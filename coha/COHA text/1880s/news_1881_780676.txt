txt The trains and boats from this City to Albany yesterday carried many Republican politicians , but few men of note were among them . The matter having been at length settled by authority that ex-Senators Conkling and Platt are candidates for re-election , every election district statesman in the City at once arose to the importance of the occasion , and declared it his bounden duty to go to Albany and take a hand in the fight . Therefore , a large number of these distinguished gentlemen deprived their constituents of their company , and started for the battle-ground . Chauncy M. Depew , who , it is well known , has a strong desire to represent New-York in the United States Senate , was in a happy frame of mind when he boarded the train bound for Albany . He had been announced to speak at the meeting in Chickering Hall last evening , and was expected to uphold and glorify the Administration of President Garfield in his usually happy manner , but it seems that he thought he would be of more service if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when asked whether he was a candidate in opposition to either ex Senators Conkling or Platt , closed his left eyelid as though about to say " I should smile , " and replied that he really did not know ; perhaps he might be . A. D. Barbour , " Ed " Phelps , and " Jimmy " Davies exchanged knowing winks as they encountered each other in the Grand Central Depot . Justice Jacob Patterson , Jr. , said that he was merely going to see his old friend Gov . Cornell . Senators Eidman and Strahan cornportal themselves with Senatorial dignity , and waved a welcome to Senator Astor when that gentleman arrived at the depot in his carriage . Assemblyman Everett , of Putnam County , was cheerful and outspoken in his defense of President Garfield , and in his opposition to Senators Conkling and Platt he was especially emphatic , seeming not to have any fear of ex-Assemblyman Hamilton Fish , Jr. , who loomed up before him frequently . Mr. Fish took occasion a few days ago to rebuke Mr. Everett for announcing himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Fish and Mr. Everett started ou the same train , but were not engaged in conversation prior to the start . Among others who went to Albany were ex-Deputy Collector Lydecker , Police Justice Solon B. Smith , John J. O'Brien , Robert G. McCord , Senators Wendover and Fowler , Assemblymen Murtha , Brodsky , Trimble , Hamilton , Brehm , and Waring , Controller Wadsworth , and Congressman J. Hyatt Smith . On the 6 P. M. train ex-Sheriff Albert Daggett , of Brooklyn , took a large delegation of half-breeds , among them James McDermott , Jndge Mayhew , R. B. Sedgwick , Col. Stegman , M. J. Dady , Auditor Beggs , M. ' Waldron , and District Attorney Isaac I. Catlin . The Stalwarts and half-breeds were about equally divided in numbers , and were equally hopeful of success m Albany . One of the Stalwarts said , in the hearing of some of the halfbreeds , " I was talking to Vice-President Arthur last evening , and he said that without doubt ' we will return Conkling and Platt to the Senate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. We or Gan . Arthur is not biz enough even yet to accomplish such a feat . " As there was bound to be a wrangle that would accomplish nothing good , the inevitable peace-maker stepped in with the remark that it would be just as well for the politicians who bad tickets for Albany in their pockets to remain at home and attend to their legitimate business , if they had any , instead of going to the State capital for the purpose of creating confusion . " For , " said the peace-maker , " it 's an old saying , but everlastingly true , notwithstanding , that rats always lave a sinking ship . ' What has Conk-ling to give in the way of national patronage if he is re-elected ? Absolutely nothing . The members of the Legislature understand this , and I 'm a bigger fool than I think I am if they elect him through sentiment . There 's little sentiment in politics any way , and the imperious Roscoe will find , I think , that he has no path of roses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States Senate . " At this the half-breeds cheered and seemed to gain courage . One of the Stalwarts said to the reporter " Wait until Conkling himself confronts those members of the Legisla-ture who have seceded from him or who are wavering , and you 'll hear them on their knees asking his forgiveness . Let him walk through the corridors and the parlors of the Delevan House , and the knees of the waiters will smite each other and their faces will grow deadly pale . In either branch of the Legislature he would meet with an ovation , and do n't you forget it . " " Good for you , " shouted a halfbreed , " that 's what Conkling might have done a short time ago , but that time has passed . No more smiting of knees , , growing deadly pale , or being lashed by him . Like talk was heard everywhere in the waiting-room of the depot previous to the departure of the Albany trains .                 @ @ @ @
