txt Overanxious partisans of Mr. Randall are rushing into Print to give the impression that the fight about to be made for the amendment of the House rules is strictly a personal attack upon the part of the Morrison " free traders " leagued with the subsidy grabbers , the claim hunters , the " pork " stealers of all kinds , and the corrupt elements in both the Republican and the Democratic Parties . . If ' Mr. Morrison favors a revision of the rules it will not be because he desires an opportunity to plunder the Treasury . Mr. Reed , of Maine , Mr. John D. Long , of Massachusetts . Mr. Warner of Ohio , Mr. Mills of Texas , and other men of sound reputation can not be charged with improper motives in favoring a change that will permit the consideration of general legislation detached from appropriation bills . Mr. Hiscock , it appears , favors a change of the rules , and no one who knows the pleasant relations existing between him and Mr. Randall , particularly in their treatment of tariff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostility to Mr. Randall . *** The forecast of the position to be taken by members of the Forty-ninth Congress on the silver question , telegraphed to-day from Louisville , is not regarded as likely to prove true after Congress has met and received the President 's message and the report of Secretary Manning . It is becoming understood that the President and the Secretary are not likely to occupy different grouni from that taken by Mr. Cleveland last Spring , and that he will appeal reasonably to the two houses to support his views and try them in practice . As to the effort to change the rules the Star says to-night that " it will be pressed by the tariff reformers , and will be opposed by Mr. Randall and his supporters as a design to clear the way for tariff legislation . About the same features are expected to be presented in this contest as in the tariff fight in the last Congress . Mr. Randall will oppose all attempts to change the present status or the Appropriations Committee , and it is expected will have the assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the former fight . The proposition to distribute the appropriation bills will provably be presented to the caucus that meets to nominate a Speaker , and an effort will be made to bind the party to support it . It is believed that should the motion be carried in the caucus Mr. Randall and his followers would withdraw and follow the same course they did in relation to the Seerrisen bill . It is probable , however , that there will not be enough advocates of the distribution plan to carry it through the House , and the antiRandall men will have to be satisfied with such restrictions as their opponents can place upon too committee by requiring the bills to be reported early and prohibiting any legislation in them . " The attention of the Treasury Department has been directed , by correspondence , to a case of alleged unjust discrimination in appraisement which has occurred in la ew-York , and for which relief is asked by the person who has suffered from the action of the merchant appraiser , against whom unfair motive 's are alleged . Mr. L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invoice or glassware at an ad valorem rate of 6 florins . He asked for a reappraisement , which was ordered , and upon the reappraisement , Mr. J. M. Young being the merchant appraiser , the advance of 100 Per cent . was sustained . To this advance , which the importer regards as extraordinary , objection Is made and relief is asked from the Secretary of the Treasury . In a letter dated Nov. 7 Mr. Lehmann refers to the report that the Secretary has called upon the Collector andirinfrfilatfres for information , and which the importer understands will simply recite the facts of the importation , the advance , and the action of the reappraisement sustaining the advance . Mr. Lehmann offers to prove before an investigating committee some interesting facts . He offers to prove that his London house has purchased goods of the same kind imported , at the price invoice a for a period of two years , and that at least two importers in New-York bought similar goods at similar prices , and that their goods were passed us invoiced , although they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he promises to prove that Mr. J. Young , the merchant appraiser , who sustained the advance of 100 per cent. , bought some of the same goods from the house of which Mr. Lehmann obtained nis at the same price , and that his goods were passed as correct . Mr. Young , it is offered to prove , bt , ught his goods in May and received them in Aueust , and that , knowing the market value , disregarded his official oath and advanced Mr. Lehmann 's goods from 3 florins to 6 florins . Mr. Lehmann asserts that the examiner advanced the value of his goods improperly , thus injuring him in his business , or that , through ignorance of values , lent himself to an unscrupulous competitor . The attention of Mr. , the appraiser , was directed to tile documents supporting this statement , but Mr. Lehmann says that he declined to take any steps other than to call upon the assistant appraiser for a report . Tee assistant appraiser claims that the value of the woods dropped 60 or 70 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the injured merchant offered to disprove by the values to-day , which are said to De the same as they have been for a year past . He calls for a sweeping investigation of the case . Assistant Secretary Fairchild says that attention will be given to the matter , and that information about it has already been asked for from New-York. *** Among the well known Republicans who continue to hold office iu New-York State under a Democratic Administration there are several Internal Revenue Collectors and Postmasters ? Collector James Armstrong at Utica , Collector Pierce at Rochester , and Postmaster " Gil " Robeasel ( at Troy being among the number . Collector Smart , at Troy , was yesterday dropped for offensive partisanship . but it is not easy to ascertain whether his offense consists in being a Democrat in New-York or an alle ? ed Republican in the county of Rensselaer . Postmaster Robertson , albeit one of the most stalwart of Coukling men , has come in for a number of flings at Democratic hands as being a man who is willing to be regarded as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can retain his position . Collector Armstrong , another stalwart and the man who received the celebrated dispatch at Albany from Mr. Conkling addressed to the " Spartan band , " which was " borne down by forbidden and abhorrent forces , " was one of the stoutest Cleveland men about Utica last Fall and has been held up as one of those caretakers who can carry water on both shoulders . At Rochester the Collector is represented as being a very firm Republican and desirous to hold ( in to the fat office at the same time . it is not yet settled that all or these gentlemen worked for Hill for Governor , as Collector Smart is represented to have done , but there are intimations that a Democratic Ko-Ko will soon bo found to apply the suiekersnee to their official necks . *** Commissioner of Customs McCalmont , in his report to the Secretary of the Treasury , allows Deputy H. A. Lockwood , who has long served in the bureau , to make a number of suggestions for the improvement of the customs service , deferring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He suggests a change in the law to prevent the payment of interest ou duties refunded . It is claimed that suits for refunds are , if not purposely delayed , not actively pressed , because of the advantage arising from the recovery of interest , and it may be Possible that this delay also leads to many liquidations of judgment to the prejudice of the Government . Another change suggested is the assignment of all subordinate officers of the customs , other than those appointed by the President , into one class , to be styled customs officers , with power to the Collector or chief customs officers to detail any customs officer under him to any duty in his district . This , it is believed , would enable a Collector to use his force more efficiently , do away with many questions now coming before the Collector as to the employment of one officer to perform the duties of another , and make the chief officer responsible for the efficiency of his force . A modification of the law , so as to give the Secretary of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers , would simplify the question and not be against the policy of the law . A third change recommended is a fixed amount of compensation Tor the principal customs officers , now paid in five ways : By salary ; by salary and fees : by salary , fees , ano , commissions ; by fees and commissions , and by foes only . One objection to payment in fees is the tendency to the exaction of illegal fees . Another is that the money taken for fees does not appear in the receipts and expenditures of the Treasury , except in the emolument statement . The expenses of collecting the revenue are of necessity more , by the amount of fees retained for commissions , than is shown by the appropriation ledger . Another serious objection is that payment by commissions causes delay in the settlement of accounts . Section 305 of the Revised Statutes does not allow credit to be given a person depositing money in the Trees ury until a covering warrant shall have beet issued . The compensation of many Collector : being paid by commissions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts must be ad. justed before the expense and emolument TIC counts can be taken up .
