C.  --  Chairs up L.  --  Yellow-covered novels and sensation papers on tables . MUGGS discovered in easy-chair , reading a novel . Muggs . Goodness , gracious ! How exciting , to be sure ! ( Reads ) " And DeRoville rushed madly into the cabin of the ' Silver-crested Dolphin , ' and wildly shrieked for Leonora . ' Leonora ! ' he hoarsely cried , while his voice was echoed by a mocking laugh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pirate of the Gory Spear ! ' " ( Closes book . ) What a perfectly exciting scene ! Enter LAURA BUNG , hastily , L. 2 E. , with her veil down . Laura . Ah ! he here ! Discovered ! ( X in front , and exits R. 3 E. , dropping handkerchief . ) Mug . Muggs Bless me ! what was that ? Exactly like Marianna , in " The Blood-drinker of the Black Mountains . " What if she should be the Spirit of the Fen ? Enter MAJOR BUNG , hastily , L. 2 E.  --  He looks about the room cautiously ; peeps under the tables ; gazes up the chimney , and out on the balcony . Major . Humph ! not here . Let her tremble ! Exit angrily , L. 2 E. Mug . Muggs Why , what can be the matter ? In my own house , too ! I wonder if that was the " Brigand of the Pyrenees , " in disguise . Enter LIEUTENANT BUNG , wildly , L. 2 E.  --  He rushes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nods his head , and looks under tables and chairs . Lieutenant . Not here ! Ah ! woe to her , when I find her ! ( X in front , and exits , passionately , L. 2 E. ) Mug . Muggs Eh ! what can it mean ? There 's something perfectly horrible at the bottom of it all ! ( Sees handkerchief . ) What have we here ? a handkerchief ! ( Picks it up . ) I wonder if that young woman is in love with me , and is pursued by two relentless rivals who are brigands . ( Reads name on handkerchief ) " Laura Bung . " ( Puts it in pocket . ) A very curious name . What an adventure ! It 's very like the meeting of Leon de Valdez , in the mountains , with Cora Mendoza . The only difference is that she dropped a handkerchief here , while in the novel Cora drops off the mountain into an abyss . The resemblance struck me at once . Enter ARTHUR WYNDHAM , D. L. 2 E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ah , uncle , how are you this morning ? Busy again at your books , I see . ( Aside , moving towards window ) Where can Laura be . Mug . Muggs Yes , my dear boy ; but what ails you ? Why are you so fidgety ? Ar . Arthur Oh , nothing . ( Looks out uneasily . ) It 's only your fancy . Mug . Muggs Oh ! ( Aside ) Hang me if I do n't think he has gone crazy too . Why , Arthur  --  Ar . Arthur Do n't bother  --  that is  --  excuse me  --  Mug . Muggs Ah ! I see . A tiff again with Fanny . Make it up , my boy . You know , when Alphonso quarrels with Miriam , in " The Blind Spectre of the Gulf , " he goes on his knees , and holding a superbly-chased dagger to his throat , swears to have her forgiveness , or to let out his life 's blood on the spot . Ar . Arthur Thank you , uncle . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made up my tiff with Fanny , I assure you . ( Looks out again uneasily . ) Mug . Muggs I am glad of that ; for you must know , my dear boy , that it is my fondest wish that you and Fanny should be united before I die . Ar . Arthur ( impatiently ) . Yes , yes . ( Aside ) Why does Laura delay ? Mug . Muggs I do certainly wish that you had some bitter and relentless enemy who was your rival . How delightful to be continually tracked by a black-looking scoundrel who seeks to glut his hatred by shedding your warm and crimson blood . Ar . Arthur Perfectly delightful ! ( Looking out ) Ah ! what do I see ? There 's Laura 's bonnet , as sure as fate ! Exit , in great haste , over balcony , C. Mug . Muggs Hallo ! now he 's gone . He 'll break his neck . What , in mercy 's name , has come over everybody this morning ? My head is absolutely turning around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means . ( Rings bell . ) Posher ! Hallo ! Posher ! ( Rings . ) Enter POSHER , R. 1 E. Posher . Ring , sir ? Mug . Muggs Look here , Posher , is my room grown to be a public thoroughfare , that people bounce in and out of it at random ? Why do n't you keep the front door shut , or announce people before you allow them to enter my room ? Posh . Posher Why , how can I , sir ? You know that you have only rented the first floor , and the door must be left open for the other tenants . Mug . Muggs Hang the first floor ! Give warning for me , Posher . I 'll move to-morrow . Posh . Posher ( going ) . All right , sir . Mug . Muggs No ; on second thoughts , I 'll stay . Posh . Posher Very well , sir . Anything else ? Mug . Muggs Anything else , you brute ! There 's language . How do you ever expect to resemble Alonzo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take more care of yourself ? Posh . Posher I do my best , I 'm sure . Mug . Muggs No you do n't . Here , for novelty 's sake , I have elevated you into the proud position of Arthur 's rival . I want you to make him uncomfortable . Do you look as if you could make anybody uncomfortable ? Have I not told you the story of Philip the Serf often enough ? Did I not tell you the slave fell in love with his master 's daughter , and went about sighing and fretting , until he died of grief ? Posh . Posher But I do n't want to die of grief . Mug . Muggs You do n't want to ? You must . Obey me , and begin to die of grief at once , sir , or I give you warning . Enter LAURA , distractedly , R. 3 E. Lau . Laura ( C. , to POSHER ) . Hush ! Not a word ! Posh ( R. , confused ) . Oh ! not a word . Lau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your life ! Mug . Muggs Again ? Who are you ? Lau . Laura ( kneeling to POSHER ) . Conceal me , I implore you ! Posh . Posher ( confounded ) . Of course . Lau . Laura ( to MUGGS ) . Oh , sir ! let me not kneel in vain to you . I am pursued ! Mug . Muggs Why ? By whom ? ( Aside , rubbing his hands ) Here is a real romance . Lau . Laura By them ! Mug . Muggs As I have n't the most remote conception of them , with regard to time , place , degree or manner , you will probably have no objections to explain your meaning . Lau . Laura Hush ! ( Listens . ) I can not ! They are here . Your ( turning from one to the other ) life is in danger . Conceal and protect me to the last drop of your blood . Secresy ! No more ! Hush ! Exit , distractedly , R. 3 E. Mug . Muggs I must be asleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to himself in reality . ( Rubbing his hands ) It 's very exciting , though . Posh . Posher Is n't it ? Especially as she said your life 's in danger . Mug . Muggs No sir ; she said your life 's in danger . Posh . Posher Well , all that I know is , somebody 's life 's in danger . Mug . Muggs Why , you cold-blooded villain ! Can you go on talking in that calm and collected manner , when we are liable at any moment to have this carpet ensanguined with our blood ? Enter MAJOR , savagely , L. 2 E. Maj. Major ( L. , fiercely to MUGGS ) . Sir ! Mug . Muggs ( C. ) I beg pardon . Meaning me ? Posh . Posher ( R. ) Or me ? Maj. Major ( to POSHER ) . Be quiet , poodle ! Mug . Muggs Posher , mind what the gentleman says . Maj. Major My name is Bung ! Mug . Muggs ( confidentially to POSHER ) . Bung ? Posh . Posher ( mysteriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevarication . Do you know this glove ? ( Holds up kid glove . ) Mug . Muggs I give you my word of honor that I never spoke to it in the whole course of my life . Maj. Major Prevaricator ! ' t is false . I saw it enter this house a few moments ago . ( Brings down three chairs C. ) Mug . Muggs Might I venture to suggest that this room does not by any means constitute the whole house ? Maj. Major ( C. ) Sit down ! ( Seizes MUGGS by the collar , throws him around , and forces him into chair , R. C.  --  POSHER the same , L. C.  --  ( Sits C. ) Listen to me . Do you see this knife ? ( Draws huge bowie-knife , and shows it to POSHER . ) Posh . Posher ( L. ) Man of power , I do ! ( Nervously pushes back MAJOR 'S arm , which is flourishing knife in his face . ) Maj. Major Do you see this revolver ? ( Draws revolver , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. ) Blood-thirsty but valiant creature , I do . ( Pushes his arm nervously away . ) Look out ; it may be loaded . Maj. Major ( C. , fiercely ) . If I thought that either of you in any wise interposed between me and my intentions , I 'd blow your brains out with this ( brandishes knife ) , and pierce your hearts with this . ( Points pistol . ) Posh . Posher But what is the matter ? Maj. Major Be quiet , raven ! Mug . Muggs Posher , mind what the gentleman says . Maj. Major Beware ! ( Kicks POSHER . ) Tremble ! ( Pulls MUGGS ' nose ) . I repeat it  --  beware and tremble ! ( Looks about mysteriously . ) Ha ! ( looks out D. L. 2 E. ) she is there ! Exit L. 2 E. Mug . Muggs Gracious me ! what a fire-eater ! How adventures are thronging on me this morning ! ( Rubs his nose . ) Posh . Posher Master , what heavy boots he wears ! ( Rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman out , and ask her what it means . ( Going R. 3 E. ) Enter LIEUTENANT , through window , C. Lieut . Lieutenant ( C. ) Ha ! ( Savagely ) Come here ! Mug . Muggs ( R. ) What , more ? This is terrible ! Lieut . Lieutenant My name is Bung ? Mug . Muggs Bung ? Lieut . Lieutenant ( proudly ) . Bung ! Posh . Posher ( L. ) Bung ? Lieut . Lieutenant ( irascibly ) . Bung ! Mug . and Posh . ( solemnly ) . Another Bung ! Lieut . Lieutenant Sit down ! ( Forces MUGGS into chair , L. C. ) Donkey , be seated ! ( Forces POSHER into chair , R. C. ) Be quiet , both of you , and listen to me ! ( Sits C. ) Mug . Muggs ( rising indignantly ) . But , sir ! Lieut . Lieutenant Sit down ! ( Pulls him down by coat-tail . ) Posh . Posher ( rising ) . But , mister  --  Lieut . Lieutenant Sit down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir !  --  ( Rises . ) Mug . and Posh . Sit down ! ( Each catch a coat-tail , and pull him down . ) Lieut . Lieutenant ( C. ) Now listen ! Mug . Muggs ( L. ) Proceed , explosive Bung . Lieut . Lieutenant You must know I have a cousin . Mug . Muggs Is it possible ? Posh . Posher ( R. ) You must be joking ! Lieut . Lieutenant Silence , pig-face ! That cousin 's name is Laura Bung ! Mug . Muggs Laura Bung ! Good gracious ! Lieut . Lieutenant Sir , she wo n't marry me ! Mug . Muggs Indeed ! She has no taste . Lieut . Lieutenant She escaped from the custody of her father and myself , this morning ; and I have every reason to believe she is in this house . Beware how you trifle with me , for I am desperate . I do not wish to intimidate you , but if I find her here your death shall be the least of my revenges ! Enter LAURA , unseen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my word that under those circumstances I would n't trifle with you for the world . Lau . Laura ( aside ) . My hateful cousin here . ( Steals X , and exits L. 2 E. , unseen . ) Lieut . Lieutenant Sir , if I thought you dared to trifle with me , your ensanguined stream of life should flow over the hall oil-cloth like water ! Mug . Muggs ( aside . ) Just like Ulrico , in " The Penitent Ghost of the Hartz Mountains . " ( Wipes forehead with LAURA 'S handkerchief . ) Lieut . Lieu tenant Ha ! What do I see ? ( Seizes it , and reads name ) " Laura Bung . " Reptile , prepare to die ! Mug . Muggs The Bungs have put a stopper on me ! Posh . Posher Oh , do n't , sir ; do n't ! ( Kneels . ) Lieut . Lieut enant Where is she ? Speak , at once ! Mug . Muggs ( aside , dramatically ) . Shall I act the recreant 's part ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I know not ! ( Aside ) Thus would Alphonso the Crusader have acted . Lieut . Lieutenant Then prepare to meet your fate ! ( Takes out penknife ) . Posh . Posher Oh do n't ! I know all about it , Mr. Bung . Here , this way . Here she is . Follow me . Exit D. R. 3 E. Lieut . Lieutenant ' T is well ! You can wait . Exit D. R. 3 E. Mug . Muggs The ignoble traitor Posher ! If he find her he will kill us all , just as Mordeccai the Hindoo slaughters all the hospital patients , in the " Massacre of Palmyra . " Lieut . Lieutenant ( without ) . Ah ! Wretch ! Posh . Posher ( without ) . It 's a mistake . She has fled ! Re-enter LIEUTENANT , dragging in POSHER , D. R. 3 E. Lieut . Lieutenant Viper ! Do you play with me . ( Using POSHER a la Damon . ) Posh . Posher No ; it seems as though I were the toy . Lieut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. ) She is not there ! Mug . Muggs What ! gone ! Lieut . Lieutenant Yes , gone ! I 'll have revenge ! ( Pulls POSHER 'S nose , and throws him X R. ) Yes , deadly revenge ! ( Kicks MUGGS . ) Beware ! ( Heavy tramp without . ) Ha ! a light step on the stairs . ' T is hers ! Exit D. L. 2 E. Mug . Muggs Thank Heaven , she is gone ! Re-enter LIEUTENANT , D. L. 2 E. Lieut . Lieutenant ( to POSHER ) . Wretch and menial , follow me ! ( X , seizes him by the collar , and drags him off D. L. 2 E. ) Mug . Muggs What am I coming to ? Talk of your novels ! This beats them all ;  --  high pressure , into the bargain . Where will it end ? Enter FANNY , D. L. 2 E. , as though from shopping . Fanny . Oh , Pa ! I 'm so agitated ! Do n't speak to me now . ( X R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventure ! Do n't say anything to me . Exit , hastily , R. 1 E. Mug . Muggs What , more of it ! The whole world seems fit for a lunatic asylum ; and I believe I am the asylumest of the lot . Enter GUY RATTLE , running , D. L. 2 E. Guy . Oh , I beg pardon , sir . I did n't mean to intrude . ( Looks mysteriously about . ) Mug . Muggs Oh ! I give it up . I suppose this is another blood-thirsty Bung . Who are you , sir ? What do you here ? Guy . ( L. ) I think I shall stagger you a little , when I inform you that I am running after a nose . Mug . Muggs ( R. ) Running after a nose ! Have you lost one , may I inquire , sir ? Guy . Yes ; lost it , I fear , forever ! Mug . Muggs You have probably lost somebody else 's , sir ; as you seem to be all right in that particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You mistake me , most reverend and approved good master . Listen . I have fallen desperately in love with a nose . Mug . Muggs With a nose ? Guy . With a nose ! But I have n't got time to tell you any more . I 'm sure I saw it enter this house . It must have gone up stairs . Good day . Exit , hastily , D. L. 2 E. Mug . Muggs This will never do . I do n't mind having novels in real life ; but I do most unequivocally object to having " to be continued " at the end of every chapter , and being deprived of my denouement on every occasion . Posher ! Here , Posher ! Where is Posher ? ( Rings bell . ) I wonder if that monster of a lieutenant has killed him . How delightful to have a murder in the family ! Posher ! I 'll pack up , and go into the country at once . It 's all infernal nonsense to be annoyed in this way . Re-enter GUY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Excuse me , sir . It 's of no use . I 've lost it again . Mug . Muggs ( R. ) What , your nose ? Guy . Yes sir . Oh , that nose ! Mug . Muggs Snub , may be ? Guy . Oh , sir ! how can you harrow my feelings so ? Mug . Muggs Perhaps bottle ? Guy . A bottle-nose ! No sir !  --  not a snub , bottle , pug , Roman , Grecian , Jewish , Ethiopian , Hottentot , Otahaitan , Chinese , bottle or broken ; but the concentrated quintessence of all these combined . I saw it a week ago , at the yacht-race , and it has haunted me ever since . I have gone to sleep with that nose haunting my mind to such an excess that I have waked up with an indistinct idea as to whether my own nose was an anchor or an umbrella . Mug . Muggs Is it possible ? It does n't look much like either ; though , now I gaze again , it does look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sir , I have walked the streets unceasingly , in the hope of meeting with that nose . To-day I saw it going into a dry-goods store . Mug . Muggs That nose ? Guy . No , its owner . I followed it , and never lost sight of it until I traced it into this very house . Mug . Muggs Its owner , again , of course . Guy . No ; that nose . I entered , and followed . It disappeared . Darting forward , fearful of losing it , I found myself suddenly in this apartment ; for introducing myself into which so abruptly I have returned to offer my apologies . Mug . Muggs ( R. ) Never mind apologies , sir . So you are hunting after a nose , are you ? Did you ever read the romance of " Black Denville 's Fate " ? Guy ( L. ) Ca n't say I have . Mug . Muggs More 's the pity . There is an incident in it very similar to yours ; the only difference being , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has half a dozen Spanish bloodhounds running after him . The similarity struck me at once . Guy . Yes ; quite remarkable . But , sir , I want that nose . Mug . Muggs I 'm sorry , sir ; but really we have n't any to spare , here . ( GUY goes up . ) Enter ARTHUR , dejectedly , D. L. 2 E. Ar . Arthur It was not Laura , after all . Mug . Muggs ( R. ) Returned again , Arthur ? What took you through that window , like a mad bull after an old apple-woman ? Ar . Arthur ( L. ) Nothing , sir ;  --  a sudden spasm . Guy ( coming down C. , sees ARTHUR ) . What do I see ? Arthur ! my college chum ? ( Offers hand . ) Ar . Arthur What , Rattle ! ( They shake hands . ) My dear fellow , how are you ? Mug . Muggs ( aside ) . How romantic ! Exactly like the meeting of Fritz and Sompernackel , in " The Glen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GUY ) . What has brought you here ? To what am I indebted for this meeting , after so long an estrangement ? Guy . I have been running after a nose . ( Goes up L. with ARTHUR . ) Mug . Muggs ( aside ) . A friend of Arthur 's . I wonder if he would fall in love with Fanny . It would be a splendid chance for Arthur to get a rival . ( Aloud ) Arthur , entertain your friend until I come back . ( Aside ) I will bring her here , and perhaps it may turn out , after all , just like " The Fatal Hope of the House of Gordon . " ( Aloud ) I 'll return speedily . Exit R. 1 E. Ar . Arthur ( down R. ) Well , Guy , I 'm really very glad to see you . But this story about the nose : is it not a piece of humbug ? Guy ( L. ) Not at all , my boy . But what are you doing with yourself ? Ar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am perfectly miserable . My uncle has set his heart upon my marrying my cousin Fanny , whom I can not love . The fact is , Guy , that , unknown to him , I am already married . Guy . You do n't say so ! I hope you have been doing nothing rash . Ar . Arthur No ; I have married my lovely Laura ;  --  Laura Bung . Guy . Bung ? Ar . Arthur Bung ! She is one of the best little creatures in the world . It was the simplest thing imaginable . We understood each other that we loved ; I proposed ; she accepted . We met by stealth ; for she has a most blood-thirsty father , who wanted to marry her to his blood-thirstier nephew . I proposed an elopement  --  Guy . She accepted , of course . Ar . Arthur No ; she refused . I then proposed a clandestine marriage . Guy . She refused that . Ar . Arthur No ; she accepted . We were married yesterday , and I have not seen her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when we were to have gone on our knees , and confessed all to my uncle , and to have claimed his protection and forgiveness . I have not been able to find Laura , and am consequently in despair . I am afraid he will never forgive me ! Guy . Nonsense ! It 's all easy enough . What do you want to do ? Ar . Arthur I scarcely know . My uncle is full of romance , and is determined to wed me to Fanny , after the most approved yellow-covered style . Guy . You want time to find your Laura , do n't you ? Ar . Arthur Yes . Now , if you would only pretend to be my rival for the affections of Fanny , you might gain me what time I need , and put the old man in so good a humor that I could get whatever I wanted in the way of forgiveness . Guy . I 'll tell you what I 'll do . I 'll pretend that your Fanny is my nose . But does she not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Besides , she was desperately smitten with some young fellow at the yacht-race , last week , and her head is full of him . Guy . At the yacht-race ? Who was he ? Ar . Arthur Some well-dressed puppy or other , I suppose . Guy . Oh ! Well , then , for the present your Fanny is to be my nose . Ar . Arthur Thanks , my friend Enter MUGGS , R. 1 E. , pulling in FANNY . Mug . Muggs Come along , Fanny . It 's only a friend of your cousin 's . What folly ! Guy ( L. , starting tragically ) Merciful powers ! it 's my nose ! Mug . Muggs Eh ! what ! My daughter your nose ? Fan . Fanny ( R. , aside ) . My young gentleman of the yacht-race ! Ar . Arthur ( L. ) Go it , Guy . Capital ! Guy ( X R. , and pushing MUGGS aside ) . Get out of the way , old fellow . Oh , most lovely and adorable being ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swinging GUY round L. ) Here , this will never do ! What do you mean , sir , by this conduct ? Ar . Arthur ( L. , aside ) . Capital ! capital ! Mug . Muggs ( R. C. , to GUY ) . Away , sir ! Guy ( L. C. ) What ! and leave my nose , after all the trouble I have had to find it ? Never ! Fan . Fanny ( R. , mock-heroically ) . Oh , pa ! do n't send him away ! Mug . Muggs Child , go to your room again ; or else  --  or else  --  a father 's curse shall mantle o'er  --  o'er  --  thy blushing steps ! ( Aside ) This is splendid ! It 's a drama in real life . Fan . Fanny But , pa ! ( Snivels ) . Mug . Muggs Go to your room , miss !  --  weep , and let down your back hair , like Clara of Segovia , in the " Fatal Kiss of Alonzo . " Go , miss ! No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  GUY blows kisses after her , and comes down R. ) Ar . Arthur ( L. ) How capitally you do it , Guy ! Guy ( R. ) Do it be hanged ! That 's my nose ! Mug . Muggs ( C. , aside ) . This is glorious ! ( To GUY ) Now , sir , what have you to say for yourself ? ( Folds arms sternly . ) Guy . Nothing sir , save that yonder being is the nose of my adoration ; and I will have her if I have to ( advancing to MUGGS fiercely ) fight the whole family in order to get her ! Mug . Muggs ( retreating behind ARTHUR , L. ) Arthur , my boy , why the deuce do n't you say something to him ? Think of Adalbert of Bavaria , in " The Silver Goblet of the Magic Grotto . " Ar . Arthur But , uncle  --  Guy . Sir , if you object to me as an unknown adventurer , I will depart  --  Mug . Muggs Ah !  --  Guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Guy . With any amount of satisfaction on that score . In your safe keeping I leave that nose . See that the trust be not broken !  --  no  --  you know what I mean . I will return speedily . Exit L. 2 E. Mug . Muggs ( L. ) This is a pretty piece of business . And you , sir ! why did you stand there as mum as a mackerel with the measles ? Do n't you know I have set my heart on your marriage with your cousin ? Ar . Arthur ( R. C. ) I thought , sir , you wanted me to have a rival . Mug . Muggs So I did ; but I did n't want you to give her up to him willingly . How did Sir Mungo , in the " Murdered Monkey "  --  Ar . Arthur ( R. ) Yes , I know all about Sir Mungo . ( Aside ) I must tell him all , I find . ( Aloud ) Sir ! I have a weighty secret to impart to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight ) . A secret ! You , Arthur ? Ar . Arthur Yes sir . ( Aside ) I might as well get over it at once . Where can Laura be ? ( Aloud ) Be seated , sir . ( They sit . ) You must know , sir  --  Mug . Muggs ( greedily ) . Yes ! yes ! I am ready . ( Listens . ) Ar . Arthur Oh , I ca n't do it ! It is impossible ! ( Rushes off R. 1 E. ) Mug . Muggs Well ! that is what I may safely call a curious proceeding . What the deuce did the boy mean by going off like an angry rocket ? This has been a precious day . I hope it wo n't end in blood . Enter POSHER , L. 2 E. , covered with mud . Posh . Posher Oh , sir ! what a time I 've had of it ! Mug . Muggs More of it ! Hang it ! what do you all mean by it ? Do you want to drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Posher Do give me time to breathe , sir . ( Splashes mud on MUGGS . ) Such a run as I 've had for it ! Sir , that cannibal , after dragging me away from this place , lugged me down stairs , and up one street , and down another , till I escaped him , by doubling him up around a lamp-post . Mug . Muggs Dear me ! what a fearful piece of villainy ! Posh . Posher Fearing he might pursue me , I darted down the street , with all the dogs in town yelping after me , and the old apple-women cursing me for upsetting their stands . I have been dodging up one street and down anothor , to baffle my captor ; until at last I conceived the brilliant idea of returning home ; and here I am . I hope I am in time , sir . Mug . Muggs For what , Posher ? Posh . Posher To make love to Miss Fanny . Mug . Muggs I do n't want you for that any more , Posher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rascals ! I 'll go for my pistols , in case the scoundrels return again . I 'll let them know they ca n't annoy me with impunity . Exit R. 1 E. Posh . Posher I do n't suppose I can improve my time better than by taking a comfortable wash under the hydrant . Enter LAURA , L. 2 E. Lau . Laura At last ! Oh , noble being ! for mercy 's sake conceal me somewhere , and inform Mr. Wyndham that I am here ! Posh . Posher Inform him ? Oh yes . But I do n't happen to know who you are . Lau . Laura Never mind ! Inform him ! Posh . Posher Oh yes ; of course . Lau . Laura Alas ! they come again . They have discovered me . Hush ! Betray me not ! Exit D. R. 3 E. Posh . Posher Oh , I wo n't betray you , seeing I do n't know who you are . What does she want with Arthur , I wonder . Enter MAJOR , D. L. 2 E. Maj. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me !  --  Silence !  --  Speak ! Ah ! you tremble ! Posh . Posher The evil-minded major again ? Help ! Maj. Major Be quiet , fool ! Not a word ! Dare not to betray my presence here ! ( Shows pistol . ) You understand . I am watching you ! Dare not to move ! Exit on balcony , C. Posh . Posher This is pleasant . I wonder if the other one is at hand . Enter LIEUTENANT , D. L. 2 E. Lieut . Lieutenant Ha ! Scoundrel ! You here again ? Speak !  --  Not a word ! Is she here ? Hush ! No more ! I 'll watch . Woe to you , if you have deceived me ! Dare not to move , on your life ! ( Shows pistol , and X and conceals himself under table , R. ) Posh . Posher ( trembling , but not daring to move ) . This is a pretty situation ;  --  a novel situation , as master would call it . Why do n't master come back with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ar . Arthur ( X L. ) Now to get out , and look after my dear Laura . Posh . Posher Arthur ! I inform you . She told me to . Ar .
