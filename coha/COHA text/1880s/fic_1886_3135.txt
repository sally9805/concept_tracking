" The Salt of the Earth . " The salt of the earth -- what a meaningful phrase From the lips of the Saviour , and one that conveys A sense of the need of a substance saline This pestilent sphere to refresh and refine , And a healthful and happy condition secure By making it pure as the ocean is pure . In all the nomenclature known to the race , In all appellations of people or place , Was ever a name so befitting , so true Of those who are seeking the wrong to undo , With naught of the Pharisee 's arrogant air Their badge of discipleship humbly who wear ? Do beings , forsooth , fashioned out of the mold , So secretly , strangely , those elements hold That may be developed in goodness and grace To shine in demeanor , in form and in face Till they , by renewal of heavenly birth , Shall merit their title -- the salt of the earth ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , With nausea , scurvy , or canker maybe , ' T is never in language to overexalt The potent preservative virtue of salt --  A crystal commodity wholesome and good , A cure for disease , and a savor for food . Ah , the beasts of the wood and the fowls of the air Know all of the need of this condiment rare , Know well where the springs and the " salt-licks " abound , Where streams salinaceous flow out of the ground ; And their cravings appease by sipping the brine With more than the relish of topers at wine . Our wants may be legion , our needs are but few , And every known ill hath its remedy true ; ' T is ours to discover and give to mankind Of hidden essentials the best that we find ; ' T is ours to eradicate error and sin , And help to make better the place we are in . If ever this world from corruption is free , And righteousness reign in the kingdom to be , Like salt in its simple and soluble way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action sublime Must never relax till the finale of time . To thousands discouraged this comforting truth Appeals like the promise of infinite youth : To know , as they labor like bees in the hive , Yet do little more than keep goodness alive --  To know that the Master accredits their worth As blessed disciples --  " the salt of the earth . " Not Gone . They are not gone whose lives in beauty so unfolding Have left their own sweet impress everywhere ; Like flowers , while we linger in beholding , Diffusing fragrance on the summer air . They are not gone , for grace and goodness can not perish , But must develop in immortal bloom ; The viewless soul , the real self we love and cherish , Shall live and flourish still beyond the tomb . They are not gone though lost to observation , And dispossessed of those dear forms of clay , Though dust and ashes speak of desolation ; The spirit-presence -- this is ours alway . Let Us Give Thanks . If we have lived another year And , counting friends by regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broken ranks , For this let us give thanks . If , since the last Thanksgiving-time , Have we been blessed with strength and health , And added to our honest wealth , Nor lost by broken banks , For this would we give thanks . If through adversity we trod , Yet with serene and smiling face , And trusted more to saving grace Than charlatans and cranks , For this let us give thanks . If we have somehow worried through The ups and downs along life 's track , And still undaunted can look back And smile at Fortune 's pranks , For this would we give thanks . If every page in our account With God and man is fairly writ , We care not who examines it , With no suspicious blanks , For this let us give thanks . Sonnet . Upon my smile let none pass compliment If it but gleam like an enchanting ray Of sunshine caught from some sweet summer day , In atmosphere of rose and jasmine scent And breath of honeysuckles redolent , When , with the birds that sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sway , And all the world with joy is eloquent . But in that day of gloom when skies severe Portend the tempest gathering overhead , If by my face some token shall appear Inspiring hope , dispelling darksome dread , Oh , be the rapture mine that it be said , " Her smile is like the rainbow , full of cheer . " A Rainy Day . Oh , what a blessed interval A rainy day may be ! No lightning flash nor tempest roar , But one incessant , steady pour Of dripping melody ; When from their sheltering retreat Go not with voluntary feet The storm-beleaguered family , Nor bird nor animal . When business takes a little lull , And gives the merchantman A chance to seek domestic scenes , To interview the magazines , Convoke his growing clan , The boys and girls almost unknown , And get acquainted with his own ; As well the household budget scan , Or write a canticle . When farmer John ransacks the barn , Hunts up the harness old --  Nigh twenty years since it was new --  Puts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing will hold Without that missing martingale That bothered Dobbin , head and tail , He , gentle equine , safe controlled But by a twist of yarn . When busy fingers may provide A savory repast To whet the languid appetite , And give to eating a delight Unknown since seasons past ; Avaunt , ill-cookery ! whose ranks Develop dull dyspeptic cranks Who , forced to diet or to fast , Ergo , have dined and died . It is a day of rummaging , The closets to explore ; To take down from the dusty shelves The books -- that never read themselves --  And turning pages o'er Discover therein safely laid The bills forgot and never paid --  Somehow that of the corner store Such dunning memories bring . It gives a chance to liquidate Epistolary debts ; To write in humble penitence Acknowledging the negligence , The sin that so besets , And cheer the hearts that hold us dear , Who 've known and loved us many a year --  Back to the days of pantalets And swinging on the gate . It gives occasion to repair Unlucky circumstance ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make amends By mending hose and pants ; The romping young ones to re-dress Without those signs of hole-y-ness That so bespeak the mendicants By every rip and tear . It is a time to gather round The old piano grand , Its dulcet harmonies unstirred Since Lucy sang so like a bird , And played with graceful hand ; Like Lucy 's voice in pathos sweet Repeating softly " Shall we meet ? " Is only in the heavenly land Such clear soprano sound . It is a time for happy chat En cercle tete-a-tete ; Discuss the doings of the day , The club , the sermon , or the play , Affairs of church and state ; Fond reminiscence to explore The pleasant episodes of yore , And so till raindrops all abate As erst on Ararat . Ah , yes , a rainy day may be A blessed interval ! A little halt for introspect , A little moment to reflect On life 's discrepancy --  Our puny stint so poorly done , The larger duties scarce begun --  And so may conscience culpable Suggest a remedy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descend That wonderful hole in the ground ?  --  That , feeling its way like a hypocrite-friend In sinuous fashion , seems never to end ; While thunder and lightning abound . Oh , who in creation would dare to go down That great subterranean hole --  The tunnel , the terror , the talk of the town , That gives to the city a mighty renown And a shaking as never before ? A serpent , a spider , its mouth at the top Where the flies are all buzzing about ; Down into its maw where the populace drop , Who never know where they are going to stop , Or whether they 'll ever get out . Why is it , with millions of acres untrod Where never the ploughshare hath been , That man must needs burrow miles under the sod , As if to get farther and farther from God , And deeper and deeper in sin ? O Dagos and diggers , who ca n't understand That the planet you 'll never get through --  Why , there is three times as much water as land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your life is worth less than a sou . Come up out of Erebus into the day , There 's plenty of room overhead ; No boring or blasting of rocks in the way , No stratum of sticky , impervious clay --  All vacuous vapor instead . Oh , give us a transit , a tube or an " el --  " , Not leagues from the surface below ; As if we were never in Heaven to dwell , As if we were all being fired to -- well , The place where we do n't want to go ! The Apple Tree . Has ever a tree from the earth upsprung Around whose body have children clung , Whose bounteous branches the birds among Have pecked the fruit , and chirped and sung --  Was ever a tree , or shall there be , So hardy , so sturdy , so good to see , So welcome a boon to the family , Like the pride of the farmer , the apple tree ? How he loves to be digging about its root , Or grafting the bud in the tender shoot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finest selected fruit . How he boasts of his Sweetings , so big for size ; His delicate Greenings -- made for pies ; His Golden Pippins that take the prize , The Astrachans tempting , that tell no lies . How he learns of the squirrel a thing or two That the wise little rodents always knew , And never forget or fail to do , Of laying up store for the winter through ; So he hollows a space in the mellow ground Where leaves for lining and straw abound , And well remembers his apple mound When a day of scarcity comes around . By many a token may we suppose That the knowledge apple no longer grows , That broke up Adam and Eve 's repose And set the fashion of fig-leaf clothes ; The story 's simple and terse and crude , But still with a morsel of truth imbued : For of trees and trees by the multitude Are some that are evil , and some that are good . The more I muse on those stories old The more philosophy they unfold Of husbands docile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , many a couple halve their fare With that mistaken and misfit air That the world and all are ready to swear To a mighty unapple-y mated pair . The apple 's an old-fashioned tree I know , All gnarled and bored by the curculio , And loves to stand in a zigzag row ; And does n't make half so much of a show As the lovely almond that blooms like a ball , And spreads out wide like a pink parasol Set on its stem by the garden-wall ; But I love the apple tree , after all . " A little more cider "  - -  sings the bard ; And who this juiciness would discard , Though holding the apple in high regard , Must be like the cider itself -- very hard ; For the spirit within it , as all must know , Is utterly harmless -- unless we go Like the fool in his folly , and overflow By drinking a couple of barrels or so . What of that apple beyond the seas , Fruit of the famed Hesperides ? But dust and ashes compared to these That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the apples of years agone : For Rambos streaked like the morning dawn , For Russets brown with their jackets on , And aromatic as cinnamon . Oh , the peach and cherry may have their place , And the pear is fine in its stately grace ; The plum belongs to a puckery race And maketh awry the mouth and face ; But I long to roam in the orchard free , The dear old orchard that used to be , And gather the beauties that dropped for me From the bending boughs of the apple tree . Two Roses . I 've a friend beyond the ocean So regardful , so sincere , And he sends me in a letter Such a pretty souvenir . It is crushed to death and withered , Out of shape and very flat , But its pure , delicious odor Is the richer for all that . ' T is a rose from Honolulu , And it bears the tropic brand , Sandwiched in this friendly missive From that far-off flower-land . It shall mingle pot-a-pourri With the scents I love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me weep . While I dream I hear the music That of happiness foretells , Like the flourishing of trumpets And the sound of marriage bells . There 's a rose upon the prairie , Chosen his by happy fate , He shall gather when he cometh Sailing through the Golden Gate . Mine , a public posy , growing Somewhere by the garden wall , Might have gone to any stranger , May have been admired by all . But the rose in beauty blushing , Tenderly and sweetly grown In the home and its affections , Blooms for him , and him alone . Speed the voyager returning ; His shall be a welcome warm , With the Rose of Minnesota Gently resting on his arm . Love embraces in his kingdom Earth and sea and sky and air . Hail , Columbia ! hail , Hawaii ! It is Heaven everywhere . The Taxidermist . From other men he stands apart , Wrapped in sublimity of thought Where futile fancies enter not ; With starlike purpose pressing on Where Agassiz and Audubon Labored , and sped that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conquer , to achieve , Makes life well worth the struggle hard ; Its petty ills to disregard , In high endeavor day by day With this incentive -- that he may Somehow mankind the richer leave When he has passed away . Forest and field he treads alone , Finding companionship in birds , In reptiles , rodents , yea , in herds Of drowsy cattle fat and sleek ; For these to him a language speak To common multitudes unknown As tones of classic Greek . Unthinking creatures and untaught , They to his nature answer back Something his fellow mortals lack ; And oft educe from him the sigh That they unnoticed soon must die , Leaving of their existence naught To be remembered by . Man may aspire though in the slough ; May dream of glory , strive for fame , Thirst for the prestige of a name . And shall these friends , that so invite The study of the erudite , Ever as he beholds them now Perish like sparks of light ? Nay , ' t is his purpose and design To keep them : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elephant , or dove , or swan , Its native hue and raiment on , In effigy of plumage fine , Or skin its native tawn . What God hath wrought thus time shall tell , And thus endowment rich and vast Be rescued from the buried past ; And rare reliques that never fade Be in the manikin portrayed Till taxidermy witness well The debt to science paid . Lo ! one appeareth unforetold --  This re-creator , yea , of men ; Making him feel as born again Who looketh up with reverent eyes , Through wonders that his soul surprise , That great Creator to behold All-powerful , all-wise . Epithalamium . I. " Whom God hath joined " ah , this sententious phrase A meaning deeper than the sea conveys , And of a sweet and solemn service tells With the rich resonance of wedding-bells ; It speaks of vows and obligations given As if amid the harmony of heaven , While seraph lips approving seem to say , " Love , honor , and obey . " II . Is Hymen then ambassador divine , His mission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardor to incite , Convert the nun , rebuke the eremite ? As if were this his mandate from the throne : " It is not good for them to be alone ; Behold the land ! its fruitage and its flowers , Not mine and thine , but ours . " III . Did not great Paul aver , in lucid spell , That they of conjugal intent " do well " ? But hinted at a better state ,  - -  'tis one With which two loving souls have naught to do . For , in well-doing being quite content , Be there another state more excellent To which the celibate doth fain repair , They neither know nor care . IV . And does the Lord of all become High Priest , And with his presence grace the wedding-feast ? Then must the whole celestial throng draw nigh , For nuptials there are none beyond the sky ; So is the union sanctified and blest , For Love is host , and Love is welcome guest ; So may the joyous bridal season be Like that of Galilee . V. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the loving Saviour who revere , Madonna-like be thou in every grace That shall adorn thee in exalted place , And thine the happy privilege to prove The depth , the tenderness of woman 's love ; So shall the heart that honors thee today Bow down to thee alway . VI . O radiant June , in wealth of light and air , With leaf and bud and blossom everywhere , Let all bright tokens affluent combine , And round the bridal pair in splendor shine ; Let sweethearts coy and lovers fond and true On this glad day their tender vows renew , And all in wedlock 's bond rejoice as they Whom God hath joined for aye . A Fowl Affair . I hope I 'm not too orthodox To give a joke away , That took me like the chicken-pox And left a debt to pay . Let argument ignore the cost , If it be dear or cheap , And only claim that naught be lost When it 's too good to keep . The proverb says " All flesh is grass , " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pass , But not to pass me by . A body weighing by the pound Inside of half a score , In case and cordage safely bound , Was landed at my door . What could it be ? for friends are slack , And give , I rather trow , When they are sure of getting back As much as they bestow . My hair , at thought of dark design , Or dynamitish fate , Stood up like quills of porcupine , But more than twice as straight . Anon , I mused on something rare , Like duck or terrapin , But dreamed not , of the parcel , there Might be a pullet-in . A mighty jerk ,  - -  the string that broke The fowl affair revealed , The victim of a cruel choke , Its neck completely peeled . The biped in its paper cof- Fin , cramped and plump and neat , Had scratched its very toenails off In making both ends meat . The only part I always ate , That never made me ill , Had gone away decapitate And carried off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wings , On giblet gravy , salad nice , And chicken-pie-ous things . In heat of Fahrenheit degree Two hundred twelve or more , Where its grandsire , defying me , Had crowed the year before , I thrust it with a hope forlorn ,  --  I knew what toughness meant , And sighed that ever I was born To die of roasting scent . But presto ! what denouement grand Of cookery sublime ! ' T was done as by the second hand , The drumsticks beating thyme . And now the moral -- he who buys Will comprehend its worth ,  --  Look not so much to weight and size As to the date of birth . In fowls there is a difference ; " The good die young , " they say , And for the death of innocence To make us meat , we pray . Holiday Home . Of all the sweet visions that come unto me Of happy refreshment by land or by sea , Like oases where in life 's desert I roam , Is nothing so pleasant as Holiday Home . I climb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the west with affectionate thrills , And fancy I stand by the emerald side Of charming Geneva , like Switzerland 's pride . In distant perspective unruffled it lies , Except for the packet that paddles and plies , And puffing its way like a pioneer makes Its daily go-round o'er this pearl of the lakes . Untroubled except for the urchins that come From many a haunt that is never a home , Instinctive as ducklings to swim and to wade , Scarce knowing aforetime why water was made . All placid except for the dip of the oar Of the skiff , or the barge striking out from the shore , While merry excursionists shout till the gale Reverberates laughter through rigging and sail . How it scallops its basin and shimmers and shines Like a salver of silver encompassed with vines , In crystal illusion reflecting the skies And the mountain that seems from its bosom to rise . There stands a great house on a summit so high , Like an eyrie of safety enroofed by the sky ; And I think of the rest and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that empyreal air . Oh , the charm of the glen and the stream and the wood Can never be written , nor be understood , Except by the weary and languid who come To bask in the quiet of Holiday Home . From prisonlike cellars unwholesome and drear , From attic and alley , from labor severe , For the poor and the famished doth kindness prepare A world of diversion and excellent fare . To swing in the hammock , disport in the breeze , To lie in the shade of magnificent trees --  Oh , this is like quaffing from luxury 's bowl The life-giving essence for body and soul ! Nor distance nor time shall efface from the mind The influence gentle , the ministry kind ; While gratitude fondly enhallows the thought Of a home and a holiday never forgot . Ah , one is remembered of saintliest men To lovely Geneva who comes not again ; Who left a sweet impress wherever he trod , Humanity 's helper , companion of God . In the hearts of the many there sheltered and fed , As unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a sunbeam intrude Of the bounty so free , and the donors so good ? Who of their abundance have cheerfully given Wherewith to develop an embryo heaven --  To brighten conditions too hard and too sad And make the unhappy contented and glad . Be blessedness theirs , who like knights of renown Thus scatter such largesse o'er country and town , Their monument building in many a dome Like healthful and beautiful Holiday Home . Rutha . The days are long and lonely , The weary eve comes on , And the nights are filled with dreaming Of one beloved and gone . I reach out in the darkness And clasp but empty air , For Rutha dear has vanished --  I wonder , wonder where . Yet must it be : her nature So lovely , pure , and true ; So nearly like the angels , Is she an angel too . The cottage is dismantled Of all that made it bright ; Beyond its silent portal No love , nor life , nor light . Where are the hopes I cherished , The joys that once I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all are perished too . Yes , love 's dear chain is broken ; From shore to shore I roam --  No comfort , no companion , No happiness , no home . Oh could I but enfold her Unto my heart once more , If aught could e'er restore me My darling as before ; If God would only tell me --  Such myriads above --  Why He must needs have taken The one I loved to love ; If God would only tell me Why multitudes are left , Unhappy and unlovely , And I am thus bereft ; If -- O my soul , be silent And some day thou shalt see Through mystery and shadow , And know why it must be . To every cry of anguish From every heart distressed , Can be no other answer Than this -- God knoweth best . The Student Gone . So soon he fell , the world will never know What possibilities within him lay , What hopes irradiated his young life , With high ambition and with ardor rife ; But ah ! the speedy summons came , and so He passed away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others misapplied , misunderstood ; And doors are barred that wait the master-key --  That wait his magic Open Sesame !  --  To that assertive power that commands The multitude . Too soon he fell ! Was he not born to prove What manhood and integrity might be --  How one from all base elements apart Might walk serene , in purity of heart , His face the bright transparency of love And sympathy ? The student ranks are closed , there is no gap ; Of other brave aspirants is no dearth ; Prowess , fidelity , and truth go on , And few shall miss or mourn the student gone , Reposing in the all-protecting lap Of Mother Earth . Too soon -- O God ! was it thy will that one Of such endeavor and of noble mien , Enrapt with living , should thus early go From all he loved and all who loved him so , Mid life 's activities no longer known , No longer seen ? Oh , not for aye should agonizing lips Quiver with questionings they dare not frame ; Though in the dark penumbra of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enshadowed as in dense eclipse , No more the same . Could we but know , in that Elysian lore Of happy exercise still going on Could we but know of glorious heights attained , Of his reward , of mysteries explained ,  --  Ah ! but to know were to lament no more The student gone . The Tourist . Lo ! carpet-bag and bagger occupy the land , And prove the touring season actively begun ; His personnel and purpose can none misunderstand , For each upon his frontlet bears his honest brand --  The fool-ish one ! By caravan and car , from country and from town , A great grasshopper army fell foraging the land ; Like bumblebees that know not where to settle down , Impossible it is to curb or scare or drown The tourist band . With guidebook , camera , with rod and gun , to shoot , To lure the deer , the hare , the bird , the speckled trout , The pauper or the prince unbidden they salute , And everywhere their royal right dare none dispute --  To roam about . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From high society 's luxurious stately homes , From lounging places by the park or promenade , From rural dwellings canopied in sylvan shade , The tourist comes . To every mountain peak within the antipodes , To sweet , sequestered spots no other mortal knows ; To every island fair engirt by sunny seas , To forest-centers unexplored by birds or bees , The tourist goes . For Summer 's fingers all the land have richly dressed , Resplendent in regalia of scent and bloom , And stirred in every heart the spirit of unrest , Like that of untamed fledglings in the parent nest For ampler room . What is it prompts the roving mania -- is it love Of wild adventure fanciful , unique , and odd ? Is it to be in fashion , and to others prove One 's social standing , that impels the madness of The tramp abroad ? The question hangs unanswered , like an unwise prayer , Importunate , but powerless response to bring ; Go ask the voyagers , the rovers everywhere --  They only say it is their rest-time , outing , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy complete When happy tourist-traveler , no more to roam , His fascinating , thrilling story shall repeat To impecunious , luckless multitudes who greet The tourist home . The Antiquarian . Millions have been and passed from view Benignity who never knew ; No aspiration theirs , nor aim ; Existence soulless as the clay From whence they sprang , what right have they To eulogy or fame ? So multitudes have been forgot --  But drones or dunces , good for naught ; Like clinging parasites or burrs Taking from others all they dared , Yet little they for others cared Except as pilferers . Not so with that majestic man The all-round antiquarian --  No model his nor parallel ; From selfishness inviolate Are his achievements good and great , And thus shall ages tell . A love for the antiquities His honest hold , his birthright is ! And things unheard of or unread , Defaced by moth or rust or mold , To him are treasures more than gold , Ay , than his daily bread . At neither ghost nor ghoul aghast He echoes voices of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his ear Are sweeter than of kindred dear , Sweeter than Florimel 's . He delves through centuries of dust To resurrect some unknown bust , A torso , or a goddess whole ; Maybe like Venus , minus arms --  Haply to find those missing charms ; But not the lost , lost soul . He dotes on aborigines Who lived in caves and hollow trees , And barters for their trinkets rare ; Exchanging with those dusky breeds For arrow-heads and shells and beads A scalplock of his hair . Had he been born -- thus he laments --  Along with other great events , Coeval say with Noah 's flood , A proud relationship to trace With Hittites -- or with any race Of blue archaic blood ! Much he adores that Pilgrim flock , The same that split old Plymouth rock , Their " Bay Psalm " when they tried to sing . Devoid of metre , sense , and tune , Who but a Puritanic loon Could have devised the thing ? He revels in a pedigree , The sprouting of a noble tree ' Way back in prehistoric times ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that ever grew Would give a billion dimes . There is a language fossils speak : ' T is not like Latin , much less Greek , But quite as dead and antiquate Its silent syllables , and cold ; But ah , what meanings they unfold , What histories relate ! The earthquake is his best ally --  It shows up things he can not buy , And gives him raw material For making mastodons and such , Enough to beat that ancient " Dutch Republic 's Rise and Fall . " A piece of bone can never lie : A rib , a femur , or a thigh Is but a dislocated sign Of something hybrid , half and half Betwixt a crocodile and calf --  Maybe a porcupine . The stately " Antiquarium " Is his emporium , his home . He wonders if when he is gone Will people look with mournful pride On him done up and classified , And the right label on . He dreams of an emblazoned page , The calendar of every age Down from Creation 's primal dawn ; With archetypes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrations drawn . Labor a blessing , not a curse , His hunting ground the Universe , So much the more his nature craves To sound the fathoms of the sea : What mighty wonders there must be Down in those hidden caves ! So toils this dauntless man , alert Amid the ruins and the dirt , That other men to endless day Themselves uplifted from the clod May see , and learn and know that God Is greater far than they . And thus , of mighty ken and plan , The all-round antiquarian Pursues his happy ministry ; And on the world 's progressive track Advances , always going back --  Back to antiquity . Poor Housekeeping . If there is one gift that I prize above others , That tinges with brightness whatever I do , And gives to the sombre a roseate hue , ' T is a legacy mine from the nicest of mothers , Who haply the beauty of housewifery knew , And taught me her neatness and diligence too .

There 's many a husband , a patient bread-winner , Gets up from the table with look of despair , And something akin to the growl of a bear ; Not the saint he might be , but a querulous sinner --  One driven to fasting but not unto prayer --  Till epitaphed thus --  " Indigestible Fare . " There 's many a child , from the roof-tree diurnal , A scene of distraction or dullness severe , With the longing of youth for diversion and cheer , That comes like the spring-time refreshing and vernal , Goes out on a ruinous , reckless career , Returning , if ever , not many a year .

I covet no part with that army of shirkers All down at the heels in their slipper-y tread , Who hunt for the rolling-pin under the bed , Who look with disdain on intelligent workers And take to the club or the circus instead Of mending a stocking or laying the spread .

Valiant sons of the sea , All the vast deep , your home , Holds no terror so dread As this novel and unseen foe , Lurking under the foam Of some dangerous channel --  As the torpedo , the scourge of ships . Through the rigging may roar AEolus ' thousand gales , Yet the mariner 's heart Shrinketh not from the howling blast ; Though with battle-rent sails , Flames and carnage around him , Cowardice never shall pale his lips . But when powers concealed , Threatening with death the crew , Pave each eddy below , E'en the bravest are chilled with fear , Lest yon wizard in blue , Who their progress is spying , Touch but the key with his finger-tips .

The mallet-sport became her In hue of exercise That tinged her cheek with roses ; And , dancing in her eyes , Were pantomime suggestions Of having won -- a prize . No more to me a stranger Is she who occupies A place in all my musings ; And brings in tender guise A thought of one so like her --  Long years in Paradise . Dear Margaret ! that " pearl-name " Is thine -- and may it be The synonym of goodness , Of truth and purity , And all ennobling graces Exemplified in thee . Christmas Bells .

Ring , Christmas bells ! for at the sound Sweet memories of Him abound Who laid aside a diadem To be the babe of Bethlehem . By the Sea . I am longing to dwell by the sea , And dip in the surf every day , And -- height of subaqueous glee --  With the sharks and the porpoises play . To novelty ever inclined --  Instead of a calm evening sail , ' T would suit my adventurous mind To ride on the back of a whale .

My heart is sad tonight ; The day has been so drear and long , The world has gone awry and wrong , Discouragements around me throng , And gloom surpassing night . Oh , sing again the song for me My mother used to sing When I , a child beside her knee , Looked up for her sweet sympathy , Nor ever thought how I might be Her little hindering thing .

" We quarrel with the calendar --  For May has been misplaced --  And doubt the tale oracular Of " Janus , double-faced ; " For this " ethereal mildness " looks Toward shadowy delights Of roseate bowers , of cosy nooks , Of coming thermal nights . Let robes diaphanous succeed Dense garments made of fur , And overcoats maintain the lead --  Among the things that were ! The wisely-rented sealskin sacque , By many a dame possessed , Be quickly relegated back To its moth-haunted chest ! While every portly alderman , In linen suit arrayed , Manipulates the palm-leaf fan And seeks the cooling shade ; And he perspires who not in vain Suggests his funny squibs , By poking his unwelcome cane In other people 's ribs .

" Sweet Peas . By helpful fingers taught to twine Around its trellis , grew A delicate and dainty vine ; The bursting bud , its blossom sign , Inlaid with honeyed-dew . Developing by every art To floriculture known , From tares exempt , and kept apart , Careful , as if in some fond heart Its legume germs were sown .

Midway upon the lawn it stands , So picturesque and pretty ; Upreared by patient artist hands , Admired of all the city ; The very arbor of my dream , A covert cool and airy , So leaf-embowered as to seem The dwelling of a fairy . It is the place to lie supine Within a hammock swinging , To watch the sunset , red as wine , To hear the crickets singing ; And while the insect world around Is buzzing -- by the million --  No winged thing above the ground Intrudes in this pavilion . It is the place , at day 's decline , To tell the old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning glory ; To confiscate the rustic seat And barter stolen kisses , For honey must be twice as sweet In such a spot as this is . It is the haunt where one may get Relief from petty trouble , May read the latest day 's gazette About the " Klondike " bubble : How shanties rise like golden courts . Where sheep wear glittering fleeces , How gold is picked up -- by the quartz --  And all get rich as Croesus . Here hid away from dust and heat , Secure from rude intrusion , While willing lips the thought repeat , So grows the fond illusion : That happiness the product is Of lazy , languid dozing , Of soft midsummer reveries , Half-waking , half-reposing . And here in restful interlude , Life 's fallacies forgetting , Its frailties -- such a multitude --  The fuming and the fretting , Amid the fragrance , dusk , and dew , The happy soul at even May walk abroad , and interview Bright messengers from Heaven . To Die in Autumn . The melody of autumn Is the only tune I know , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ; It stirs anew the happy wish , So near to perfect bliss , To live a little longer in A world like this . The sound was never sweeter , The voice so nearly mute , As beauty , dying , loses Her hold upon the lute ; And like the harmonies that touch And blend with those above , Forever must an echo wake The heart of love . Her robe of brown and coral And amber glistens through Rare jewels of the morning , The opals of the dew , Like royal fabrics worn beneath The tinselry of pearls , Or diamond dust by fashion strewn On sunny curls . If I could wrap such garments In true artistic style About myself departing , And wear as sweet a smile And be as guileless as the flowers My friends would never sigh ; ' T would reconcile them to my death To see me die .

Apple Blossoms . Of all the lovely blossoms That decorate the trees , And shower down their petals With every breath of breeze , There is nothing so sweet or fair to me As the delicate blooms of the apple tree . A thousand shrubs and flow'rets Delicious pleasure bring , But beautiful Pomona Must be the queen of spring ; And out of her flagon the peach and pear Their chalices fill with essence rare . Oh , is it any wonder , Devoid of blight or flaw , The peerless blooms of Eden Our primal mother saw In redolent beauty before her placed So tempted fair Eve the fruit to taste ? But woman 's love of apples , Involving fearful price , And Adam 's love for woman That cost him Paradise , By the labor of hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blessing now . If so those pink-eyed glories , In fields and orchards gay Develop luscious fruitage By Horticulture 's way , Then , sweet as the heart of rich legumes , Shall luxury follow the apple blooms . Without a Minister . The congregation was devout , The minister inspired , Their attitude to those without By every one admired , And all things so harmonious seemed , Of no calamity we dreamed . But , just in this quiescent state A little cloud arose Portentous of our certain fate --  As everybody knows ; Our pastor took it in his head His " resignation " must be read . In every eye a tear-drop stood , For we accepted it Reluctantly , but nothing could Make him recant one bit ; And soon he left for distant parts , While we were left -- with broken hearts . And next the " patriarch " who led For nearly three-score years Our " Sabbath school "  - -  its worthy head --  Rekindled all our fears By saying , with a smile benign , " Since it 's the fashion , I 'll resign ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , of good report --  " Our Superintendent " is his name --  Who tries to " hold the fort " With wisdom , tact , and rare good sense , In this , his first experience .

Is it not our bounden duty Harsh and bitter thoughts to quell , Wild , ambitions schemes repel , And to revel in the beauty Of this Indian summer spell , Bathing forest , field , and dell As with radiance immortelle ? None can paint like nature dying ; Whose dissolving struggle lent Wealth of hues so richly blent That , through weary years of trying , Artist skill pre-eminent May not copy or invent Such divine embellishment . Knights of old from castles riding Scattered largesse as they went Which , like manna heaven-sent , Cheered the poverty-abiding ; But , when ' neath " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sad were they and indigent . Monarchs , too , have thus delighted Giving unto courtiers free , Costly robes and tinselry ; And , as royal guests , invited Them to sumptuous halls of glee , Banqueting and minstrelsy , Bacchus holding sovereignty . Then , perchance , in mood capricious Stripped and scorned and turned away Those who tasted for a day Pleasure sweet and food delicious ; Nor might any say them nay --  Lest his head the forfeit pay Who a king dared disobey . But our own benignant Giver , Almoner impartial , true , Constantly doth gifts renew ; Nor would fitfully deliver Aught unto the chosen few , But to all the wide world through , Who admire his wonders , too . Never shall the heart be poorer , Never languish in despair , That such affluence may share ; For than this is nothing surer --  He hath said , and will prepare In those realms of upper air Glories infinitely fair . Autumn-Time . Like music heard in mellow chime , The charm of her transforming time Upon my senses steals As softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their shadow falls Across the sleeping fields . A fair , illumined book Is nature 's page whereon I look While " autumn turns the leaves ; " And many a thought of her designs Between those rare , resplendent lines My fancy interweaves . I dream of aborigines , Who must have copied from the trees The fashions of the day : Those gorgeous topknots for the head , Of yellow tufts and feathers red , With beads and sinews gay . I wonder if the saints behold Such pageantry of colors bold Beyond the radiant sky ; And if the tints of Paradise Are heightened by the strange device Of making all things die . Yea , even so ; for Nature glows Because of her expiring throes , As if around her tomb Unmeet it were ,  - -  the look severe That designates a common bier Enwreathed in deepest gloom . And so I meditate if aught Can be so fair where death is not ; If Heaven 's loveliness Is born of struggle and decay ; And , but for funeral array , Would it be beautiless ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrivaled brilliancy Is but her splendid pall ! That Heaven were not what it is But for that crown of tragedies , The sacrifice for all . So not a charm would Zion lose Were it bereft of sparkling hues In gilded lanes and leas ; It would be bright though not a flower Unclosed in its celestial bower , And void of jeweled trees . Yet , lily-like , one bloom I see , Its name is his who died for me ; Whose matchless beauty shows Perfection on its bleeding stem , The blossom-bud of Bethlehem , The Resurrection Rose . The Beauty of Nature . Oh bud and leaf and blossom , How beautiful they are ! Than last year 's vernal season ' T is lovelier by far ; This earth was never so enchanting Nor half so bright before --  But so I 've rhapsodized , in springtime , For forty years or more . What luxury of color On shrub and plant and vine , From pansies ' richest purple To pink of eglantine ; From buttercups to " johnny-jump-ups , " With deep cerulean eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sometimes I think the sunlight That gilds the emerald hills , And makes Aladdin dwellings Of dingy domiciles , Is surplus beauty overflowing That Heaven can not hold --  The topaz glitter , or the jacinth , The glare of streets of gold . In " Cedar Hill , " the city Of " low green tents " of sod , I read the solemn record Of those gone home to God ; While from their hallowed dust arising The fragrant lilies grow As if their life was all the sweeter For those who sleep below . And so ' t is not in sadness I dwell upon the thought , When I am dead and buried That I shall be forgot . Because the germ of reproduction Doth this poor body hold , Perchance to add to nature 's beauty A rose above the mold . " All the Rage .

No place its own euphonious name Within the catalogue might claim Of any flora-lover ; For , in the scores of passers-by , As yet no true artistic eye Its beauty could discover . The reaper with his sickle keen Aimed at its crest of gold and green With spiteful stroke relentless , And would have rooted from the ground The " Solidago "  -- blossom-crowned , But gaudy , rank , and scentless . But everything must have its day --  And since some fickle devotee Or myrmidon of Fashion Declares that this obnoxious weed , From wild , uncultivated seed , Shall be the " ruling passion , " Effusive schoolgirls dote on it ; Whose " frontispieces " infinite That need no decoration Are hid beneath its golden dust , Till many a fine , symmetric bust Is lost to admiration .

That negligee " blue-stocking " friend , Who never cared her time to spend On mysteries of the toilet , Now wears a sumptuous bouquet And shakes your hand a mile away For fear that you will spoil it . Delightful widows , dressed in black , Complain with modest sighs they lack That coveted expression , That sort of Indian Summer air Which " relicts " always ought to wear By general concession ; And so lugubrious folds of crape Are crimped and twisted into shape With graceful heads of yellow , That give a winsome toning down To sombre hat and sable gown --  In autumn tintings mellow . Alas , we only hate the weed ! And think that it must be , indeed , The ladies ' last endeavor To match the gentlemen , who flaunt That odious dried tobacco plant At which they puff forever .

As bright as blessed sunlight ray The past comes back to me ; Her fingers turn the sacred page For a little group of tender age Who gather at her knee .

The company was large , and she Touched elbows with the exquisite , Gay Archibald , who took her wit And pertness all as meant for him ; Who , thereby lifted some degrees Above less-favored devotees , With rainbow sails began to trim His craft of sweet felicity ; So mirth in reckless afterlude Convulsed the merry multitude , Who laughed at Archie 's self-esteem , And pitied Will 's long-cherished dream ; While all declared , for her and Ned --  His face was like a silver tray --  The wedding-banquet should be spread Before a twelvemonth passed away .

If every folly , every freak , From day to day , from week to week , Is written in " The Book , " With all the idle words we speak , Would it not crimson many a cheek Upon the page to look ?

He hath been blessed who sometimes knelt Owning that God is just , And in the stillness of cypress shade Rosemary 's tender symbol laid Upon a cherished shrine , and felt Strengthened in faith and trust Over the precious dust . So perfect character is wrought , Rounded and beautified , By the alchemy of that strange alloy , The intermingling of grief and joy ; So nearer Heaven the spirit , brought Bleeding , so sorely tried , Finds its diviner side .

Ah , no ! that everywhere The earth is passing fair , And strange new life hath caught , Is but the marvel wrought By sunlight , rain , and air . Bermuda .

Oh , how it makes the northern heart , With sluggish current half-congealed , In ecstasy and vigor start To read about this tropic field ; The garden of luxuriousness , In winter wearing summer 's dress .

But if some reckless cyclone gale Should drop Bermuda at our door , ' T would warm our February sky And bring the time of roses nigh ! The Charter Oak .

Revered as one among the trees To mark the seasons born , To watchful aborigines It told by leafy indices The time of planting corn .

Shall e'er Connecticut forget What unto it we owe --  How Wadsworth coped with Andros ' threat , And tyranny , in council met , Outwitted years ago ? Aye , but it rouses loyal spunk To think of that old tree ! Its stately stem , its spacious trunk By Nature robbed of pith and punk To guard our liberty . But of the oak long-perished , why Is earth forever full ? For , like the loaf and fish supply , Its stock of fiber , tough and dry , Seems inexhaustible .

The air is redolent As ocean breezes are From spicy islands blowing , Or groves of Malabar Where sandal-wood is growing ; Or sweet , diffusive scent , From fragrant attar-jar . Just so is loveliness Renewed from year to year ; And thus emotions tender , Born of the atmosphere , Of bloom , and vernal splendor That words can not express , Make Spring forever dear . Can mortal man behold So beautiful a scene , Without the innate feeling That thus , like dying sheen The sunset hues revealing , Glints pure , celestial gold On fields of living green ?

' Mid novelty and sweet surprise Her soul , enraptured , seemed to rise And tread the realms of Paradise ; Her shivering limbs grew warm , And as the shadows longer crept Across the chancel , angels kept Their vigils o'er her as she slept Secure from cold and storm .

Lightning-bugs . Around my vine-wreathed portico , At evening , there 's a perfect glow Of little lights a-flashing --  As if the stellar bodies had From super-heat grown hyper-mad , And spend their ire in clashing . As frisky each as shooting star , These tiny electricians are The Lampyrine Linnaean --  Or lightning-bugs , that sparkling gleam Like scintillations in a dream Of something empyrean . They brush my face , light up my hair , My garments touch , dart everywhere ; And if I try to catch them They 're quicker than the wicked flea --  And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress to match them . To be a " princess in disguise , " And wear a robe of fireflies All strung and wove together , And be the cynosure of all At Madame Haut-ton 's carnival , In fashion 's gayest feather . So , sudden , falls upon the grass The overpow'ring light of gas , And through the lattice streaming ; As wearily I close my eyes Brief are the moments that suffice To reach the land of dreaming . Now at the ball , superbly dressed As I suppose , to eclipse the rest , Within an alcove shady A brilliant flame I hope to be , While all admire and envy me , The " bright electric lady . " But , ah , they never shine at all ! My eyes ignite -- I leave the hall , For wrathful tears have filled them ; I could have crushed them on the spot --  The bugs , I mean !  - -  and quite forgot That stringing them had killed them . Of Her who Died . We look up to the stars tonight , Idolatrous of them , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ray of purest light From some celestial gem In her bright diadem . Before that lonely home we wait , Ah ! nevermore to see Her lovely form within the gate Where heart and hearthstone desolate And vine and shrub and tree Seem asking : " Where is she ? " There is the cottage Love had planned --  Where hope in ashes lies --  A tower beautiful to stand , Her monument whose gentle hand And presence in the skies Make home of Paradise . In wintry bleakness nature glows Beneath the stellar ray ; We see the mold , but not the rose , And meditate if knowledge goes Into yon mound of clay , With her who passed away . Of sighs , and tears , and joys denied Do echoes reach up there ? Do seraphs know -- God does -- how wide And deep is sorrow 's bitter tide Of dolor and despair , And darkness everywhere ? Dear angel , snatched from our caress , So suddenly withdrawn , Alone are we and comfortless ; As in a dome of emptiness The old routine goes on , Aimless , since thou @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In all the world beside Of thee to cherish blessed thought ; So early thy sweet mission wrought , As friend , as promised bride , Who lived , and loved , and died . Thanksgiving . Nature , erewhile so marvelously lovely , is bereft Of her supernal charm ; And with the few dead garlands of departed splendor left , Like crape upon her arm , In boreal hints , and sudden gusts That fan the glowing ember , By multitude of ways fulfills The promise of November . Upon the path where Beauty , sylvan priestess , sped away , Lies the rich afterglow Of Indian Summer , bringing round the happy holiday That antedates the snow : The glad Thanksgiving time , the cheer , The festival commotion That stirs fraternal feeling from The mountains to the ocean . O Hospitality ! unclose thy bounty-laden hand In generous dealing , where Is gathered in reunion each long-severed household band , And let no vacant chair Show where the strongest , brightest link In love 's dear chain is broken --  A symbol more pathetic than By language ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some Beloved absentee , Perchance passed to the other shore , oh , let the stranger come And in gratuity Partake of festal favors that Shall sweeten hours of labor , And strengthen amity and love Unto his friend and neighbor . Let gratitude 's pure incense in warm orisons ascend , A blessing to secure , And gracious impulse bearing largesse of good gifts extend To all deserving poor ; So may the day be hallowed by Unstinted thanks and giving , In sweet remembrance of the dead And kindness to the living . Receiving Sight . In hours of meditation fraught With mem'ries of departed days , Comes oft a tender , loving thought Of one who shared our youthful plays . In gayest sports and pleasures rife Whose happy nature reveled so , That on her ardent , joyous life A shadow lay , we did not know ; And bade her look one summer night Up to the sky that seemed to hold , In dying sunset splendor bright , All hues of sapphire , red , and gold . How strange the spell that mystified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadly her sweet voice replied , " Why , do n't you know I can not see ? " Too true ! those eyes bereft of sight No blemish bare , no drop-serene , But nothing in this world of light And beauty they had ever seen . A dozen years in gentle ruth Their impress lent to brow and cheek , When precious words of sacred truth Led her the Saviour 's face to seek . Responsive unto earnest prayers Commingling love and penitence , A blessing came -- not unawares --  In new and strange experience . And all was light , as Faith 's clear eye A brighter world than ours divined ; For never clouds obscured the sky That she could see , while we were blind . Oh , it must be an awful thing To be shut out from light of day !  --  From summer 's grace , and bloom of spring In gladness words can not portray . But haply into every heart May enter that Celestial Light That doth to life 's dark ways impart A radiance hid from mortal sight . Revenge . Beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and right , A morning glory grew ; With blossoms covered , pink and white And deep , delicious blue . Its care became my daily thought , Who to the sweet diversion brought A bit of florist skill To guide its progress , till it caught The meaning of my will . When through the trellis in and out It bent and turned and climbed about And so ambitious grew , O'erleaped a chasm beyond the spout Where raindrops trickled through , Then , in caressing , graceful way , Around a door knob twined one day With modest show of pride ; All unaware that danger lay Just on the other side . An awkward , verdant " maid of work , " Who dearly loved her tasks to shirk , While rummaging among Unused apartments , with a jerk The door wide open flung . And lo ! there lay , uprooted quite , The object of my heart 's delight --  I did not weep or rant , And yet a grain or two of spite My secret thoughts would haunt . So when at night her favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le cuisine --  Occurred , as all the neighbors know , A semi-tragic scene . The garden hose , obscured from view , Turned on itself and drenched the two --  A hapless circumstance That lengthened out her " frizzes " new , But shrunk his Sunday pants . Remember this was years agone --  The madcap now hath sober grown And hose is better wrought , And neither now would run alone The risk of being caught . On the Common . We met on " Boston Common "  --  Of course it was by chance --  A sudden , unexpected , But happy circumstance That gave the dull October day A beautiful , refulgent ray . Like wandering refugees from A city of renown , Impelled to reconnoiter This Massachusetts town , Each by a common object urged , Upon the park our paths converged . Good nature , bubbling over In healthy , hearty laughs , And little lavish speeches Like pleasant paragraphs , The kind regard , unstudied joke , His true felicity bespoke . A bit of doleful knowledge Confided unto me , About the way the doctors --  Who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sympathy and humor , too . I hoped he would n't lose them , And languish in the dumps By having to quadrille on A pair of polished stumps --  But a corky limb , though one might dread , Is n't half as bad as a wooden head . He censured those empirics Who never heal an ill , Though bound by their diplomas To either cure or kill , Who should , with ignominy crowned , Their patients follow -- under ground . I left him at the foot of " The Soldiers ' Monument , " With incoherent mutterings --  As though ' t were his intent To turn the sod , a rod or two , And sleep beside the " boys in blue . " In Hartford 's charming circles His bonhommie I miss , And having never seen him From that day unto this , I think of him with much regret As lying -- with the soldiers -- yet . Woman 's Help . Sometimes I long to write an ode And magnify his name , The man of honor , on the road To opulence and fame , On whom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world I fain would show That talent widely known , Rare eloquence , of burning glow To melt a heart of stone , That all his gifts , a dazzling row , Are his , and his alone . But him , of character and mind Superb , alert , and strong , I never study but to find The subject of my song , Some paragon of womankind , Has helped him all along . He may not know , he may not guess , How much to her he owes , How every scion of success That in his nature grows , Developed by her watchfulness , Becomes a blooming rose . From buffetings in humble place , And labors ill begun , To proud achievement in the race And laurels grandly won , His trials all she dares to face As friend and champion . The bars that hinder his advance And half obscure the goal , The stubborn bond of circumstance That irritates his soul , The countershafts of arrogance , All yield to her control . He builds a tower -- she below Is handing up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand had trimmed the wicks ; He prays for daily bread -- the dough A woman deigns to mix . Tobogganing . Oh , the rare exhilaration , Oh , the novel delectation Of a ride down the slide ! Packed like ice in zero weather , Pleasure-seekers close together , On a board as thin as wafer , Barely wider , scarcely safer , At the height of recreation Find a glorious inspiration , Ere the speedy termination In the snowy meadow wide , Sloping to the river 's side . Oh , such quakers we begin it , Timorous of the icy route ! But to learn in half a minute What felicity is in it , As we shoot down the chute , Smothered in toboggan suit , Redingote or roquelaure , Buttoned up ( and down ) before , Mittens , cap , and moccasin , Just the garb to revel in ; So , the signal given , lo ! Over solid ice and snow , Down the narrow gauge we go Swifter than a bird o'erhead , Swifter than an arrow sped From the staunchest , strongest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Silly lovers ' paradise !

Ye who dwell in latitudes Where " the blizzard " ne'er intrudes , And the water seldom freezes ; Ye of balmy Southern regions , Alabama 's languid legions , From the " hot blast " of your breezes , Where the verdure of the trees is Limp , and loose , and pitiful , Come up here where branches bare Stand like spikes in frosty air ; Come up here where arctic rigor Shall restore your bloom and vigor , Making life enjoyable ; Come and take a jog on The unparalleled toboggan ! Such the zest that he who misses Never knows what perfect bliss is .

In summer 's still solstice my steps are drawn To the shade of the forest trees ; To revel with Pan in his secret haunts , To pipe mazourkas while satyrs dance , Or lull to soft slumber some favorite faun And fascinate strange wild birds and bees . I love the woods when autumnal fires Are kindled on every hill ; When dead leaves rustle in grove and field , And trees are known by the fruits they yield , And the wild grapes , sweetened by frost , inspire A mildly-desperate , bibulous thrill . There 's a joy for which I would fling to the air My petty portion of wealth and fame , In tracking the rabbit o'er fresh-fallen snow , The ways of the ' coon and opossum to know , To capture squirrels when branches are bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I long to explore the woods again In my own aboriginal way , As before I knew how culture could frown On a hoydenish gait and a homespun gown Or dreamed that the strata of proud " upper-ten " Would smile at rusticity 's naivete . I sigh for the pleasures of long ago In youth 's sweet halcyon time ; When better beloved than the thoroughfare By multitudes trod were the woodlands , where Was never a path that I did not know , Nor thrifty sapling I dared not climb . Alas for lost freedom ! Alas for me ! For oh , Society 's lip would curl , Propriety 's self with scornful eye And gilt-edged Fashion would pass me by To know that sometimes I 'm dying to be The romp , the rover , the same old girl .

The invalid may yet enjoy His favorite recreation , Gay , romping girl , unfettered boy In outdoor sports the time employ , And happy consummation Of prudent plans the farmer know Ere wintry breezes round him blow . And they by poverty controlled --  Good fortune shall betide them As scenes of beauty they behold , And seem to revel in the gold Which Plutus has denied them ; For , ah ! the poor from want 's despair Oft covet wealth they never share . Sheridan 's Last Ride . While Phoebus lent his hottest rays To signalize midsummer days , I stood in that far-famed enclosure By thousands visited , Where , in the stillness of reposure , Are grouped battalions dead . Where , round each simple burial stone , The grass for decades twain has grown , Protecting them in dreamless slumber Who perished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war 's tableau . Along the winding avenue A vast procession came in view ; The mourners ' slow , advancing column With reverent step drew near , The " Dead March " playing , sad and solemn , Above a soldier 's bier . There were the colonels , brigadiers , Comrades in arms of other years , Civilians , true and loyal-hearted To him their bravest man , Who seemed to say to those departed , " Make room for Sheridan ! " Anon , beside the new-made mound , The warworn veterans gathered round , And spake of Lyon and of Lander , And others ranked as high , Recalling each his old commander , One not afraid to die . Thus , silent tenants one by one Are crowding in at Arlington ; Thus Sheridan , the horseman daring , Has joined the honored corps Of those , their true insignia wearing , Who battle nevermore . Potomac 's wave shall placid flow , And sing his requiem soft and low , His terrace grave be sweet with clover , And daisies star his bed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead ! A Bit of Gladness . As I near my lonely cottage , At the close of weary day , There 's a little bit of gladness Comes to meet me on the way : Dimpled , tanned , and petticoated , Innocent as angels are , Like a smiling , straying sunbeam Is my Stella -- like a star . Soon a hand of tissue-softness Slips confidingly in mine , And with tender look appealing Eyes of beauty sweetly shine ; Like a gentle shepherd guiding Some lost lamb unto the fold , So she leads me homeward , prattling Till her stories are all told . " Papa , I 'm so glad to see you --  Cousin Mabel came today --  And the gas-man brought a letter That he said you 'd better pay --  Yes , and awful things is happened : My poor kitty 's drowned to death --  Mamma 's got the ' Pigs in Clover '  --  " Here she stops for want of breath . I am like the bold knight-errant , From his castle who would roam , Trusting her , my faithful steward , For a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and hazard All that any man may dare , For a resting-place at even , And the love that waits me there . And sometimes I look with pity On my neighbor 's mansion tall : There are chambers full of pictures , There are marbles in the hall , Yet with all the signs of splendor That may gild a pile of stone , Not a living thing about it But the owner , grim and lone . I believe that all his millions He would give without repine For a little bit of gladness In his life , like that in mine ; This it is that makes my pathway Beautiful , wherever trod , Keeps my soul from wreck and ruin , Keeps me nearer to my God . The Charity Ball . There was many a token of festal display , And reveling crowds who were never so gay , And , as it were AEolus charming the hours , An orchestra hidden by foliage and flowers ; There were tapestries fit for the home of a queen , And mirrors that glistened in wonderful sheen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this was the annual Charity Ball . There were pompous civilians , in wealth who abide , Displaying their purses , the source of their pride ; And plethoric dealers in margins and stocks , And owners of acres of elegant blocks , And tenement-landlords who cling to a cent When from the poor widow exacting her rent --  Immovable , stern , as an adamant wall --  And yet , who " came down " to this Charity Ball . There was Beauty whose toilet , superb and unique , Cost underpaid industry many a week Of arduous labor of eye , and heartache , Its starving inadequate pittance to make ; There were mischievous maidens and cavaliers bold , Whose blushes and glances and coquetry told A tale of the monarch who held them in thrall --  Who met , as by chance , at the Charity Ball . There were delicate viands the poor never taste , And dollars were lavished in prodigal waste To pamper the palate of epicures rich ; Who drew from the wine cellar 's cavernous niche " Excelsior " brands of the rarest champagnes To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if a step in some woeful downfall Should ever be traced to a Charity Ball ! Outside of the window , pressed close to the pane , And furrowed by tears that had fallen like rain , Was the face of a woman , so spectral in hue , With great liquid eyes , like twin oceans of blue , And cheeks in whose hollows were written the lines That pitiless hunger so often defines , Who muttered , as closer she gathered the shawl , " Oh , never for me is this Charity Ball ! " From liveried hirelings who bade her begone , By uniformed minions compelled to move on , Out into the street again driven to roam --  For friends she had none , neither fortune nor home ; While carnival-goers in morning 's dull gray As homeward returning , fatigued and blase , A vision encountered their hearts to appall , And banish all thought of the Charity Ball . As if seeking warmth from the icy curb-stone , A form half-reclining , half-clad , and unknown . Dead eyes looking up with a meaningless stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A form so emaciate the spirit had fled --  But the pulpit and press and the public all said , As society 's doings they sought to recall , That a " brilliant success " was the Charity Ball . The Bell(e) of Baltimore . One of the notable features of Baltimore is the big bell that hangs in the city hall tower , to strike the hour and sound the fire alarm . It is called " Big Sam , " and weighs 5,000 pounds A million feet above the ground ( For so it seemed in winding round ) , A million , and two more , The latter stiff and sore , While perspiration formed a part Of every reeking pore , I viewed the city like a chart Spread out upon the floor . And said : " Great guide Jehoiakin , To me is meagre pleasure in The height of spires and domes , Of walls like ancient Rome 's ; Nor care I for the marts of trade , Or shelves of musty tomes , Nor yet for yonder colonnade Before your palace homes ; " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen , Who suiteth well the score Of suitors at her door ; Oh , which of your divinities Is she whom all adore ? Embodiment of truth , who is The belle of Baltimore ? " Veracity 's revolving eyes Looked up as if to read the skies : " Why , Lor ' - a- miss , see dar --  De bell is in de air ! Lan ' sakes ! of all de missteries Yo ' nebber learn before ! Why , don ' yo ' know ' Big Sam ' ? He is De bell of Baltimore ! " Christmas at Church . ' T was drawing near the holiday , When piety and pity met In whisp'ring council , and agreed That Christmas time , in homes of need , Should be remembered in a way They never could forget . Then noble generosity Took youth and goodness by the hand , And planned a thousand charming ways To celebrate this best of days , While hearts were held in sympathy By love 's encircling band . So multitudes together came , Like wandering magi from the East With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfect thing To satisfy a shivering frame Or amplify a feast . The angels had looked long and far The happy scene to parallel , When through the sanctuary door Were carried gifts from shop and store , The treasures of the rich bazaar , To give -- but not to sell . As once the apostolic twelve Of goods allotment made , So equity dealt out with care The widow 's and the orphan 's share , And of the aged forced to delve At drudging task or trade . Oh , could the joy which tears express That out of gladness come Be mirrored in its tender glow , Before the beautiful tableau Ingratitude and selfishness Would shrink abashed and dumb ! If every year and everywhere Could kindness thus expand In bounteous gratuity , To all her children earth would be A flowery vale like Eden fair , A milk-and-honey land . Mysterious . The morning sun rose bright and fair Upon a lovely village where Prosperity abounded , And ceaseless hum of industry In lines of friendly rivalry From day to day resounded . Its shaded avenues were wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Or marked by blocks of masonry That might defy a century To loosen from their stanchions . Its peaceful dwellers daily vied To make this spot , with anxious pride , A Paradise of beauty , Recounted its attractions o'er , And its adornment held no more A pleasure than a duty . But , ere the daylight passed away , That hamlet fair in ruins lay , Its hapless people scattered Like playthings , at the cyclone 's will , And scarce remained one domicile Its fury had not shattered . Few moments of the tempest 's wrath Sufficed to mark one dreadful path With scenes of devastation ; While over piles of wild debris Rose shrieks of dying agony Above the desolation . Oh , mystery ! who can understand Why , sudden , from God 's mighty hand Destructive bolts of power Without discrimination strike The evil and the good alike --  As in that dreadful hour ! Alas for aching hearts that wait Today in homes made desolate By one sharp blow appalling --  For all who kneel by altars lone , And strive to say " Thy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We dare not question his decrees Who seeth not as mortal sees , Nor doubt his goodness even ; Nor let our hearts be dispossessed Of faith that he disposeth best All things in earth and Heaven .

" Of all the precepts in the Book By word of inspiration given , That bear the import , tone , and look Of messages direct from heaven , From Revelation back to Genesis Is nothing needed half so much as this . Ah , well the great apostle spake In admonition wise and kind , Who bade humanity forsake The petty weaknesses that bind The spirit like a bird with pinioned wings , That to a broken bough despairing clings .

In deep despondency to pine , Or vain solicitude , Is to deny this truth divine That God is great and good ; That he is Ruler over earth and Heaven , And so disposes and makes all things even . Mount Vernon . Subdued and sad , I trod the place Where he , the hero , lived and died ; Where , long-entombed beneath the shade By willow bough and cypress made , The peaceful scene with verdure rife , He and the partner of his life , Beloved of every land and race , Are sleeping side by side .

What comfort , cheer , and kind intent The weary stranger oft hath known When she , its mistress , fair and good , Reigned here in peerless womanhood , When soft , shy maiden fancy gave Encouragement to soldiers brave , And Washington his presence lent To grace its bright hearthstone ! O beautiful Mount Vernon home , The Mecca of our long desire ; Of more than passing interest To North and South , to East and West , To all Columbia 's children free A precious , priceless legacy , Thine altar-shrine , as pilgrims come , Rekindles patriot fire !

Sometimes he drops his pretty head And seems to be dispirited , And then his little mistress says : " Poor Dickie misses his chickweed , Or else I 've fed him musty seed As stale as last year 's oranges ! " But all the time I wonder If we half comprehend In sweet song-words The thought of birds , Or why so oft their raptures In sudden silence end . They do not pine for forest wilds Within the " blue Canary isles , " As exiles from their native home , For in a foreign domicile They first essayed their gamut-trill Beneath a cage 's gilded dome ; But maybe some sad throbbing Betimes their spirits stirs , Who love as we Dear liberty , That they , admired and petted , Are only -- prisoners .

Buffets and gyves from your effete Old monarchy dilapidate , Or freedom 's laurels for thy brow ?

Like thee , meandering , yet wafted back From distant hearth and lonely bivouac , From strange vicissitudes in other lands , From half-wrought labors and unfinished plans I come , in thy cool depths my brow to lave , And rest a moment by thy silver wave . But , ah ! what means thy muddy , muggy hue ?

I shut my eyes ; ' t is all in vain --  The battle-field appears , And one among the thousands slain In manhood 's brilliant years ; An elbow pillowing his head , And on the crimson sand Syringa-blooms , distained and dead , Within his rigid hand . Could she foresee , who from the stem Had plucked that little spray Of flowers , that he would cherish them Unto his dying day ?

But with the morrow 's tranquil dawn , A fairy scene I looked upon That filled me with delight ; Far-reaching from my own abode , The world in matchless splendor glowed , Arrayed in spotless white . The surface of the hillside slope Gleamed in my farthest vision 's scope Like opalescent stone ; Rich jewels hung on every tree , Whose crystalline transparency Golconda 's gems outshone . Beyond the line where wayside posts Stood up , like fear-inspiring ghosts Of awful form and mien , A mansion tall , my neighbor 's pride , A seeming castle fortified , Uprose in wondrous sheen .

The apple trees ' extended arms Upheld a thousand varied charms ; The curious tracery Of trellised grapevine seemed to me A rare network of filigree In silver drapery . And I no longer thought it hard From favorite pursuits debarred , Nor gazed with rueful face ; For every object seemed to be Invested with the witchery Of magic art and grace . And , though a multitude of cares , Perplexing , profitless affairs , Absorbed the hours , it seems That on the golden steps of thought I mounted heavenward , and wrought Out many hopeful schemes . Thus every day , though it may span The gulf wherein some cherished plan Lies disarranged and crossed , If , ere its close , we shall have trod The path that leads us nearer God , Can not be counted lost . The Master of the Grange . The type of enterprise is he , Of sense and thrift and toil ; Who reckons less on pedigree Than rich , productive soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be --  His veins can ever spoil . And yet on blood his heart is set ; He has his sacred cow , Some Alderney or Jersey pet , The mistress of the mow ; His favorite pig is ( by brevet ) " Lord Suffolk " of the slough . To points of stock is he alive As keenest cattle king ; A thoroughbred he deigns to drive , But not a mongrel thing ; The very bees within his hive Are crossed -- without a sting . If apple-boughs drop pumpkins and Tomatoes grow on trees , It is because his grafting hand Has so diverted these That alien shoots with native stand Like twin-born Siamese . No neater farm a nabob owns , Its care his chief employ , To find fertility in bones And briers to destroy , Where once he lightly skipped the stones A whistling , happy boy . The ancient plough and awkward flail He banished long ago ; The zigzag fence with ponderous rail He dares to overthrow ; And wields , with sinews strong and hale , The latest style of hoe . The household @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classes with the minister , The rural pedagogue , And as a sort of angel-cur Regards his spotted dog . His wife reviews the magazines , His children lead the school , He tries a thousand new machines ( And keeps his temper cool ) , But bristles at Kentucky jeans , And her impressive mule . With Science letting down the bars , Enlightening ignorance , Enigmas deeper than the stars He solves as by a glance , And raises cinnamon cigars From poor tobacco plants ! By no decree of fashion dressed , And busier than Fate , The student-farmer keeps abreast With mighty men of state , And treasures , like his Sunday vest , The motto " Educate ! " Beyond encircling hills of blue , Where I may never range , This monarch in his realm I view , Of title new and strange , And make profound obeisance to " The Master of the Grange . " A Friend Indeed . If every friend who meditates In soft , unspoken thought With winning courtesy and tact The doing of a kindly act To cheer some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream , Then hardship but a myth would seem . If sympathy were always thus Oblivious of space , And , like the tendrils of the vine , Could just as lovingly incline To one in distant place , ' T would draw the world together so Might none the name of stranger know . If every throb responsive that My ardent spirit thrills Could , like the skylark 's ecstasy , Be vocal in sweet melody , Beyond dividing hills In octaves of the atmosphere Were music wafted to his ear . If every friendship were like one , So helpful and so true , To other hearts as sad as mine ' T would bring the joy so near divine , And hope revive anew ; So life 's dull path would it illume , And radiate beyond the tomb . The Needed One . ' T was not rare versatility , Nor gift of poesy or art , Nor piquant , sparkling jeux d'esprit Which at the call of fancy come , That touched the universal heart , And won the world 's encomium . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the rounded arm , The fair complexion 's brilliancy , If form and features shapely were Or lacked the grace of symmetry . So not by marked , especial power She grew endeared to human thought , But just because , in trial 's hour , Was loving service to be done Or sympathy and counsel sought , She made herself the needed one . Oh , great the blessedness must be Of heart and hand and brain alert In projects wise and manifold , Impending sorrow to avert That duller natures fail to see , Or stand aloof severe and cold ! And who shall doubt that this is why In womanhood 's florescent prime She passed the portals of the sky ? As if a life thus truly given To purpose pure and act sublime Were needed also up in Heaven . " Thy Will Be Done . " Sometimes the silver cord of life Is loosed at one brief stroke ; As when the elements at strife , With Nature 's wild contentions rife , Uproot the sturdy oak . Or fell disease , in patience borne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and worn , Of energy and beauty shorn , Death 's sweet release would claim . By instant touch or long decay Is dissolution wrought ; When , lost to earth , the grave and gay , The young and old who pass away , Abide in hallowed thought . In dear regard together drawn , Affection 's debt to pay , Fond greetings we exchange at dawn With one who , ere the day be gone , Is bruised and lifeless clay . O thou in manhood 's morning-time With health and hope elate , For whom in youth 's enchanting prime The bells of promise seemed to chime , We mourn thy early fate ! To us how sudden -- yet to thee Perchance God kindly gave Some warning , ere the fatal key Unlocked the door of mystery That lies beyond the grave . Then let us hope that one who found Such favor , trust , and love , And cordial praise from all around , For rare fidelity renowned , Found favor , too , above .

Of specious weight like tissue freight The snowflakes are -- in sparkle pure As the rich parure A lovely queen were proud to wear ; As volatile , as fine and rare As thistle-down dispersed in air , Or bits of filmy lace ; Like nature 's tear-drops strewn around That beautify and warm the ground , But melt upon my face . A ton or more against my door They lie , and look , in form and tint , Like piles of lint , When war 's alarum roused the land , Wrought out by woman 's loyal hand From linen rag , and robe , and band --  From garments cast aside --  In hospital , on battle-field The shattered limb that bound and healed , Or stanched life 's ebbing tide . I see the gleam of lake and stream , The silver glint in frost portrayed Of the bright cascade ; They bear the moisture of marshes dank , The dew of the lawn , or river bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frigid air , That strange alembic , crystallize In odd , fantastic shape and size Like gems of dazzling glare . Oh , of the snow such fancies grow , ' Till thought is lost in wandering , And wondering If portions of their drapery The angel beings , sad to see So much of earth 's impurity , Have dropped from clearer skies As snowflakes , hiding stain and blot To make this world a fairer spot , And more like Paradise . Monadnock . One summer time , with love imbued , To climb the mount , explore the wood , Or rove from pole to pole , Upon Monadnock 's brow I stood --  A lone , adventurous soul . Beyond the Bay State border-line A sweeping vista , grand and fine , Embraced the Berkshire hills ; Embosomed hamlets , clumps of pine , And country domiciles . Afar , Mount Tom , in verdantique , And Holyoke , twin companion peak , Appeared gigantic cones ; The burning sunlight scorched my cheek , And seemed to melt the stones . Beneath a gnarled and twisted root I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , And like an arrow seemed to shoot Adown the deep abyss . Beside the base that solstice day A city chap who chanced to stray Was shooting somewhat , too ; Who , when the nugget sped that way , His firelock quickly drew . While right and left he sought the quail , Or the timid hare that crossed his trail , Rang out a wild " Ha ! ha ! " That might have turned the visage pale Of a red-skinned Chippewa . The game was his -- for it made him quail ; He flung his gun and fled the vale , The mountain-dwellers say , As though pursued by a comet 's tail --  And disappeared for aye . Never Had a Chance Fresh from piano , school , and books , A happy girl with rosy looks Young Plowman wooed and won ; despite Her pretty , pouting prejudice , Her deep distaste for rural bliss Or countryfied delight . Romance through all her nature ran --  Indeed , to wed a husband-man Suffused her ardent maiden thought ; But lofty fancy dwelt upon A new " Queen Anne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . Her lily fingers that so well Could paint a scene -- in aquarelle --  Or broider plush with leaves and vines , No more of real labor knew Than waxen petals of the dew On native eglantines . Anon , with lapse of tender ways That emphasized the courting days , The housewife in her apron blue , As mistress of her new abode , By frequent lachrymations showed Her grief and blunders too . The butter-making , bread and cheese , The old folks difficult to please , The harvest hands -- voracious bears !  --  The infantry , a parent 's pride , By duos proudly classified : So multiplied her cares . The treadmill round of duties that Makes any life inane and flat , Without diversion sandwiched in , The drudgery , the overplus Of toil and trouble arduous , Were rugged discipline . What time for books and music , when The lambs were bleating in their pen , The chickens peeping at the door ; The rodent gnawing at the churn , The buckwheat wafers crisped to burn , The kettle boiling o'er ?

" Sorrow and Joy . In sad procession borne away To sound of funeral knell , Affection 's tribute thus we pay , And in earth 's shelt'ring bosom lay The friend to whom but yesterday We gave the sad farewell . But scarce the melancholy sound Has died upon the ear , Before the mournful dirge is drowned By wedding-anthems ' glad rebound , That stir the solemn air around With merry peals and clear . Within our home doth gladness tread So closely upon grief That , in the tears of sorrow shed O'er our beloved , lamented dead , We see reflected joy instead That gives a blest relief . A father and a daughter gone Beyond our fireside --  For one we loved and leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one in life 's sweet dawn Went out a happy bride . We gave to Heaven , in manhood 's prime , Him whose brave strength and worth Life 's rugged steeps had taught to climb ; And her , for whom a tuneful rhyme The bells of promise sweetly chime , We consecrate to earth . Thus each a mystic path , untried , Has entered -- God is just ! We leave with him our friend who died , With him we leave our fair young bride Who shall no more with us abide , And in His goodness trust . Oh , life and death , uncertainty , Bright hopes and anxious fears , Commingle so bewilderingly , That perfect joy we may not see Till all shall reunited be Beyond this vale of tears ! Watch Hill . Fair summer home peninsula , Enriched by every breeze From fragrant islands , wafted far Across the sunny seas !

In " mountain billows " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supremacy displayed Whose hands the waters keep . No sweep of waves , in broad expanse , With wild , weird melody , Shall thus an unseen world enhance --  " There shall be no more sea !

Proud caravansaries that compete In studied arts to please The multitude , with restless feet , From earth 's antipodes ! A motley company astray : The sojourner for health , The grave , serene , the devotee Of fashion and of wealth . Artistic cottages upreared In beauty , strength , and skill --  The happy , healthful homes endeared To lovers of Watch Hill ! A golden crown adorns the spot ; Forever blessed be The hand beneficent that wrought " A temple by the sea !

Glad paeans down the centuries With joy the world shall thrill : " The Lord , revered and honored , is The glory of Watch Hill ! " Supplicating . One morn I looked across the way , And saw you fling your window wide To welcome in the breath of May In breezes from the mountain-side , And greet the sunlight 's earliest ray With happy look and satisfied . The pansies on your window-sill In terra cotta flowerpot , Like royal gold and purple frill Upon the stony casement wrought , Adorned your tasteful domicile And claimed your time and care and thought . In cherry trees the robins sang Their sweetest carol to your ear , And shouts of merry children rang Out on the dewy atmosphere , But to my heart there came a pang That my salute you did not hear . I envied then the favored breeze That dallied with your flowing hair , Begrudged the songsters in the trees And longed to be a flow'ret fair --  Some favorite blossom like heartease --  Within your miniature parterre . O heart , that finds such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song and sunshine and perfume And all benign impulses -- go , I pray thee , dissipate my gloom --  And take in thy petitioner too ! " Honest John . " He was a man whose lot was cast , As some might think , in lines severe ; In humble toil whose life was passed From week to week , from year to year ; And yet , by wife and children blessed , He labored on with cheerful zest . As one revered and set apart , A quaint , unusual name he bore That well became the frugal heart ; While plain habiliments he wore Without a tremor or a chill At thought of some uncanceled bill . A king might not disdain to wear The title so appropriate To one who never sought to share Exalted station ' mong the great , Nor cared if on the scroll of fame Were never traced his worthy name . As bound by honor 's righteous law In strictest rectitude he wrought --  The man who calmly , clearly saw His duty , and who dallied not --  To garner life 's necessities For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brood protects As fledglings in their downy nest , Until a Power their flight directs From trial trips to distant quest , Through trackless zones of ether blue , For bird companions strange and new . But ere his babes from prattlers grew , Upon his knee or by his side , To womanhood and manhood true --  Too soon we thought -- the father died ; How could we know , when Death was nigh Those little wings were taught to fly ? Another name his boyhood knew , So seldom heard that lapse of years Had made it seem a thing untrue , Unmusical to friendly ears ; And thus his appellation odd His passport was where'er he trod . So long , on every lip and tongue As if by universal whim , To him had his cognomen clung , And like a garment fitted him , That angels even must have heard Of one , like them , in love preferred . And when he came to Heaven 's door , To Peter 's self or acolyte , The holy warder looking o'er , " ' T is ' Honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pilgrim spirit passed within Because his walk with God had been . Bushnell Park . Sweet resting place ! that long hath been A boon Elysian ' mid the din Of city life , ' mid city smoke ; Where weary ones who toil and spin Have turned aside as to an inn Whose swinging sign a welcome spoke ; Where misanthropes find medicine In peals of laughter that begin With ancient , resurrected joke , Or ready wit of harlequin ; Where children , free from discipline , Take on Diversion 's easy yoke . Fair oasis ! to view aright Its charming paths , its sloping height , Its beautiful and broad expanse , Must one approach in witching night When , like abodes of airy sprite Revealed unto the wondering glance , O'erflooded with electric light Than Luna 's beams more dazzling bright , Illumined nooks the scene enhance ; While zephyrs mischievous unite The timid stroller to affright By swaying boughs in shadow dance . The Capitol that crowns the hill Where Boreas sweeps with icy chill , A masterpiece of studied art Conceived by genius versatile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowded mart , And , like a kingly domicile , Its burnished dome and sculpture thrill With admiration every heart ; And strangers pause beyond the rill To view its grandeur , lingering still , And with reluctant steps depart . O Bushnell Park , memorial soil ! That marks success ( though near to foil ) Of one who with prophetic ken , With honest zeal and ceaseless toil , Opposed the vandal wish to spoil This lovely bit of vale and glen ; Who , ' mid discussion and turmoil Of adverse minds , did not recoil From vigorous stroke of tongue and pen ; And then , till passion ceased to boil , On troubled waters poured out oil And to his plans won other men . So when , fatigued and overwrought , In summer time when skies are hot We seek its verdant , velvet sward , Oh may we hold in reverent thought The debt we owe , forgetting not The spirit passed to its reward Of one whose giant soul was fraught With true benignity -- who sought To touch humanity 's quick chord With fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and being caught As inspiration from the Lord . At General Grant 's Tomb . Afar my loyal spirit stirred At mention of his name ; Afar in ringing notes I heard The clarion voice of fame ; So to his tomb , hope long deferred , With reverent step I came . The pilgrim muse revivified A half-forgotten day : A slow procession , tearful-eyed , In funeral array , And from MacGregor 's lonely side A hero borne away . Here sleeps he now , where long ago Hath nature raised his mound : A mighty channel far below , Divided hills around , Where countless thousands come and go As to a shrine renowned . With awe do strangers ' eyes discern A casket mid the green Luxuriance of flower and fern ; Airy and cool and clean , Unchanged from spring to spring 's return , This charnel chamber scene . His country 's weal his care and thought , Beloved in peace was he ; Magnanimous in war -- shall not The nation grateful be , And render at his burial spot A testimonial free ? Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is spent , To him , the silent soldier gone , Statesman and President , On Riverside 's majestic lawn Uprear a monument . " Be Courteous . " Ah , yes ; why not ? Is one more adventitious born Than others -- shekels richer , honors fuller , and all that --  That he can pass his fellows by with lofty scorn , Nor even show this slight regard -- the lifting of the hat ? Why prate of social status , class , or rank when earth Is common tenting-ground , the heritage of all mankind ? Except in purity is there no royal birth , No true nobility but nobleness of heart and mind . Life is so short -- one journey long , a pilgrimage That we can not retrace , nor ever pass this way again ; Then why not turn for some poor soul a brighter page , And line the way with courtesies unto our fellow-men ? To give a graceful word or smile , or lend a hand To one downcast and trembling on the borders of despair , May help him to look up and better understand Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rainbow there . Be courteous ! is nothing helpful half so cheap As kind urbanity that doth so much of gladness bring ; More precious too than all the treasures of the deep , Making the winter of discomfort seem like joyous spring . Be courteous and gentle ! be serene and good ! Those grand ennobling and enduring virtues all may claim ; Of each may it be said , of the great multitude : Oh that my life were more like such an one of blessed fame ! Is it that over-crowding , care , anxiety , Vortex of pleasure , the incessant round of toil and strife , Beget indifference , repressing love and sympathy , Till we forget the beautiful amenities of life ? Then cometh a sad day , when with a poignant sting Lost opportunities shall speak to us reproachfully ; And ours shall be the disapproval of the King --  " Discourteous to these , my creatures , ye have wounded Me . " A New Suit . The artist and the loom unseen , In textures soft as crepe de chine Spring weaves her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dotted , With furzy tufts like mosses fine And showy clumps of eglantine , With dainty shrub and creeping vine Upon the verdant fabric knotted . Oh , winter takes our love away For ashen hues of sober gray ! So when the blooming , blushing May Comes out in bodice , cap , and kirtle , With arbutus her corsage laced , And roses clinging to her waist , We crown her charming queen of taste , Her chaplet-wreath of modest myrtle . For eighteen centuries and more Her fairy hands have modeled o'er The same habiliments she wore At her primeval coronation ; And still the pattern exquisite , For every age a perfect fit , In every land the favorite , Elicits world-wide admiration . Gay butterflies of fashion , you Who wear a suit a year or two , Then agitate for something new , Look at Regina , the patrician ! Her cleverness is more than gold Who so transforms from fabrics old The things a marvel to behold , And glories in the exhibition . Why worry for an overdress , The acme of luxuriousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as lambkin fleeces ! Why flutter round in pretty pique To follow style 's capricious freak , To match pongee or moire antique , And break your peace in hopeless pieces ? O mantua-maker , costumer , And fair-robed wearer ! study her And imitate the conjurer So prettily economizing , Without demur , regret , or pout , Who always puts the bright side out And never frets at all about The world 's penchant for criticizing . The Little Clock . Kind friend , you do not know how much I prize this time-ly treasure , So dainty , diligent , and such A constant source of pleasure . The man of brains who could invent So true a chrono-meter Has set a charming precedent , And made a good repeater . It speaks with clear , commanding clicks , Suggestive of the donor ; And ' tends to business -- never sick A bit more than the owner . It goes when I do ; when I stop ( As by the dial showing ) It never lets a second drop , But simply keeps on going . It tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary ; When food with me is obsolete , I 'll be a reliquary . It tells me early when to rise , And bother with dejeuner ; To sally forth and exercise , And fill up my porte-monnaie . I hear it talking in the night , As if it were in clover : You 've never lost your appetite , You 've never been run over . It makes me wish that I might live More faithful unto duty , And unto others something give Like this bijou of beauty . It holds its hands before its face , So very modest is it ; So like the people in the place Where I delight to visit . Sometimes I wonder if it cries The course I am pursuing ; Because it has so many I-s And must know what I 'm doing . Sometimes I fear it makes me cry --  No matter , and no pity --  Afraid at last I 'll have to die In some far , foreign city . It travels with me everywhere And chirrups like a cricket ; As if it said with anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Companion of my loneliness Along my journey westward , It never leaves me comfortless , But has the last and best word . I would not spoil its lovely face , And so I go behind it , And hold it like a china vase , So careful when I wind it . A clock is always excellent That has its label on , And proves a fine advertisement For Waterbury , Conn . Those Yankees -- ah ! they never shun A chance to make a dime , And counterfeit the very sun In keeping " Standard Time . " Ah , well ! the little clock has proved The best of all bonanzas ; And thus my happy heart is moved To these effusive stanzas . Improvement . Along the avenue I pass Huge piles of wood and stone , And glance at each amorphous mass , Whose cumbrous weight has crushed the grass , With half resentful groan . Say I : " O labor , to despoil Some lovely forest scene , Or at the granite stratum toil , And desecrate whole roods of soil , Is vandal-like and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden-land , Let me consort with Cerberus , Be chained to crags precipitous , Or seek an alien strand . " But while this pining , pouting Muse The interval ignores , Deft industry , no time to lose , Contrives and carries , hoists and hews , And symmetry restores . Behold ! of rock and pile and board A modern miracle , My neighbor 's dwelling , roofed and floored , That rapid grew as Jonah 's gourd , And far more beautiful . The artisan 's receding gait Has brushed the chips away , Where innocence shall recreate , Or like the flowers grow , and wait The balminess of May . An arid spot , where careless feet Have long been wont to roam , Where cattle grazed , as if to eat Were life 's delicious , richest treat , Becomes a charming home . O man primeval ! hadst thou known , Ere rude hands scooped thy grave , Of Homestead Act , or Building Loan , Thou wouldst have quite disdained to own A rugged cliff or cave . And now I see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her breathing heart , And to the tissues torn impart A use and beauty new . And this improvement is , to turn The things which God has given To their best purpose , as we learn To make the place where we sojourn Homelike and more like Heaven . On Bancroft Height . On Bancroft height Aurora 's face Shines brighter than a star , As stepping forth in dewy grace , The gates of day unbar ; And lo ! the firmament , the hills , And the vales that intervene --  Creation 's self with gladness thrills To greet the matin queen . On Bancroft height the atmosphere Is but an endless waft Of life 's elixir , pure and clear As mortal ever quaffed ; And such the sweet salubrity Of air and altitude , Is banished many a malady And suffering subdued . On Bancroft height the sunset glow When day departing dies Outrivals all that tourists know Of famed Italian skies ; And happy dwellers round about Who view the scene aright In admiration grow devout And laud the Lord of light . Round Bancroft height @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's celebrities , Of him whose name it bears ; The scholar-wise compatriot Who left to later men The grand achievements unforgot Of that historic pen . Fair Bancroft height revisited When all the land is white , A halo crowns its noble head Impelling fresh delight ; The daring wish in winter-time The blizzard to defy Those shining slippery slopes to climb Up nearer to the sky . Though Boreas abrade the cheek With buffetings of snow , He gives a vigor that the weak And languid never know ; And with rejuvenescent thrill , Like children everywhere , Bestirs the rhapsody , the will To make a snow-man there . On Bancroft height and Bancroft tower Such vistas charm the eye ' T were life 's consummate , glorious hour But to behold -- and die ; Yet in the sparkle and the glow Is earth so very fair The spirit lingers , loath to go , And dreams of heaven -- up there . A Reformer . When I was young , my heart elate With ardent notions warm , I thirsted to inaugurate A spirit of reform ; The universe was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Was bound to set aright . My mind conceived a million plans , For Hope was brave and strong , But dared not with unaided hands Combat a giant wrong ; So with caress I sought to coax Those who had humored me In infancy -- the dear old folks --  And gain their sympathy . But quarreling with extant laws They would have deemed a shame Who clung to error , just because Their fathers did the same . I sought in Pleasure 's gilded halls , Where grace and beauty stirred At revelry 's impetuous calls , To make my projects heard . Then turned to stately palaces Of luxury and ease , Where wealth 's absorbing object was The master 's whim to please ; And spoke of evils unredressed , Of danger yet to be --  They only answered , like the rest : " But what is that to me ? " And even pious devotees Whom sacred walls immure Condemned me ( as by feeble praise )  --  What more could I endure ? Down by the stream , so pure and clear That sunbeams paused to drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brink . Thick darkness seemed to veil the day ; Beyond a realm of tears Utopia 's land of promise lay ; And not till later years I learned this lesson -- that to win Results from labor sure , " Reformers " always must begin Among the lowly poor . For they whose lot privation is And whose delights are few , Whose aggregate of miseries Is want of something new , The measure of whose happiness Is but an empty cup , For every novelty will press Alert to fill it up .
