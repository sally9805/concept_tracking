AS time passes and the period rapidly approaches when in the course of nature my tongue must be silent , and the pen drop from my fingers , it seems but right that I should record some of the thousand and one reminiscences of a somewhat eventful career which may concern others , and may in the future be conducive to the good of my fellow mortals . In June , 1840 , I graduated at the U. S. Military Academy at West Point , and in common with my classmates was granted a three months furlough to repair to my home to prepare for active service with my rpgiment in Florida . My home was then in the family of the Hon. Thomas Ewing , at Lancaster , Ohio . This family was large , occupying one of the best mansions of that ancient village , and among the family were two boys " cousins** of about eleven years of age , as bright and handsome as ever were two thoroughbred colts in a blue-grass pasture of Kentucky . Being myself a full-fledged graduate of the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. Artillery with a salary of *65 a month , all in gold , I could hardly stoop to notice these lads , but was informed that they were attending the select school of Mr. Lyons , an English gentleman , a classical scholar , uncle to the Lord Lyons who long represented Great Britain at Washington , and since has represented his country in Paris up to the time of his recent death . This teacher , Mr. Lyons , being a younger brother without estate , though with Oxford education , like many thousands of strangers , had come to America for a maintenance , working out the great unseen problem of life which often startles us with its results ; for I honestly believe that the bias given to the minds of Jim Blame and Tom Ewing , Jr. , at Lancaster , Ohio , in 1840-1 , by Mr. Lyons , has furnished us two of our brightest national luminaries. // Blame 's history from that time forth is well known to all who seek the truth , and I propose to limit myself in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to two , of his brilliant career . In 1846-8 occurred the war with Mexico . General Zachary Taylor commanded our troops invading Mexico from the direction of Texas , and General Winfield Scott those from Vera Cruz . Both campaigns were eminently successful , and both leaders were afterwards sought for by the politicians of their day as Presidential candidates . I believe the military world will accord to General Scott the higher war honors ; but General Taylor had been equally brave , heroic , and successful , and moreover possessed those personal qualities of patience , subordination , and honesty which always command popular applause . Therefore , although the civilian politicians had expected to profit by the Mexican War , the American people chose for their President in November , 1849 , General Zachary Taylor . At the time of his election he was a major-general in the army of the United States , which commission he resigned January 31 , 1849 , and was inaugurated President , March 4 , 1849 . He was then possessed of property in Kentucky , and a sugar plantation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son IRichard , who for a time was with his father in Mexico and at Washington , who afterwards settled in Louisiana and went off to the Southern Confederacy with the stampede of 1861 ; a daughter , Mrs. Ann M. Wood , wife of the eminent army surgeon , Robert C. Wood , and Mrs. Betty Bliss , wife of Major W. W. S. Bliss , then universally known amd respected as General Taylor 's most faithful military adjutant and private secretary . At that date , 1850 , Mrs. Wood was with her husband at Fort Mdllenry , Baltimore , and Mrs. Bliss did the honors of the White House in Washington , from March 4 , 1849 , till her father 's death . With them all I bad a more or less intimate acquaintance . Surgeon Wood attended General Taylor in his last fatal illness , but his great skill and kindness were unavailing , President Taylor died July 9 , 1850 , and his family afterwards became scattered . Long years passed , the " Great Conspiracy of 1861 " was hatched , and the Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found myself at Nashville , Tennessee , charged with a heavy load of responsibility , but I had plenty of good men to help me , // among them this same surgeon , Robert C. Wood , then promoted to be Assistant Surgeon-General , who had become an old nian , with a young heart and a big soul . He was posted at Louisville to receive , care for and professionally treat the hundreds and thousands of poor fellows doomed to drift to the rear in the mad onslaught then preparing . He met his responsibilities like a man , and his letters which I preserve are proof to me that this world is not as bad as represented . I went on , never saw him again , and only afterwards read in the Gazette that Assistant Surgeon-General Robert C. Wood died March 28 , 1869 , having served his country faithfully since 1825-full forty-four years . In the year 1873 General U. S. Grant was President of the United States . I was General in Chief of the armies of the United States , and James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All were resident in Washington , D. C. I was seated in my office at the old War Department , now destroyed and replaced by a better one , when my orderly produced the card of " Mrs. Wood , " widow of the late Assistant Surgeon-General , U. S. A. Of course I instructed him to show the iady in . She was deeply veiled , then not uncommon by reason of the many dependent widows and orphans who thronged the national capital to appeal for help . She , without unveiling , handed me a letter in the familiar handwriting of the venerable General David Hunter , asking me to befriend " the bearer . " Casting my eyes over it , I exclaimed , " What ! are you the widow of my old Surgeon-General Wood , and the daughter of General Zachary Taylor ? " " Yes , " she answered , raised her veil and revealed her features , then of an old lady , but beyond question the daughter of General Zachary Taylor . " Dear Mrs. Wood , what does this mean ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not know , but General Hunter , our steadfart friend , has sent me to you , " and she went on to explain : " When my husband died in 1869 , I supposed I had estate enough to satisfy my moderate wants . I went to Louisiana , took possession of the old sugar plantation , collected a few of the old slaves with promises of wages or shares , tried to make a living , but everything was out of joint . I then tried a lease with no better success . Now my daughter writes me from Austria that she is very sick and begs me to come to her . General Sherman ! I must go to my daughter , ud I have not a cent . My old friends arc all dead , and I know // not what to do . " I naturally inquired how much money was necessary ? She said a thousand dollars . I had not the money . General Hunter had not the money . How about your pension ? " When my husband died after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Mexican War , and the great C ivil War , I thought I could take care of myself and never asked for a pension , but now my child calls to me from abroad . " " Mrs. Wood , I am sure we can easily make up a case under the General Pension Law , which will give you $30 a month , but it can only date from the time of your formal application . " " What good will that do me ? " she exclaimed , " my daughter is calling for me now ! My passage across the ocean will cost $120 , and the incidental expenses afterwards will run up to a full thousand . " After a few moments ' thought I said : " Mrs. Wood , we must get a special bill , putting your name on the same list with that of Mrs. General Worth , Mrs. General Sumner and others , and have this special pension to date back to your husband 's death , viz. : March 28 , 1869 . This will require an act of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Louisiana ? " " Alas , none . " " What member from Kentucky ? " " Not one . " " Do you know anybody in Congress ? " " Not a single member . " " Do n't you know Mr. Blame ? He is the Speaker of the House , a fellow of infinite wit and of unbounded generosity ? " No , she had never met Mr. Blame . " Now* my dear Mrs. Wood , can you meet me this afternoon at the Speaker 's Room , say , at 4 P. st. , punctually ? " " I will do anything , " she answered , " that you advise . " " Then meet me at the Speaker 's Room , south wing of the Capitol , at 4 o'clock this evening . " Of course she did . I was there ahead of time , sent my card to Mr. Speaker Blame , who was in his chair presiding over a noisy House , but who , as always , responded quickly to my call . In a few words , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speaker 's Room across the hall , behind the " Chair , " where sat the lady , closely veiled . No courtier since the days of Charlemagne ever approached a lady with more delicacy and grace than did Mr. Speaker Blame the afflicted widow of Surgeon Wood , the daughter of General Zachary Taylor , a former President of the United States . After a few words of inquiry and explanation , he turned to me , and said : " Great God ! has it come to this , that the daughter of Zachary Taylor , and the widow of a faithful // army surgeon who served his country and mankind all his life , should be here knocking at the doors of Congress for the pitiful pension of fifty dollars a mouth ? " I could only answer " T is true , and pity t is t is true . " Turning to Mrs. Wood , Blame continned : " Your father was the first man I ever shouted for as President , and for you , his daughter , I will do all a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case my own . Do n't leave this city till you hear from me . " Finding I had touched the proper chord of his generous nature , I advised Mrs. Wood to return to General Hunter 's , and await the result . Blame escorted her to the stairway with many friendly expressions , returned to the Speaker 's chair , and resumed his functions . I did not remain , but learned from a friend afterwards the sequel . Blame sat in his chair about an hour , giving attention to the business of the House , occasionally scribbling on a bit of paper , and when a lull occurred he called some member to take his place and walked straight to Mr. Holman , the " Universal Objector , " saying : " Holman , I have a little matter of great interest which I want to rush through , please do n't object . ' " What is it ? " " A special pension for the widow of Surgeon Wood , the daughter of General Zachary Taylor . " " Is it all right ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American should blush that this thing could be . " " Well , " said Holinan , " go ahead ; I will be out of the way , in the cloak-room . " Watching his opportunity , James G. Blame , as a Member of Congress for Maine , got the eye and ear of the Acting Speaker , made one of his most eloquent and beautiful speeches , introduced his little bill for the pension of Mrs. Wood for $50 a month , to date back to the time of Surgeon Wood 's death ( about four years ) , which would give her about $2,400 of arrears and $600 a year for life . It was rushed through the House by unanimous consent , and Blame followed it through to the Senate and to the President , where it became law , and this most deserving lady was enabled to go to Austria to be with her daughter in her illness . I understand that both are now dead , and that the overflowing treasury of the United States is no longer taxed by this pension , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of unrecorded benevolence . Pensions are not always matters of legal contract but of charity , which blesses him who gives as well as receives ; and I of all men // fully recognize the difficulty of making pensions subject to the tender feelings of an executive officer ; but when I discover an instance illustrating the genuine feeling , no one should object to my recording it and printing it if need be . There is another phase in Mr. Blame 's character of which I , and I alone , can testify . The press of our country supposes that it controls public opinion and public events . Whereas in fact prudent men conceal their most important thoughts . Daring the Civil War the Northern press was not friendly to the generals who succeeded , but lavished flattery without limit on the " failures " and on our distinguished opponents . Well do I recall General McPherson 's exclamation a few days before his heroic death : " Sherman , why is it that our Ohio papers , especially those of Cincinnati , continue their abuse of Grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ohio , who surely are doing our very best ? " I could only answer that I did not know except that it was easier for the editors and reporters to fight battles in their safe offices in the North than among the rocks , ravines and rivers of the South . Yet we soldiers did eventually win the battle , and restored the country to its normal condition of law and peace . In peace , also , the press is generally hostile to whomsoever is prominent and positive . Let any man rise above the common level , and the cry goes forth , crucify him ! crucify him !  --  the same old story ! Nevertheless , I honestly believe the people of the United States to be a thinking people ; that the press chiefly records the gossip of the day , and that the future of our beloved land is safe in the custody of its good , industrious citizens . To be sure it sometimes requires an earthquake like that of 1861 to arouse them to serious thought . In the year of our Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nomination in Chicago for a presidential candidate of the Republican party . The press and people generally believed that Blame wanted it , and everybody turned to him as the man best qualified to execute the policy to accomplish the result aimed at . Still , abnegating himself , he wrote to me from Washington this letter : " Confidential , strictly and absolutely so . " WASHINGTON , D. C. , May 25 , 1884 . " Mi DEAR GENERAL : " This letterrequires no answer . After reading it file it away in your.most secret drawer or give It to the flames . // " At the approaching convention at Chicago it is more than possible , it is indeed not improbable , that you maybe nominated for the Presidency . If so you must stand your hand , accept the responsibility and assume the duties of the place to which you will surely be chosen if a candidate . " You must not look upon it as the work of the politicians . If it comes to you it will come as the ground swell of popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have refused to obey an order when you were a lieutenant in the army . If it comes to you at all it will come as a call of patriotism . It would in such an event Injure your great fame as much to decline it as it would for you to seek it . Your historic record , full as it is , would be rendered still more glorious by such an administration as you would be able to give the country . Do not say a word in advance of the convention , no matter who may ask you . You are with your friends who will jealously guard your honor and renown . " Your friend , JAMES G. BLAINE . " To which I replied : " 912 GARRISON AVENUE , " ST . Louis , Mo. , May 28 , 1884 . " HON. JAMES G. BLAINE , WASHINGTON , D. C. " My DEAR FRIEND : I have received your letter of the 25th , shall construe it a absolutely confidential , not intimating even to any member of my family that I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an answer I hope you will not construe one as unwarranted . " I have had a great many letters from all points of the compass to a similar effect , one or two of which I have answered frankly , but the great mass are unanswered . " I ought not to submit myself to the cheap ridicule of declining what is not offered , but it is only fair to the many really able men who rightfully aspire to the high honor of being President of the United States , to let them know that I am not and must not be construed as a rival In every man 's life occurs an epoch when he must choose his own career and when he may not throw off the responsibility , or tamely place his destiny in the hands of friends . Mine occurred in Louisiana , when , in 1861 , alone in the midst of a people blinded by supposed wrongs , I resolved to stand by the Union as long as a fragment of it survived on which to cling . Since then , through faction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been all my family and friends could ask . We are now in a good house of our own choice , with reasonable provisions for old age , surrounded by kind and admiring friends , in a community where Catholicism Is held in respect and veneration , and where my children will naturally grow up in contact with an industrious and frugal people . You have known and appreciated Mrs. Sherman from childhood , have also known each and all the members of my family , and can understand without an explanation from me how their thoughts and feelings should and ought to influence my action . But I will not even throw off on them the responsibility . " I will not in any event entertain or accept a nomination as a candidate for President by the Chicago Republican Convention , or any other convention , for reasons personal to myself . I claim that the Civil War , in which I simply did a man 's fair share of work , so perfectly accomplished peace that military men have an absolute right to rest , and to demand that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice of peace shall now do their work equally well . Any Senator can step from his chair at the Capitol into the White House and fulfill the office of President with more skill and success than a Grant , Sherman or Sheridan , who were soldiers by education and nature , who filled well their office when the country was in danger , but were not schooled in the practice by which civil communities are and should be governed . I claim that our experience since 1865 demonstrates the truth of this my proposition . Therefore I say that patriotism does not demand of me what I construe as a sacrifice of judgment , of inclination , and of self-interest . " I have my personal affairs in a state of absolute safety and comfort . I owe no man a cent , have no expensive habits , envy no man his wealth or power , no compli // 623 cations or Indirect liabilities , and would account myself a fool , a madman , an ass , to embark anew at sixty-five years of age in a career that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defalcation , the dishonesty or neglect of any single one of a hundred thousand subordinates utterly unknown to the President of the United States , not to say the eternal worriment by a vast host of impecunious friends and old military subordinates . Even as it is I am tortured by the charitable appeals of poor , distressed pensioners , but as President these would be multiplied beyond human endurance . " I remember well the experience of Generals Jackson , Harrison , Taylor , Grant , Hayes , and Garfield , all elected because of their military services , and am warned , not encouraged , by their sad experiences . " The civilians of the United States should and must buffet with this thankless office , and leave us old soldiers to enjoy the peace we fought for , and think we earned . With profound respect , " Your friend , W. T. SmIRMAN . " These letters prove absolutely that Mr. Blame , though qualified , waived to me personally a nomination which the world still believes he then coveted for himself . For copies of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but as a soldier I claim the privilege of unmasking my batteries when I please . In looking over my letter-book of that period I find one recorded aud dated two weeks before the Blame letter , which is to me more satisfactory than any other , aud therefore I embrace it in this article , which I want to be complete and final on this subject matter , viz. " 912 GARRIsON AvENUE , Sr. LotTIs , Mo. , May 16 , 1884 . " HON. M. C. BT:TT , Virogna , Wis . " My DEAR SIR : I infer from your letter of May 14 , just received , that you are one of those soldiers who served under me in the Rebellion , and that you entertain for me that most acceptable feeling of love and confidence which I value more than gold and riches . I also infer that you are a delegate to the Republican Convention to meet at Chicago early in June , to select out of the greatunumber of eminent and experienced men a candidate for President . " I am embarrassed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mar be uresented , and that as an American officer and citizen I have no right to decline-It is simply exposing myself to ridicule to answer declining what is not offered , and probably never will be ; and , as a rule , such letters are ignored ; but you are a Delegate , and , in my opinion , nave a higher title in being a member of that Army which made our Government permanent and most honored among the Nations of the earth , therefore entitled to an answer . " At this moment of time no danger or necessity exists which can make such a personal sacrifice necessary on my part . My brother , Senator Sherman , is fatly advised of my views , so is my neighbor , ox-Senator Henderson , who will be at Chicago as a delegate from Missouri , and both &amp;nould relieve me of any embarrassment , for t will not allow the use of my name as a candidate . I have a thousand reasons , any one of which to me is good and sufficient , and I claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of choosing for myself my own course of action in life . I do not want my old comrades to think me eccentric or unreasonanle , but to concede to me the simple privilege of living out my own time in peace and comfort . " ThiB letter Ia meant for yourself alone and not for the public . " With great respect , " Yours . &amp;c. , W* T. SirERMAN. " // In giving to the NORTH AMERICAN REVIEW at this late day these letters , which thus far have remained hidden in my private files , I commit no breach of confidence , and to put at rest a matter of constant inquiry referred to in my letter of May 28 , 1884 , I here record that my immediate family are strongly Catholic . I am not and can not be . That is all the public has a right to know ; nor do I wish to be construed as departing from a resolve made forty years ago never to embark in politics . The brightest and best youth of our land have been drawn into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Ocean of Time . My memory even in its short time brings up names of victims by the hundreds , if not thousands . Still American citizens should take an interest in public events , because with them resides the ultimate power , the " Sovereignty . " We have thrown overboard the old doctrine of the Divine right of kings , and substituted " The will of the people , " and the civilized world looks toward America for a solution of the greatest problem of human existence and happiness , good government ; this is only possible by watching jealously and closely the drift of public events . Thus far as a nation we have met every phase , colonial and national , military and civil , and in my judgment the people of the United States have in the past fifty years accomplished larger physical results than those of Asia in a thousand years or of Europe in five hundred years . I am equally convinced that our people in every section are more intelligent , more temperate , and enjoy more of the comforts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are well warranted in allowing the drift of public events to continue as now , as little disturbed by artificial obstructions as possible . T is true that " eternal vigilance is the price of liberty , " and citizens should and must watch the conduct of their chosen agents . Acts are substantial , words and professions are only idle wind ; none but men who have done well should be chosen to office . The worst men always pronuse most  --  and of all things the Nation should not be represented abroad by men who labored to destroy the Government . Again , the incident recently reported as having occurred at Richmond , Virginia , of displaying the Rebel flag in a procession to which Union men were invited , among them the venerable Andrew G. Curtin , of Pennsylvania , one of the famous war governors , who // to my personal knowledge has gone to the extreme limit of possibility to create a perfect reconciliation , was calculated to arouse feelings which it were wiser to allow to die out . We now have a common country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag . I was glad to receive from high authority the assurance that the affair had been greatly exaggerated . Still it is well to emphasize the fact that the Rebel flag went down forever at Appomattox , and can not be resurrected without protest , if not actual bloodshed . W. T. SHERMAIW.
