txt The spirit of the old Connecticut " Blue Laws " survives in Dr. LEONARD W. BACON , Mayor OSGOOD , and " twenty-four other prominent citizens " of the city of Norwich . Historians profess to have disproved the existence of any special code under the name of the " Blue Laws , " but they have evidently been deceived . If , in the year 1880 , the citizens of Norwich are forbidden to seek recreation and health . by a quiet sail on the Sound of a Sunday afternoon , we may with measurable certainty infer a state of public opinion in. the NewHaven Colony 200 years ago which would have made it a grave offense for a man to , kiss his wife or spank his child on the Sabbath . Dr. BACON , a New-England pioneer of the seventeenth century , transported by some caprice of nature into a day and generation with which he is not in sympathy , raises a discordant note of protest against a practice which seems to him a desecration of the Sabbath . A year ago this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday excursions of the steamer Ella from Norwich to Watch Hill . A week ago to-day he returned to the attack in his morning sermon , delivered before a union meeting of the three principal churches of Norwich ' . The Pastors of two of these churches were absent on their Summer vacations . It is not improbable that they were at Watch Hill , enjoying the health-giving surf and the invigorating sea breezes . Dr. BACON denounced the owners of the steamer Ella " in the most scathing terms , " we are told , " not only for violating the sanctity of Sunday in a flagrant manner , but also for aggravating their alleged offense by carrying women of known bad character , tolerating the sale of liquor on board , and thus promoting gross debauchery in connection with these pleasure trips , besides having bands of music to add to the secularization of the day . " - The pious Doctor did not content himself with denunciations . He drew up a petition to the managers of the Ella , and invited signatures . A brother Pastor declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with . its terms . A member of Dr. BACON 'S church remonstrated ' With him , and informed him that another petition " of a more temperate and less offensive character " was to be- put in circulation . The clergyman recalled his petition , therefore , and the guardianship of the holiness of the Sabbath in-Norwich was transferred to other hands . Another petition , or letter , signed by Mayor OSGOOD and " twenty-four other prominent citizens , " was presented to the managers of the steam-boat by the Mayor himself , " who , in a brief informal interview , expressed the sentiments of the best people of the community , and obtained a ready promise to abandon the Sunday excursions for the rest of the season . " Who are " the best people of the community " in this Connecticut city ? Do they dwell in close , small-windowed houses in the crowded quarter , where the streets are narrow and not over clean , where the blazing sun by day and the stifling heat by night torture grown men and women and burn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that the " best people of the communitt " inhabit such a Quarter . Surely , the poor man who works from sunrise to sundown on six days in the week would not petition against the privilege of a cool , delightful trip up the Sound . with his wife and children on the only day he could call his own . These poor folk know that the heat and foul air of the city are fatal to infant life , and they love their babies as fondly as though they were " the best people of the community . " They know , too , that a trip on . the Sound is cheaper than a funeral . Was it clerks and shop-girls who signed the petition  --  young men and women who have no home but a hall bedroom in which they all but suffocate these hot nights ? This can not be , for they would look forward to Sunday , with its breezy sail to Watch Hill , as the bright day of their lives . As the signers of the petition could not have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to conclude that they are the rich people who own and live in spacious mansions on . the Hill and along the shaded avenues . It is obvious that they would care nothing about the Ella and her trips to Watch Hill . Their houses are roomy and comfortable . They get pure and grateful breezes at home ; or , if they feel the need of sea air , they can go out on the Sound in their own or their friends ' private yachts , or they can pack their numerous and large trunks full of costly clothes and go to Newport , Narragansett Pier , Block Island , or some other fashionable resort . They are the " best people of the community , " and with light hearts and pious souls they sign away the liberties of the poor , vulgar , ignoble herd . This outburst of austere and sour-faced Puritanism is not a pleasant spectacle to contemplate . Mayor OSGOOD and the twentyfour " best people of the community " probably blame Dr. BAcoN for the violence of his language , but flatter themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of just-thinking men will fall more heavily upon them than upon him . He overreached himself through too much zeal , but his method was straightforward . They went to work with a smoothtongued , oily persuasiveness , and , being Deacons , pillars of the church , rich men  --  in short , the " best people of the community " ? they made the proprietors of the Ella feel that they were really malefactors . If these most excellent people disapproved of Sunday excursions , they reasoned , the LORD must disapprove of them , too . Mayor OSGOOD and his twentyfour fellow-pietists must base their objections to Sunday excursions to Watch Hill on precisely the same ground as Dr. BACON  --  that is , that they violate the sanctity of the Sabbath , that women of bad character are taken on the boats , and that liquor is sold . But the people who go on . the excursions must be somewhere , the bad women must be somewhere , and the liquor will be sold somewhere . It is the experience of this City , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the better of his judgment , that the Sabbath is much better kept by an excursion to the sea-side than by an idle day in the City . The public peace and the morals of the community in New-York gain to an immeasurable extent by the Sunday trips to Coney Island , Rockaway , and Glen Island . Do the " best people " of Norwich believe that their city will be more holy and righteous now that the Ella will be moored to her dock on future Sunday afternoons ? They have set up one law fox the rich and another for the poor . They de ? clare that all who do not think and . act as they do are godless and wicked . They can go to Watch Hill on week days , so they stay a1 home on Sundays , and declare that everybody else must do the same . Will they build a pillory in Norwich , cut off the ears of unbelievers , and burn witches ?                 @ @ @ @
