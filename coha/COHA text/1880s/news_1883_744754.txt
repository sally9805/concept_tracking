txt Secretary Teller has suspended Jenkins A. Fitzgerald , a pension claim agent of this city , from practice before the Interior Department for forcing the collection of fees in advance without an agreement on the part of the claimant4who had employed him . The scheme discovered was a new variation of one for which the Commissioner of Pensions some time since recommended that another of the Fitzgeralds be disbarred . The late device has been to send to those who had committed the collection of their pensions to them a letter informing them of the points of evidence still wanting in their cases and also inclosing a receiOt for the balance which would be due when the pension should be secured or for a portion of this balance . The whole was then sent to the claimants by express in a package marked C. 0 . D. These packages in size and shape were such as might readily create the impression that they were pension certificates , and they were in addition each prominently stamped " Fitzgerald 's Pension Agency . " Several of those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Commissioner of Pensions and the result was a prompt suspension of Fitzgerald . The former scheme in which the Fitzgeralds were concerned and for which the disbarment of N. W. Fitzgerald was recommended was also worked through C. 0 . D. express packages . To such of their claimants as applied for a new medical examination on which to base a claim for increased pension , or other blanks nteded in their case , an envelope containing these blanks stamped with the Fitzgerald agency would be sent with $10 to be collected . The claimant expecting a pension certificate would pay this charge only to find that he had been misled , if not swindled . The Pension Office , on investigating some of these cases , found instances where the greatest hardshins had been caused by the efforts or the poor to raise sufficient money to get one of these Fitzgerald packages from the express office . When N. W. Fitzgerald was confronted with the discoveries of the Pension Office he pleaded that it was his brother , the present offender , who had sent off these packages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had repriinanded him sharply . Now the same man has been caught again and stricken from the roll of attorneys before the Interior Department . His wife , who had applied for and been accorded permission to practice as a pension claim agent before the office under her maiden name , was also disbarred upon the discovery being made that she was Fitzgerald 's wife and was practicing under another name . Devices for swindling pensioners are on the increase at present . Tne publication of the lists of all pensioners ordered at the last session of Congress will give claim agents the address of every pensioner on the rolls , and circulars are already prepared and are being sent out , offering all manner of inducements to secure an increase of pension . The moment the dishonest agents receive any kind of a response they begin to ask for a small advance fee , in some cases as low as $1 , to cover postage and stationery , and the chief work from that time on is to collect the rest of the fee without regard to the progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
