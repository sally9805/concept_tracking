txt The production of M. Lalo 's new ballet , " Namouna , " at the Opera has thrown Gen. Skobeleff and Bismarck into the background for the moment , but a vague feeling of uneasiness is still noticeable in the utterances of the French press . Events across the Rhine are being watched with close attention here , and the utmost care is being taken to avoid giving Germany the slightest pretext for taxing France with the foolish intention of concluding an alliance with Russia and tempting fortune in another war in the wild hope of recovering Alsace and Lorraine . But despite this laudable prudence , an arrival is expected here shortly which is likely to revive the suspicions and bitterness of the German press . Our St. Petersburg correspondent telegraphs that Prince Demidoff de San Donato , Adjutant to Gen. Ignatieff , left St. Petersburg for Paris on Thursday on an important mission for the French Government . Just as he was about to start Ignatieff brought him his last instructions from Gatschina . The Prince will remain here only 48 hours . " Namouna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its production , has proved a complete failure . The scenario is unutterably silly , the dances neither new nor striking , and the music tar too serious for the lazy and blase public at the Opera . It is the first work that M. Lalo has succeeded in getting represented on the operatic stage in France , though he has been composing all his life , and is now 53 . Like most contemporary French musicians , he is a good symphonist , but a poor dramatie composer . his orchestration has a family likeness to Wagner 's and his melody is ofteh more elaborate than that of the German composer . M. Lalo is well known in the concert-room by his arrangements of his unpublished opera , Le Roi Dys , " which have been favorably received at the Conservatoire concerts , and his violin concertos are deservedly admired . On the night of its first performance " Namouna " was mercilessly hissed . Mlle. Rita Sangalli did her best to save it from failure , but in vain . Some idea of the profits made in Paris by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Thomas Evans is in the habit of leaving his money about so loosely that a faithless retainer was able to rob him of a trifle of $120,000 the other day , at his house in the Avenue Malakoff . The thief escaped to Brussels , where he has since been arrested . It appears that German spies are at work in France . One was caught by the French authorities at Brotteaux , near Lyons , this week . He described himself as a Captain in the German Army . His trunks , on being opened , were found to contain a number of plans , maps , and drawings of fortresses . The affair has not been much talked of , but it has , perhaps , been thought of the more . M. Perivier , one of the Directors of our lively contemporary , the Figaro , was the victim of a brutal assault recently at the hands of an individual named Le Sueur . He commenced proceedings yesterday before the Tribunal Correc tionel . The philosopher to whom we owe the famous saying " Cherchez la femme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a petticoat was at the bottom of that quarrel between Dumas and Jacquet , although it was ostensibly about a picture . It is well known that a great part of the works exhibited at the Salon every year find their way eventually to America . Several of the American dealers are already making the rounds of the Paris studios . One of them tells me that the Salon bids fair to be very poor indeed this season . Albert Wolff discussed the influence of American wealth on French art in the Figaroyesterday . Mr. Wolff thinks the influence is bad and tends to render art low and mercenary . Paris yesterday narrowly escaped a calamity almost as terrible as that which visited Vienna a couple of months ago . Four workmen were examining the gas meter in  --  the cellar of the Opera Comique at 5 o'clock in the afternoon , when , through some carelessness on the part of one of the men , the gas ignited , an explosion followed , and the basement of the theatre was instantly wrapped in flames . Help was happily soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extinguished . But for the gallantry of a gas-fitter , who braved almost certain death to turn off the meter , the whole building and the adjoining house would have been blown to atoms . The cornet player Levy made his debut last aight at the Folies Berg  --  res , and met with a most enthusiastic reception . He played three pieces , Les Rameaux , " " Sweet Sixteen , " and " Yankee Doodle , " all of which brought down the house . The Paris papers this morning publish an audacious circular , signed by the now celebrated Bontoux , announcing the formation of a new financial association under the name of the Societe de la Nouvelle Union . The circular , of course , holds out hones of the most roseate hue to the dupes to whom it is addressed . A group of speculative aristocrats who , with M. Bontoux , had helped to form the Union Generale , and so brought around one of the greatest financial disasters of our century , add a postscript to the document warmly recommending it to the investors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
