txt At every session of Congress the Committees on Commerce are besieged by delegations who desire the Government to build the great canals upon which much money has already been expended in making preliminary surveys . The proposed canals to connect the Mississippi and Lake Michigan , and extend across the Michigan peninsula frOna Lake Michigan to Lake Erie , which have been described in THE TIMES , are by no means the most costly or most formidable of these projects . For several years great efforts have been made in Baltimore to induce the Government to construct a ship canal from Delaware Bay to Chesapeake Bay across the great Delaware peninsula . The construction of this canal was one of the labors which the morning newspaper whose brief existence recently came to an end in Baltimore promised to undertake and accomplish . Many surveys of the several routes across the peninsula have been made by the Government , and one has recently been finished . The choice has been narrowed down to one of two routes . One of these , known as the Sassafras route , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few miles below Havre de Grace and Elkton . For a part of the way it follows the Sassafras River . The other route is called the Choptank route . It enters the peninsula at Cambridge , follows the Choptank River , and reaches Delaware Bay just above Cape Henlopen . The cost of a canal by either route would be many millions of dollars . A bill was introduced in the House yesterday providing for an appropriation of $1,000,000 to begin the work . Another canal which the Government is invited to build , at a cost of a little more than $50,000,000 , is the one for which surveys have been made across the Peninsula of Florida . In making surveys for this and other proj sets of the kind the Engineer Corps has done a great deal of hard work . From year to year the results of this labor are published with costly maps . and from year to year the delegates arrive and depart . The proposed canal in Florida would extend in a straight line from St. Mark 's , on the coast of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pinckney , on the St. Mary 's River . Senator Gorman , of Maryland , was recently reported as saying that if , in securing the construction of the Hennepin Canal in the Northwest , the Florida Canal in the South , and the Delaware and Chesapeake Canal in the East , the interests of one great section of the country were dovetailed with those of another , the processes required to secure the canals would be lifted above mere dickering and cease to smack of subsidy . At a recent conference between Maryland delegates and Maryland Representatives Mr. said that there was not so much chance of getting the money from the Government as might be supposed , and remarked that the Western members were not anxious to form such a combination as had been suggested . The delegates were asked whether the State or the city of Baltic ore would aid the construction of the canal by giving money , and the reply was made that the prospect for such aid was not good .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
