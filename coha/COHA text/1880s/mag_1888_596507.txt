THE WHITE COWL. a shadowy solitary valley of southern Kentucky , and besidc a noiseless stream , there stands to-day a great French abbey of white-cowled Trappist monks . It is the loneliest of human habitations . Though not a ruin , an atmosphere of gray antiquity hangs about and forever haunts it . The pale-gleaming cross on the spire looks as though it would fall to the earth , weary of its aged unchangeableness . The long Gothic windows ; the rudely carven wooden crucifixes , suggesting the very infancy of holy art ; the partly encompassing wall , seemingly built as though to resist a siege ; the iron gate of the porter 's lodge , locked against profane intrusion - all are the voiceless but eloquent emblems of a past that still enchains the memory by its associations as it once enthralled the reason by its power . Over the placid stream , and across the fields to the woody crests around , float only the sounds of the same sweet monastery bells that in the quiet evening air summoned a ruder world to nightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at midnight are heard the voices of monks chanting the self-same masses that ages ago were sung by others , who all night long from icy chapel floors lifted up piteous hands with intercession for poor souls suffering in purgatory . One almost expects to see coming along the dusty Kentucky road which winds through the valley meek brown palmers just returning from the Holy Sepulcher , or through an upper window of the abhey to descry lance and visor and battle-ax flashing in the sunlight as they wind up a distant hill-side to the storming of some perilous citadel . Ineffable influences , too , seem to bless the spot . I-iere , forsooth , some saint , retiring to the wilderness to subdue the devil in his flesh , lived and struggled , and suffered and died , leaving his life as an heroic pattern for others who in the same hard way should wish to win the fullest grace of Christlike character . Perhaps even one of the old monks , long since halting towards the close of his pilgrimage , will reverently lead you down the aisle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repose under the altar while his virtues perpetually exhale heavenward like gracious incense . The beauty of the region , and especially of the grounds surrounding the abbey , thus seems but a touching mockery . What have these inward-gazing , heavenward-gazing souls to do with the loveliness of Nature , with the change of season or the flight of years , with green pastures and waving harvest-fields outside the wall , with flowers and orchards and vineyards within ? It was in a remote corner of the beautiful // gardens of the monastery that a young monk , Father Palemon , was humbly at work one morning some years ago amidst the lettuces and onions and fast-growing potatoes . The sun smote the earth with the fierce heat of departing June ; and pausing to wipe the thick bead of perspiration from his forehead , he rested a moment , breathing heavily . His powerful legs were astride a row of the succulent shoots , and his hands clasped the handle of the hoe that gave him a staff-like support in front . He was dressed in the sacred garb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the furrows . His cream-colored serge cowl , the long skirt O w1nic'nwouNN *navetoucNcie* Vne grounA , *ha ( X been folded up to his knees and tied with hempen cords . The wide sleeves , falling away , showed up to the elbows the superb muscles of his bronzed arms ; and the calotte , pushed far back from his head , revealed the outlines of his neck , full , round , like a column . Nearly a month had passed since the convent barber had sheared his poll , and his yellow hair was just beginning to enrich his temples with a fillet of thick curling locks . Had Father Palemon s hair been permitted to grow , it would have fallen down on each side in masses shining like flax and making the ideal head of a saint . But his face was not the face of a saint . It had in it no touch of the saint 's agony - none of those fine subtle lines that are the material network of intense spirituality brooding within . Scant vegetarian diet and the deep shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hues of youth , noticeable still beneath the tan of recent exposure *o Vhe summer sun . Y*is caNm , sYea*y b'lue eyes , also , had the open look peculiar to selfunconscious childhood ; so that as he stood thus , tall , sinewy , supple , grave , bare-headed under the open sky , clad in spotless white , a singular union of strength , manliness , and unawakened innocence , he was a figure startling to come upon , picturesque to contemplate , profoundly interesting to study . As he rested , he looked down and discovered that the hempen cords fastening the hem of his cowl were becoming untied , and walking to the border of grass which ran round the garden just inside the monastery wall , he sat down to secure the loosened threads . He was very tired . He had come forth to work before the first gray of dawn . His lips were parched with thirst . Save the little cup of cider and a slice of black bread with which he had broken his fast after matins , he had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both weary and faint , therefore , he had hardly sat down before in the weakness of his flesh a sudden powerful impulse came upon him to indulge himself in a moments repose . His fingers fell away from the untied cords , his body sank backward against the trunk of the gnarled apple-tree by which he was shaded , and closing his eyes , he drank in eagerly all the sweet influences of the perfect day . For Nature was in an ecstasy . The sunlight never fell more joyous upon the unlifting shadows of human life . The breeze that cooled his sweating face was heavy with the odor of the won- // derful monastery roses . In the dark green canopy overhead two piping flame-colored orioles drained the last bright dew-drop from the chalice of a leaf . All the liquid air was slumbrous with the minute music of insect life , and from the honeysuckles clambering over the wall at his hack came the murmur of the happy , happy bees . What power have hunger and thirst and momentary weariness over the young ? Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beautiftil nature around him . His heart was like some great secluded crimson flower that is just ready to burst open in a passionate seeking of the sun . As he sat thus in the midst of Nature 's joyousness and irrepressible unfoldings and peaceful consummations , he forgot hunger and thirst and weariness in a feeling of delicious languor . But beneath even this , and more subtle still , was the stir of restlessness and tbe low fever of vague desire for something wholly beyond his experience . He sighed and opened his eyes . Right before them , on the spire beyond the gardens , was the ancient cross to which he was consecrated . On his shoulders were the penitential wounds he had that morning inflicted with the knotted scourge . In his ears was the faint general chorus of saints and martyrs , echoing backward ever more solemnly to the very passion of Christ . While Nature was everywhere clothing itself with living greenness , around his gaunt body and muscular limbs - over his young head and his coursing hot blood - he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding-sheet of his humanity . These were not clear thoughts in his mind , but the vaguest suggestions of feeling , which of late had come to him at times , and now made him sigh more deeply as he sat up and bent over again to tie the hempen cords . As he did so , his attention was arrested by the sound of voices just outside the monastery wall , which was low here , so that in the general stillness they became entirely audible . ii . OUTSIDE the wall was a long strip of woodland which rose gently to the summit of a ridge half a mile away . The woodland was but little used . Into it occasionally a lay brother drove the gentle monastery cows to pasture , or here a flock sheltered itself beneath forest oaks against the noontide summer heat . Beyond the summit lay the homestead of a gentleman farmer . As one descended this slope towards the abbey , he beheld it from the most picturesque side , and visitors at the homestead usually came to see it by this secluded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall , he would have discovered that the voices were those of a young man and a young woman - the former a slight , dark cripple , and invalid . He led the way along a footpath up quite close to the wall , and the two sat down beneath the shade of a great tree . Father Palemon , listening eagerly , unconsciously overheard the following conversation : " I should like to take you inside the abbey wall , but of course that is impossible , as no woman is allowed to enter the grounds . So we shall rest here awhile . I find that the walk tires me more than it once did , and this tree has become a sort of outside shrine to me on my pilgrimages . " " Do you come often ? " " Oh , yes . When we have visitors , I am appointed their guide , probably because I feel more interest in the place than any one else . If they are men , I take them over the grounds inside ; and if they are women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest . " " As you will do for me now ? " " No ; I am not in the mood for describing . Even when I am , my description always disappoints me . How is one to describe such human beings as these monks ? Sometimes , during the long summer days , I walk over here alone and lie for hours under this tree , until the influences of the place have completely possessed me and I feel wrought up to the point of description . The sensation of a chill comes over me . Look up at these Kentucky skies ! You have never seen them before . Are there any more delicate and tender ? Well , at such times , where they bend over this abbey , they look as hard and cold as a sky of Lnndseer 's . The sun seems no longer to warm the pale cross on the spire yonder , the great drifting white clouds send a shiver through me as though uplifted snowbanks were passing over my head . I fancy that if I were to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the petals of the white roses , finding them stiff with frost , and that the white rabbits would be limping trembling through the frozen grass , like the hare in The Eve of S . Agnes . ' Everything becomes cold to me-cold , cold , cold ! The bleak and rugged old monks themselves , in their hoary cowls , turn to personifications of perpetual winter ; and if I were in the chapel , I should expect to meet in one of them Keats 's very beadsman ,  - -  patient , holy man , meager , wan ,  --  whose fingers were numb while he told his rosary , and his breath frosted as it took flight for heaven . Ugh ! I am cold now . My blood must be getting very thin . " // " I do not discover thinness of blood in your description so much as a poetic imagination . " " At least the impression is a powerful one . I have watched these old monks closely . Whetherit is from the weakness of vigils and fasts or from positive cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their souls shiver as well . Are not their cowls the graveclothes of a death in life ? " " You seem to forget , Austin , that faith warms them . " " By extinguishing the fires of nature ! Why should not faith and nature grow strong together ? I have spent my life on the hill-side back yonder , as you know , and I have had leisure enough for studying these monks . I have tried to do them justice . At different times I have almost lived with St. Benedict at Subiaco , and St. Patrick on the mountain , and St. Anthony in the desert , and St. Thomas in the cell . I understand and value all the elements of truth and beauty in the lives of the ancient solitaries . But they all belong so inalienably to the past . We have outgrown the ideals of antiquity . How can a man now look upon his body as his evil tenement of flesh ? How can he believe that he approaches sainthood by destroying his manhood ? The highest type of personal holiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not true . The highest type of personal holiness is to be attained in the thick of all the world 's temptations . Then it becomes sublime . It seems to me that all the heroisms worth speaking of nowadays are active , not meditative . But why should I say this to you , who as much as any one else have taught me to think thus - I who myself am able to do nothing ? But though I can do nothing , I can at least look down upon the monastic ideal of life as an empty dead husk , into which no man with the largest ideas of duty will ever compress his powers . Even granting that it develops personal holiness , this itself is but one element in the perfect character , and not even the greatest one . " " But do you suppose that all these monks have deliberately and freely chosen their vocation ? You know perfectly well that often there are almost overwhelming motives impelling men and women to hide themselves away from the world-from its sorrows , its dangers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orthodox . I know that such motives exist , but are they sufficient ? Of course there was a time when the cloister was a refuge*from dangers . Certainly that is not true in this country now . And as for the sorrows and temptations , I say that they must be met in the world . There is no sorrow befalling a man in the world that he should not bear in the world - bear it as well for the sake of his own character as for the sake of helping others who suffer like him . This way lie moral heroism and martyrdom . This way , even , lies the utmost self-sacrifice , if one will only try to see it . No , I have but little sympathy with such cases . The only kind of monk who has all my sympathy is the one that is produced by early training and education . Take a boy whose nature has nothing in common WTith the scourge and the cell . Immure him . Never let him get from beneath the shadow of convent walls or away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bend him , train him , break him , until he turns monk despite nature 's purposes , and ceases to be a man without becoming a saint . I have sympathy for him . Sympathy ! I do not know of any violation of the law of personal liberty that gives me so much positive suffering . " " But why suffer over imaginary cases ? Such constraint belongs to the past . " " On the contrary , it is just such an instance of constraint that has colored all my thoughts of this abbey . It is this that has led me to haunt the place for years from a sort of sad fascination . Men find their way to this valley from the remotest parts of the world . No one knows from what inward or outward stress they come . They are hidden away here and their secret histories are buried with them . But the history of one of these fathers is known , for he has grown up here under the shadow of these monastery walls .. You may think the story one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there be found as long as monasteries rise and human beings fall . " He was anillegitimate child . Who his father was , no one ever so much as suspected . When his mother died he was left a homeless waif in one of the Kentucky towns . But some invisible eye was upon him . He was soon afterwards brought to the boarding-school for poor boys which is taught by the Trappist fathers here . Perhaps this was done by his father , who wished to get him safely out of the world . Well , he has never left this valley since then . The fathers have been his only friends and advisers . He has never looked on the face of a woman since he looked into his mother 's when a child . He knows no more of the modern world - except what the various establishments connected with the abbey have taught him - than the most ancient hermit . While he was in the Trappist school , during afternoons and vacations he worked in the monastery fields with the lay brothers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was finished he became a lay brother // imself . But amidst such influences the rest of the story is foreseen : in a few years he put on the brown robe and leathern girdle of a brother of the order , and last year he took final vows , and now wears the white cowl and black scapular of a priest . " " But if he has never known any other life , he , most of all , should be contented with this . it seems to me that it would be much harder to have known human life and then renounce it . " " That is because you are used to dwell upon the good , and strive to better the evil . No ; I do not believe that he is happy . I do not believe nature is ever thwarted without suffering , nd nature in him never cried out for the monkish life , but against it . His first experience with the rigors of its discipline proved nearly fatal . He was prostrated with long illness . Only by special indulgence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even now is not inured to the cruel exactions of his order . You see , I have known him for years . I was first attracted to him as a lonely little fellow with the sad lay brothers in the fields , As I would pass sometimes , he would eye me with all a boy 's unconscious appeal for the young and for companionship . I have often gone into the abbey since then , to watch and study him . He works with a terrible , pent-up energy . I know his type among the young Kentuckians . They make poor monks . Time and again they have come here to join the order . But all have *oon fallen away . Only Father Palemon has ever persevered to the taking of the vows that bind him until death . My father knew his mother and says that he is much like her - an impulsive , passionate , trustful , beautiful creature , with the voice of a seraph . Father Palemon himself has the richest voice in the monks ' choir . Ah , to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kegiiia / The others seem to moderate their own voices , that his may rise clear and uncommingled to the vaulted roof . But I believe that it is only the music he feels . He puts passion and an outcry for human sympathy into every note . Do you wonder that I feel so strongly drawn towards him ? I can give you no idea of his appearance . I shall show you his photograph , but that will not do it . I have often imagined you two together by the very law of contrast . I think of you at home in New York City , with your charities , your missions , your energetic , untiring beneficence . You stand at one extreme . Then I think of him at the other --  doing nothing , shut up in this valley , spending his magnificent manhood in a never-changing , never-ending routine of sterile vigils and fasts and prayers . Oh , we should ch* nge places , he and I ! I should be in there and he out here . He should belying here by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I have loved you , and winning you as I never can . 0 Madeline , Madeline , Madeline ! " The rapid , broken utterance suddenly ceased . In the deep stillness that followed , Father Palemon heard the sound of a low sob and a groan . " HE BENT OVER IT , REVERENTIAL , WELL-NH3H AVE-STRICEEN. ' // He had sat all this time riven to the spot , and as though turned into stone . He had hardly breathed . A bright lizard gliding from out a crevice in the wall had sunned itself in a little rift of sunshine between his feet . A bee from the honeysuckles had lighted unnoticed upon his hand . All sounds had died away from his ears , which were strained to catch the last echoes of these strange voices from another world . Now all at once across the gardens came the stroke of a bell summoning to instant prayer . Why had it suddenly grown so loud and terrible ? He started up . He forgot all priestly gravity and ran - fairly ran , headlong and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were being crushed beneath his feet . From another part of the garden an aged brother , his eye attracted by the sunlight glancing on a bright moving object , paused while training a grape-vine and watched with amazement the disorderly figure as it fled . As he ran on , the skirts of his cowl , which he had forgotten to tie up , came down . When at last he reached the door of the chapel and stooped to unroll them , he discovered that they had been draggled over the dirt and stained against the bruised weeds until they were hardly recognizable as having once been spotless white . A pang of shame and alarm went through him . III . ftVERY morning the entire Trappist brotherhood meet in a large room for public confession and accusation . High at one end sits the venerable abbot ; beside him , but lower , the prior ; while the fathers in white and the brothers in brown range themselves on benches placed against the wall on each side . It was near the close of this impressive ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from his face , looked sorrowfully around upon the amazed company . A thrill of the tenderest sympathy shot through them . He was the youngest by far of their number and likeliest therefore to go astray ; but never had any one found cause to accuse him , and never had he condemned himself . Many a head wearing its winter of age and worldly scars had been lifted in that sacred audience-chamber of the soul confessing to secret . sin . But not he . So awful a thing is it for a father to accuse himself that in utter self-abasement his brethren throw themselves prone to the floor when he rises . It was over the prostrate forms of his brethren that Father Palemon now stood up erect , alone . Unearthly spectacle ! He began his confession . In the hushed silence of the great bare chamber his voice awoke such echoes as might have terrified the soul VOL . XXXVJ. - 95. had one gone into a vast vault and harangued the shrouded dead . But he went on , sparing not himself and laying bare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden ; the listening to the conversation ; most of all , the harboring of strange doubts and desires since then . Never before had the word " woman ' been breathed at this confessional of devoted celibates . More than one hooded , faded cheek blushed secret crimson at the sound . The circumstances attending Father Palemon 's temptation invested it with an ancient horror . The scene , a garden ; the tempter , a woman . It was like some modern Adam confessing his fall . His penance was severe . For a week he was not to leave his cell , except at brief seasons of permission . Every morning he must scourge himself on his naked back until the blood came . Every noon he must go about the refectory on his knees , begging his portion of daily bread , morsel by morsel , from his brethren , and must eat it sitting before them on the floor . This repast was reduced in quantity a half . An aged deaf monk took his place in the garden . His week of penance over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work , and was sent to relieve one of the fathers in the school . Educated there himself , he had often before this taught its round of familiar duties . The school is situated outside the abbey wall on a hill-side several hundred yards away . Between it and the abbey winds the road which enters the valley above and goes out below , connecting two country highways . Where it passes the abbey it offers slippery , unsafe footing on account of a shelving bed of rock which rises on each side as a steep embankment , and is kept moist by overhanging trees and by a small stream that issues from the road-side and spreads out over the whole pass . The fathers are commanded to cross this road at a quick gait , the hood drawn completely over the face , and the eyes bent on the ground . One sultry afternoon , a few days later , Father Palemon had sent away his little group of pious pupils , and seated himself to finish his work . The look of unawakened innocence had vanished from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little while and , as though weighed down with heaviness , his head sank upon his arms , which were crossed over the desk . But he soon lifted it quickly , and with alarm . One of the violent storms which gather and pass so quickly in the Kentucky skies was rushing on from the south . The shock of distant thunder sent a tremor through the building . He walked to the window and stood for a moment watching the // rolling edge of the low storm-cloud with its plumes of white and gray and ominous dungreen colors . Suddenly his eyes were drawn to the road below . Around a bend a horse came running at full speed , uncontrolled by the rider . He clasped his hands and breathed a prayer . Just ahead was the slippery , dangerous footing . Another moment and horse and rider disappeared behind the embankment . Then the horse reappeared on the other side , without saddle or rider , rushing away like a forerunner of the tempest . He ran down . When he reached the spot he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creature whom his priestly vows forbade him ever to approach . Her face was upturned , but hidden under a great wave of her long , loosened , brown hair . He knelt down and , lifting the hair aside , gazed down into it . " Ave Maria / - Mother of God ! " The disjointed exclamations were instinctive . The first sight of beautiful womanhood had instantly lifted his thought to the utmost height of holy associations . Indeed , no sweet face had he ever looked on but the Virgin 's picture . Many a time in the last few years had he , in moments of restlessness , drawn near and studied it with a sudden rush of indefinable tenderness and longing . But beauty , such as this seemed to him , he had never dreamed of . He bent over it , reverential , well-nigh awe-stricken . Then as naturally as the disciple John might have succored Mary , finding her wounded and fainting by the wayside , he took the unconscious sufferer in his arms and bore her to the school-room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself of his great soft cowl , and , spreading it on the bare floor , laid her on it , and with cold water and his coarse monk'shandkerchief bathed away the blood that flowed from a little wound on her temple . A few moments and she opened her eyes . He was bending close over her , and his voice sounded as sweet and sorrowful as a vesper bell : " Do you suffer ? Are you much hurt ? Your horse must have fallen among the rocks . The girth was broken . " She sat up bewildered and replied slowly : A ' I think I am only stunned . - Yes , my horse fell . - I was hurrying home out of the storm . - He took fright at something and I lost control of him . What place is this ? " " This is the school of the abbey . The road passes just below . I was standing at the window when your horse ran past , and I brought you here . " " I must go home at once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting at a place not more than a mile away. ** He shook his head and pointed to the window . A sudden gray blur of rain had effaced the landscape . The wind shook the building . " You must remain here until the storm is over . It will last but a little while . " During this conversation she had been sitting on the white cowl , and he , with the frankness of a wondering , innocent child , had been kneeling quite close beside her . Now she got up and walked to one of the windows , looking out upon the storm , while he retired to another window at the opposite end of the room . What was the tempest-swept hill outside to the wild , swift play of emotions in him ? A complete revulsion of feeling quickly succeeded his first mood . What if she was more beautiful - far more beautiful-than the sweet Virgin 's picture in the abbey ? She was a devil , a beautiful devil . Her eyes , her hair , which had blown against his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; her form , which he had clasped in his arms , was the Devil 's subtlest hiding-place . She had brought sin into the world . She had been the curse of man ever since . She had tempted St. Anthony . She had ruined many a saint , sent many a soul to purgatory , many a soul to hell . Perhaps she was trying to send his soul to hell now - now while he was alone with her and under her influence . It was this same woman who had broken into the peace of his life two weeks before , for he had instantly recognized the voice as the one that he had heard in the garden and that had been the cause of his severe penance . Amidst all his scourgings , fasts , and prayers that voice had never left him . It made him ache to think of what penance he must now do again on her account ; and with a sudden impulse he walked across the room , and , standing before her with arms folded across his breast , said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have you crossed my pathway , thus to tempt me ? " She looked at him with eyes that were calm but full of natural surprise . " I do not understand how I have tempted you. ** " You tempt me to believe that woman is not the devil she is . " She was silent with confusion . The whole train of his thought was unknown to her . It was difficult , bewildering . A trivial answer was out of the question , for he hung upon her expected reply with a look of pitiable eagerness . She took refuge in the didactic . " I have nothing to say about the nature of woman . It is vague , contradictory ; it is anything , everything . But I can speak to // you of the lives of women : that is a definite subject . Some women may be what you call devils . But some are not . I thought that you recognized the existence of saintly women within the memories and the present pale of your church . " " True . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know so well the women of the world ? " " I have been taught . I have been taught that if Satan were to appear to me on my right hand and a beautiful woman of the world on my left , I should flee to Satan from the arms of my greater enemy . You tempt me to believe that this is not true - to believe that the fathers have lied to me . You tempt me to believe that Satan would not dare to appear in your presence . Is it because you are yourself a devil that you tempt me thus ? " " Should you ask me ? I am a woman of the world . I live in a city of more than a million souls-in the company of thousands of these women-devils . I see hundreds of them daily . I may be one myself . If you think I am a devil , you ought not to ask me to tell you the truth . You should not listen to me or believe me . " She felt the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a child who had earnestly asked to be told something that might wreck its faith and happiness . The storm was passing . In a few minutes this strange interview would end : he back to his cell again ; she back to the world . Already it had its deep influence over them both . She , more than he , felt its almost tragical gravity , and was touched by its pathos . These two young human souls , true and pure , crossing each other 's pathway in life thus strangely , now looked into each other 's eyes , as two travelers from opposite sides of the world meet and salute and pass in the midst of the desert . " I shall believe whatever you tell me , " he said with tremulous eagerness . The occasion lifted her ever-serious nature to the extraordinary ; and trying to cast the truth that she wished to teach into the mold which would be most familiar to him , she re-plied : " Do you know who are most like you monks in consecration of life ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . What are your great vows ? Are they not poverty , labor , self-denial , chastity , prayer ? Well , there is not one of these but is kept in the hearts of good&gt;vomen . Only , you monks keep your vows for your own sakes , while women keep them as well for the sakes of others . For the sake of others they live and die poor . Sometimes they even starve . You never do that . They work for others as you have never worked ; they pray for others as you have never prayed . In sickness and weariness , day and night , they deny themselves and sacrifice themselves for others as you have never done - never can do . You keep yourselves pure . They keep themselves pure and make others pure . If you are the best examples of personal holiness that may be found in the world apart from temptation , they are the higher types of it maintained amidst temptations that never cease . You are content to pray for the world , they also work for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most nearly perfect form that is ever attained in this world , love and sympathy and forgiveness ; if you wish to find vigils and patience and charity - go to the good women of the world . They are all through the world , of which you know nothing - in homes , and schools , and hospitals ; with the old , the suffering , the dying . Sometimes they are clinging to the thankless , the dissolute , the cruel ; sometimes they are ministering to the weary , the heart-broken , the deserted . No , no ! Some women may be what you call them , devils She blushed all at once with recollection of her earnestness . It was the almost elemental simplicity of her listener that had betrayed her into it . Meantime , as she had spoken , his quickly changing mood had regained its first pitch . She seemed to rise higher - to be arraigning him and his ideals of duty . In his own sight he seemed to grow smaller , shrink up , become despicable ; and when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alas ! too plainly now betraying his heart . " And you are one of these good wom-en ? " " I have nothing to say of myself ; I spoke of others . I may be a devil . " For an instant through the scattering clouds the sunlight had fallen through the window , lighting up her head as with a halo . It fell upon the cowl also , which lay on the floor like a luminous heap . She went to it , and , lifting it , said to him : " Will you leave me alone now ? They must pass here soon looking for me . I shall see them from the window . I do not know what should have happened to me but for your kindness . And I can only thank you very gratefully . " He took the hand that she gave him in both of his , and held it closely awhile as his eyes rested long and intently upon her face . Then quickly muffling up his own in the folds of his cowl , he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the embankment below and then reappear on the opposite side , striding rapidly towards the abbey . // Iv . ALL that night the two aged monks whose cells were one on each side of Father Palemon 's heard him tossing in his sleep . At the open confessional next morning he did not accuse himself . The events of the day before were known to none . There were in that room but two that could have testified against him . One was Father Palemon himself ; the other was a small dark red spot on the white bosom of his cowl , just by his heart . It was a blood-stain from the wounded head that had lain on his breast . All through the dread examination and the confessions Father Palemon sat motionless , his face shadowed by his hood , his arms crossed over his bosom , hiding this scarlet stain . What nameless foreboding had blanched his cheek when he first beheld it ? It seemed to be a dead weight over his heart , as those earth-stains on the hem had begun to clog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his familiar duties faultlessly but absently . Without heeding his own voice , he sang the difficult ancient offices of the Church in a full volume of tone , that was heard above all the rich unison of the unerring choir . When , at twilight , belay down on his hard narrow bed , with the leathern cincture about his gaunt waist , he seemed girt for some lonely spiritual conflict of the midnight hours . Once in the sad tumult of his dreams his outstretched arms struck sharply against some object and he awoke : it was the crucifix that hung against the bare wall at his head . He sat up . The bell of the monastery tolled 12 . A new day was beginning . A new day for him ? In two hours he would set his feet , as evermore , in the small circle of ancient monastic exactions . Already the westering moon poured its light through the long windows of the abbey and flooded his cell . He arose softly and walked to the open casement , looking out upon the southern summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Countless white roses , as though censers swung by unseen hands , waved up to him their sweet incense . Some dreaming bird awoke its happy mate with a note prophetic of the coming dawn . From the bosom of the stream below , white trailing shapes rose ethereal through the moonlit air and floated down the valley as if journeying outward to some mysterious bourn . On the dim horizon stood the domes of the forest trees , marking the limits of the valley - the boundary of his life . He pressed his hot head against the cold casement and groaned aloud , seeming to himself ; in his tumultuous state , the only thing that did not belong to the calm and holy beauty of the scene . Disturbed by the sound , an old monk sleeping a few feet distant turned in his cell and prayed aloud : " Seigneur ! Seigneur ! Oubliez la faiblesse de ma jeunesse ! Vive J*sus ! Vive la Croix ! " The prayer smote him like a warning . Conscience was still torturing this old man - torturing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had burned up within him half a century ago . On the very verge of the grave he was uplifting his hands to implore forgiveness for the errors of his youth . Ah ! and those other graves in the quiet cemetery garth below- the white-cowled dust of his brethren , moldering till the resurrection morn . They , too , had been sorely tempted - had struggled and prevailed , and now reigned as saints in heaven , whence they looked sorrowfully and reproachfully down upon him , and upon their sinful heaps of mortal dust , which had so foiled and clogged and baffled the immortal spirit . Miserably , piteously , he wrestled with himself . Even conscience was divided in twain and fought madly on both sides . His whole training had left him obedient to ideas of duty . To be told what to do always had been for him to do it . But hitherto his teachers had been the fathers . Lately two others had appeared - a man and a woman of the world , who had spoken of life and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pale dark hunchback , whom he had often seen haunting the monastery grounds and hovering around him at his work , had unconsciously drawn aside for him the curtains of the world and a man 's nobler part in it . The woman , whom he had addressed as a devil , had come in his eyes to be an angel . Both had made him blush for his barren life , his inactivity . Both had shown him which way duty lay . Duty ? Ah ! it was not duty . It was the woman , the woman ! The old tempter ! It was the sinful passion of love that he was responding to ; it was the recollection of that sweet face against which his heart had beat - of the helpless form that he had borne in his arms . Duty or love , he could not separate them . The great world , on the boundaries of which he wished to set his feet , was a dark , formless , unimaginable thing , and only the light from the woman 's face streamed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made his priestly life wretched - made even the wearing of his cowl an act of hypocrisy that was the last insult to Heaven . Better anything than this . Better the renunciation of his sacred calling , though it should bring him the loss of earthly peace and eternal pardon . The clock struck half-past i . He turned back to his cell . The ghastly beams of the // setting moon suffused it with the pallor of a death-scene . God in heaven ! The deathscene was there - the crucifixion ! The sight pierced him afresh with the sharpest sorrow , and taking the crucifix down , he fell upon his knees and covered it with his kisses and his tears . There was the wound in the side , there were the drops of blood and the thorns on the brow , and the Divine face still serene and victorious in the last agony of self-renunciation . Self-renunciation ! " Lord , is it true that I can not live to Thee alone ? - And Thou didst sacrifice Thyself to the utmost for me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have mercy , have mercy ! If I sin , be Thou my witness that I do not know it ! - Thou , too , didst love her well enough to die for her ! " In that hour , when he touched the highest point that nature ever enabled him to attain , Father Palemon , looking into his conscience and into the Divine face , took his final resolution . He was still kneeling in steadfast contemplation of the cross when the moon withdrew its last ray and over it there rushed a sudden chill and darkness . He was still immovable before it when , at the resounding clangor of the bell , all the spectral figures of his brethren started up from their couches like ghosts from their graves , and in a long , shadowy line wound noiselessly downward into the gloom of the chapel , to begin the service of matins and lauds . V. HE did not return with them when at the close of day they wound upward again to their solemn sleep . He slipped unseen into the windings of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abbey sent for the abbot . It was a great bare room . A rough table and two plain chairs in the middle were the only furniture . Over the table there swung from the high ceiling a single low , lurid point of light , that failed to reach the shadows of the recesses . The few poor pictures of saints and martyrs on the walls were muffled in gloom . The air was dank and noisome , and the silence was that of a vault . Standing half in light and half in darkness , Father Palemon awaited the coming of his august superior . It was an awful scene . His face grew whiter than his cowl , and he trembled till he was ready to sink to the floor . A few moments , and through the dim doorway there softly glided in the figure of the aged abbot , like a presence rather felt than seen . He advanced to the little zone of light , the iron keys clanking at his girdle , his delicate fingers interlaced across his breast , his gray eyes filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have disturbed me in my rest and meditations . The occasion must be extraordinary . Speak ! Be brief ! " " The occasion is extraordinary . I shall be brief . Father Abbot , I made a great mistake in ever becoming a monk . Nature has not fitted me for such a life . I do not any longer believe that it is my duty to live it . I have disturbed your repose only to ask you to receive the renunciation of my priestly vows and to take back my cowl : I will never put it on again . " As he spoke he took off his cowl and laid it on the table between them , showing that he wore a dark suit of citizen 's clothes beneath . Under the flickering spark the face of the abbot had at first flushed with anger and then grown ashen with vague , formless terror . He pushed the hood back from his head and pressed his fingers together until the jeweled ring cut into the flesh . " You are a priest of God , consecrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you say . You have made no mistake . It would be too late to correct it , if you bad . " " I shall do what I can to correct it as soon as possible . I shall leave the monastery tonight . " " To-night you confess what has led you to harbor this suggestion of Satan . To-night I forgive you . To-night you sleep once more at peace with the world and your own soul . Begin ! Tell me everything that has happened-everything ! " " It were better untold . It could only pain - only shock you . " " Ha ! You say this to me , who stand to you in God 's stead ? " " Father Abbot , it is enough that Heaven should know my recent struggles and my present purposes . It does know them . " " And it has not smitten you ? It is merciful . " " It is also just . " " Then do not deny the justice you receive . Did you not give yourself up to my guidance as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch near you in danger and lead you back when astray ? Do you not realize that I may not make light of the souls committed to my charge , as my own soul shall be called into judgment at the last day ? Am Ito be pushed aside - made naught of- at such a moment as this ? Thus urged , Father Palemon told all that had recently befallen him , adding these words : " Therefore I am going - going now . I can not expect your approval : that pains me. // But have I not a claim upon your sympathy ? You are an old man , Father Abbot . You are nearer heaven than this earth . But you have been young ; and I ask you , is there not in the past of your own buried life the memory of some one for whom you would have risked even the peace and pardon of your own soul ? " The abbot threw up his hands with a gesture of sudden anguish , and turned away into the shadowy distances of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Palemon in the deepest agitation . " I tell you this purpose of yours is a suggestion of the Evil Spirit . Break it against the true rock of the Church . You should have spoken sooner . Duty , honor , gratitude , should have made you speak . Then I could have made this burden lighter for you . But , heavy as it is , it will pass . You suffer now , but it will pass , and you will be at peace again - at perfect peace again . " " Never ! Never again at peace here ! My place is in the world . Conscience tells me that . Besides , have I not told you , Father Abbot , that I love her , that I think of her day and night ? Then I am no priest . There is nothing left for me but to go out into the world . " " The world ! What do you know of the world ? If I could sum up human life to you in an instant of time , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restlessness and passion is hurrying you . " All sweetness had forsaken the countenance of the aged shepherd . His tones rung hoarse and hollow , and the muscles of his face twitched and quivered as he went on : " Reflect upon the tranquil life that you have spent here , preparing your soul for immortality . All your training has been for the solitude of the cloister . All your enemies have been only the spiritual foes of your own nature . You say that you are not fitted for this life . Are you then prepared for a life in the world ? Foolish , foolish boy ! You exchange the terrestrial solitude of heaven for the battle-field of hell . Its coarse , foul atmosphere will stifle and contaminate you . It has problems that you have not been taught to solve . It has shocks that you would never withstand . I see you in the world ? Never , never ! See you in the midst of its din and sweat of weariness , its lying and dishonor ? You say that you love this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow her . Do you not know that you may be deluded , trifled with , disappointed ? She may love another . Ah ! you are a child - a simple child ! " " Father Abbot , it is time that I were becoming a man . " But the abbot did not hear or pause , borne on now by a torrent of ungovernable feelings : " Your parents committed a great sin . " He suddenly lifted the cross from his bosom to his lips , which moved rapidly for an instant in silent prayer . " It has never been counted against you here , as it will never be laid to your charge in heaven . But the world will count it against you . It will make you feel its jeers and scorn . You have no father , " - again he bent over and passionately kissed his cross ,  --  " you have no name . You are an illegitimate child . There is no place for you in the world - in the world that takes no note of sin unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you by all the years of my own experience , and by all the sacred obligations of your holy order , against this fatal step . " " Though it be fatal , I must and will take it . " " I implore you ! - God in heaven , dost thou punish me thus ? - See ! I am an old man . I have but a few years to live . You are the only tie of human tenderness that binds me to my race . My heart is buried in yours . I have watched over you since you were brought here , a little child . I have nursed you through months of sickness . I have hastened the final assumption of your vows , that you might be safe within the fold . I have staid my last days on earth with the hope that when I am dead , as I soon shall be , you would perpetuate my spirit among your brethren , and in time come to be a shepherd among them , as I have been . Do not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all needs you in this age and in this country . I have reared you within it that you might be glorified at last among the saints and martyrs . No , no ! You will not go away ! " " Father Abbot , what better can I do than heed the will of Heaven in my own con-science ? " " I implore you ! " " I must go . " " I warn you , I say . " " 0 my father ! You only make more terrible the anguish of this moment . Bless me , and let me go in peace . " " Bless you ? " almost shrieked the abbot , starting back with horror , his features strangely drawn , his uplifted arms trembling , his whole body swaying . " Bless you ? Do this , and I will hurl upon you the awful curse of the everlasting Church ! " As though stricken by the thunderbolt of his own imprecation , he fell into one of the chairs and buried his head in his arms upon the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curse had struck him in the forehead . These final words he had never thought of- never foreseen . For a moment the silence of the great chamber was broken only by his own quick breathing and by the convulsive agitation of the abbot . Then with a rapid movement Father Palemon came forward , knelt , and kissed the hem of the abbot 's cowl , and turning away went out . Love - duty - the world ; in those three words lie all the human , all the Divine , tragedy . vi . YEARS soon pass away in the life of a Trappist priest . For shade to shade will come too drowsily , And drown the wakeful anguish of the soul . Another June came quickly into the lonely valley of the Abbey of Gethsemane . Again the same sweet monastery bells in the purple twilights , and the same midnight masses . Monks were again at work in the gardens , their cowls well tied up with hempen cords . Monks were once more teaching the pious pupils in the school across the lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southern horizon , like a mortal vision of beauty never to return . There were few changes to note . Only the abbot seemed to have grown much feebler . His hand trembled visibly now as he lifted the crosier , and he walked less than of yore among his brethren while they busied themselves with the duties of the waning autumn . But he was oftener seen pacing to and fro where the leaves fell sadly from the moaning choir of English elms . Or at times he would take a little footpath that led across the brown November fields , and , having gained a crest on the boundary of the valley , would stand looking far over the outward landscape into imaginary spaces , limitless and unexplored . But Father Palemon , where was he ? Amidst what splendors of the great metropolis was he bursting Joy 's grape against his palate fine ? What of his dreams of love and duty , and a larger , more modern stature of manhood ? LATE one chill , cloud-hung afternoon in November there came into the valley of Gethsemane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the road towards the abbey , with the air of one who is weary and forgetful of his surroundings . His head dropped heavily forward on his breast , and his empty hands hung listlessly down . At the iron gate of the porter 's lodge entrance was refused him ; the abbey was locked in repose for the night . Urging the importance of his seeing the abbot , he was admitted . He erased a name from a card and on it wrote another , and waited for the interview . Again the same great dark room , lighted by a flickering spark . He did not stand half in light and half in shadow , but hid himself away in one of the darkest recesses . In a few moments the abbot entered , holding the card in his hand and speaking with tremulous haste : " Father Palemon ' ? - who wrote this name , Father Palemon ' ? " Out of the darkness came a low reply : " I wrote it . " " I do not know you. ** " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in the abbot 's voice , as he replied musingly : " There - is - no - Father Palemon : he died long ago . " " 0 my father ! Is this the way you receive me ? " He started forward and came into the light . Alas ! No ; it was not Father Palemon . His long hair was unkempt and matted over his forehead ; his face pinched and old with suffering , and ashen gray except for the red spots on his cheeks . Deep shadows lay under his hollow eyes , which were blood-shot and restless and burning . " I have come back to lead the life of a monk . Will you receive me ? " " Twice a monk , no monk . Receive you for what time ? Until next June ? " " Until death . " " I have received you once already until death . How many times am I to receive you until death ? " I beseech you do not contest in words with me . It is too much . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checked his passionate utterance , speaking slowly and with painful self-control : " I can not endure now to tell you all that has befallen me since I went away . The new life that I had begun in the world has come to an end . Father Abbot , she is dead . I have just buried her and my child in one grave . Since then the one desire I have had has been to return to this place . God forgive me ! I have no heart now for the duties I had undertaken . I had not measured my strength against this calamity . It has left me powerless for good to any human creature . All my plans were wrecked when she died . My purposes have gone to pieces . There is no desire in me but for peace and solitude and prayer . All that I can do now is to hide my poor , broken , ineffectual life here , until by God 's will , sooner or later , it is ended . " // " You speak in the extremity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life lies yet before you . In time Nature heals nearly all the wounds that she inflicts . In a few years this grief which now unmans you - which you think incurable - will wear itself out . You do not believe this . You think me cruel . But I speak the truth . Then you may be happy again - happier than you have ever been . Then the world will resume its hold upon you . If the duties of a man 's life have appealed to your conscience , as I believe they have , they will then appeal to it with greater power and draw you with a greater sense of their obligations . Moreover , you may love again - ahl Hush ! Hear me through ! You think this is more unfeeling still . But I must speak , and speak now . It is impossible to seclude you here against all temptation . Some day you may see another woman 's face - hear another woman 's voice . You may find your priestly vows intolerable again . Men who once break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them again , if they love again . No , no ! If you were unfit for the life of a monk once , much more are you unfit now . Now that you are in the world , better to remain there . " " In Heaven 's name , will you deny me ? I tell you that this is the only desire left to me . The world is as dead to me as though it never existed , because my heart is broken . You misunderstood me then . You misunderstand me now . Does experience count for nothing in preparing a man for the cloister ? " " I did misunderstand you once : I thought that ypu were fitted for the life of a monk . I understand you now : I do not make the same mistake twice . " " This is the home of my childhood , and you turn me away ? " " You went away yourself , in the name of conscience and of your own passion . " " This is the house of God , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them open of your own selfwill . " Hitherto the abbot had spoken for duty , for his church , for the inviolable sanctity of his order . Against these high claims all the pent-up tenderness of his heart had weighed as nothing . But now as the young man , having fixed a long look upon his face , turned silently away towards the door , with outstretched arms he tottered after him and cried out in broken tones : " Stop ! Stop , I pray you ! You are ill . You are free to remain here a guest . No one was ever refused shelter-O my God ! what have I done ? " Father Palemon had reeled and fallen fainting in the doorway . IN this life , from earliest childhood , we are trained by merciful degrees to brave its many sorrows . We begin with those of infancy , which , Heaven knows , at the time seem grievous enough to be borne . As we grow older we somehow also grow stronger , until through the discipline of many little sufferings we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rush down upon us in maturer years . Even thus fortified , there are some of us on whom these fall only to overwhelm . But Father Palemon . Unnaturally shielded by the cloister up to that period of young manhood when feeling is deepest and fortitude least , he had suddenly appeared upon the world 's stage only to enact one of the greatest scenes in the human tragedy - that scene wherein the perfect ecstasy of love by one swift mortal transition becomes the perfect agony of loss . What wonder if he had staggered blindly , and if , trailing the habiliments of his sorrow , he had sought to return to the only place that was embalmed in his memory , as a peaceful haven for the shipwrecked ? But even this quiet port was denied him . INTO the awful death-chamber of the abbey they bore him one midnight some weeks later . The tension of physical powers during the days of his suspense and suffering , followed by the shock of his rejection , had touched those former well-nigh fatal ravages that had prostrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dying . The delirium of his fever had passed away , and with a clear , dark , sorrowful eye he watched them prepare for the last agony . On the bare floor of the death-chamber they sprinkled consecrated ashes in the form of a cross . Over these they scattered straw , and over the straw they drew a coarse serge cloth . This was his death-bed - a sign that in the last hour he was admitted once more to the fellowship of his order . From the low couch on which he lay he looked at it . Then he made a sign to the abbot , in the mute language of the brotherhood . The abbot repeated it to one of the attendant fathers , who withdrew and soon returned , bringing a white cowl . Lifting aside the serge cloth , he spread the cowl over the blessed cinders and straw . Father Palemon 's request had been that he might die upon his cowl , and on this they now stretched his poor emaciated body , his cold feet just touching the old earth-stains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite still , with closed eyes . Then he turned them upon the abbot and the monks who were kneeling in prayer around him , and said , in a voice of great and gentle dignity : // " My father - my brethren , have I your full forgiveness ? " With sobs they bowed themselves around him . After this he received the crucifix , tenderly embracing it , and then lay still again , as if awaiting death . But finally he turned over on one side , and , raising himself on one forearm , sought with the hand of the other among the folds of his cowl until he found a small blood-stain now faint upon its bosom . Then he lay down again , pressing his cheek against it ; and thus the second time a monk , but even in death a lover , he breathed out his spirit with a faint whisper- " Madeline ! " And as he lay on the floor , so now he lies in the dim cemetery garth outside , wrapped from head to foot in his cowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . fames La ie A/len.
