txt The caucus of Republican Senators which meets to-day or to-morrow , to consider the programme of the executive sessions , which , in a general way , have been determined on , may very- profitably take up another feature of the political situation . Up to the present time the Republicans have stood very firm for the right to name the officers of the Senate . For various reasons , some of them not so ingenuous , it now appears , as they have been represented , great importance has been attached to this right . It will undoubtedly be secured , sooner or later , either at the extra session or at the regular one . The Republican Senators should understand that a right so conspicuously and so obstinately claimed must carry with it a corresponding responsibility . It will be of quite as much importance how it is exercised as that it should be exercised by the majority . And it will be a very poor use to make of it to elect Mr. GORHAM Secretary of the Senate . Whatever motives may have induced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are very much stronger motives why he should now be dropped . It will hardly be maintained that among the possible Republican candidates Mr. GORHAM is the only one capable of performing the duties of the office . He has experience and capacity , and made a very creditable record , we believe , in his previous term . But he is no more competent than any one of a hundred who might be named , and if the Republicans were content to take a new man in Capt . RIDDLEBERGER f Or Sergeant - at - Arms , they can as readily and properly find a new man for the place to which Mr. GORHAM aspires . The latter gentleman , it is understood , represents , in some undefined manner , jointly with Capt . RIDDLEBERGER , the wishes of Senator MAHONE . But we do not understand that Senator MAHONE makes his co-operation with the Republicans condi-. tional on the retention of Mr. GORHAM . If he did , that would be no reason for adhering to Mr. GORHAM under existing circumstances . The Republicans can much better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can afford to continue in so conspicuous a position the most prominent apologist of the star route frauds . Whatever else Mr. GORHA3I may be , this is the character in which he is now , by his own choice , most generally recognized throughout the country . No possible claim to consideration that he may possess can outweigh the scandal of this fact . In truth , however , Mr. GORHAM has no special claim to Republican favors . He has been a very active politician , but , according to even the politician 's standard of merit , he has been amply rewarded . Probably he would himself disown that his present position is " due " to him in any sense that forbids the party from putting up another candidate , now that he has seen fit to make his own nomination obviously unfit to stand by . Moreover , though he now identifies himself with what are known as the " stalwarts " of the party , it is but a short time since he worked actively for the Democrats in his adopted State of California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not ask that the party should cling to a nomination which has become indefensible and injurious . It he bad the assurance to ask it , the majority in the Senate can not afford to accede to the request . The frauds in the Post Office Department are a much more serious matter than any possible offense to Mr. GORHAM or to his friends , no matter who these may be , including the new Senator Lfrom Virginia . They have occurred under successive Republican Administrations . A Republican Administration has finally undertaken to expose them , clean out the guilty officials , and bring them to justice . As far as Mr. GARFIELD and his Cabinet are concerned , their action has been prompt and manly , and bids fair to be thorough . So far as concerns the party , however , it is but too tardy . Doubtless there are Democrats in the ring , and a Democratic Congress failed , on presentation of the facts , to apply a summary remedy . But the remedy should not have been left to them . The responsibility for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Executive ? with the President and Postmaster-General , who have all along been Republicans . The Republican Party was only too clearly identified with the whole miserable system , and the great body of the ? party are heartily ashamed of it . They regard the work of the present Administration as in every way worthy of the most cordial support , and as opening the only possible way for ridding the party of responsibility for a most scandalous and outrageous swindle . Mr. GORHAM , through the paper of which he is the editor , has not only defended the men guilty of this swindle , but has attacked first the President and then the PostmasterGeneral in a particularly offensive and contemptible manner . He may consider that in doing so he is only discharging his duty to his employer , the head of the star route conspiracy . That is a matter for them to settle between them . But the further support of Mr. GORHAM as a candidate for the chief office in the gift of the Senate is a matter for Senators to consider as relating to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the honor of the public service . It is to be hoped that they will take the earliest opportunity to " unload " Mr. GORHAM . They can not do less with a decent regard for their most obvious responsibilities .
