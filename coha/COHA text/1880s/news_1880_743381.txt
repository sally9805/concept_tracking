txt The number and variety of possible Presidential candidates with which the Democratic Party is furnished must be really embarrassing . Whether it arises from the fact that to the Democratic mind it does not require much of a man to be entitled to that distinction , or whether it is due to a lack of fixed principles or purposes beyond that of somehow or other getting control of the National Administration , we will not undertake to say . There is a pic ? turesque diversity of " views " prevalent in the party regarding all questions of policy , though there appear to be none which the possessors would not willingly dispense with for the sake of being a candidate , but those who have no hope of such a distinction are more or less tenacious of certain opinions , and that renders them less accommodating than their leaders . Most Democrats consider the war and all its consequences , especially its consequences , as a calamity , the results of which they are anxious to undo , but over and above all is the intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acceptance whose nomination would give tolerable assurance of that . His present position matters little , if only he can be elected . That point gained , the Democrats would work their will with the Government , and the President would have no personal opinions likely to stand in the way . They have made many experiments with candidates since 1864 , with this one object in view . They tried a Union soldier who was supposed to be for peace . ? They ventured upon a civic statesman who , rightly or wrongly , was considered an opponent of the war and all its results . They resorted to a Republican who had been a Radical of Radicals , and then they reverted to a Democrat of the extreme type of the old days , all in vain ; and the question now is , What shall they try next ? The strength of the party is once more in the South , and what says the South on the subject of candidates 7 It loses no occasion to remark that it wants no more of TILDEN , and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things in the world , for a Union soldier . It has had little occasion to love the Union soldier unless from the instinct of the spaniel that fawns on the hand that scourges him , but it has doubtless bethought itself that herein lies the best chance of success . And when it makes up its mind for a Union soldier the choice is simplified amazingly . As Mr. STANLEY MATTHEWS says . the Southern people have found but one who will let them vote for him . MCCLELLAN might not object , but he long since ceased to be available . But there is HANCOCK , a real soldier , whose arms have " used their ? dearest action in the tented field . " He is a soldier and nothing but a soldier , and , unneeowatably enough , he is a Democrat . There has been objection to retaining the military men in polities , but here is a military man who is absolutely nothing else , and on him the South has fixed its loyal affections . HANCOCK was never suspected of statesmanship , and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with opinions on any one subject involved in the great questions of policy awaiting solution . He has had no experience whatever in civil administration , and so his one qualification is to be fouud in his service in helping to put down the rebellion . This makes the alleged Southern preference for him the more difficult to account for . unless it is supposed that he would have peculiar strength in the North which would make it possible to put him in the Presidential chair , where his innocence of statesmanship would render it easier for others to do the governing . We remember but one incident , and that a small one , in Gen. HANCOCK 'S career which could furnish the suggestion of using him for a candidate . He was sent to New-Orleans to direct the execution of the Reconstruction acts and failed . He was unwilling to execute the orders sent from Washington by Gen. GRANT , and asked to be relieved from the command with some display of dudgeon . It was a small matter , but it may have won the affections . of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken a fancy for a Union soldier , HANCOCK is their man . There is no doubt that the North has an attachment for Union soldiers , but it does not prevail largely among Democrats , and it has a cherished principle ? on which to rest . The Northern people do not object to a soldier , but they want something more . They want his name to stand for the . great cause of the Union and the idea of nationality , and if he has known convictions and is not without administrative experience , they consider that an advantage rather than otherwise . If a ' Union soldier is to be selected , they have a preference , and are ready to offer one for Southern acceptance . As the North sustained the Union cause , and the South notoriously did not , the proffer should . properly come from this direction , and then its acceptance would mean something . If the South really desires to give evidence of a sincere conversion , and afford assurance of a real acceptance of the triumph of national authority and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not do better . than support ' a Union soldier for the Presidency , but it should be one whose name carries with it the significance of all they profess to be ready to accept .
