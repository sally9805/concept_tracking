txt In submitting his last annual message to Congress President ARTHUR does little more than make a summary statement of the condition . of our foreign relations , which are entirely peaceful ; call attention to the information and recommendations contained in the department reports , which , for the most part , receive his approval , and give prominence and emgDasis to certain matters of policy by suggestions of his own . He enters into no elaborate . discussion of any single question and discharges his task in a somewhat perfunctory spirit . The . most prominent features of the message are those which relate to coast defenses , the rebuilding of the navy , and the encouragement of foreign trade and American shipping . While we are at peace and on friendly terms with all nations , the President is impressed with the fact that if any unforeseen exigency were to bring upon us the hostility of any great power we should be found in a comparatively defenseless condition . The great cities on our long line of seacoast are practically unprotected . While a policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best defense , we can not remain careless of the fact that in case of aggression the seaports where great wealth and great interests are centred lie open to attacks which we should have no adequate means of resisting . The President is of the opinion that our most important cities , whose destruction or capture would be a national humiliation , might be put in a state of adequate defense by the gradual expenditure of $60,000,000 , one-tenth of which is asked for to begin the work . He is equally assured that the navy should be as rapidly as possible restored to the " high state of efficien2y which formerly characterized it . " His plan for promoting foreign commerce and building up a merchant marine is somewhat peculiar . His main idea is to foster commercial relations with the other countries of this continent by a series of reciprocal treaties which shall facilitate the interchange of commodities so far as they are carried under the flags of the parties to the contracts . That is to say , there shall be a favorable tariff arrangement with Brazil or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other vexations , provided the trade with those countries is carried on in their own vessels or those of the United States . The limitations of this policy would be likely to counteract its benefits so far as American shipping is concerned , for so long as our merchants can not buy foreign ships and those built here continue , to be costly the tendency would be to put the carrying trade nominally into the hands of . the , other ' 4 , party and really ! into . those of . European , capitalists who would get their ? vessels - Lunder South 4 American colors. : But the President suggests as one feat : ure of ? his scheme the .. " enactment of measures to favor the conotruction . and maintenance of a : steam carrying marine hunder ? the ) flag ' : of- the , ... United States . " .1 What measures are necessary . for that purpose he " does not specify . It would be simpler to deal with these two entirely different questions of foreign trade relations and American shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries would be a good one if it were practicable , but the notion that it would serve the purpose of affording a profitable market far our gold and silver products is chimerical . Foreign countries with which we trade will take those products according to their needs or the advantages to be gained , re , gardless of the form into which they are put . Among the minor suggestions of the President those in favor of international copyright , the amendment of the naturalization laws , the improvement of the Consular Service , the passage of a bankrupt law , and provision agaisst the introduction of cholera are worthy of special attention . He touches very briefly on an important subject when he suggests that measures should be taken to prevent the preparation , on our soil , for criminal acts to be carried out in other lands , such , for instance , as the shipping of dynamite and infernal machines to destroy lives and property in countries with which vir . e are on terms of peace and amity . In referring to the polygamy question he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Territory of Utah , and govern it through a commission . The President deserves a word of commendation for the tone of his reference to the subject of civil service reform . He cordially recognizes the benefits that have already been wrought . The good results ' expected from the new system have been " more than realized . " It has fully answered the expectations of its friends " in securing competent and faithful public servants , and in protecting the appointing officers of the Government from the pressure of personal importunity and from the labor of examining the claims and pretensions of rival candidates for public employment . " He declares that the law has had the unqualified support of the President and the heads of departments , and that . the Commissioners have performed their duties with zeal and fidelity , and he speaks of recommendations to be made for enlarging the scope of the existing statute . These favorable words from the head of the Administration soon to go out of power will be of value to the friends of the reform .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
