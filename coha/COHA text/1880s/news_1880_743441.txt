txt In the severe strain to which Christian belief is now subjected , it is not surprising that there is a visible , if not notable , increase of those who hold agnostic views . The question before every one is , whether Christianity is anything more than one of the many forms in which the heart and mind of man have found an expression of what is best . If Christianity is a strictly human form of religion , as it unquestionably is in the great part of its outward observances , it has no claims which are binding upon the individual , and without a supernatural basis for existing life , human thought is entirely confined to phenomena . There are antecedents and consequents in life , but the controlling divine mind is a fiction of the imagination , and nothing beyond human experience can be proved to have any definite value . This form of atheism is not new , and is not necessarily held by persons of depraved minds . If called agnostic , it is simply agnostic in the enunciation of the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is au emphatic protest against the attempt to put GOD behind all natural causes , and to insist that He works ? visibly in all the operations of life . It is the reaction from the undue prominence of GOD in the world . It , therefore , need not be wholly bad nor wholly good . It does not mean atheism in the vulgar sense , nor the belief in GOD in the common religious statement of His work . - The present form of agnosticism is simply a statement of the attitude of the natural mind toward religious belief . We have had . alternations of ascribing too much and then too little to GOD ; now we are striving to reach equity of judgment , and the writings of the materialists , to a large extent based upon facts which no one can deny , have seemed to favor that unwillingness to affirm GOD in life which is chiefly today the work of agnostic teaching . Thus , as far as agnosticism goes , its positive statement in Sir WILLIAM HAMILTON 'S philosophy of the unconditioned , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believers in Christianity ; and yet , if we do not know GOD in the sense of the proper comprehension of His essence , it does not follow that we do not know Him at all . The fatal defect of agnosticism is that it stops at this gate of the unknowable and refuses to advance , refuses to organize the forces of life upon merit and intelligence in what is beyond , and compels us to limit human motives to what is strictly the human and temporal view of life . Now , conceding the correctness of the agnostic position up to a certain point , as all candid thinkers must who understand the limits of our knowledge , there is something to be said for the great and common instincts of men . Whether the world advances or recedes , we are the disciples of progress . These universal instincts for truth , for noble purposes , for the higher affections , for a clean conscience , can neither be denied nor despised . They are not facts in science , but profound truths in actual life , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. HUTTON , in an article on " The Atheistic View of Life , " in Fraser ' s Magazine for May , in showing that , much as they mean as purely natural instincts , they imply vastly more than merely natural instinct in their influence upon human conduct . It can not be that the great natural forces in human life have always been misleading , nor can it be . without significance , that these instincts have controlled conduct in a way to both exalt and sanctify our lives . These natural forces have something behind them . Whether traced by the law of evolution or by the law of intuition , they are the great components of life . That we can estimate them in a scientific sense is impossible ; that we can say that one elementary force has accomplished this and another resulted in that is too much to expect ; but when , in the large view , you consider the motive which is , , behind our mental and moral activity , the large and the small believer agree in the opinion that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the act . This point has been so often made that it need not be argued , nor need . it be more than remarked in passing that almost the whole motive power of life , outside of merely physical activity , has its origin in the belief in a personal GOD . It may be replied that we can not decide this dispassionately , because the belief already widely prevails , but it prevails as the natural expression of the mind and heart , as the outgrowth of our unconscious , almost involuntary , instincts . These instincts are the common property of mankind , more or less the apparently natural endowment of men . They are represented by conscience , by natural rights , by the deeper enjoyments of life . They can never be reduced to the selfish , utilitarian basis of agnosticism without losing their essential power . The meaning which men import into life is always in proportion as the inward power of these instincts is developed . They are not developed , but blunted , by the agnostic philosophy . They are developed on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is related to the eternal Mind of the universe . The zeal for truth depends upon the fact that the more truth we have the larger is the measure of our personal existence . The activity of conscience depends upon the growing sense of what is right and what is wrong , and the knowledge of what is right comes from some sense of justice as it exists in GOD . The whole structure of human society is based upon the social and domestic affections , and these affections are deep and strong in proportion as the lower feelings are sacrificed to the higher ideals of life . But upon the basis of agnosticism these instincts only command the range of present existence , and thus lose the very force by which they largely control and uplift human conduct . The morality of agnosticism is a morality without aim , a morality of circumstances , a morality essentially outward and without push . It wants the energy of high civilization . It does not sufficiently account for the human force which men import into daily life , nor for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean that what Mr. HERpERT SPENCER Or Mr. LESLIE STEPHEN have to say is not to be considered , but it means that all which the school of agnostic writers have to say does not properly account for the great , broad , universal instincts of the human race which , whatever their origin may be , point to something behind themselves as their incitement to action . The agnostic philosophy of being and conduct does not cover all the facts which enter into current life . It does not concern itself with the motive power . In man , speaking broadly , the intuitions , which are the hidden part of our instincts , are the fixed tendencies , while the understanding is the adapting power . The spiritual and intellectual side of life is as real as the physical side , and the one is not fully explained by the method which illustrates the other . The agnostic outlook is defective , not because it does not truthfully explain the instincts which control the lower part of life , but because it inadequately estimates the great inward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but whisper that the unseen Maker of the soul is not far from the creation of His hand .
