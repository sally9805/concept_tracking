THE PAPER MONEY CRAZE OF 1786 AND THE SHAYS REBELLION . THERE is no telling how long the wretched state of things which followed the Revolution might have continued , had not the crisis been precipitated by the wild attempts of the several States to remedy the distress of the people by legislation . That financial distress was wide-spread and deep-seated was not to be denied . At the beginning of the war the amount of accumulated capital in the country had been very small . The great majority of the people did little more than get from the annual yield of their farms or plantations enough to meet the current expenses of the year . Outside of agriculture the chief resources were the carrying trade , the exchange of commodities with England and the West Indies , and the Newfoundland whale fisheries ; and in these occupations many people had grown rich . The war had destroyed all these sources of revenue . Imports and exports had alike been stopped , so that there was a distressing scar city of some of the commonest household articles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before the war , the dockyards of Nan . tucket were ringing with the busy sound of adze and hammer , rope-walks covered the island , and two hundred keels sailed yearly in quest of spermaceti . At the return of peace , the docks were silent and grass grew in the streets . The carrying-trade and the fisheries began soon to revive , but it was some years before the old prosperity was restored . The war had also wrought serious damage to agriculture , and in some parts of the country the direct destruction of property by the enemy 's troops had been very great . To all these causes of poverty there was added the hopeless confusion due to an inconvertible paper currency . The worst feature of this financial device is that it not only impoverishes people , but bemuddles their brains by creating a false and fleeting show of prosperity . By violently disturbing apparent values , it always brings on an era of wild speculation and extravagance in living , followed by sudden collapse and protracted suffering . In such crises the poorest people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their brows and have no margin of accumulated capital , always suffer the most . Above all men , it is the laboring man who needs sound money and steady values . We have seen all these points amply illustrated since the War of Secession . After the War of Independence , when the margin of accumulated capital was so much smaller , the misery was much greater . While the paper money lasted there was marked extravagance in living , and complaints were loud against the speculators , especially those who operated in bread - stuffs . Washington said he would like to hang them all on a gallows higher than that of Haman ; but they were , after all , but the inevitable products of this abiiormal state of things , and the more guilty criminals were the demagogues who went about preaching the doctrine that the poor man needs cheap money . After the collapse of this continental currency in 1780 , it seemed as if there were no money in the country , and at the peace the renewal of trade with England seemed at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed manufactured goods , which then began , would naturally have been paid for in the South by indigo , rice , and tobacco , in the Middle States by exports of wheat and furs , and in New England by the profits of the fisheries , the shipping , and the West India trade . But in the Southem // and N'liddle States the necessary revival of agriculture could not be effected in a moment , and British legislation against American shipping and the West India trade fell with crippling force upon New England . Consequently , we had little else but specie with which to pay for imports , and the country was soon drained of what little specie there was . In the absence of a circulating medium there was a reversion to the practice of barter , and the revival of business was thus further impeded . Whiskey in North Carolina , tobacco in Virginia , did duty as measures of value ; and Isaiah Thomas , editor of the Worcester Spy , announced that he would receive subscriptions for his paper in salt pork . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what this specie was , the scarcity of which created so much embarrassment . Until 1785 no national coinage was established , and none was issued until 1793 . English , French , Spanish , and German coins , of various and uncertain value , passed from hand to hand . Beside the ninepences and fourpence-ha ' - pennies , there were bits and half-bits , pistareens , picayunes , and fips . Of gold pieces there were the johannes , or joe , the doubloon , the moidore , and pistole , with English and French guineas , carolins , ducats , and chequins . Of coppers there were English pence and half-pence and French sons ; and pennies were issued at local mints in Vermont , Massachusetts , Connecticut , New Jersey , and I*ennsylvania . The English shilling had everywhere degenerated in value , but differently in different localities ; and among silver pieces the Spanish dollar , from Louisiana and Cuba , had begun to supersede it as a measure of value . In New England the shilling had sunk from nearly one fourth to one sixth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in North Carolina to one tenth . It was partly for this reason that in desiring a national coinage the more uniform dollar was adopted as the unit . At the same time the decimal system of division was adopted instead of the cumbrous English system , and the result was our present admirably simple currency , which we owe to Gouverneur Morris , aided as to some points by Thomas Jefferson . During the period of the confederation , the chaotic state of the currency was a serious obstacle to trade , and it afforded endless opportunities for fraud and extortion . Clipping and counterfeiting were carried to such lengths that every moderately cautious person , in taking payment in hard cash , felt it necessary to keep a small pair of scales beside him and carefully weigh each coin , after narrowly scrutinizing its stamp and deciphering its legend . In view of all these complicated impediments to business on the morrow of a long and costly war , it was not strange that the whole country was in some measure pauperized . It is questionable if the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system of government . The cost of the war , estimated in cash , had been about $1 7* ) ,  - -  000,000 ; and probably not more than $30,000,000 of this ever got paid in any shape . The repudiation was wholesale because there was really no money to be had . The people were somewhat in the condition of Mr. Harold Skimpole . In many parts of the country , by the year 1786 , the payment of taxes had come to be regarded as an amiable eccentricity . At one moment , early in 1782 , there was not a single dollar in the treasury . That the government bad in any way been able to finish the war , after the downfall of its paper money , was due to the gigantic efforts of one great man , - Robert Morris , of Pennsylvania . This statesman was born in England , but he had come to Philadelphia in his boyhood , and had amassed an enormous fortune , which he devoted without stint to the service of his adopt- // September , ed country . Though opposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had , nevertheless , signed his name to that document , and scarcely any one had contributed more to the success of the war . It was he who supplied the money which enabled Washington to complete the great campaign of Trenton and Princeton . In 1781 he was made superintendent of finance , and by dint of every imaginable device of hard-pressed ingenuity he contrived to support the brilliant work which began at the Cowpens and ended at Yorktown . He established the Bank of North America as an instrument by which government loans might be negotiated . Sometimes his methods were such as doctors call heroic , as when he made sudden drafts upon our ministers in Europe after the manner already described . In every dire emergency he was Washing .. ton 's chief reliance , and in his devotion to the common weal he drew upon his private resources until he became poor ; and in later years - for shame be it said - an ungrateful nation allowed one of its noblest and most disinterested champions to languish in a debtor 's pris on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weak and disorderly confederation that in 1784 , after three years of herculean struggle with impossibilities , this stout heart and sagacious head could no longer weather the storm . The task of creating wealth out of nothing had become too arduous and too thankless to be endured . Robert Morris resigned his place , and it was taken by a congressional committee of finance , under whose management the disorders only hurried to a crisis . By 1786 , under the universal depression and want of confidence , all trade had well . nigh stopped , and political quackery , with its cheap and dirty remedies , had full control of the field . In the very face of miseries so plainly traceable to the deadly paper currency , it may seem strange that people should now have begun to clamor for a renewal of the experiment which had worked so much evil . Yet so it was . As starving men are said to dream of dainty banquets , so now a craze for fictitious wealth in the shape of paper money ran like an epidemic through the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only now it was the several States that sought to apply the remedy , each in its own way . And when we have threaded the maze of this rash leg .. islation , we shall the better understand that clause in our federal constitution which forbids the making of laws impairing the obligation of contracts . The events of 1786 impressed upon men 's minds more forcibly than ever the wretched and disorderly condition of the country , and went far toward calling into existence the needful popular sentiment in favor of an overruling central government . The disorders assumed very different forms in the different States , and brought out a great diversity of opinion as to the causes of the distress and the efficacy of the proposed remedies . Only two States out of the thirteen - Connecticut and Delaware - escaped the infection , but , on the other hand , it was only in seven States that the paper money party prevailed in the legislatures . North Carolina issued a large amount of paper , and , in order to get it into circulation as quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it , paying double the specie value of the tobacco . As a natural consequence , the paper dollar instantly fell to seventy cents , and went on declining . In South Carolina an issue was tried somewhat more cautiously , but the planters soon ref use ( l to take the paper at its face value . Coercive measures were then attempted . Planters and merchants were urged to sign a pledge not to discriminate between paper and gold , and if any one dared refuse the fanatics forthwith attempted to make it hot for him . A // kind of " Kukiux " society was organized at Charleston , known as the " Hint Club . " Its purpose was to hint to such people that they had better look out . If they did not mend their ways , it was unnecessary to inform them more explicitly what they might expect . houses were combustible then as now , and the use of firearms was well understood . In Georgia the legislature itself attempted coercion . Paper money was made a legal tender in spite of strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or merchant from exporting any produce without taking affidavit that he had never refused to receive this scrip at its full face value . But somehow people found that the more it was sought to keep up the paper by dint of threats and forcing-acts , the faster its value fell . Virginia had issued hills of credit during the campaign of 1781 , but it was enacted at the same time that they should not be a legal tender after the next January . The influence of Washington , Madison , and Mason was effectively brought to bear in favor of sound currency , and the peopie of Virginia were but slightly affected by the craze of 1786 . In the autumn of that year a proposition from two counties for an issue of paper was defeated in the legislature by a vote of eighty-five to seventeen , and no more was heard of the matter . In Maryland , after a very obstinate fight , a rag money bill was carried in the House of Representatives , but the Senate threw it out ; and the measure was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in popular interest . Pennsylvania had warily begun in May , 1785 , to issue a million dollars in bills of credit , which were not made a legal tender for the payment of private debts . They were mainly loaned to farmers on mortgage , and were received by the State as an equivalent for specie in the payment of taxes . By August , 1786 , even this carefully guarded paper had fallen some twelve cents below par , - not a bad showing for such a year as that . New York moved somewhat less cautiously . A million dollars were issued in bills of credit receivable for the custom-house duties , which were then paid into the state treasury ; and these bills were made a legal tender for all money received in lawsuits . At tho same time the New Jersey legislature passed a bill for issuing half a million paper dollars , to be a legal tender in all business transactions . The bill was vetoed by the governor in council . The aged Governor Livingston was greatly respected by the people ; and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stake and dragged his effigy up to it , refrained from inflicting the last indignities upon the image , and burned that of one of the members of the council instead . At the next session the governor yielded , and the rag money was issued . But an unforeseen difficulty arose . Most of the dealings of New Jersey people were in the cities of New York and Philadelphia , and in both cities the merchants refused their paper , so that it speedily became worthless . The business of exchange was thus fast getting into hopeless confusion . It has been said of Bradshaw 's Railway Guide , the indispensable companion of the traveler in England , that no man can study it for an hour without qualifying himself for an insane asylum . But Bradshaw is pellucid clearness compared with the American tables of exchange in 1786 , with their medley of dollars and shillings , moidores and pistareens . The addition of half a dozen different kinds of paper created such a labyrinth as no human intellect could explore . No wonder that men were counted wise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had a yard of cloth to sell could tell how much it was worth . But even worse than all this was the swift and certain // renewal of bankruptcy which so many States were preparing for themselves . Nowhere did the warning come so quickly or so sharply as in New England . Connecticut , indeed , as already observed , came off scot-free . She had issued a little paper money soon after the battle of Lexington , but had stopped it about the time of the surrender of Burgoyne . In 1780 she had wisely and summarily adjusted all relations between debtor and creditor , and the crisis of 1786 found her people poor enough , 110 doubt , but able to wait for better times and indisposed to adopt violent remedies . It was far otherwise in Rhode Island and Massachusetts . These were preeminently the maritime States of the Union , and upon them the blows aimed by England at American commerce had fallen most severely . It was these two maritime States that suffered most from the cutting down of the carrying trade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things worked injury to ship-building , to the exports of lumber and oil and salted fish , even to the manufacture of Medford rum . Nowhere had the normal machinery of business been thrown out of gear so extensively as in these two States , and in Rhode Island there was the added disturbance due to a prolonged occupation by the enemy 's troops . Nowhere , perhaps , was there a larger proportion of the population in debt , and in these preeminently commercial communities private debts were a heavier burden and involved more personal suffering than in the somewhat patriarchal system of life in Virginia or South Carolina . In the time of which we are now treating , imprisonment for debt was common . High-minded but unfortunate men were carried to jail , and herded with thieves and ruffians in loathsome dungeons , for the crime of owing a hundred dollars which they could not promptly pay . Under such circumstances , a commercial disturbance , involving wide-spread debt , entailed an amount of personal suffering and humiliation of which , in these kinder days , we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debtor an outlaw , ready to entertain schemes for the subversion of society . In the crisis of 1786 , the agitation in Rhode Island and Massachusetts reached white heat , and things were done which alarmed the whole country . But the course of events was different in the two States . Iii Rhode Island the agitators obtained control of the government , and the result was a paroxysm of tyranny . In Massachusetts the agitators failed to secure control of the government , and the result was a paroxysm of rebellion . Tile debates over paper money in the Rhode Island legislature began in 1785 , but the advocates of a sound currency were victorious . These men were roundly abused in the newspapers , and in the next spring election most of them lost their seats . The legislature of 1786 showed an overwhelming majority in favor of paper money . The farmers from the inland towns were unanimous in supporting the measure . They could not see the difference between the State making a dollar out of paper and a dollar out of silver . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ment stamp they dismissed as an idle crotchet , a wire-drawn theory , worthy only of " literary fellows . " What they could see was the glaring fact that they had no money , hard or soft ; and they wanted something that would satisfy their creditors and buy new gowns for their wives , whose raiment was unquestionably the worse for wear . On the other hand , the merchants from seaports like Providence , Newport , and Bristol understood the difference between real money and the promissory notes of a bankrupt government , but they were in a hopeless minority . Half a million dollars were issued in scrip , to be loaned to the farmers on a mortgage of their real estate . No one could obtain the // scrip without giving a mortgage for twice the amount , and it was thought that this security would make it as good as gold . But the depreciation began instantly . When the worthy farmers went to the store for dry goods or sugar , and found the prices rising with dreadful rapidity , they were at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they truly said , was with the wicked merchants , who would not take the paper dollars at their face value . These men were thus thwarting the government , and must be punished . An act was accordingly hurried through the legislature , commanding every one to take paper as an equivalent for gold , under penalty of five hundred dollars fine and loss of the right of suffrage . The merchants in the cities thereupon shut up their shops . During the summer of 1786 all business was at a standstill in Newport and Providence , except in the bar-rooms . There and about the market-places men spent their time angrily discussing politics , and scarcely a day passed without street-fights , which at times grew into riots . In the country , too , no less than in the cities , the goddess of discord reigned . The farmers determined to starve the city people into submission , and they entered into an agreement not to send any produce into the cities until the merchants should open their shops and begin selling their goods for paper at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ butter and grain , they tried to dispose of them in Boston and New York , and in the coast towns of Connecticut . But in all these places their proceedings had awakened such lively disgust that placards were posted in the taverns warning purchasers against farm produce from Rhode Island . Disappointed in these quarters , the farmers threw away their milk , used their corn for fuel , and let their apples rot on the ground , rather than supply the detested merchants . Food grew scarce in Providence and Newport , and in the latter city a mob of sailors at .. tempted unsuccessfully to storm the provision stores . The farmers were threatened with armed violence . Town-meetings were held all over the State , to discuss the situation , and how long they might have talked to no purpose none can say , when all at once the matter was brought into court . A cabinet-maker in Newport named Trevett went into a meat-market kept by one John Weeden , and , selecting a joint of meat , offered paper in payment . Weeden refused to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed supperless , and next morning informed against the obstinate butcher for disobedience to the forcing-act . Should the court find him guilty , it would be a good speculation for Trevett , for half of the five hundred dollars fine was to go to the informer . Hard-money men feared lest the court might prove subservient to the legislature , since that body possessed the power of removing the five judges . The case was tried in September amid furious excitement . Huge crowds gathered about the courthouse and far down the street , screaming and cheering like a crowd on the night of a presidential election . The judges were clear-headed men , not to be browbeaten . They declared the forcing-act unconstitutional , and dismissed the complaint . Popular wrath then turned upon them . A spe. * cial session of the legislature was convened , four of the judges were removed , and a new forcing-act was prepared . This act provided that no man could vote at elections or hold any office without taking a test oath promising to receive paper money at par @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were not wild enough to support such a measure ; among the farmers there were some who had grown tired of seeing their produce spoiled on their hands ; and many of the richest merchants had announced their intention of moving out of the State . The new forcing-act // accordingly failed to pass , and presently the old one was repealed . The paper dollar had been issued in May ; in iNovember it passed for sixteen cents . These outrageous proceedings awakened disgust and alarm among sensible people in all the other States , and Rhode Island was everywhere reviled and made fun of . One clause of the forcing-act had provided that if a debtor should offer paper to his creditor and the creditor should refuse to take it at par , the debtor might carry his rag money to court and deposit it with the judge ; and the judge must thereupon issue a certificate discharging the debt . The form of certificate began with the words " Know Ye , " and forthwith the unhappy little State was nicknamed Rogues ' Island , the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scorn of the people was thus poured out upon Rhode Island , much sympathy was felt for the government of Massachusetts , which was called upon thus early to put down armed rebellion . The pressure of debt was keenly felt in the rural districts of Massachusetts . It is estimated that the private debts in the State amounted to some $7,000,000 , and the State 's arrears to the federal government amounted to $7,000 ,  - -  000 more . Adding to these sums the arrears of bounties due to the soldiers , and the annual cost of the state , county , and town governments , there was reached an aggregate equivalent to a tax of more than $50 on every man , woman , and child in this population of 379,000 souls . Upon every head of a family the average burden was some $200 at a time when most farmers would have thought such a sum yearly a princely income . In those days of scarcity most of them did not set eyes on so much as $50 in the course of a year , and happy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or moidores in an old stocking , and sewed up the treasure in his straw mattress or hidden it behind the bricks of the chimney - piece . Under such circumstances the payment of debts and taxes was out of the question ; and as the same state of things made creditors clamorous and ugly , the courts were crowded with lawsuits . The lawyers usually contrived to get their money by exacting retainers in advance , and the practice of champerty was common , whereby the lawyer did his work in consideration of a percentage on the sum which was at last forcibly collected . Homesteads were sold for the payment of foreclosed mortgages , cattle were seized in distrainer , and the farmer himself was sent to jail . The smouldering fires of wrath thus kindled found expression in curses aimed at lawyers , judges , and merchants . The wicked merchants bought foreign goods and drained the State of specie to pay for them , while they drank Madeira wine and dressed their wives in fine velvets and laces . So said the farmers ; and city ladies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs , of which the members pledged themselves to wear homespun , - a poor palliative for the deep-seated ills of the time . In such mood were many of the villagers when in the summer of 1786 they were overtaken by the craze for paper money . At the meeting of the legislature in May , a petition came in from Bristol County , praying for an issue of paper . The petitioners admitted that such money was sure to deteriorate in value , and they doubted the wisdom of trying to keep it up by forcing-acts . Instead of this they would have the rate of its deterioration regulated by law , so that a dollar might be worth ninety cents to-day , and presently seventy cents , and by and by fifty cents , and so on till it should go down to zero and be thrown overboard . People would thus know what to expect , and it would be all right . The delicious na*vet6 of this argument did not prevail with the legislature of Massachusetts , // and soft money was frowned down by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought in seeking to reestablish in legislation the ancient practice of barter , and make horses and cows legal tender for debts ; and this bill was crushed by eighty-nine votes against thirty-five . At the same time this legislature passed a bill to strengthen the federal government by a grant of supplementary funds to Congress , and thus laid a further burden of taxes upon the people . There was an outburst of popular wrath . A convention at Hatfield in August decided that the court of common pleas ought to be abolished , that no funds should be granted to Congress , and that paper money should be issued at once . Another convention at Lenox denounced such incendiary measures , approved of supporting the federal government , and declared that no good could come from the issue of paper money . But meanwhile the angry farmers had resorted to violence . The legislature , they said , had its sittings in Boston , under the influence of wicked lawyers and merchants , and thus could not be expected to do the will of the people . A cry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small inland town , where jealous eyes might watch their proceedings . Meanwhile the lawyers must be dealt with ; and at Northampton , Worcester , Great Barrington , and Concord , the courts were broken up by armed mobs . At Concord one Job Shattuck brought several hundred armed men into the town and surrounded the court-house , while in a fierce harangue he declared that the time had come for wiping out all debts . " Yes , " squeaked a nasal voice from the crowd , - " yes , Job , we know all about them two farms you ca n't never pay for ! " But this repartee did not save the judges , who thought it best to flee from the town . At first the legislature deemed it wise to take a lenient view of these proceedings , and it even went so far as to promise to hold its next session out of Boston . But the agitation had reached a point where it could not be stayed . In September the Supreme Court was to sit at Springfield , and Governor Bowdoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect it . They were confronted by some 600 insurgents , under the leadership of Daniel Shays . This man had been a captain in the continental army , and in his force were many of the penniless veterans whom Gates would fain have incited to rebellion at INewburgh . Shays seems to have done what he could to restrain his men from violence , but he was a poor creature , wanting alike in courage and good faith . The militia , too , were lacking in spirit . After a disorderly parley , with much cursing and swearing , they beat a retreat , and the court was prevented from sitting . Fresh riots fol .. lowed at Worcester and Concord . A regiment of cavalry , sent out by the governor , scoured Middlesex County , and , after a short fight in the woods near Groton , captured Job Shattuck and dispersed his men . But this only exasperated the insurgents . They assembled in Worcester to the number of 1200 or more , where they lived for two months at free quarters , while Shays organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended for eight months , and Governor Bowdoin called out an army of 4400 men , who were placed under command of General Lincoln . As the state treasury was nearly empty , some wealthy gentlemen in Boston subscribed the money needed for equipping these troops , and about the middle of January , 1787 , they were collected at Worcester . The rebels had behaved shamefully , burning barns and seizing all the plunder they could lay . hands on . As their numbers increased they found their military stores inadequate , and accordingly they marched upon Springfield , with the intent to capture // the federal arsenal there , and provide themselves with muskets and cannon . General Shepard held Springfield with 1200 men , and on the 25th of January Shays attacked him with a force of somewhat more than 2000 , hoping to crush him and seize the arsenal before Lincoln could come to the rescue . But his plan of attack was faulty , and as soon as his men began falling under Shepard 's fire a panic seized them , and they retreated in disorder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to houses and robbing the inhabitants . On the approach of Lincoln 's army , three days later , Shays retreated to Pelham , and planted his forces on two steep hills protected at the bottom by huge snowdrifts . Lincoln advanced to Hadley and sought to open negotiations with the rebels . They were reminded that a contest with the state government was hopeless , and that they had already incurred the penalty of death ; but if they would now lay down their arms and go home , a free pardon could be obtained for them . Shays seemed willing to yield , and Saturday , the 3d of February , was appointed for a conference between some of the leading rebels and some of the officers . But this was only a stratagem . During the conference Shays decamped and marched his men through Prescott and North Dana to Petersham . Toward nightfall the trick was discovered , and Lincoln set his whole force in motion over the mountain ridges of Shutesbury and New Salem . The day had been mild , but during the night the thermometer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fall . There was great suffering during the last ten miles , and indeed the whole march of thirty miles in thirteen hours over steep and snow-covered roads was a worthy exploit for these veterans of the Revolution . Shays and his men had not looked for such a display of energy , and as they were getting their breakfast on Sunday morning at Petersham they were taken by surprise . A few minutes sufficed to scatter them in flight . A hundred and fifty , including Shays himself , were taken prisoners . The rest fled in all directions , most of them to Athol and Northfield , whence they made their way into Vermont . General Lincoln then marched his troops into the mountains of Berkshire , where disturbances still continued . On the 26th of February one Captain Hamlin , with several hundred insurgents , plundered the town of Stockbridge and carried off the leading citizens as hostages . He was pursued as far as Springfield , defeated there in a sharp skirmish , with a loss of some thirty in killed and wounded , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Massachusetts . During the autumn similar disturbances had occurred in the States te the northward . At Exeter in New Hampshire and at Windsor and Rutland in Vermont the courts had been broken up by armed mobs , and at Rutland there had been bloodshed . When the Shays rebellion was put down , Governor Bowdoin requested the neighboring States to lend their aid in bringing the insurgents to justice , and all complied with the request except Vermont and Rhode Island . The legislature of Rhode Island sympathized with the rebels , and refused to allow the governor to issue a warrant for their arrest . On the other hand , the governor of Vermont issued a pruclamation out of courtesy toward Massachusetts , but he caused it to be understood that this was but an empty form , as the State of Vermont could not afford te discourage immigration . A feeling of compassion for the insurgents was widely spread in Massachusetts . In March the leaders were tried , and fourteen were convicted of treason and sentenced to death ; but Governor Bowdoin , whose term was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks . At the annual election in April the candidates for the governorship were Bowdoin and Hancock , // and it was generally believed that the latter would be more likely than the former to pardon the convicted men . So strong was this feeling that , although much gratitude was felt toward Bowdoin , to whose energetic measures the prompt suppression of the rebellion was due , Hancock obtained a large majority . When the question of a pardon came up for discussion , Samuel Adams , who was then president of the Senate , was strongly opposed to it , and one of his arguments was very characteristic . " In monarchies , " he said , " the crime of treason and rebellion may admit of being pardoned or highly punished ; but the man who dares to rebel against the laws of a republic ought to suffer death . " This was Adams 's sensitive point . He wanted the whole world to realize that the rule of a republic is a rule of law and order , and that liberty does not mean license . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to be said , the clemency of the American temperament prevailed , and Governor Hancock pardoned all the prisoners . Nothing in the history of these disturbances is more instructive than the light incidentally thrown upon the relations between Congress and the state government . Just before the news of the rout at Petersham , Samuel Adams had proposed in the Senate that the governor should be requested to write to Congress and inform that body of what was going on in Massachusetts , stating that " although the legislature are firmly persuaded that . . . in all probability they will be able speedily and effectively to suppress the rebellion , yet , if any unforeseen event should take place which may frustrate the measures of govern VOL . LVIII. - NO. 347. 25 ment , they rely upon such support from the United States as is expressly and solemnly stipulated by the articles of confederation . " A resolution to this effect was carried in the Senate , but defeated in the House through the influence of western county members in sympathy with the insurgents ; and incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was incompatible with the dignity of Massachusetts to allow United States troops to set foot upon her soil . When we reflect that the arsenal at Springfield , where the most considerable disturbance occurred , was itself federal property , the climax of absurdity seems to have been reached . It was left for Congress itself , however , to cap that climax . The progress of the insurrection in the autumn in Vermont , New Hampshire , and Massachusetts , as well as the troubles in Rhode Island , had alarmed the whole country . It was feared that the insurgents in these States might join forces , and in some way kindle a flame that would run through the land . Accordingly , Congress in October called upon the States for a continental force , but did not dare to declare openly what it was to be used for . It was thought necessary to say that the troops were wanted for an expedition against the Northwestern Indians ! National humiliation could go no further than such a confession , on the part of our central government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those very articles of confederation to which it owed its existence . Things had come to such a pass that people of all shades of opinion were beginning to agree upon one thing , - that something must be done , and done quickly . John Fiske.
