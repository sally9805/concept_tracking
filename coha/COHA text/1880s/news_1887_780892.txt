txt The bears or the San Francisco wheat market are becom-ing very much excited , and it looks as if the game played some time ago on the mining stock brokers Is to be repeated with effect on the grain speculation . The hands of John Mackay and Banker Flood are , it is alleged , seen plainly in the present deal , and every one is beginning to . look out closely for some big failures . It has been well known for some time that Mackay has had designs on the wheat crop of California , and while in Europe last year the fact of every little shower in California was telegraphed to him . When Mackay got back some months ago he found the mining stock market in splendid shape for squeezing the shorts , and he put on the screws with such effect that several very prosperous and cautious brokers will not take European trips this year . Having made handsomely by this deal , Mackay and Flood turned seriously to the wheat market , and , through William Dresbach , proceeded to corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war . The incautious bears . remembering that Dresbaeb , though a very sharp fellow , had made a couple of very serious slips in his time , thought they could see the end of the purse a ud concluded to trip him . They begin to realize no w that they have been putting their dimes against the bonanza firm 's dollars , and are imploring the Produce Exchange Board to save them by putting into effect rule 7 of the board , which provides that when there is a fictitious market the hoard may establish a price for the f ulfiliment of contracts . It is evident that the bull combination is master of the situation , for the millers can not get wheat and are shutting down the mills . Some think that the bonanza firm will lose heavily , as there is likely to be an abundant crop this year , and prices can not be driven much higher . The question is , can Mackay and Flood corner the new crop , or can prices be held up until after May 1 , when the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be several heavy failures to record in San Francisco .
