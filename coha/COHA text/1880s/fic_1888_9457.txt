( Exit . ) Crabtree . TOM CRABTREE.  --  ( Looking after . ) The fool ! But I said nothing . I scarcely thought it . I did not dare think it . It is too dastardly , too cowardly to let come into my head . And yet he tempted me to half hope it . Why , to see Hank Monk whirl his Tally-ho , the first that ever crossed the Sierras , around them peaks yonder , playing spider and fly in the heaven with his six horses , it would seem that he must fall , and he must , he must and will . ( Song of the Alps in distance . ) That crazy Dutchman that he picked up and put to work here .

( Enter Hank and Rosie ; whips , gauntlets , rich and picturesque California driving habits . Ebe and Nora courtesy and show great deference ; then Ebe swings hat and shouts out his welcome and delight .  --  Note . I desire an exact makeup of Hank Monk as he appeared in his prime , about 15 years ago . Stage dresses of that day worn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crown , rich top-boots , long gauntlets , much jewelry , bowie-knife and pistol , very rich clothes and always a rich scarf of fine showy color about the neck .

ROSIE LANE .  --  " ( Aside . ) Gold , gold here in seams and lines and bars ; enough to make Henry rich , rich ! And I heard the Squire speak of coming to make a deed of it . It must not be . Hank . HANK MONK .  --  My Rosie , love , what are you sitting out there and apart on the rocks for ? Are you tired ? Rosie . ROSIE LANE .  --  " Why , no , Henry , not at all . Hank . HANK MONK .  --  Well , the thirty-mile dash down the Sierras might have made you so were it not that you are a part of them , my beauty . Oh , Rosie , when I remember my dissolute old life , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at old Hank Monk , and how one little girl away up yonder , in a camp almost on the summit , used to sit every day as I dashed by . Well , well , they were trying old days . But the little flower by the roadside grew and grew and blossomed brighter as the sun rolled on , and one day I drew up six reins , got down , and gathered it to my heart . ( Embraces her . ) Rosie . ROSIE LANE .  --  " And oh , Henry , how I used to love you ! Hank . HANK MONK .  --  Used to ? used to , my pet ? Be careful ; I am growing old , and the white snows of the Sierras are sifting through my hair . And then that handsome fellow , that gambler , who loved you so , who loves you still . Rosie .

EBENEZER OFENHOFFER Yah ! we do dat togeder , away up yonder , ven she was not so  --  so long in ze dress . Hank . HANK MONK .  --  Tally-ho forever !

( Aside . ) This time I have come to stay , and will need my best wits about me . They are all drunk , all but her . Well , if I do n't win this game , I 'll leave the Sierras . Wife and mine are booked . Oh , Mr. Monk , I told the squire that probably we might need him to make out the deed . Brown . SQUIRE BROWN .  --  " Yes , for in California the law is  --  is the law . Hank . HANK MONK .  --  Do n't hurry business . Squire , I knew a man once that was in a hurry . ( Is nearly drunk . ) It was Horace Greeley ! I 'm the man , as all the world knows , that drove Horace Greeley over the Sierras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm the man that did it . Shall I tell you all about it ? Crabtree . TOM CRABTREE.  --  ( Aside . ) Bah ! that old story that I have heard till I am sick of it . Hank . HANK MONK .  --  Yes ; you want to hear it ? Well , Horace came to me first thing , and says he , " Colonel , I 'm Horace Greeley . " " Well , I , " says I , " Mr. Horace Greely , how are you ? I 'm Hank Monk " ; and then we shook . And then says he , " I 've got to lecture in Nevada to-night . " " All right , Mr. Greeley , " says I , " the mail 's got to get through . " Well , I tightened up the horses , took a turn around old Tally-ho to see that she was all solid to a bolt , timber and trees , and then I kind of slowlike climbed up to my box and Ebe there threw me the reins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fingers and the horses began to prick their ears and paw . But I was cool and slow , lookin ' close to the horses , thinkin ' of the great man I had there in my care , the great and good man that all the world loved , that I had to take whirlin ' up and around them peaks  --  where a stone as big as an apple might land us all at the bottom of a bottomless gorge  --  well , I tell you I was about half prayin ' , slowly threadin ' the ribbons , you know , and hearin ' the horses rattle the bits in their teeth , when suddenly out popped a little bald white head and Horace squeaked out , " I 've got to lecture to-night in Nevada , Mr. Monk ! " Well , I give ' em the silk . Ten miles up , and they began to blow and smoke like furnaces . Out popped the little white head . " I 've got to lecture in Nevada , to-night ! " Ten miles more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snow-peaks about us , but I held ' em in , slow and steady and strong ; they tugged and struggled as if they knew all I felt ; but it was slow , so slow now . " I 've got to lecture in Nevada , to-night , mr . Monk ! " And just then I turned the tip of the summit , threw out the silk , the horses plunged down the steep hill , the axles rattled like engines , the wheels were in the air ! And then the little white head popped out and said somethin ' about not being so very anxious to get to Nevada , after all . But I could n't hear him for the clatter of hoofs and the rattle of the stage as we dashed like a cataract down the mountains . And at last out popped the little white head again and said somethin ' about thinkin ' I better slow up a bit , and not hurt my horses ! Slow up ? I gave ' em , every one , six inches of silk ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard somethin ' tumblin ' about like loose lumber in a gale , said , " Do n't care a damn whether I get to Nevada to-night or not . " Ebe . EBENEZER OFENHOFFER Yah , dot wor our own hosses did dat ting . Brown . SQUIRE BROWN .  --  " And he did lecture that night in Nevada ? Hank . HANK MONK .  --  Yes , yes . But he was tired , I tell you . And he was sore as well as tired . And he did not sit down to lecture . ( All laugh . ) Crabtree . TOM CRABTREE.  --  Well , about that sale , Monk ? ( Crabtree has sat on stump , taken out bowie-knife and been whittling . ) Hank . HANK MONK .  --  That 's a fine bowie ; looks like the one I carry on the Tally-ho . Where did you get your knife ? Crabtree . TOM CRABTREE.  --  Sacramento . Made by Jim Bowie , nephew of the old Colonel Bowie who made the first bowie-knife in Texas . Hank . HANK MONK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're twins , ai n't they ?

Crabtree . TOM CRABTREE.  --  Yes . Hank . HANK MONK .  --  I had n't the heart to have it done on mine . The fact is , I 'm ashamed to carry the confounded thing . It 's a coward 's weapon , a knife is . I 'm a man myself , and I prefer a man 's arms any day . Crabtree . TOM CRABTREE.  --  What do you call a man 's arms ? Hank . HANK MONK .  --  His hands , of course . They 're the natural weapons of a gentleman . If nature intended you to stab , she 'd have given you steel finger-nails a foot long .

But then Hank Monk has no money , never would save a cent ; and how can you persuade any honest man in this world to believe a man is not guilty when you have not a dollar to persuade with ? Oh , if he had only kept his mouth shut ! Men talk too much , men talk too much , altogether too much . ( Enter Nora .
