txt Lord Selborne , Liberal , in a letter to the Times , attacks certain features of Mr. Gladstone 's Home Rule bill . He pronounces the measure hopelessly faulty from the fact that not one of the restrictions provided excepts from the powers of the proposed Irish Legislature any matter relating to the lives , liberties , and properties of the Queen 's Irish subjects . " The magistrates , the judges , and the police in Ireland , " says Lord Selborne , " will be the servants of the Dublin Government " Referring to the fact that Mr. G/adBtone 's measure excludes from the powers of the Irish Legislature all matters relating to the army and navy , Lord Selborne says there is still no reason why a volunteer Irish army can not be raised without passing a bill . Lord Selborne strongly attacks the Land Purchase bill . He asks upon the ground that ? 130,000,000 will be required to buy out the Irish landlords how the sharers in the first ? 50,000,000 provided are to be selected , and what position those landlords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will thereafter occupy , first , with respect to the collection of their rents , and secondly , with regard to prospects of being bought out at all ? " Does Mr. Gladstone , " asks the writer , " expect that these landlords will have their rents paid in the Meantime ? What security is there that any further Government after Mr. Gladstone 's will pass an act to add ? 100,000,000 to the national debt in order to do justice to the remaining landlords of Ireland , when , in the meantime , the government of Ireland has passed into the bands of the Nationalists and a great experiment , which has already cost ? 50,000,000 , has perhaps proved a failure . If the question is one of public honor , justice , and good faith provision ought to be made now to discharge the whole obligation , otherwise it is a cruel mockery toward the landlords . " The letter concludes with the statement that the writer is not surprised that Mr. Gladstone 's friends are advising him to drop the Land bill altogether . The Trustees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have offered to turn over the lands in fee to the tenants at sums equaling , in the case of each holding , 12 years ' rent , the property to be sold at the present poor law valuation . The offer has created a sensation in Ireland .
