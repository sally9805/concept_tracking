txt The excitement into which politicians were thrown here by the news of the resignation of Senators Conkling and Platt has not by any means diminished . The capital has become the political centre for the time , and hither come dispatches , special correspondents , and letters , all seeking information as to the solution of the quarrel between the Administration and its opponents . Up to this time all inquirers have been compelled to reach the same conclusion ? that the Administration is ahead , and that exSenators Conkling and Platt , if they should choose to continue the Contest , would be defeated . The State is thoroughly aroused . Every mail brings its avalanches of correspondence , and . where there is one letter approving the course of Conkling and Platt there are ten which breathe a spirit of thankfulness , if not rejoicing , that the season of domination is over . New zest was to-day added to the excitement here by the news from Washington that the President had sent in a new batch of nominations , including the names of several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stiffen the backs of the Administration men , but it has made no perceptible change in the situation . It can not be said to have checked the tide of opposition running against Conkling and Platt , nor to have abated a jot the confidence and enthusiasm with which the Robertson men shout " Stand by the Administration . " The situation is altogether remarkable . Robbed of power , the Conkling men have wilted in their places , and their opponents are disnosed not only to insist that Conkling and Platt shall not be re-elected , but that their successors shall be Administration men , pure and simple . It is not by any means certain that this disposition will be maintained . If the Conkling men can accomplish what they believe they earn the tables will be turned . No one here sees just how victory can be won for Conkling , but there are many men here who have full confidence in his ability to triumph if he is disposed to make a fight , Early this morning , in the Senate and the Assembly , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Administration list was not produced , but there were many quiet conversations between members of different ? stripes for the plain purpose of sounding doubtful and weak men . With the Administration men , the adjuration was " stand by Garfield . " While the Admuaistraticn men claimed that at least 47 members of both houses had signed the promise not to support an anti-Administration Senator , the anti-Administration men  --  the followers of Conkling and Platt  --  declare that the list did not con:ain more than 37 names , and that Dthers who had wavered would be fed on such assurances that in a few days they would once more desert to come to the winning side . Senator Robertson , sitting in his place in the Senate , looked at a handsome floral ship sent to his desk by friends , and presided at the desk with his usual equanimity . He received the Governor 's announcement of vacancies in the Senate just as he would have received the report of a bill . He knew a great deal better than some of his associates the degree of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This feeling of confidence is apparent to-night . On the other hand , the lack of confidence and purpose among the anti-Administration men is painfully apparent . What the outcome is to be . no one in the Conkling ranks can tell . The Garfield men say that it means two Administration Senators , and that nothing can prevent s ch a conclusion of the Senatorial contest . During the day there have been several earnest conferences in Speaker Sharpe 's room , between Police Commissioner French and prominent Conkling men in the Assembly , as to what course ought to be adopted . The Commissioner left here for Now-York to-night , and when he went away no conclusion had been reached . Among the friends of exSenators Conkling and Platt there has been great anxiety to ascertain positively whether they desired to be renominated . Telegrams were sent to Washington making Inquiries on this point , but no answers could be obtained . The hope was strong that an affirmative answer would be sent . The few remaining outspoken Conkling men are desirous of having a watchword . They now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they made inquiries as to the progress of the Administration canvass , only exhibiting their feelings when the name of same new convert was announced . Some of the Assemblymen must nave spoken cautiously , for several are claimed by both sides . It will not do for the Conkling men to assume that all the members who acted with them will be with them now . The popular approval of Mr. Robertson 's confirmation must have its effect upon Assemblymen , as won all other persons . Talking with one of those accounted as a Stalwart , he said : " I lave not signed any paper for or against an Administration candidate . I shall sign cone . I believe that the action of cur Senators hag released me from ill obligation , to support them if they become candidates . I shall feel free to vote for the man I personally prefer , no matter what may be proposed by Stalwarts or halt-breeds . I propose that the Legislature shall remain here until it has elected two Senators . " This determination might as well become general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go home finally until it has elected the Senators . Gov . Cornell is determined about this , and said to-day , to a gentleman who called upon him , that if the Legislature should adjourn without electing , he should be compelled to reconvene it for the special purpose of filling the vacant places . The Governor has hesitated to express any opinion as to the course of exSenators Conkling and Platt in resigning , but to-day , in conversation , he plainly said that he regarded their action as unwise and much to be regretted . This disposes of all talk about a dead-lock , and for that matter not a Republican has been found who is in favor of taking an adjournment ? before electing Senators . A very hasty canvass of the Assembly served to dispose of the report that this proposition had any support , and also disproved the rumor that the Democrats have been seeking to secure a postponement , in the hope of securing a point against the Republicans by testing the legality of an election next session . Until the leaders , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disposition to rely for direction , shall intimate whether or not they wish to be renominated , it is net likely that the anti-Administration men will name candidates . In their anxiety to-day , some of the Conkling men went so far as to make inquiry as to whether it would not be well to draw up a petition . asking Conkling to come to Albany . Being here , it was believed he could tell his own story of his treatment by the President in a way that would soon reverse the whole situation . " Why , " said one ardent admirer of the exSenator this afternoon , , " if he would only some here and walk through the hail of the Delavan ho would make the half-breeds up stairs tremble . " In all conversation on the subject the possibility that it will become necessary to choose other candidates than Conkling and Platt is admitted , and guarded reference Is made to other prominent men . Gen. Grant 's name has been heard occasionally . The most popular name , however , at present , next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Judge Folger . A new candidate is heard of in Mr. John M. Francis , of Rensselaer , whose friends are desirous of putting him forward , while Mr. Chauncey M. Depew has allowed his friends to go on making his canvass . He has not established head-quarters or gone into business regularly , but there is no attempt on his part to conceal the fact that he is in the field . He begins his canvass under more favorable conditions than he did in January , and , as the most popular of the opponents of ThomasC . Platt in the last contest , he stands a much better chance of winning . Among the Erie men and their neighbors from the western part of the State , there is quite a difference of opinion as to the nomination of Gould for Collector of Buffalo . The " Half-breeds " of that part of the State say that he is the last man the President ought to have put in the place , while the Stalwarts , knowing him as a warm friend of James D. Warren , approve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and why he at the same time supplanted Marshal Payn by Mr. Knox , and sent back Senator Woodin 's dearest foe , MacDougal . The Administration men take these doses with slight shrugs in the interest of harmony , but with a strong desire to know the meaning of the business . The report published in some of the papers this morning that Col. George Bliss , of NewYork , would he sent in in the place of the Hon. S. L. Woodford , there was good ground for believing . It is said here that Mr. Bliss received a telegram from Washington a day or two ago asking him if he would take this place , and that he telegraphed back that he could not under present circumstances accept it . Should he do so after he had taken the liberty of criticising the course of the Administration toward the New-York Senators , it would look as though he had been bought off by presentation of an office . The Administration men had a long conference to-night in Senator Wagner 's room to talk over the situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platt , or for any candidate hostile to the Administration , was presented to several members who had decided during the day to add their names to it . Among the number said to have signed is AssemtQ.yman Peek , of St. Lawrence . It had already been signed by Senator Lynde . The course to be pursued about the caucus was considered informally , and it was the unanimous conclusion of those present that the Administration men would not consent to go into any caucus until they were strong enough to control nominations . A preliminary caucus to the general Republican caucus will be held by the Administration men . Tits Commercial Advertiser of to-night contains a long letter , purporting to have been sent by Secretary of State Blaine to Senator Robertson . The Senator says that the letter is unquestionably a fiction , as he had not received any such communication from Blaine , and does not regard it as at all likely that he was ever addressed in the terms or to the effect of this silly production . Many members of the Assembly were to-day granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haste with the declared purpose of ascertaining the sense of their constituents . Both the Conkling men and the supporters of the Administration claim that upon their return they will be " stiffened . " It remains to be seen whether they will be stiff for Conkling or for the Administration . Mr. Everett , Assemblyman from Putnam , received a telegram from Hamilton Fish , Jr. , rebuking him for having sold out and broken all his pledges . Mr. Everett had signed the Administration pledge and abandoned Conkling and Platt . Senator Robertson said to-day , in answer to an inquiry , that he did not intend to resign his Senatorship ; he was not one of the resigning kind , but always stuck to his post until he had performed the duties that his constituents elected him to perform . He will not assume his office as Collector until after the Legislature adjourns , and even then there will be no need of his resigning his Senatorship . There is a bare possibility that there might be an extra session called before the 1st of next January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
