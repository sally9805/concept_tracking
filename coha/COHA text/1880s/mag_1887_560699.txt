DEAR SIR : I am glad that I know you , even though some of my brethren look upon you as a monster because of your unbelief . I shall never forget the long evening I spent - at your house in Washington ; and in what I have to say , however it may fail to convince you , I trust you will feel that I have not shown myself unworthy of your courtesy or confidence . Your conversation then and at other times interested me greatly . I recognized at once the elements of your power over large audiences , in your wit and dramatic talent-personating characters and imitating tones of voice and expressions of countenance-and your remarkable use of language , which even in familiar talk often rose to a high degree of eloquence . All this was a keen intellectual stimulus . I was for the most part a listener , but as we talked freely of religious matters , I protested against your unbelief as utterly without reason . Yet there was no offence given or taken , and we parted , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further , we found many points of sympathy . I do not hesitate to say that there are many things in which I agree with you , in which I love what you love and hate what you hate . A man 's hatreds are not the least important part of him ; they are among the best indications of his character . You love truth , and hate lying and hypocrisy-all the petty arts and deceits of the world by which men represent themselves to be other than they are-as well as the pride and arrogance , in which they assume superiority over their fellow-beings . Above all , you hate every form of injustice and oppression . Nothing moves your indignation so much as " man's inhumanity to man , " and you mutter curses not loud but deep** on the whole race of tyrants and oppressors , whom you would sweep from the face of the earth . And yet you do not hate oppression more than I , nor love liberty more . // Nor will I admit that you have any stronger desire for that intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the last and greatest emancipation of mankind . Nor have you a greater horror of superstition . Indeed , I might say that you can not have so great , for the best of all reasons , that you have not seen so much of it ; you have not stood on the banks of the Ganges , and seen the Hindoos by tens of thousands rushing madly to throw themselves into the sacred river , even carrying the ashes of their dead to cast them upon the waters . It seems but yesterday that I was sitting on the back of an elephant , looking down on this horrible scene of human degradation . Such superstition overthrows the very foundations of morality . In place of the natural sense of right and wrong , which is written in men 's consciences and hearts , it introduces an artificial standard , by which the order of things is totally reversed : right is made wrong , and wrong is made right . It makes that a virtue which is not a virtue , and that a crime which is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have no relation whatever to natural goodness , but which rather exclude it by being a substitute for it . Penances and pilgrimages take the place of justice and mercy , benevolence and charity . Such a religion , so far from being a purifier , is the greatest corrupter of morals ; so that it is no extravagance to say of the ilindoos , who are a gentle race , that they might be virtuous and good if they were not so religious . But this colossal superstition weighs upon their very existence , crushing out even natural virtue . Such a religion is an immeasurable curse . I hope this language is strong enough to satisfy even your own intense hatred of superstition . You can not loathe it more than I do . So far we agree perfectly . But unfortunately you do not limit your crusade to the religions of Asia , but turn the same style of argument against the religion of Europe and America , and , indeed , against the religious belief and worship of every country and clime . In this matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; church and cathedral must go with the temple and the pagoda , as alike manifestations of human credulity , and proofs of the intellectual feebleness and folly of mankind . While under the impression of that memorable evening at your house , I took up some of your public addresses , and experienced a strange revulsion of feeling . I could hardly believe // my eyes as I read , so inexpressibly was I shocked . Things which I held sacred you not only rejected with unbelief , but sneered at with contempt . Your words were full of a bitterness so unlike anything I had heard from your lips , that I could not reconcile the two , till I reflected that in Robert Ingersoll ( as in the most of us ) there were two men , who were not only distinct , but contrary the one to the other  --  the one gentle a nd sweet-tempered ; the other delighting in war as his native element . Between the two , I have a decided preference for the former . I have no dispute with the quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his home ; but it is that other man over yonder , who comes forward into the arena like a gladiator , defiant and belligerent , that rouses my antagonism . And yet I do not intend to stand up even against him ; but if he will only sit down and listen patiently , and answer in those soft tones of voice which he knows so well how to use , we can have a quiet talk , which will certainly do him no harm , while it relieves my troubled mind . What then is the basis of this religion which you despise ? At the foundation of every form of religious faith and worship , is the idea of God . Here you take your stand ; you do not believe in God . Of course you do not deny absolutely the existence of a Creative Power. : for that would be to assume a knowledge which no human being can possess . How small is the distance that we can see before us ! The candle of our intelligence throws its beams but a little way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal darkness . Upon this no one insists more than yourself . I have heard you discourse upon the insignificance of man in a way to put many preachers to shame . I remember your illustration from the myriads of creatures that live on plants , from which you picked out , to represent human insignificance , an insect too small to be seen by the naked eye , whose world was a leaf , and whose life lasted but a single day ! Surely a creature that can only be seen with a microscope , can not know that a Creator does not exist ! This , I must do you the justice to say , you do not affirm . All that you can say is , that if there be no knowledge on one side , neither is there on the other ; that it is only a matter of probability ; and that , judging from such evidence as appeals to your senses and your understanding , you do not 6elieve that there is a // God . Whether this be a reasonable conclusion or not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now I am not going to argue against what the Catholics call " invincible ignorance " - an incapacity on account of temperament-for I hold that the belief in God , like the belief in all spiritual things , comes to some minds by a kind of intuition . There are natures so finely strung that they are sensitive to influences which do not touch others . You may say that it is mere poetical rhapsody when Shelley writes : " The awful shadow of some unseen power Floats , though unseen , among us . " But there are natures which are not at all poetical or dreamy , only most simple and pure , which , in moments of spiritual exaltation , are almost conscious of a Presence that is not of this world . But this , which is a matter of experience , will have no weight with those who do not have that experience . For the present , therefore , I would not be swayed one particle by mere sentiment , but look at the question in the cold light of reason alone . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can be entertained by the human mind . Its very greatness overpowers us , so that it seems impossible that such a Being should exist . But if it is hard to conceive of Infinity , it is still harder to get any intelligible explanation of the present order of things without admitting the existence of an intelligent Creator and Upholder of all . Copernicus , when he swept the sky with his telescope , traced the finger of God in every movement of the heavenly bodies . Napoleon , when the French savants on the voyage to Egypt argued that there was no God , disdained any other answer than to print upward to the stars and ask , " Who made all these ? " That is the first question , and it is the last . The farther we go , the more we are forced to one conclusion . No man ever studied nature with a more simple desire to know the truth than Agassiz , and yet the more he explored , the more he was startled as he found himself constantly face to face with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a great mystery , " meaning that it is something that we do not know anything about ? Of course , it is " a mystery . " But do you think to escape mystery by denying the Divine existence ? You only exchauge one mystery for another . // The first of all mysteries is , not that God exists , but that we exist . Here we are . How did we come here ? We go back to our ancestors ; but that does not take away the difficulty ; it only removes it farther off . Once begin to climb the stairway of past generations , and you will find that it is a Jacob 's ladder , on which you mount higher and higher until you step into the very presence of the Almighty . But even if we know that there is a God , what can we know of His character ? You say , " God is whatever we conceive Him to be . " We frame an image of Deity out of our consciousnessit is simply a reflection of our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Alps in certain states of the atmosphere-and then fall down and worship that which we have created , not indeed with our hands , but out of our minds . This may be true to some extent of the gods of mythology , but not of the God of Nature , who is as inflexible as Nature itself . You might as well say that the laws of nature are whatever we imagine them to be . But we do not go far before we find that , instead of being pliant to our will , they are rigid and inexorable , and we dash ourselves against them to our own destruction . So God does not bend to human thought any more than to human will . The more we study Him , the more we find that He is not what we imagined Him to be ; that He is far greater than any image of Him that we could frame . But , after all , you rejoin that the conception of a Supreme Being is merely an abstract idea , of no practical importance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of immeasurable importance . Let go the idea of God , and you have let go the highest moral restraint . There is no Ruler above man ; he is a law unto himself  --  a law which is as impotent to produce order , and to hold society together , as man is with his little hands to hold the stars in their courses . I know how you reason against the Divine existence from the moral disorder of the world . The argument is one that takes strong hold of the imagination , and may be used with tremendous effect . You set forth in colors none too strong the injustice that prevails in the relations of ' men to one another  --  the inequalities of society ; the haughtiness of the rich and the misery of the poor ; you draw lurid pictures of the vice and crime which run riot in the great capitals which are the centres of civilization ; and when // you have wound up your audience to the highest pitch , you ask , " How can it be that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the earth and sees all this horrible confusion , and yet does not lift His hand to avenge the innocent or punish the guilty ? " To this I will make but one answer : Does it convince yourself ? I do not mean to imply that you are conscious of insincerity . But an orator is sometimes carried away by his own eloquence , and states things more strongly than he would in his cooler moments . So I venture to ask : With all your tendency to skepticism , do you really believe that there is no moral government of the world-no Power behind nature " making for righteousness ? " Are there no retributions in history ? When Lincoln stood on the field of Gettysburg , so lately drenched with blood , and , reviewing the carnage of that terrible day , accepted it as the punishment of our national sins , was it a mere theatrical flourish in him to lift his hand to heaven , and exclaim , " Just and true are Thy ways , Lord God Almighty ! " Having settled it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceed in the same easy way to dispose of that other belief which lies at the foundation of all religion  --  the immortality of the soul . With an air of modesty and diffidence that would carry an audience by storm , you confess your ignorance of what perhaps others are better acquainted with , when you say , " This world is all that I know anything about , so far as I recollect . " This is very wittily put , and some may suppose it contains an argument ; but do you really mean to say that you do not know anything except what you " recollect , " or what you have seen with your eyes ? Perhaps you never saw your grandparents ; but have you any more doubt of their existence than of that of your father and mother whom you did see ? Here , as when you speak of the existence of God , you carefully avoid any positive affirmation : you neither affirm nor deny . You are ready for whatever may " turn up . " In your jaunty style , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation , you will accept it and make the best of it , and be " as ready as the next man to enter on any remunerative occupation ! " But while airing this pleasant fancy , you plainly regard the hope of another life as a beggar 's dream  --  the momentary illusion of one who , stumbling along life 's highway , sits him down by the roadside , footsore and weary , cold and hungry , and falls asleep , // and dreams of a time when he shall have riches and plenty . Poor creature ! let him dream ; it helps him to forget his misery , and may give him a little courage for his rude awaking to the hard reality of life . But it is all a dream , which dissolves in thin air , and floats away and disappears . This illustration I do not take from you , but simply choose to set forth what ( as I infer from the sentences above quoted and many like expressions ) may describe , not unfairly , your state of mind . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not speak of it in a serious way , but lightly and flippantly , as if it were all a matter of fancy and conjecture , and not worthy of sober consideration . Now , does it never occur to you that there is something very cruel in this treatment of the belief of your fellow-creatures , on whose hope of another life hangs all that relieves the darkness of their present existence ? To many of them life is a burden to carry , and they need all the helps to carry it that can be found in reason , in philosophy , or in religion . But what support does your . hollow creed supply ? You are a man of warm heart , of the tenderest sympathies . Those who know you best and love you most , tell me that you can not bear the sight of suffering even in animals ; that your natural sensibility is such that you find no pleasure in sports , in hunting or fishing ; to shoot a robin would make you feel like a murderer . If you see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help him . You can not see a child in tears but you want to take up the little fellow in your arms , and make him smile again . And yet , with all your sensibility , you hold the most remorseless and pitiless creed in the world  --  a creed in which ' there is not a gleam of mercy or of hope . A mother has lost her only son . She goes to his grave and throws herself upon it , the very picture of woe . One thought only keeps her from despair : it is that beyond this life there is a world where she may once more clasp her boy in her arms . What will you say to that mother ? You are silent , and your silence is a sentence of death to her hopes . By that grave you can not speak : for if you were to open your lips and tell that mother what you really believe , it would be that her son is blotted out of existence , and that she can never look upon his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and crush the last hope of a broken heart . When such sorrow comes to you , you feel it as keenly as any // man . With your strong domestic attachments one can not pass out of your little circle without leaving a great void in your heart , and your grief is as eloquent as it is hopeless . No sadder words ever fell from human lips than these , spoken over the coffin of one to whom you were tenderly attached : " Life is but a narrow vale , between the cold and barren peaks of two eternities ! " This is a doom of annihilation , which strikes a chill to the stoutest heart . Even you must envy the faith which , as it looks upward , sees those " peaks of two eternities , " not " cold and barren , " but warm with the glow of the setting sun , which gives promise of a happier to-morrow ? I think I hear you say , " So might it be ! Would that I could believe it ! " for no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I do not forget the tone in which you said : " Life is very sad to me ; it is very pitiful ; there is n't much to it . " True indeed ! With your belief , or want of belief , there is very little to it ; and if this were all it would be a fair question whether life were worth living . In the name of humanity , let us cling to all that is left us that can bring a ray of hope into its darkness , and thus lighten its otherwise impenetrable gloom . I observe that you not unfrequently entertain yourself and your audiences by caricaturing certain doctrines of the Christian Religion . The " Atonement , " as you look upon it , is simply " punishing the wrong man " - letting the guilty escape , and putting the innocent to death . This is vindicating justice by permitting injustice . But is there not another side to this ? Doem not the idea of sacrifice run through human life , and ennoble human character ? You see a mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enduring every hardship , till at last , worn out by her labor and her privation , she folds her hands upon her breast . May it not be said truly that she gives her life for the life of her children ? History is full of sacrifice , and it is the best part of history . I will not speak of " the noble army of martyrs , " but of heroes who have died for their country or for liberty-what is it but this element of devotion for the good of others that gives such glory to their immortal names ? how then should it be thought a thing without reason that a Deliverer of the race should give His life for the life of the world ? So , too , you find a subject for caricature in the doctrine of " Regeneration . " But what is regeneration but a change of // character shown in a change of life ? Is that so very absurd ? Have you never seen a drunkard reformed ? Have you never seen a man of impure life , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the prodigal , " come to himself " - that is , awakened to his shame ; and turning from it , come back to the path of purity , and finally regained a true and noble manhood ? Probably you would admit this , but say that the change was the result of reflection , and of the man 's own strength of will . The doctrine of regeneration only adds to the will of man the power of God . XVe believe that man is weak , but that God is mighty ; and that when man tries to raise himself , an arm is stretched out to lift him up to a height which he could not attain alone . Sometimes one who has led the worst life , after being plunged into such remorse and despair that he feels as if he were enduring the agonies of hell , turns back and takes another course : he becomes " a new creature , " whom his friends can hardly recognize as he " sits clothed and in his right mind . " The change is from darkness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has known but one such case will never say that the language is too strong which describes that man as " born again . " If you think that I pass lightly over these doctrines , not bringing out all the meaning which they bear , I admit it . I am not writing an essay in theology , but would only show , in passing , by your favorite method of illustration , that the principles involved are the same with which you are familiar in every-day life . But the doctrine which excites your bitterest animosity is that of Future Retribution . The prospect of another life , reaching on into an unkuown futurity , you would contemplate with composure were it not for the dark shadow hanging over it . But to live only to suffer ; to live when asking to die ; to " long for death , and not be able to find it " - is a prospect which rouses the anger of one who would look with calmness upon death as au eternal sleep . The doctriue loses none of its terrors in passing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means by which you work upon the feeliugs of your hearers . You pronounce it " the most horrible belief that ever entered the human mind : that the Creator should bring beings into existence to destroy them ! This would make Him the most fearful tyrant in the universe-a Moloch devouring his own children ! " I shudder when // I recall the fierce energy with which you spoke as you said , " Such a God I hate with all the intensity of my being ! " But gently , gently , Sir ! We will let this burst of fury pass before we resume the conversation . When you are a little more tranquil , I would modestly suggest that perhaps you are fighting a figment of your imagination . I never heard of any Christian teacher who said that " the Creator brought beings into the world to destroy them ! " Is it not better to moderate yourself to exact statements , especially when , with all modifications , the subject is one to awaken a feeling the most solemn and profound ? Now I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will not quote a single text . I only ask you whether it is not a scientific truth that the effect of everything which is of the nature of a cause is eternal . Science has opened our eyes to some very strange facts in nature . The theory of vibrations is carried by the physicists to an alarming extent . They tell us that it is literally and mathematically true that you can not throw a ball in the air but it shakes the solar system . Thus all things act upon all . What is true in space may be true in time , and the law of physics may hold in the spiritual realm . When the soul of man departs out of the body , being released from the grossness of the flesh , it may enter on a life a thousand times more intense than this : in which it will not need the dull senses as avenues of knowledge , because the spirit itself will be all eye , all ear , all intelligence ; while memory , like an electric flash , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into view ; and the moral sense will be quickened as never before . Here then we have all the conditions of retribution-a world which , however shadowy it may seem , is yet as real as the homes and habitations and activities of our present state ; with memory trailing the deeds of a lifetime behind it ; and conscience , more inexorable than any judge , giving its solemn and final verdict . With such conditions assumed , let us take a case which would awaken your just indignation-that of a selfish , hard-hearted , and cruel man ; who sacrifices the interests of everybody to his own ; who grinds the faces of the poor , robbing the widow and the orphan of their little all ; and who , so far from making restitution , dies with his ill-gotten gains held fast in his clenched hand . How long must the night be to sleep away the memory of such a hideous life ? If he wakes , will not the recollection cling to him // still ? Are there any waters of oblivion that can cleanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surely he can not forgive himself for the baseness which now he has no opportunity to repair . Here , then , is a retribution which is inseparable from his being , which is a part of his very existence . The undying memory brings the undying pain . Take another case-alas ! too sadly frequent . A man of pleasure betrays a young , innocent , trusting woman by the promise of his love , and then casts her off , leaving her to sink down , down , through every degree of misery and shame , till she is lost in depths which plummet never sounded , and disappears . Is he not to suffer for this poor creature 's ruin ? Can he rid himself of it by fleeing beyond " that bourne from whence no traveler returns ? " Not unless he can flee from himself : for in the lowest depths of the under-world  --  a world in which the sun never shines-that image will still pursue him . As he wanders in its gloomy shades , a pale form glides by him like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in its sorrow , but with a look upon it as of one who has already suffered an eternity of woe . In an instant all the past comes back again . He sees the young , unblessed mother wandering in some lonely place , that only the heavens may witness her agony and her despair . There he sees her holding up in her arms the babe that had no right to be born , and calling upon God to judge her betrayer . How far in the future must he travel to forget that look ? Is there any escape except by plunging into the gulf of annihilation ? Thus far in this paper I have taken a tone of defence . But I do not admit that the Christian religion needs any apology ,  --  it needs only to be rightly understood to furnish its own complete vindication . Instead of considering its " evidences , " which is but going round the outer walls , let us enter the gates of the temple and see what is within . Here we find something better than " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Founder of our Religion , and not its Founder only , but its very core and being . Christ is Christianity . Not only is He the Great Teacher , but the central subject of what He taught , so that the whole stands or falls with Him . In our first conversation , I observed that , with all your sharp comments on things sacred , you professed great respect for the ethics of Christianity , and for its author . " Make the Sermon on // the Mount your religion , " you said , " and there I am with you . " Very well ! So far , so good . And now , if you will go a little further , you may find still more food for reflection . All who have made a study of the character and teachings of Christ , even those who utterly deny the supernatural , stand in awe and wonder before the gigantic figure which is here revealed . Renan closes his " Life of Jesus " with this as the result of his long study : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be renewed without ceasing ; his story l6gende will draw tears from beautiful eyes without end ; his sufferings will touch the finest natures ; ALL THE AGES WILL PROCLAIM THAT AMONG THE SONS OF MEN THERE HAS NOT RISEN A GREATER THAN JESUS ; * ) while Rousseau closes his inimortal eulogy by saying , " SOCRATES DIED LIKE A PHILOSOPHER , BUT JESUS CHRIST LIKE A GOD ! " Here is an argument for Christianity to which I pray you to address yourself . As you do not believe in miracles , and are ready to explain everything by natural causes , I beg you to tell us how came it to pass that a Hebrew peasant , born among the hills of Galilee , had a wisdom above that of Socrates or Plato , of Confucius or Buddha ? This is the greatest of miracles , that such a Being has lived and died on the earth . Since this is the chief argument for Religion , does it not become one who undertakes to destroy it to set himself first to this central position , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ address one of the great audiences that hang upon your words , is it unfair to ask that you lay aside such familiar topics as Miracles or Ghosts , or a Reply to Talmage , and tell us what you think of JESUS CHRIST ; whether you look upon Him as an impostor* or merely as a dreamer  --  a mild and harmless enthusiast ; or are ready to acknowledge that He is entitled to rank among the great teachers of mankind ? But if you are compelled to admit the greatness of Christ , you take your revenge on the Apostles , whom you do not hesitate to say that you " do n't think much of . " In fact , you set them down in a most peremptory way as " a poor lot . " It did seem rather an unpromising lot , " that of a boat-load of fishermen , from which to choose the apostles of a religion - almost as unpromising as it was to take a rail-splitter to be the head of a nation in the greatest crisis of its history ! But perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that // chose better than we . It might puzzle even you to give a better definition of religion than this of the Apostle James : " Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this : to visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction , and to keep himself unspotted from the world ; " or to find among those sages of antiquity , with whose writings you are familiar , a more complete and perfect delineation of that which is the essence of all goodness and virtue , than Paul 's description of the charity which " suffereth long and is kind ; " or to find in the sayings of Confucius or of Buddha anything more sublime than this aphorism of John : " God is love , and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God , and God in him. ** And here you must allow me to make a remark , which is not intended as a personal retort , but simply in the interest of that truth which we both profess to seek , and to count worth more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careful thinker , who measures his words and weighs them in a balance . Your lectures remind me of the pictures of Gustave Dor6 , who preferred to paint on a large canvas , with figures as gigantesque as those of Michael Angelo in his Last Judgment . The effect is very powerful , but if he had softened his colors a little ,  --  if there were a few delicate touches , a mingling of light and shade , as w4*en twilight is stealing over the earth ,  --  the landscape would be more true to nature . So , believe me , your words would be more weighty if they were not so strong . But whenever you touch upon religion you seem to lose control of yourself , and a vindictive feeling takes possession of you , which causes you to see things so distorted from their natural appearance that you can not help running into the broadest caricature . You swing your sentences as the woodman swings his axe . Of course , this " slashing " style is very effective before a popular audience , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has to be sifted and weighed ; but wants opinions off-hand , and likes to have its prejudices and hatreds echoed back in a ringing voice . This carries the crowd , but does not convince the philosophic mind . The truth-seeker can not cut a road through the forest with sturdy blows ; he has a hidden path to trace , and must pick his way with slow and cautious step to find that which is more precious than gold . But if it were possible for you to sweep away the " evidences // of Christianity , " you have not swept away Christianity itself ; it still lives , not only in tradition , but in the hearts of the people , entwined with all that is sweetest in their domestic life , from which it must be torn out with unsparing hand before it can be exterminated . To begin with , you turn your back upon history . All that men have done and suffered for the sake of religion was folly . The Pilgrims , who crossed the sea to find freedom to worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable fanatics . There is no more place in the world for heroes and martyrs . He who sacrifices his life for a faith , or an idea , is a fool . The only practical wisdom is to have a sharp eye to the main chance . If you keep on in this work of demolition , you will soon destroy all our ideals . Family life withers under the cold sneer-half pity and half scorn-with which yoa look down on household worship . Take from our American firesides such scenes as that pictured in the Cotter 's Saturday Night , and you have taken from them their most sacred hours and their tenderest memories . The same destructive spirit which intrudes into our domestic as well as our religious life , would take away the beauty of our villages as well as the sweetness of our homes . In the weary round of a week of toil , there comes an interval of rest ; the laborer lays down his burden , and for a few hours breathes a serener air . Th* Sabbath morning has come : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , The bridal of the earth and sky . " At the appointed hour the bell rings across the valley , and sends its echoes among the hills ; and from all the roads the people come trooping to the village church . Here they gather , old and young , rich and poor ; and as they join in the same act of worship , feel that God is the maker of them all . Is there in our national life any influence more elevating than this-one which tends more to bring a community together ; to promote neighborly feeling ; to refine the manners of the people ; to breed true courtesy , and all that makes a Christian village different from a cluster of Indian wigwams  --  a civilized community different from a tribe of savages ? All this you would destroy : you would abolish the Sabbath , or have it turned into a holiday ; you would tear down the old church , so full of tender associations of the living and the dead , or at least // 142 have it " razeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heaven ; and the interior you would turn into an assembly rooma place of entertainment , where the young people could have their merry-makings , except perchance in the warm Summer-time , when they could dance on the village green ! So far you would have gained your object . But would that be a more orderly community , more refined or more truly happy ? You may think this a mere sentiment-that we care more for the picturesque than for the , true . But there is one result which is fearfully real the destructive creed , or no creed , which despoils our churches and our homes , attacks society in its first principles by taking away the support of morality . I do not believe that general morality can be upheld without the sanctions of religion . There may be individuals of great natural force of character , who can stand alone-men of superior intellect and strong will . But in general human nature is weak , and virtue is not the spontaneous growth of childish innocence . Men do not become pure and good by instinct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education ; and it needs all the elements of strength which can be given it , from without as well as frogi within , from the government of man and the government of God . To let go of these restraints is a peril to public morality* You feel strong in the strength of a robust manhood , well poised in body and mind , and in the centre 9f a happy home , where loving hearts cling to you like vines round the oak . But many to whom you speak are quite otherwise . You address thousands of young men who have come out of country homes , where they have been brought up in the fear of God , and have heard the morning and evening prayer . They come into a city full of temptations , but are restrained from evil by the thought of father and mother , and reverence for Him who is the Father of us alla feeling which , though it may not have taken the form of any profession , is yet at the bottom of their hearts , and keeps them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , who is thus " guarded and defended* ' as by unseen angels , some evening when he feels very lonely , is invited to " go and hear Ingersoll , " and for a couple of hours listens to your caricatures of religion , with descriptions of the prayers and the psalm-singing , illustrated by devout grimaces and nasal tones , which set the house in roars of laughter , and are received with tumultuous applause . When it is // all over , and the young man finds himself again under the flaring lamps of the city streets , he is conscious of a change ; the faith of his childhood has been rudely torn from him , and with it " a glory has passed away from the earth ; " the Bible which his mother gave him the morning that he came away , is " a mass of fables ; " the sentence which she wished him to hang on the wall , " Thou , God , seest me , " has lost its power , for there is no God that sees him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So he reasons as he walks slowly homeward , meeting the temptations which haunt these streets at night-temptations from which he has hitherto turned with a shudder , but which he now meets with a diminished power of resistance . Have you done that young man any good in taking from him what he held sacred before ? Have you not left him morally weakened ? From sneering at religion , it is but a step to sneering at morality , and then but one step more to a vicious and profligate career . How are you going to stop this downward tendency ? IV hen you have stripped him of former restraints , do you leave him anything in their stead , except indeed a sense of honor , self-respect , and selfinterest ? - worthy motives , no doubt , but all too feeble to withstand the fearful temptations that assail him . Is the chance of his resistance as good as it was before ? Watch him as he goes along that street at midnight ! He passes by the places of evil resort , of drinking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of music and dancing , and for the first time pauses to listen . How long will it be before he will venture in ? With such dangers in his path , it is a grave responsibility to loosen the restraints which hold such a young man to virtue . These gibes and sneers which you utter so lightly , may have a sad echo in a lost character and a wretched life . Many a young man has been thus taunted until he has pushed off from the shore , under the idea of gaining his " liberty , " and ventured into the rapids , only to be carried down the stream , and left a wreck in the whirlpool below ! You tell me that your object is to drive fear out of the world . That is a noble ambition : if you succeed , you will be indeed a deliverer . Of course you mean only irrational fears . You would not have men throw off the fear of violating the laws of nature : for that would lead to incalculable misery . You aim only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how are you going // to get rid of these ? You trust to the progress of science , which has dispelled so many fears arising from physical phenomena , by showing that calamities ascribed to spiritual agencies are explained by natural causes . But science can only go a certain way , beyond which we come into the sphere of the unknown , where all is dark as before . How can you relieve the fears of othersindeed how can you rid yourself of fear , believing as you do that there is no Power above which can help you in any extremity ; that you are the sport of accident , and may be dashed in pieces by the blind agency of nature ? If I believed this , I should feel that I was in the grasp of some terrible machinery which was crushing me to atoms , with no possibility of escape . Not so does Religion leave man here on the earth , helpless and hopeless-in abject terror , as he is in utter darkness as to his fate-. but opening the heaven above him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing the end from the beginning , and ordering our little lives so that even the trials that we bear , as they call out the finer elements of character , conduce to our future happiness . God is our Father . We look up into His face with childlike confidence , and find that " His service is perfect freedom . " " Love casts out fear . " That , I beg to assure you , is the way , and the only way , by which man can be delivered from those fears by which he is all his lifetime subject to bondage . In your attacks upon Religion you do violence to your own manliness . Knowing you as I do , I feel sure that you do not realize where your blows fall , or whom they wound , or you would not use your weapons so freely . The faiths of men are as sacred as the most delicate manly or womanly sentiments of love and honor . They are dear as the beloved faces that have passed from our sight . I should think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mother if I could speak lightly of the faith in which they lived and died . Surely this must be mere thoughtlessness , for I can not believe that you find pleasure in giving pain . I have not forgotten the gentle hand that was laid upon your shoulder , and the gentle voice which said , " Uncle Robert would n't hurt a fly . " And yet you bruise the tenderest sensibilities , and trample down what is most cherished by millions of sisters and daughters and mothers , little heeding that you are sporting with " human creatures ' lives . " You are waging a hopeless war  --  a war in which you are certain // only of defeat . The Christian Religion began to be nearly two thousand years before you and I were born , and it will live two thousand years after we are dead . Why is it that it lives on and on , while nations and kingdoms perish ? Is not this " the survival of the fittest ? " Contend against it with all your wit and eloquence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can not fight against the instincts of humanity . It is as natural for men to look up to a Higher Power as it is to look up to the stars . Tell them that there is no God ! You might as well tell them that there is no Sun in heaven , even while on that central light and heat all life on earth depends . I do not presume to think that I have convinced you , or changed your opinion ; but it is always right to appeal to a man 's sober second thought "  --  to that better judgment that comes with increasing knowledge and advancing years ; and I will not give up hope that you will yet see things more clearly , and recognize the mistake you have made in not distinguishing Religion from Superstition-two things as far apart as " the hither from the utmost pole . " Superstition is the greatest enemy of Religion . It is the nightmare of the mind , filling it with all imaginable terrors  --  a black cloud which broods over half the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science to scatter its darkness . Whoever helps to sweep , it away , is a benefactor of his race . But when this is done , and the moral atmosphere is made pure and sweet , then you as well as we may be conscious of a new Presence coming into the hushed and vacant air , as Religion , daughter of the skies , descends to earth to bring peace and good will to men .
