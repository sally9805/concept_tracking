// 54 ' ment , that demand the spiritual factor , the personal equation , the allowance for exception , in the problem of national growth . Jn the absence of a sunlit atmosphere , they shine by inward light , and communicate heat and luster to their surroundings . When a link in the chain of evolution is missing , such are the forces that make up for it . But there are other forces , and certain modes of intellectual effort , which assist growth and somewhat forestall the ordinary process . Even criticism may do a share , and often by penetrative study of the leaders that reflect or stimulate the various tendencies of a people 's ideality . Of course a poet must represent his age and habitat ; a Grecian temple beside an Alleghanian trout-. brook might be lovely , but surely would be out of place and date . It is now my province to discover what special aids the poets of America have experienced , and what hindrances . In no modem country has ideality been more retarded than in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited production in the field of Poetry  --  the chief of imaginative arts . Yet I see that , in spite of these , the ultimate rise of an American school of poetry was swift and strong , and that its chiefs have had their aids no less than their obstacles , and have bravely confronted the latter . And thus we are brought directly to the preliminary issue . " MUCH has been written of late upon the topic of our native literature . Is there a distinctly American school ? If not , when and where shall we look for one ? What are , or should be , its special characteristics ? These and similar questions are frequently and somewhat vaguely discussed . Now , it is first to be observed that the radical quality of any national school , in any country or period , does not wholly depend upon the types , personages , localities , and other materials utilized by its artists and men of letters ; and this is especially true with regard to the work of a poet , in distinction from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artist is not derived from the images which his genius informs with life , and from the plots that serve his expression of the thought , passion , imagination , of his people and time . Mere reliance upon these will not suffice . Even a painter might devote his life to copying the groups he finds in his own streets , the streets themselves , and the fields and woods beyond them , yet not produce an original art , nor execute it in a fresh and native way . The mere dialect and legends of a province or section are powerless to convey their essential quality to the song of a poet who calls them to his aid . Mr. Grant White , therefore , is perfectly right when he suggests , for these and other reasons , that it is the spirit , not the letter , which giveth life ; that we must pay regard to the flavor , rather than to the form and color , of the fruit  --  to the distinctive character , not the speech and aspect , of the personage . Unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fresh and distinctive vision ,  --  unless these are radically different from the French , or German , or even the English , feeling and vision ,  --  they are not American , and our time has not yet come . But I am not with this distinguished and thoroughly American writer in his further claim that we still are essentially English , and shall be so for a long series of years to come ; that our literature , like the language we inherit , is wholly English , and must remain so for centuries , until " Anglo-Saxon and Hollander and German and Irishman and negro and Chinese shall have so blended their blood * * * that from the fusion a new race shall have sprung . " What I first call to mind is that there are few Americans , even those of but one remove , who are not instantly recognized abroad as being very different from Englishmen , not only with respect to feature , mold , and speech ,  - -  which vary according to the sections from which they come ,  --  but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way of looking at things . In both outward and inward traits they are pronounced distinctively un-English and " American , " however divided among themselves . Again , by so much as the style is the man , I believe that the literary product of this new people differs from the literary product of the English , or any other people of the Old World , and I hope to make that difference clear in the course of these essays . And I will remark , in passing , that " The Scarlet Letter , " a romance which Mr. White cites in illustration , to me appears thoroughly un-English in its mystical temper , and its undertone and atmosphere ; if not broadly American , it is locally so  --  the very fruit and out-giving of the New England sentiment that brooded in its author 's spirit , and of which it is a soul-wrought witness and dramatic chronicle . In fine , recognizing the error of those // 542 who , by a forced effort , would anticipate creations that will come only of themselves , or through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that already , in various walks of art , and in none more than in that to which our present study is devoted , we have exhibited the new and broad results , both of acclimatization and of a blending process , to which the ruling divisions of our population thus far have been subjected . Equally obvious are the minor distinctive phases , which , on the other hand , arise from the differentiation of the American people by influences that , in widely separated districts , have acted upon their inhabitants from the early settlements to the present time . The first-named phenomena are national , while those of the latter class may be termed sectional ; but all are American , whether they appertain to the whole , or to the subdivisions , of our intellectual yield . The type first suggested , that of a broadly national character , is plainly incomplete , and has wide room for maturer development . Let us measure it only at its worth . A restless and ill-adjusted spirit still pervades the heterogeneous elements of our nationality . Here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far apart , in physical attributes , as those of Norway and Sicily . Here are the emigrants or descendants of every people in Europe ,  --  to go no farther ,  - -  and all their languages , and customs , and traditions , and modes of feeling , at one time or another , have come with them . Hence our unconscious habitude of variety , the disinclination to cling to one way of life or thought until its perfect conclusion . There is a ferment in new blood . The American travels , and at first is delighted with the color and flavor of the region to which he has come , but soon wearies of them and pushes on to some new place where novel characteristics can be enjoyed . This is observable of all Anglo-Saxons , capricious yet steadfast as they are , but more so among ourselves than with respect to our British kinsmen . America has absorbed the traits of many lands and people ; the currents still set this way ; our modern intercourse with the world at large is close and unint*ermitting , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite as rapidly as the whirl and stir of the popular system can triturate and commingle them . It is too much , then , to expect that our art or song , from whatever section these may come , will exhibit a quality specifically American in the sense that the product of Italy is Italian , or that of France is French . At this distance , we , who watch others as we are watched ourselves , can readily see that the same causes which make our civilization assume the composite type are blending the politics , manners , dress , art , and letters of the several European countries ,  --  and this , however distinct their nationalities , in proportion to the growth of travel and interculture . But the United States are homogeneous in what pertains to the language and methods of their masterrace , and to this extent their homogeneity is definitely assured . Concerning the primal influences that affect the general tone of art and literature , mutual communication and understanding are so perfect that any changes or advances are almost simultaneous throughout our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far wrong in requiring that our home-product shall differ from their own ; that it shall be , at least , un-European ,  --  manifestly of the New World and not of the Old . Return to a consideration of the family likeness , physical and mental , which instantly is apparent to others as we visit the mother-land . If we ourselves are unconscious of it , or wonted to it ; if the air and fashion that we display seem to us imperceptible or of small account , they are not so regarded by our kinsmen , or by the guest who lands upon these shores . The stranger quickly perceives , and holds at its value , the general , the national , type . Material and psychological changes are correlative , and almost equally sure of external recognition . So far , therefore , from demanding absolute novelty in structure , language , or theme , of our home-poet , it is the duty of the critic to value the Americanism which great and small have displayed in quality of tone , and in faithful expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be found they have not fallen short . Those arbiters of foreign taste who do not acknowledge this , may be suspected of some unconscious insincerity . Not every mother as fair and ripe as England , and as affectionate , can look with perfect complacency upon a daughter growing to her own height and beauty before the world . To her eyes the maiden is still a child , and they own with reluctance , and very slowly , her attractiveness and the claims of her suitors . One by one the points of youth and inferiority , brought against America , have worn away , and now , when so many of us grant England this last // defense of her supremacy , it is with the respect due a mother , and with a courtesy perchance no less insincere than her avowal . The new Americanism is not so modest as to surrender any freehold or to be unconscious of its smallest advantages . The less essential novelties of structure , theme , and dialect already are discernible in the yield that represents our territorial subdivision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I believe , unquestioned , but our conceit is not overfed by an acknowledgment almost wholly due to grotesque and humorous exploits ,  --  a welcome such as a prince in his breathing-hour might give to a new-found jester or clown . American poetry , however , has not represented the popular life of our continental slopes and corners merely in their coarser traits . These sections are not so isolated as the Scottish highlands , or as those mountain nooks in Italy , where peasant women contentedly whirl the spindle and never visit the plains that glisten below ; yet some of them are long-settled , and have an abiding population , with habits more or less confirmed . Where there is the least of change and interruption , and the colonial blood is most unmixed , the national ennui does not prevail ; the sentiment and instinct of the people , if limited , are clearly understood , and have been fairly expressed in poetry and prose-romance . In a certain sense , it is natural for the citizen of so vast and various a country to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the appeals of his own locality . There is still a lagging behind full nationality , just as Federal supremacy , in the hearts of a great multitude , gives precedence to " State rights . " Yet there are signs of growth toward an imagination in keeping with our political enlargement . The new Americanism , with relation to literature and the arts of beauty and construction , is seen in the very search for it , in the closer inspection of our own ground , in our more realistic method-in the genuine quality of our modem poetry and creative prose , so much more indigenous than the work of the neo-Romantic English school , and presenting so fresh a contrast to the poetry and prose of our early periods ; finally , in the greater value set upon our home-workers , upon our ventures for ourselves . It is curious to note the minor symptoms of this change . As time has lessened our yearning for the mother-country , native Americans less fondly cling to 543 the old words and traditions . The landlords who cater to foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their hotels , and a fresh English colony , after the manner of our ancestors , calls its village Rugby  --  but the reproach of this barrenness of nomenclature is fast passing away , and the time has come when the declaration of our independence may be made to include the fields of literature and art . And , indeed , if under the free system of a democracy , art does not show in time as proud a result-whether in the product of its disciples or in the wealth of its libraries and museums-as in countries where it is fed by governmental patronage and subsidies , then our republicanism , upon its aesthetic side , is itself a failure . So far as poetry is concerned , I see that we have already had the first period of what may be called , for want of a better term , a true American school . I see that this school was slow to rise , uiitil suddenly a number of its leaders appeared at once ; that its first tuneful season has been completed , so that , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , may honestly recount its triumphs . But that our lyrical product has not been so obvious as our material grandeur , that it has put on a national type less complete than the types of various sections , that it has been but a delightful promise of what a new song will create for us when poetry comes in vogue again throughout the world , - this , too , is not to be gainsaid . Before examining what we have done , let us see what we have not been able to do until recently , and what not at all . It is time to indicate the early and latter restrictions that have hemimed in the poets , and limited the poetry , of the western world . III . THE poets themselves , naturally , would be slow to perceive the causes of their difficulties . The brain is not always conscious of its own malaise . Nevertheless , I think that to each true singer , as he arrived at a period when his intellectual faculty sought the rationale of his successes and failures , the facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this people was long retarded by certain interdicts , and at last forced its way to expression under very baffling and perplexing conditions , some of which are even now felt . So far as the embarrassments peculiar to the new epoch are involved , // 544 it was a perception of these that led me to observe their bearing on the poets of England , before venturing to write upon our own . To these matters I shall again refer , after some mention of the absolute barriers which shut out the Muses from these shores until so late a time . For two centuries , in truth , the situation here was so adverse to art , and especially to song , as to nullify even our complement to Tame 's theory ; to stifle , or to divert to other than ideal uses , * any exceptional genius that existed , and that would have made its way against restnctions not of themselves quite as exceptional . The modified results of this situation may still be observed . As a rider to all I have said of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fail , also , to consider the repugnance of the general mind to disassociate things and ideas  --  to separate the spirit of a work from what is used for its 6onstruction . There is a natural expectation that the art of a country will convey to us something of the national history , aspect , social law . On the whole , it has been the instinct of masters to avail themselves , so far as might be , in their plots , manners , , and scenery , of the region nearest them ; a wise instinct , through which they reach closely to nature , and are more sure to make their work of interest elsewhere and afterward . Shakspere 's men are apt to be Englishmen , though they may figure in Illyria or Rome . Nor is it entirely through unfairness and caprice that the free range allowed to English poets has been denied our own . The Old World has drawn its countries together , like elderly people in a tacit alliance against the strength of youth which can not return to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not share . There is , also , something worth an estimate in the division of an ocean gulf ; that makes us like the people of a new planet ; and when those on the other side hear us sounding the changes upon familiar themes , with voices not unlike their own , they well may feel as if the highest qualities of our song were not full compensation for its lack of * I am not considering the question whether a poet of the first rank may , or may not , find his natural vocation under the most adverse conditions , and overcome them ; but am trying to see why a general poetic movement , embracing many true poets , was deferred until Longfellow , Poe , Whittier , Emerson , Lowell , Whitman , and others of the generation under review , appeared almost simultaneously . An article which seeks to regard many factors of a problem should be read wholly and in detail , or it will be misinterpreted . " something rich and strange . " A response may fairly be expected to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who look to us from across the seas . Here begin the special restrictions of an American poet . He represents , it is true , the music and ardor of a new country , of a land his race has peopled for two hundred and fifty years , a nation that has completed its first century . A new land , a new nation - yet not forced , like those which have progressed from barbarism to a sense of art , to create a language and literature of their own ; a new land with an old language , a new nation with all the literature and traditions behind it of the country from whose colonies it has sprung . While the thought and learning of this people began in America just where it had reached in the mother-land at the dates of the respective settlements , the physical state and environment of Americans were those of men who find themselves encountering the primitive nature of a savage world ; with this difference , that they were equipped for the struggle , not as an aboriginal race , but with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind them . All the drags , the anchorage , the limitations , involved in the word Colonial , retarded a new ideality . The colonial restriction has been well determined . It made the western lyre , until the period covered by this survey , a mechanism to echo , without fresh and true feeling , notes that came from over sea . It so occupied this people with a stern , steadfast , ingenious , finally triumphant , contest with Nature , that their epic passion was absorbed in the clearing of forests , bridging of rivers , the conquest of savage and beasts , the creation of a free government ; and this labor is not yet ended-it goes on with larger cohorts , and immensely widening power . But the imagination never dies , and when our first leisure came for its exercise it was awakened by contact with the Nature thus tamed-by communion with the broadest panorama of woods and hills and waters , under the most radiant skies , that civilized man has ever found himself confronting . Pioneers in art and poetry here caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to give token of novel results . The very ease with which books containing the world 's best literature were obtainable in the backwoods made our early writers copyists . The painters , meanwhile , had to lament the absence of galleries in this country , and their own inability to go abroad // and study . Thrown upon themselves , and deficient in technical knowledge , they sought for models in the nature about them ; and thus began our landscape-school of painting , the work of which , however rude and defective , was more original than the verse wherewith it was contemporary . A poet of the first rank is not given to every country , nor to every age . But poets of gifts approaching those of our living favorites doubtless have been born in America , according to Nature 's average , at different times of our history . Until recently , the stimulants of their genius must have been wanting . It may be that the people had no real need of them , and song and art , no more than invention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there does not concern us . The stone on which our colonial life was founded was frigid as an arctic bowlder-there was no molecular motion to give out life and heat . Who were the mute , inglorious Miltons ? Of what kind is the verse that was produced ? Does it move us ? Is it poetry ? However fine the cast of individuals , the effect of a perpetual contest with the elemental , often sinister , always gigantic , forces of a new continent , would be so adverse to art , so directly in the line of necessity and temporal gain , as to stifle their poetic fire , to develop a heroism that was stolid and unimaginative , to mark persons and communities with sternness and angularity , leading them to a homely gauge of values , not wont to esteem the ideal at its true worth . The aspir*ition of a refined nature would seem to the multitude foolishness and a stumbling-block . For a prolonged season the art of writing verse was almost solely a luxury of the professional classes in America , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not to the wigged and gowned that we instinctively listen for the music and freedom of creative song . And if poetry even in England , from the middle of the seventeenth century to the close of the eighteenth , stupidly fashioned itself upon the models of worn-out schools , how should it do more in England 's colonies-that brought hither certain shoots of taste and learning from the Old World and found it hard to protect them at all in the sterile wild-woods of the New ? Such was the nature of the barriers which , in the early and later colonial periods , absolutely defied the overleaping of a single notable poet . We find little of more significance in the transition era of the Revolution , although a nation took on life . No poetry was begotten in the rage of that heroic strife ; its humor , hatred , hope , suffering , prophecy , were feebly uttered , so far as verse was concerned , in the mode and language inherited years before from the coarsest English satirists . There came at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began to have a song . Some few original notes were heard among our pipings . The positive bafflers were broken , and in their stead came the restrictions that are felt in some degree down to the present time . At the outset it may be said of republicanism itself-in which our pride and faith are based , and which we trust is ultimately to promote a literature and an art not below the standard of our bravest hope ,  --  that it hitherto has somewhat lessened the ardor of our poets , or kept it within temperate bounds . There is a craving for ideality of a certain kind , and in our liberal regions the sense of utility is not the sole controlling power . There is a wide manifestation of that which bears to pure ideality an inferior relationship . Our system has diffused the intelligence which lifts our people quite above the dullness and stolidity of the middle classes elsewhere , but has not yet brought them to the pitch of high emotion . It is a leveler , and in its early stages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that there have been few tall heads of grain above the even field . The general independence and comfort have not bred those dramatic elements which imply conditions of splendor and squalor , glory and shame , triumph and despair . In their stead we have the spirit of the American homesteads , and the loss to the artist of some darker contrast , that would make their virtue and piety more inspiring , certainly is their gain . In no other country are there so many happy little households-although there is a curious foreign belief to the contrary , derived from traveling acquaintanceship . This must be so in the one land where every man can own a portion of the soil and be a freeholder , and where a man 's toil meets no doubtful reward . The popular thrift and freedom , joined with the necessity for labor to steadily maintain them , are not at first productive of the tragic or entrancing dreams of effective art . Wisely bettering their material chances , men are too busy to feel a spiritual want . And the labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as of itself to feed the popular imagination . In default of Homer , we at least have Hector and Achilles ; and the peerless exploits of our engineers , capitalists , discoverers , speak louder than a minstrel 's words . In all this amazing drama of triumphant effort and organization ; in the adjustment of our political theory , dependent on statesmanship , and leading to oratory and journalism rather than to art and song ; in the despotism of our social unwritten law that an American must be a good citizen first of all , and that the first duties of a citizen are to rear and maintain a family ; in the implied doubt as to the sanity of enduring privations for the sake of the ideal , when , by deserting it , a practical success may be had ,  --  amid all this the man of genius has too often betaken himself to the work of his neighbors , and those who keep faith with the Muse have found themselves perplexed and out of time . Nevertheless I repeat that , up to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as they will have their votes , their seats in church , their county papers , and the piano or melodeon in every house . A throng of minor singers have answered to the demand with very natural and unaffected voices . The select few , in those efforts which place them above their comrades , not only have suffered from the want of a popular following , but from the undue favor awarded their minor and ordinary productions . These adverse influences , belonging to the soil and air , are perhaps not so directly comprehended by the American poet as are the obvious and technical impediments which have force when he essays a sustained and novel work . In considering these , let us acknowledge that they do not greatly concern the emotional and lyric poet . He is at no loss for a method or a theme ; the latter is at once the cause and modulator of his song . Personal joys and griefs , special occurrences in history or related to the individual lifethese have inspired , and do inspire , the briefer poems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our verse . Their range is wide , from the simple fireside ballad to the impassioned ode , and my estimate of their remarkable freshness and variety will be given more fully hereafter . At present I would say that among them are many admirable of their kind , and that the relative number of these is not less than can be found in the popular verse of other lands . An American critic fails in discernment or independence who does not see this and avow it . But , while the lyrical songster need not cast about for a subject , and does not even look into his heart to write-for his heart has already moved him  --  the ambitious poet is best equipped for a larger effort by some adequate theme awaiting his hand . The moment arrives when poets of the upper cast desire to forego their studies and brief lyrical flights , and to produce the composite and heroic works that rank as masterpieces . These leaders often have been arrested , with respect to romantic or epic structures , by a scarcity of home-themes , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our equable American life . I am aware that this statement frequently is derided , and that many poets , while realizing that their product is too meager , will not acknowledge its force . Others , and these of our foremost , who have thought to analyze their experience , confess that it is true in no small measure , and have stated this over their own hands . Up to the present date , absence of theme for a national masterpiece , for a work belonging to our own atmosphere and history , has been a result of the condition under which we started . Original art is long deferred among a people cultured at the outset . A writer has well said that " the cause of the absence of the legendary and poetic in our early history , may be attributed to the mental development of $he colonists , who had already passed through that historic stage . " They started at once with both church and school-house . The imagination was controlled by precedent , and " Art was cheated of its birthright . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was of the poetic or wondrous in their arduous , compelling life had a local range , - such as the trials for witchcraft , finely utilized by New England 's great romancer , and too inadequately , it must be owned , by her most famous poet . In Parkman 's elegant survey of certain picturesque epochs in colonial history , the feminine element , essential to complete dramatic quality , is usually wanting ; in other annals , like those of Spanish-American adventure , it scarcely appears at all . American antiquity is a rude settler 's antiquity ; a homely fashion that palls , because not long out of date ; a // story everywhere the same ,  --  furnishing at times the basis of some exquisite idyl , like " Evangeline , " but for none too many of them . " Evangeline " still remains the most notable of the longer American poems ; and how much of that is otherwise than scenic and idyllic , and how much of it does not fit the story to the landscape , rather than the landscape to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your freedom , your conquest , your noble woods and waters , your westward spread of men ! These are motives , accessories , atmosphere , often grander inmagnitude than elsewhere to be found , but not perforce more new . The poetic instinct does not always hold the macrocosm superior to the microcosm , the prairie to the plain of Marathon , the Hudson to the Cephisus or the Tweed . As for tatter-day history , this is not far enough removed . From the Revolution to the Civil War , the incidents of our life and passion are so recent and so plainly recorded as to gather no luminous halo from the too slight distance at which we observe them . The true poet will profit by them to the uttermost ; the limits are to be overcome , but still are limits and in his way . He is thrown upon the necessity of inventing dramatic themes for the broader range of poetic venture . This the great poets always have avoided , for the product of such invention usually has seemed artificial and remote from human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide-awake people are removed , not only from the superstitions that were a religion to our forefathers , but from the wondercraft and simple faith prevailing among the common folk of other lands than our own . The beautifying lens of fancy has dropped from our eyes . Where are our forest and river legends , our Lorelei , our Venusberg , our elves and kobolds ? We have old-time customs and traditions , and they are quaint and dear to us , but their atmosphere is not one in which we freely move . Just so with our heroism . No national changes and struggles have been of more worth than our own , but critics are not far wrong who point out that , however lofty the action and spirit of our latest crisis , heroism is not with us so much the chief business that one must be always " enthusiastic and on guard . " One of our poets aims to be especially national . He sings , upon theory , as the American bard must sing when the years have died away . The result is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of itself , and after long time be past ; a disjointed series of kaleidoscopic pieces , not constituting a master-work , but with all their strength and weakness , as unsatisfactory as the illassorted elements which he strives to represent . For he , too , as we shall see , is representative and a personage of mark , if not precisely in the direction of his own choice and assurance . To more clearly understand how far , and in what way , our poets must feel the lack of background , of social contrasts , and of legendary and specific incident , we may observe the literature of some region where different conditions exist . In an isolated country of established growth and quality , a native genius soon discovers his tendency and proper field . Look at Scotland . Her national melodies were ready and waiting for Burns ; her legends , history , traditions , for Walter Scott . The popular tongue , costumes , manners , all distinctively and picturesquely her own , affect the entire outcome of her song and art . Embraced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affords the paradigm we need . Enter the cathedral in Glasgow . Within the last thirty years that edifice has been refitted throughout with stained glass , contributed by the ancient families and clans . What associations are called up by the devices upon the windows in the chancel and nave , and in the impressive crypt below ! Among all the shields and names ,  --  those of Sterling , Hay , Douglas , Montrose , Campbell , Montgomerie , Lawrie , Buccleuch , Hamilton ,  - -  not one that is not utterly , purely Scottish . Even in our oldest and most characteristic sections , in Virginia or New England , influences like these do not prevail to any such extent . In a certain sense , they are not only influences but aids : they move , they stimulate , they belong to the life and memory of the native poet , and he avails himself of them without effort or consciousness . Not that they are the essential , the imperative aids . But to be without them is a restriction , and one which our first genuine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Strange , indeed , if the material wants of New-World life , its utilitarian test of values , and the general conditions of a primitive democracy , had not forced our early idealists into a struggle for existence which even the sturdiest found it hard to prolong . Two things are essential to the poetic aspiration that results in fine achievement : the sym // pathetic applause which ministers to the last infirmity of noble minds , and the common wage that enables a laborer to do his work . The rewards of authorship have been suffi-. sufficiently doubtful and varying in times before our own . In older lands , the poet , like his predecessor the minstrel , was at least protected and nourished by the good or great to whom he dedicated his song . Happily this kind of support was from the first impracticable in a liberal republic . But it long was impossible , on material grounds alone , - although certain enthusiasts might attempt to live upon love and fame ,  --  that any vigorous and prevailing flood of poesy should be sustained in toiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in art , as in life , ideal productiveness follows and does not precede material security and wealth . The most creative eras of historic lands were those when their cities were the richest , when their galleons sought out distant ports , and their nobles and burgesses , sure of life 's needs , craved for the luxuries of taste and emotion . Literature thrives as a means of subsistence , nor is poetry an exception to the rule . The supply answers to the demand . Not long ago , in this country , few books except school-books were required by the people ; and how should poetry , that looked from the printed page for its welcome and sustenance , be naturally composed ? We are speaking of an ethereal art , but quietly examining the law of its activity . It is , moreover , in America that the popular instinct , which resists whatever is asserted to be a tax upon knowledge , has worked with peculiar force against the development of a home-school . So long as our purveyors could avail themselves without cost or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to risk their means in behalf of native authorship . Pure idealists , men like Poe and Hawthorne , are little able to push their own fortunes . Until a state of law shall exist that will induce American publishers , driven from their distant foraging-grounds , to seek for genius at home and make it available , the support of our authors will not be so assured as to tend " in the end to the advancement of literature . " International copyright at least would have made it feasible for the poet to earn his living by general literary work , and to reserve some heart and thought for his nobler calling . Now , when a serious movement at last seems under way toward copyright reform . it still has been so hampered with reservations and class-interests that many ask whether it were not better to have no change at all than to have one that is partial , and that may postpone indefinitely the one thing needful , to wit : honest recognition of an author 's right of property in his own creations , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other kinds of estate . Literature verily has been almost the sole product of human labor that has not been rated as the lasting property of the producer and his heirs or assigns . This want of permanent copyright has borne severely upon authors in all countries , but most severely upon those of America , who have had to await the formation of public taste , to create their audiences , and who , while willing to suffer in their own persons , are less ready to devote life-times to the production of what will be valueless to those whom they hold most dear . The want of international copyright has been a grievous wrong to our brother-writers in Europe . Their complaints are just ; their cry has gone up for years . Great as the spoliations have been which they have endured , the effect upon our native literature and authorship has been no less disastrous . Our authors themselves do not comprehend it . A few of the great publishing houses , grown rich upon the system of free reprints , of late have felt this wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are generously atoning for it . We see them leaders in artistic and literary movements , the friends of authors and artists , receiving for their public and private humanities our warmest tributes of honor and affection . It is said that every wrong in this world is surely , if slowly , righted ; and the wrongs of authors doubtless will be set right . But who shall pick up water spilled to the ground . The writers of a new generation will never realize how bitter was the bread eaten by those who went before them and made their paths straight . Critical periods are sometimes uncreative , yet there is little doubt that our poetry has suffered , also , from the lack of those high and exquisite standards of criticism which have been established in older lands . The poet , the artist , alike need the correction of a fine censorship and the tonic of that just appreciation ' which is the promise of fame . American verse , within recent memory , has experienced , first , a popular favor gained by its weakest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rude exaggeration // of its defects , a refusal to acknowledge its value as compared with that of the foreign product , or to consider its higher aspirations as practicable and worthy of respect . The people at large have passed from sham emotion to irreverence , and to a relish for what is flippant and ephemeral . Then , too , our most sincere and painstaking authorities often seem at a loss to estimate the nature of art , and criticise it from metaphysical or doctrinarian points of view . The poet or painter sensitively feels the wrong and the error , and , though he makes no complaint , they tell upon his buoyancy and application . Only of late have we begun to look for criticism which applies both knowledge and self-knowledge to the test ; which is penetrative and dexterous , but only probes to cure ; which enters into the soul and purpose of a work , and considers every factor that makes it what it is ;  --  the criticism which , above all , esteems it a cardinal sin to suffer a verdict to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instinct of battle with an opposing clique or school . Such criticism is now essayed , and in the spirit of a select art , but often is too much occupied with foreign or recondite subjects to search out and foster what is of worth among ourselves . iv . THESE , it seems to me , have been the local and organic difficulties with which the American poet , wittingly or unwittingly , has had to contend . They are not figments of the brain ; their force has been real ; time and national development alone have lessened them ; during the continuation of their serious pressure the rise of poetry was delayed . It is curious to note that , just as their adverse influence began to pass away , a new class of restrictions came in play throughout the enlightened world , affecting our own idealists in common with those of the mother-land . When I long since began to think of the present work , I saw that the modem intellectual change was so absolute and noteworthy that I was compelled to examine its results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to attempt a review of the poets and poetry of England before entering upon our home-field-in order to justly comprehend the effect of the new atmosphere upon the spirit of poetry itself . In the first chapter of the " Victorian Poets , " certain perplexing elements are considered which have made the recent time one to which a hackneyed word , " transitional , " is more correctly applied than to any former period . The new learning  --  the passage from the child-like and phenomenal way of regarding things to the absolute , scientific penetration of their true entities and relations , has directly told upon the work of the poet , requiring new language , imagery , invention , as he adapts himself to a deeper purpose and the hope of a sublimer faith . I have pointed out , as well , the struggles , devices , defeats , and victories , of the English minstrels under the stress of latter-day iconoclasm and the invincible demands of modern thought ; taking into account , also , the minor and obvious forces antagonistic to a devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's material activity , displayed in labor , invention , construction ,  --  the world 's realistic eagerness , that makes of the newspaper , the novel , and the bulletins of science , the food and outlets of the imagination , and renders mankind intent alone upon each day 's labor , so to hasten on the golden year . Reluctant to confront these ceaseless and perturbing manifestations , until out of them the world shall have derived a more assured philosophy , and shall again have found repose , many of the latest singers have ignored them altogether ; the weaker busying themselves with mere dilettanteism and the technique of their vocation ,  --  the nobler being devoted to the worship of beauty pure and simple , and often going back to its early revelations and the antique forms . V. THESE generic burdens of the age itself have borne even more severely upon American idealists than upon their transatlantic brethren . Yet , it was when they first began to have their weight , and not until then , that the true light of Poetry in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlwind it brightened into dawn . Possibly the new learning was most of all needed here , as an offset to puritanism , superstition , and sentimentalism in its mawkish forms . Honest fact and a search for our own resources gave an impulse to healthy inspiration . But the opportunity for the achievements of our leading poets , now so famous and beloved in their hoary years , really came when the specific restrictions , to which so much space has been here devoted , at last yielded measurably to time // and national progress . Coincidently with their decline , certain positive Aids to our lyrical genius became apparent , and were felt , and aroused to joyous activity its instinct , courage , and imagination . First of all , as I have shown , the American with an eye for natural beauty , led by his seclusion to close and musing observation , had a subject for poetic expression in the landscape of the New World , by turns impressive , bewildering , reposeful , but always beautiful and strong . If its primeval aspect stupefied the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to defer the proper study of mankind , it afterward compelled our ideal recognition , and inspired the early and reverent anthems of the father of our choir . Next , and most vital of the elements required for the promotion of a home-school , a national feeling grew up when the compactness and growth of the United States , as a nation , became assured . Half a century was needed to bring this feeling to the blossoming form of art . Meanwhile , it had been strengthening and finding expression in other ways ; for example , in the patriotic eloquence which marked our oratory , and which warmed the blood and stirred the impulse of many a poetic youth , as he read in his school-books the speeches of the founders and preservers of liberty . Hence our strongest emotional traits-love of freedom , hatred of oppression , respect for ancestral faith , the sense of independence which makes an American stand erect and believe himself the peer of any man , the audacity and ambition found among no other people ; finally an adventurous habit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some of these traits came , it is true , a commonplace and widely diffused product in literature . But if a host of writers ended in mediocrity , this , too , was in the order of evolution . The poor books of one generation are often horn-books for the people , the promise and cause of better work in the next . The late Civil War was not of itself an incentive to good poetry and art , nor directly productive of them . Sttch disorders seldom are ; action is a substitute for the ideal , and the thinker 's or dreamer 's life seems ignoble and repugnant . But we shall see that the moral and emotional conflicts preceding the war , and leading to it , were largely stimulating to poetic ardor ; they broke into expression , and buoyed with earnest and fervid sentiment our heroic verse . Lastly , it must be observed that , about the time from which I date the appearance of a group of noteworthy poets , a material support was afforded to ideal work . Both artists and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gifts to some extent a means of subsistence . American publishers , as I have said , took heart , and made ventures in behalf of our own literature . Journalism also lent its aid , paying critical attention to native authors , and enabling not a few of them to gain a sure foot-hold by labor upon the great newspapers and magazines . All these aids , I repeat , came into service after the scientific restraint of the modern period began to have weight . They assisted us to bear up against it , and alleviated the special restrictions of an earlier time . The sweet and various measures of a band of genuine singers at length were heard , and found an audience in whatsoever regions know the English tongue . American poetry took its place in literature , and entered upon a first term , now drawing to an end , and included in the field of this review . @
