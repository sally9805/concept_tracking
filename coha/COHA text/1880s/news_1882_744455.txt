txt The Joliet Iron and Steel Company has determined to close its works on or before Dec. 1 , and other Western companies making Bessemer steel expect to follow suit speedily , thus throwing out of employmenkat least 20,000 skilled and unskilled wOrkmen . Two reasons are assigned for this action . The Joliet Company gives as its reason for this stop the fact that a majority of Congress hostile to the maintenance of the present tariff has been elected . and they propose to take in sail while they have time and at a slack season . Another reason , more potent than they acknowledge , is the recent decline in the price of steel rails . Within three months they have dropped from $50 to $45 , at which the manufacturers say they can not manufacture at a profit . Still the consideration that so many persons are dependent on the employment their mills fur . nish would have inclined them to continue , even at a small loss , had not the Scranton Company , within a few days , further reduced the price to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rolling Mills and the St. Louis companies to take the same step . To a Daily . News reporter President 0 . B. Potter , of the North Chicago Company , reasoned out the situation . The closing , he said , was duo to three causes  --  the decline in prices , disproportionate wages , and the probability that the tariff on steel rails will be reduced to $14 per ton , from no , as at present . ' : . The decline in Prices , he said , had been due to the decreased demand , which , however , depended on the belief of railway constructors that they would be able to buy ? the rails at nearly their own figures by holding off a little while . Very little rail laying is going on now on that account . The Scranton company 's action in sending the prices $3 lower had knocked the bottom out of the business . At $47 , he said , there would be a mere shaving of profit ; at $45 , a considerable loss , and at $42 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Potter attributed the disposition of Congress to reduce the tariff to Mr. A. S. Hewitt 's admission that the Harrisburg company , in which ho is interested , made 79 per cent . on its capital last year , Ho says that the public do not understand that the same output at present prices would cost them a net loss of $3 or more per ton . Most of the Western Bessemer companies became bankrupt between 1873 and : 879 , in their losing effort to maintain their plants and furnish work for their employes . This time they prefer to look after the interests of their shareholders and take in sail while they can do it without the loss of anything beyond interest on capital . He says the North Chicago Mill will probably shut down by Dec. 15 , while the Union Mill will keep open long enough to complete the orders on hand , which can be finished in less than 60 days . At this time last year they had orders on their books sufficient to keep them going for nine months . The thousands of workmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the strikers last Summer , but were taxed heavily to maintain those who struck , and the stopping of work at the beginning of Winter is looked forward to with grave apprehensions.
