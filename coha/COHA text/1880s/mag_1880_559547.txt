IN politics , morals , and law there is a field for presumption . The field is a limited one , usually , but within it the conclusions drawn are as trustworthy as are those which , in the broader field of testimony , rest upon positive proof . In politics , and in the light of this day , no presumption can be more just and reasonable than the presumption that every Democrat is opposed to the election of General Grant to the Presidency for a third time . And this opposition by Democrats is not on account of the example of Washington , or of the tradition of a century , or of the resolution of the House of Representatives of 1875 ; for they were quite as fiercely opposed to his first election in 1808 , to his second election in 1872 , when the example of Washington was inapplicable , when the tradition of the fathers could not be cited , when the resolution of the House of Representatives did not exist . Among Democrats the most conspicuous Democrat in this opposition to General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the March number of the " North American Review , " he gives his friends the benefit of his argument against the third election of General Grant , and inflicts upon his enemies the full force of his passions . He has seen nothing good or even hopeful in the events of the last twenty years ; and he has read of nothing bad in the annals of Rome , where chiefly his studies appear to have been , whether as republic or empire , which he does not apprehend for America in case of the election of General Grant for a third term . His argument against the election of any person to the Presidency a third time is based upon the example of Washington and the declarations of Jefferson . The authorities are good , and , when there was no trustworthy history , either for example or warning , except that of ancient Rome and the histories of the medieval and feudal states of Europe , the argument itself was not bad . // In the course of his article Judge Black has made many references to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best I can make but one . Gibbon says of the various modes of worship which prevailed in the Roman world that " all were considered by the people as equally true , by the philosopher as equally false , and by the magistrate as equally useful . " There is no violence in the assumption that Judge Black has been so absorbed by the thought that the example of Washington and the teachings of Jefferson could be made useful to the Democratic party in this its exigency , that he has neglected to consider with care the question whether , after a century of experience in free popular government , it is indeed true that the example of Washington in this respect is the only remaining bulwark for the protection of our assailed and imperiled liberties . If this be so , then the reputation of Washington will need a more ardent-perhaps I may not be permitted to say a more able-defender than even Judge Black himself . Washington was President of the Convention which framed the Constitution of the United States . That Constitution makes every male citizen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without limitation as to times , to the office of President of the United States . If the peril to the country from the repeated election of the same person to the Presidency was believed by Washington and his associates to be such as Judge Black now represents it , then Washington and his associates are wholly without excuse in their neglect of a great public duty . Nor is it an answer or defense to say that Washington intended to leave an example to his countrymen which , in the course of time , would , as a tradition , become as powerful for the protection of their rights and liberties as would be a written constitutional inhibition . Life is uncertain ; death is certain ; and in 1787 Washington could have had no assurance that he would be permitted by Divine Providence to hold the office of President for eight years , and at the close to give an example of voluntary abstention from worldly honors which should not only receive the approval of the living generation , but also command the respect and obedience of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jefferson was not a member of the Convention , anditis well known that its proceedings in many particulars were not approved by him . But to Mr. Jefferson , more than to any one else , is the country indebted for the first eleven articles of amendment to the Constitution-articles designed to render the liberties of the // people more secure against the encroachments of power . But these amendments are silent in regard to the Presidential office . Provision is made , however , that persons charged with crime shall have a perpetual constitutional right to compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in their favor ; that in all suits at common law , where the value in controversy exceeds twenty dollars , the right of trial by jury shall be preserved ; and yet no constitutional safeguard is erected against a manifest peril , a continuing menace to the institutions and liberties of an entire people . If Washington and Jefferson estimated the peril as Judge Black now says the peril was estimated by them , and as in fact the peril really is , who is sufficient to offer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Father of his Country or the Apostle of Liberty ? The original Constitution was wrought out in the presence and under the lead of Washington , and the amendments were framed at the dictation of Jefferson . Eight words in the Constitution or in an amendment would have furnished ample protection for all time . The words are not there , and why not ? Surely not because Washington and Jefferson were not patriotic men , nor because they were not far-seeing men , but because upon reflection they thought it unwise to place any limitation upon the power of the people to elect their rulers at stated times and in prescribed ways . The country is not lacking in veneration for Washington and Jefferson . That veneration will survive the criticism of Judge Howe , it will outlive the defense of Judge Black . And may one inquire whether there is anything in the example of Washington which warrants the opinion that this Government has not constitutional power to protect its own life ; or anything in the teachings of Jefferson inconsistent with the emancipation of the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Constitution of the country ; or if there is anything in the example or teachings of Washington or Jefferson which justifies Judge Black and the party that he represents in the attempt that was made to overthrow the Union , in the resistance to emancipation , and in the continuing effort to subvert the Government by the forcible suppression of the popular will ? In every age there are those who build the tombs of the prophets and garnish the sepulchres of the righteous , and yet deny justice to the living generation of men . If Judge Black 's argument against a third term shall receive only that degree of favor which has been accorded to his public teachings for the last twenty years , he may be assured that the chief // reason is to be found in the conduct of the party with which he is identified . That conduct has awakened the most serious apprehensions in the public mind touching the security of property and of personal political rights ; and these apprehensions not only justify but require the people to place the helm of government in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship of state safely through stormy seas . In quiet times the tradition of the fathers would be respected , and this without a careful examination of its value or of its applicability to modern affairs . It is to the teachings of Judge Black , and the associates of Judge Black , that the country is indebted for the circumstances in our public life which compel us to canvass the tradition upon its merits , to examine the circumstances in which it had its origin , and to consider and determine whether its authority is such , or its intrinsic value such , that in a grave exigency in public affairs , and in obedience to that tradition . *mlone , the man best qualified to protect personal rights and to defend public interests shall be excluded from the public service . If a strong man is needed at the head of the Government , the necessity arises from the circumstance that the spirit of rebellion , of resistance to the Constitution , is manifested by a large class of citizens . Those citizens , without exception , are Democrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ party . It is the purpose of the Republican party to suppress that spirit ; to render it powerless , absolutely , both in personal and in public affairs . And it may hap*. pen that , in accomplishing this result , the example of Washington and the tradition of the fathers will be disregarded . I admit the example , I recognize the tradition , and , with these admissions , it is my purpose to consider their binding force upon the country , their historical origin , their intrinsic value as guides in public affairs . There has been a serious effort to establish the proposition that what is called " the tradition of the fathers " is as binding upon the country as a limitation upon the power of the people would be if the restriction were a part of the Constitution itself . Judge Black sustains the notion , and gives to it the benefit of his rhetoric and his emphasis . Statement alone is sufficient upon this point . Argument is unnecessary . The opinions of Washington and Jefferson are entitled to the highest consideration as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead men to control the soil of the country ; and shall we without inquiry , without a judgment of our own , permit the opinions of dead men to control the thought and the policy of the country ? We have changed , indeed in some par // ticularawe have annihilated , the Constitution of Washington , the Constitution of the fathers , and therefor take equal honor for ourselves and for them , in the belief that if they were among us they would accept and ratify with acclaim the changes that have been made . And is the unwritten law more sacred ? May the people annul the written law of the fathers , and still be bound perpetually by their traditions ? It would not be strange if in these later days , and for a particular reason , the importance of Washington 's example had been unduly magnified . When he prepared his Farewell Address to his countrymen , the most important document that ever came from his pen , he omitted all reference to his own example in retiring from the Presidential office at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his successors a corresponding practice . un November , 1806 , the Legislature of Vermont nominated Mr. Jefferson for a third election to the Presidency . If he had then realized the dangers of such a proceeding as they are now set forth by Judge Black , would he have waited till December , 1807 , before he announced his purpose not to be a candidate for re*4ection ? It is a satisfaction that , even at this somewhat advanced stage of the discussion , I am in accord with Judge Black upon one point . He says , " The mere authority of names , however great , ought not to command our assent . " This is a sound proposition in ethics , in politics , and in law . All through these weary pages I am endeavoring to demonstrate its wisdom in matters of politics , and I relieve the tediousness of the hour by a single illustration designed to show its importance in matters of law . Judge Black , speaking of real estate , and not of politics , says , " A lease for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate without end , and makes him lord of the fee . " This sentence is admirably turned , and its rhetoric is above criticism or complaint ; but as a legal proposition it is only true when some words , possibly implied by the writer , are clearly expressed . It should be written , " A lease for years , renewable at the will of the tenant , and always renewed , gives the tenant an estate without end , and makes him lord of the fee " ; and , thus written , its inapplicability to the question under discussion is fully exposed . The tenure of the office of President of the United States is not renewable at the will of the tenant , and therefore the tenant can never become lord of the fee . It is only renewable at the will of the lord of the fee  --  the people ; and , being so renewable only , the fee must ever remain in the lord , however often the lease may be renewed . // But it is not open to doubt that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the election of the same person to the Presidency a third time ; and there is as little doubt that that disinclination is less general and less vigorous than it was three years ago . It is , however , as old as the Government . It had its roots in the experience of the colonists . In Europe hereditary power had fostered standing armies , and standing armies had maintained hereditary power . Both were the enemies of personal liberty and popular rights . It was the purpose of the founders of our Government to render standing armies unnecessary , and the possession of hereditary power impossible . If the experience of a century is an adequate test , the end they sought has been attained . They had observed , also , that the possession of power , by virtue of office , for unlimited periods of time , tended to the establishment of dynastic systems and to their recognition by the people . Hence provision was made in all our Constitutions , State and national , for frequent elections in the legislative and executive departments of Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not lead the founders of the republic to the adoption of a system which limited the powers of the people or cast a doubt upon their capacity for self-government . The term of the Presidential office was limited to four years , but the constitutional ability of the people to continue one person in the office through many terms was admitted without limit . If the men who framed the Constitution apprehended evils from a third or even a second election of the same person to the Presidency , they accepted those possible evils in preference to a limitation of the power of the people in the choice of their rulers . The tenure of office is fixed , but the Constitution is silent upon the question whether it is wise or unwise to continue the same person in office for more than one term . Washington avoided a third term , and his example has had large influence in leading the country to accept the opinion that a contrary policy is fraught with danger to the public liberties . Washington 's motives and reasons are not clear . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years had been spent in the public service , and he naturally yearned for the peace and quiet of private life . Nor can there be a doubt that , superadded to these personal considerations , was the thought that his example might serve as a restraint in case of the appearance of a popular leader who should seek to subvert the Government through successive elections to the Presidency . // The system of government which Washington and his associates had inaugurated was a novel system . Government of the people , by the people , and for the people , was an experiment . No one could then foresay what their capacity- would prove to be in emergencies , or even in quiet times . The power of rulers in dynastic countries was much more absolute a century ago than it now is , and the extent of that power measured the danger to which , in the estimation of our fathers , free peoples were exposed . Washington 's example was set off and made impressive by the phenomenon of a Corsican corporal passing at a bound , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throne of an empire , displacing kings and rulers , and founding a family dynasty that has lasted nearly a century , either in power or contending for power . The experience of Europe gave rise to the opinion in America that it is dangerous to permit the same person to continue in the chief executive office for a long period of time ; but the traditionary idea that the danger-line in the Presidential office is the line between the second and third terms , is due to the influence of Washington 's example . Aside from governments in which office is conferred by popular suffrage constitutionally enjoyed and exercised , there are three methods of gaining and holding power : 1 . Physical force . 2 . The claim of a right to rule , sometimes called the divine right to rule , which is the result of the enjoyment of power in a family for a long period of time . 3 . Recognized mental and moral supremacy . As to the first mode  --  the establishment of a personal or family government in the United States by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such an undertaking , or even its attempt , is too remote in the logic of events , and too improbable when judged by experience or tested by reason , to warrant argument or to command attention . The destruction of a government is always a possible fact , and no one can predict the consequences ; but , if its overthrow is by force , the aggressive actors are parties out of power , and its defense , whether vigorous or weak , is by those in power . Moreover , it is to be said that the opportunity for a President to seize the Government by force is as great in the first or second term as it can be in the third ; and the probability that a man who had not been tempted , or who had not yielded , in the first and second terms would prove faithless in the third , is a view of human nature contrary to all human experience . And there is less prob // ability that the possession of the Presidency for eight , or twelve , or twenty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit a divine right to rule either in the occupant of the office or his family . Lastly , if mental or moral supremacy were recognized , that recognition would find expression in the United States by an election through constitutional means . There are two theories of political action , theories inconsistent with each other , both unsound and both maintained and propagated by the same body of theorists in matters of government . One theory is that men in subordinate places should be continued in those places as long as they are faithful and competent , and this without regard to their political opinions or to the qualifications of contestants ; and the other theory is that in the chief place of government , where experience , capacity , and integrity are of more consequence than in every subordinate place , the occupant should be excluded after four or certainly after eight years ' experience , however competent , wise , and just he may have proved himself to be . If a public policy were to be based upon reason , the stronger arguments would be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his services were acceptable to the people . In truth , however , there is no field for argument . No man has a right to an office , but it is the right of the people to select men for place who in their opinion are best qualified to do the work they desire to have done . Where , by the Constitution , appointments are vested in the President , in the courts , or in the heads of department , the same right rests in those constitutional agents of the people ; and it becomes their duty to continue men in office when the public interests will be best promoted by so doing , and to remove men from office when their places can be supplied by persons more capable of rendering efficient service . There can be no title to office , and there ought to be no rule of absolute exclusion from office . In public affairs , as in private life , it is true usually that our apprehensions are not awakened by the dangers that actually menace us . Executive power and the influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public mind . It may not be out of place to say that there are less than eighty thousand office-holders under the national Government , and that of these not twenty thousand . are appointed by the President directly , the rest receiving their commissions from heads of department and // the courts . This army of office-holders numbers one to about six hundred inhabitants , and there are probably not another eighty thousand intelligent men in the country whose political influence is less than theirs . If they support an administration , they are characterized as sycophants ; if they put themselves in opposition to it , they are branded as ingrates ; and if they are silent , they are treated as cowards . There is indeed no place in politics for an office-holder by executive appointment where he can exert the influence that is accorded to an independent , energetic private citizen . Office-holders should be free to express their opinions ; above all , they should be free from any constraint proceeding from the appointing power ; but in no aspect of affairs are they a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindred weakness to suppose that the liberties of the country are in danger from executive powers . Executive authority is diminishing in China , Japan , Russia , Germany , and England , and in all those countries the jurisdiction of the legislative branches of government is broader , firmer , and more respected than ever before . With us power tends toward Congress , and in Congress to the House of Representatives . In these four years we have seen the just and proper authority of the President restrained and paralyzed by the House of Representatives , and during the administration of Andrew Johnson his dispositions and purposes were checked and thwarted by the same branch of the Government . The liberties of the country can not be subverted as long as that branch of the Government which can open and close the Treasury of the nation at its sovereign will is true to its duty ; and that branch will remain true to its duty while the constituency is both intelligent and honest . I venture to assert that there is no present danger from the comparatively small body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of imminent peril , indeed , from the numerous evils marshaled under the term maladministration , from which no country is ever entirely free . With these observations upon questions of minor importance , I turn to the one topic of supreme interest and of real peril-the purpose of the old slaveholding class to subvert the Government by securing the rule of a minority , first in the South , and then consequently in all the affairs of the republic ; and I shall then proceed to show how this purpose may be most successfully thwarted by the election of General Grant . We all know that this undertaking in the end must prove a failure ; but the speedy overthrow of the scheme , and the speedy // dissipation of the idea on which the scheme rests , are essential to the reputation and welfare of the country . On the other hand , the prosecution of the scheme is an obstacle to business , a constant peril to the public peace , a direct assault upon the interests of labor in every section , and a menace to free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delusion , a criminal delusion , to accept the notion that there can be unbroken peace and continuing prosperity while any number of citizens are , as a public policy of communities and States , deprived of their equal rights . And it is a delusion not less criminal and even more dangerous to accept the suggestion that the old free States , containing a majority of the people of the country , will peacefully , and through a series of years , submit to the rule of men in the executive and legislative branches of the Government , who take office and wield power through proceedings that are systematically tainted with fraud or crimsoned with innocent blood . It is clearly established beyond the demands of legal or moral proof that there are persons in the Senate of the United States who have no better right in equity to the places they occupy than they have to seats in the Commons of Great Britain . The same is true of the House of Representatives , and these persons coliistitute the majority in each branch . Thus has our former @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been visited by a direct penalty upon ourselves . I proceed now to state our demand of the South , and in that statement I disclose also the evil of which we complain . Our demand , speaking generally , is , that in all the States of the Union every person who has a right to vote shall be permitted to vote ; that his vote shall be counted ; that it shall be honestly valued ; and that the governments created by the majorities shall be set up and recognized . The contest is upon this proposition , and upon this proposition the contest will be waged until it is accepted , practically , in all parts of the Union . Not from hostility to the South will this contest be carried on ; but in regard to the rights of our fellow citizens there and in defense of our rights as citizens of the republic will the contest be prosecuted to the end , whether near or remote . Under the system of suppression and wrong now existing , the vote of a white citizen in South Carolina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal to the votes of three citizens in Massachusetts , New York , or Illinois . Such inequality can not long continue , but , if its long continuance were // possible , it would work the destruction of the Government itself . The issue , then , is a vital one ; and , if the ultimate result be not uncertain , then the more important it is to bring the contest to a close speedily . Delay gives birth to hopes that must perish , embitters the contestants , and checks or paralyzes private and public prosperity . There is not a citizen of the North who is free from responsibility or beyond the reach of this evil . It touches with its malignant hand the humblest laborer and the wealthiest capitalist . The laborer of the South is driven in poverty from his home , and the laborer of the North is cursed with an unnatural and unhealthy competition . Capital loaned or used in the South is without security . It finds no protection either in local justice or in public faith . By the force of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North , and by the force of the same events the South is closed to the labor and capital of the world . In many aspects the South is the chief sufferer . Even now it approaches the admission that the abolition of slavery was a good , and in twenty years more it will accept the truth that there was no way to prosperity except through justice to the black man . As States multiply , as population increases , as representative constituencies are enlarged , the power of the individual voter and of the State diminishes . When the population of the Union was but three millions and the States were but thirteen , the voice of Massachusetts in the Senate was as two to twenty-six . In less than a hundred years , two thirds of her power , speaking relatively and numerically , have disappeared . Her vote in the Senate is now only two in seventy-six , or one in thirty-eight . During the same period , however , the means of communication and of influeiice have increased even more rapidly than has been the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other than were New Hampshire and Pennsylvania a hundred years ago ; and there are now no States so distant from the capital of the country as were South Carolina and Georgia when the Union was formed . The articles of " The Federalist " were delayed through successive weeks before they reached impatient readers in distant parts of the country , while now the news of the morning , the market , the courts , the Congress , is furnished with equal accuracy and fullness in Washington , in Maine , in Texas , in California , and in Oregon . If the power of the individual ballot is less than it once was , the idea behind the ballot has gained a hundred-fold in opportunity for development and influence . // We are now , therefore , more concerned about the idea which directs the ballot than we are about the name , residence , or race of the voter . All opinions and all politics have become local , and all opinions and all politics have become nationaL Political outrages in Maine , Louisiana , and South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every voting precinct and school district of the Union . The sovereignty of the States is not disputed seriously ; the supremacy , the necessary , the inevitable , the constitutional supremacy of the nation is everywhere more and more recognized ; but there are communities which deny to the General Government the power to protect a citizen of the United States in his political rights against domestic violence , and yet have no scruples about invoking the aid of the Union against yellow fever imported from Havana , or pleuro-pneumonia threatened from Holland or Liverpool . We are engaged in warm debate over an ancient tradition , whose origin is uncertain and whose value is doubtful ; we vex the public ear with discussions touching appointments to office , the dangers of executive patronage , the power of office-holders , the duties on quinine and steel ; and yield a quiet submission to the rule of a Senate and House of Representatives whose majorities were secured by the grossest usurpations , made possible only by the perpetration of the bloodiest of crimes . In fine , public attention and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary importance , while the real peril to which the country is exposed is either denied , or its consideration is avoided , or its importance is dwarfed . If any words of mine can have value in the contest now opening , those words must relate to the issue I thus foreshadow . The questions which I now treat as relatively unimportant would be worthy of earnest public consideration in ordinary times ; but the grave question  --  the gravest of all questions-now is , Shall this government be destroyed or sitbverted permanently by the usur* pations of a minority ? It may be unpleasant to revive recollections of the war , but the war itself is intimately connected with recent events which have all the ear-marks of a powerful and continuing conspiracy . By the prosecution of the war , or as resulting from its successful issue , the Union was saved , slavery was destroyed , the blacks were enfranchised , the representative power of the old slave States was increased , and all by the efforts and concessions of the Republican party . More than this : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaders of the rebellion were not only relieved from the punishment , and the peril of punishment , due to their crimes , but they were restored to their temporal possessions , and , with few exceptions , to all their political rights . How has this magnanimity been repaid ? By the seizure of State after State through bloody scenes of crime and by criminal processes of fraud . Arkansas , Alabama , Louisiana , Mississippi , and South Carolina have been subjugated to the Democratic party , by the perpetration of the basest of crimes . Power thus acquired in those States is perpetuated in the hands of an armed minority by the continual practice of frauds which the majority , intimidated by the recollection of the bloody past , dare not either resist or expose . The conspirators , encouraged by their successes in the old slave States , and warned by the accumulating evidences of an adverse public sentiment in the North , sought , in their desperation , to render their supremacy absolute by the fraudulent seizure of the always free and intelligent State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the processes employed connect the conspiracy in Maine and the conspiracy of the South with as much certainty as we connect the drifting icebergs of the Atlantic with the frozen seas of the north . The patriotic men of the country are thus brought face to face with a great conspiracy which embraces the entire republic within the theatre of its operations . The central force of that conspiracy is the old slave power . Its purpose is to subjugate the Government to the ideas and policy of the slaveholding class . The chief means by which this policy can be made successful is the entire suppression of the negro vote in the fifteen old slave States . For the time this has been accomplished , and the result is seen in a Democratic Senate and a Democratic House of Representatives . Shall the Presidency also be filled by a Democrat , and by the same means ? This conspiracy is within the Democratic party , and the Democratic party is its ally . It is , therefore , quite unimportant to inquire whether the conspiracy embrace the entire party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subservient to the conspiracy . The conspiracy triumphs when the party succeeds . The volumes of testimony taken in Louisiana , Mississippi , Korth Carolina , Georgia , Alabama , and South Carolina prove the existence of the conspiracy . They prove , also , that its agents were sometimes White-Leaguers , sometimes Ku-klux , and sometimes Regulators , but that their acts and policy were always the same . As the conspiracy operates within and gives direction to the Democratic party , it is manifest that // the Republican party is the only political organization which has either the disposition or the ability to change the course of events . And it must be admitted that the Republican party enters the contest defying a conspiracy which is already triumphant in the South . Of the fifteen old slave States it has usurped power in six , and suppressed freedom of political action in all the rest . A free vote and an honest count would insure the election of a Republican President and majorities in the Senate and House of Representatives . This vote can not be had , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of its natural and trustworthy allies in the South . The conspiracy has made the South a unit , and the sole reliance of the Republican party is upon the North . In this exigency that party must nominate a candidate who can command an election , and who , when elected , will possess ability and courage to meet and master the difficulties that are sure to confront him . As it was certain in 1860 that the controlling force in the Democratic party contemplated rebellion , so now , in 1880 , it is as certain that the controlling force in the Democratic party contemplates the inauguration of the candidate of that party , whether he is or is not duly elected . The gravity of this contest can not be exaggerated . We know beforehand that the election of the Democratic candidate by honest means is an impossibility ; and yet the declaration of his election by the House and the Senate can be averted only by a victory on the part of the Republicans so decisive as to leave no ground for criticism or claim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Republican party is under the lead of General Grant . General Grant is a man of peace ; but his capacity and firmness in defense of the rights and liberties of his country have been so often tested in great exigencies , that no further evidence is required either by friends or enemies . If it be conceded that the States of the South , where the conspirators have usurped the governments and suppressed the ballot , are to be counted for the Democratic candidate , then the entire burden of the contest is thrown upon the State of New York . Without New York the Republican party can not succeed ; with New York the Republican party is sure of success . The State of New York , in its position , in its population , in its intelligence , in its industries , in its wealth , is the representative American State . The Republicans of that State , appreciating the solemnity of the crisis and the importance of their position , have declared their purpose to support General Grant for the Presidency . // This purpose has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it been secured by extraordinary means . Something may be due to leadership , but men in masses do not change their opinions at the dictation of leaders . I place Mr. Conkling among the first of American statesmen , but I should do great injustice to his constituents if I asserted or admitted that they advocate or accept the nomination of General Grant under the influence of his lead . Indeed , not only in New York , but throughout the entire North , the voters , the rank and file of the party , as they are often designated , are more uniformly in favor of General Grant than are the leaders . They feel , they know , indeed , that every important public interest will be safe in his hands . If the industry of the country can be promoted , he is its friend . If the public credit is assailed , he will stand in its defense . If a dishonest financial policy is proposed , he will not hesitate to resist it . If the lawful authority of the national Government is disputed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government for the maintenance of that authority . And if the constitutional rights of citizens are invaded , he will employ every constitutional power for their protection . No doubt other persons proposed as candidates might act in these matters precisely as General Grant would act , but there is no one of them all who can command as great a following . Beyond all others , he represents the military spirit and the patriotic sentiment of the country . Almost to the exclusion of every other , his name is known and revered by the colored men of the South . It may not be possible to redeem a single State from the domination of military rule , but something will be gained if the victims of the usurpation are led to make one serious effort more in defense of their rights . On the other hand , the violators of law in the South fear General Grant more than they fear any one else . To them he is the representative of that power by which the rebellion was overthrown , the Union reëstablished , and slavery abolished . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the important lesson that he will confront with confidence such difficulties as may arise in the future . To the friends of law and order the nomination of General Grant is the best security that can now be had for peace and quiet ; to the enemies of law and order his nomination means the exercise of power and the administration of justice . Of this they may be assured . Most men who have been advanced to places of honor and trust have been charged with ambition . General Grant has not escaped // the charge . The ambition to acquire the faculty of honorably serving the public is a virtue ; the ambition to rise to power by the overthrow of the public liberties is a crime . General Grant may fairly claim the virtue , and the suggestion that the crime can be laid at his door is but the grossest calumny . In a public experience of nearly forty years I have known something of public men , and among them all I caA not recall one who gave more careful attention to every subject within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for any man to give such assurances of fidelity to his country as to disarm criticism and suppress the spirit of malignity . General Grant has done all that it was possible for him to do , and no one has done more . He entered the service early in the war , and without regard to rank or position . He was never advanced upon his own solicitation . He gave everything he had , including the hazard of his life , to the service of his country . He was placed at the head of our armies by President Lincoln , and at the head of our armies he brought the war to a conclusion . When the hour of victory came he was the trusted leader of a million enthusiastic , trained , veteran warriors , and first of all he suggested and earnestly urged the disbandment of this immense force , and their speedy return to the arts and pursuits of peace . Now , in private life , crowned with every honor which his own or other lands can confer , he neither seeks nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he takes no part . If by the unsolicited votes of his countrymen he is again called to the Presidency , there ought not to be even one citizen base enough to suggest that he is animated by any purpose inconsistent with the constitutional requirements of the office . This article is already burdened with the personality of the writer , but , as the evil can not now be remedied , I venture to increase it . My relations to General Grant are those of sincere friendship ; but , aside from that friendship , I recognize no personal obligation binding me to him . When he tendered me a place in his Cabinet , I declined it definitively ; and it was only when , in peculiar circumstances , a further refusal seemed wholly inconsistent with my duty as a citizen and as a supporter of the Administration , that I accepted office . My position was an independent one , and I can now pass judgment upon General Grant with entire freedom . Pending the election in November last , I spoke at Bunker Hill ; and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // " For the first time since General Grant left the office of President , I speak his name in public , and I do so now because I notice that many persons from whom I did not expect so early a recognition of his character and services have announced that they are disposed to support him for the Presidency in 1880 , or indicated the opinion that they expect his nomination and election . I may say , without assuming anything , that I have enjoyed the friendship of General Grant for many years , and I am not anxious that he should be again President of the United States . But I foresee that he is likely to be President . I do not know that the purpose to elect him is universal , but it appears to be very strong among the members of the Republican party , and I am disposed to see why it is that they look to General Grant . The instincts of great bodies of men usually have some good foundation , especially when the public sentiment runs for a long time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the current . General Grant has been around the world . He has been in all the principal countries of Europe and of Asia , and if in those countries severally there has been one person , the ruler perhaps , who has been estimated as a more important personage than General Grant , it appears to be but a repetition of what occurred in Greece when the question was taken among the commanders upon the question who was first and who was second . Each officer voted for himself first , and Themistocles second . If you consider General Grant 's career , it is not too much to say that , in a military point of view , he is among the first six men of whom history has preserved any account ; and if in future ages there shall be those who claim for him the first place , it will not be an extraordinary thing . Do you consider that he commanded more men for a period of fifteen months than were ever under the command of any other general in ancient or modern times since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operations was as large as the entire scope of Napoleon 's campaigns from Egypt to Russia ? That he never received a suggestion or an order from a superior in office after he became Lieutenant-General of the Army ? That he never held a council of war ? That he conducted operations at the same time up and down the Mississippi River , across the continent , a long the coast from Annapolis to Galveston , and penetrated the Confederacy at two or three points at the same time ? That never , never in the field , where he was in command personally , were the troops under his orders routed , though they were often shattered and afflicted by the seventies of // 387 the enemy 's attacks ? That they were never disheartened , discouraged , demoralized , much less never routed , and that he brought to a successful conclusion the greatest war of modern times ? Is it strange , then , that in all countries , even when stripped of the dignities of office and the formalities of power , he everywhere has been recognized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Under these circumstances , is it strange that the Republican party of this country turns to him ? I have said this of General Grant , not because I want him nominated for the Presidency . I think it has responsibilities from which he may well shrink . I do not know that an election will add to his fame . I am sure it will not increase his happiness . But there have been times when even in Massachusetts , and in Republican assemblies , it was not easy to represent General Grant as he is  --  a man of imperturbable spirit , full of patriotism , animated by a plain and loving sense of justice , and anxious-more anxious , perhaps , than almost any other American citizen - for the perpetuity of our institutions , for the preservation of our national honor , and for the glory and prosperity of his country .
