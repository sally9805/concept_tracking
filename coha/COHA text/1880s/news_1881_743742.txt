txt Much is apparently expected from the conference on the silver question to which France and the United States have invited the leading commercial nations . It is not to be denied that the situation is in some important regards more encouraging for a harmonious solution of this vexed problem than it was in 1878 . The relative market value of silver to gold is somewhat lower than for the six months preceding the last conference , but it has been notably steadier during the nearly three years which have elapsed than it was for the three years before the conference . In June , 1878 , silver was to gold as 17.73 to 1 ; it is now very nearly as 18.08 to 1 . After the adjournment of the conference it fell slowly , until , in February , 1879 , it had touched 19.02 to 1 , but the variation since has been even more gradual , and for the most part there has been a slight tendency toward the appreciation of silver . At the opening of 1875 silver was as 16.38 to 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 1 ; again advanced to 16.35 to 1 at the opening of 1878 , to fall once more to 17.73 to 1 , as we have said , at the time of the conference . This greater steadiness is , of course , an argument for those who think that a uniform ratio can be agreed upon . On the other hand . in 1878 France held a. position of friendly but strict neutrality in regard to the proposed agreement . She had suspended the coinage of silver , and has not since resumed It . But she has seen a great deal of gold drawn from the bank , and she is now ready to at least consider , with a hope of finding it , the proposition to seek a general ratio . When the last conference met , the gold in the Bank of France was slightly more than the silver . There was 1,178,000,0001. of the former and 1,004,000,0001. of the latter . But , at the latest advices , ( Feb. 10 , ) the gold had fallen to ' about 532,000,000f. , while the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if the Governn , ient of France could hit upon any means by - which silver could be made as desirable for export as gold , it would be very glad to do so . The present Government is more inclined than was that of Marshal , to believe in the efficacy of a ratio fixed by the principal nations , and is much more desirous of discussing such a ratio . Moreover , as the principal drain of gold has been to this country , France would have especial reason to be satisfied with an arrangement which made silver legally equal to gold in the United States . Germany , too , which positively refused to even take part in the conference of 1878 , is now ready to send delegates to the approaching one . She has had bad luck with her great experiment of establishing a currency based principally on gold , and whether her embarrassment has come from trying to do too much or from being afraid to do enough , or whether it arises from difficulties with her revenues , independent of her monetary system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her troubles through the consultation now suggested . In England , also , an active agitation by a few energetic and fluent bi-metallists , led by the untiring M. CERNIISCHI , the French banker , has produced some effect . There is not the slightest reason to suppose that Great Britain will make any radical change in her own system of coinage ; but she may not oppose a change proposed in that of other countries , which shall tend to make a steadier demand for silver , and may consent to some slight modification of her own policy to aid in this desirable result . We may be perfectly certain , however , that she will confine her attention to opening the mints of other lands ; she will not take down the bars that close her own . The one point which seems to be agreed upon by the Governments seeking the conference is that those nations which may consent to its conclusions shall proceed to the unlimited coinage of silver on the ratio agreed upon . What that ratio will be , or what ratio will be supported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of contradiction . If the present relative market value of gold and silver is regarded , the ratio of the United ** 16 to corresponds more closely to it ; but the adoption of this ratio would compel , the recoining of all the silver coins of the States belonging to the Latin Union , andwould entail ' a heavy loss upon those Governments . If , , on the other hand , the ratio prevailing in the Latin ** to 1 ? be . adopted , it has the serious disadvantage of over-valuing silver about 16. per cent. , a policy which. , would subject the citizens of all the countries adhering to this ratio to very great disturbance and embarrassment in their affairs . It may be conceded that an agreement upon a uniform ratio , which would inevitably over-value silver somewhat , would tend to appreciate silver . The more silver was over-valued , and the more numerous and commercially important were . the Governments accepting the common ratio , the more pronounced would be the tendency toward the appreciation of silver . But whatever the ratio selected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , these Governments would still be exposed to the danger of having their currency constantly changing from one metal to the other , and at most times remaining a currency of one metal only . Whenever silver was overvalued and coinage was unlimited , gold would leave the country with a rapidity proportioned to the over-valuation . If the market values should change , and silver should be under-valued , then silver would be.withdrawn . By a force perfectly well established and understood , and entirely incapable ' of being successfully resisted , though it might be partially checked , unlimited coinage of both metals would result solely in a one-metal currency , now gold , now silver , as the course of prices should become stronger than the influence of the legal tender quality in one direction or the other . The more the question is examined the more clear this fact will appear , and though the approaching conference may  --  it probably will not ? ' result in the choice of a common ratio for France , Italy , Germany , Austria , and the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would not control , the fluctuations in the relative value of the two metals .
