txt The indiscreet friends of Gov . Foster have placed him in a very unenviable position . Notwithstanding the Senatorial fight , they flatter themselves that they have dono an act which should commend them to the Administration of Gen. Garfield . The Governor 's friends have , during the past few days , prepared a memorial , which has been signed by nearly all the Republican members of the General Assembly and other political friends , and forwarded to Gen. Garfield . The memorial prays that Gov . Foster be selected as Postmaster-General under the new Administration . Gov . Foster , when he heard of the action of his friends , was greatly annoyed , and expressed himself as strongly averse to such means being used in setting forth his claims , strongly protesting that too much kindness was burdensome . The action of the Governor 's would-be friends is severely criticised as being unwarrantable , there being no instance in political history where a gentleman competent to hold a position of honor would be benefited by a petition of this character . It is intimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal ends in view , and hope to be benefited by the Governor 's promotion . What renders the matter more embarrassing to Gov . Foster is that , in the event of his entering the Cabinet , which it is now settled he will , the signers of the memorial will claim it was on account of their signatures ho was chosen . Near friends of Gov . Foster state that he will occupy a seat in Gen. Garfield 's Cabinet , and that he will be tendered the portfolio of the PostmasterGeneral . A dispatch published in the Cincinnati Commercial yesterday , which is said to have been inspired by the Governor 's private secretary , is regarded as being intended to pave the way for the announcement of the Governor 's appointment , and as being based on official information .
