txt Much comment was caused to-day in political circles by the appearance on the fifth page of the Commercial Gazette of a column of matter fiercely denunciatory of Blaine . The column was headed , in heavy black letters ,  --  inc independent Republicans , " and a second heading , in smaller letters , was as follows : " New Journalistic Enterprise  --  The independents Hire a Column of the Commercial Gazette ? , What the Mulligan Letters Are  --  How They Came Out . " The article opens up as follows : " The Independents have no organ in Cincinnati . In other cities , notably in New-York and in Boston , the great Republican dailies are with them . Such is the attitude , for instance , of THE NEW-YORK TIMES , the New-York Evening Post , the Boston Advertiser , the Springfield Republican , the Chicago News , and hosts of other papers that have always heretofore been Republican . But in Cincinnati both the Enquirer and the Commercial Gazette , are for Blaine . The Enquirer is for Blaine for the same reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blaine is for Jay Gould and the rings . As the Cincinnati Commercial said in 1876 : ' There was a regular rally of all the rings for Blaine . The whisky ring displayed all its digits for Blaine , both in Illinois and Missouri . The ringsters who have fattened under the Republican Administration feel that Blaine would not reform enough to hurt . ' This is in accordance with Mr. 's peculiar views of American politics . He agrees with Mr. Blaine 's manager , Steve Elkins , that a campaign is ' largely a question of finance . ' The Commercial Gazette is for Blaine , not because Mr. Halstead or Mr. Smith have changed their opinions of the candidate , but because the Commercial Gazette is a Republican organ , and must be for the Republican Party , right or wrong . When Mr. Schurz spoke here in 1875 Mr. Halstead said of him : ' The progress of Carl Schurz through Ohio will be an ovation . He abates no jot of his fierce independence ; he apologizes for no word of his unsparing criticism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar of anybody 's money even for traveling expenses ; but he speaks from a sense of duty , for a cause that he knows is that of truth , and he has not counted the personal loss or gain in any way . " But , although Mr. Halstead has lost his fierce independence , the Commercial Gazette remains a newspaper , opening its columns to all comers at advertising rates . The independent Republicans have rescued this column in memory of the old Commercial . Henceforth , during the campaign , they propose to edit it in the spirit of fierce independence . It is simply the difference between the fifth page and the fourth . " We trust that the arrangement ; will inure to the benefit of the proprietors In more ways than one . In the first place , they are insured a direct revenue , and in the second place , we hope by making this column not the least interesting in the paper , to largely increase its circulation . " The article then proceeds with a discussion of the Mulligan letters . Republicans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that one of the local leaders of the party telegraphed to Mr. Halstead , in New-York , to ask what it meant , and why it was permitted . The column fell under Mr. Blaine 's eye . and it comes pretty direct that he felt it keenly , and asked if it could not be stopped . On ' Change , it was all the talk . Democrats laughed over it , and Repub-. licans confessed their surprise that so stanch a Blaine organ as the Commercial Gazette should have admitted such matter to its columns at any time , much less on the morning , of the demonstration in Mr. Blaine 's honor . It would destroy , they say , half the advantage which the party had derived from ' Mr. Blaine 's visit . It is explained at the Commercia/ Gazette office that the matter was admitted by the business department and did not fall under editorial supervision , and that there-will be no more of it . A Times-Star correspondent has this interview with the gentleman who edited the matter which ' appeared today . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be Lawrence Maxwell , an attorney at law . " It is purely a local movement , " he said . " The gentlemen who called on Schurz are the only ones interested . They have assumed the expense , and have appointed a corn- ' mittee to furnish the copy . " " Then there will be a series of articles ? " " Yes , there will be one every day . " " For how long ? " " i do n't know exactly ; possibly until the elections are over . " " Pretty expensive , is n't it ? " " Certainly . I am not at liberty to say what the expense is , as a private contract has been made with the Commercial Gazette . " " Who compose the committee that is to furnish the copy ? " " I do not feel at liberty to state just now . I do n't know that they would object to being known , but I am not authorized to mention any names . There is not a great deal of writing to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We feel that the Mulligan letters have never been brought fully before the public , and by publishing them in the Commercial Gazette they will reach a class of people who would not see or understand them otherwise . " " Do you expect any good result from these publications ? " " Oh , yes , or we would not go to so much trouble and expense . "
