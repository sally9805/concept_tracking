ARTICLE Y.-DEMOCRACY . THE following sentence is from the pen of Thomas Carlyle : " For Universal Democracy , whatever we may think of it , has declared itself as an inevitable fact of the days in which we live . " The more closely one observes the tendencies of public movements throughout the world , the more clearly does he discern that this statement is true ; and the query which is immediately suggested by it is , if democracy be thus a fact , universal and inevitable , does it not remain of the highest importance that we know what to think of it ? It is by no means a simple task to decide whether one ought to enroll himself as a defender of this modern institution or not . There is , in this country at the present time , a growing sentiment of distrust respecting the ultimate outcome of that extended personal liberty which is an essential feature of modern life , and , what renders this of greater moment , this sentiment is to be found most frequently among men of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an indication of high wisdom , or does it evince merely short-sighted impatience ? Is faith in this latest form of society , on the whole , rational or irrational ? It is possible to be neutral with regard to disputed questions of the past , since neutrality as a sentiment , is another name for indifference , but it finds no place here . The case of C*esar vs . Cicero , which even in our day is earnestly argued in the court of historians , may not interest all , but with a question which touches every man 's life , to remain neutral is impossible . It is this felt necessity of thinking something respecting democracy , and of procuring a rational basis for such thinking , which has led me to undertake the following study . The line of investigation which such a purpose points out is very plain . The origin of this sentiment of democracy , as well as the course of development through which it has grown to be what it is , must be clearly discerned . The student must also learn // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political manifestation independent of all other manifestations of thought , or whether , on the other hand , it is so built into the structure of modern civilization that , to abstract it would be to essentially mar if not to destroy that civilization , He must , in the third place , portray to himself the probable future development of a society in which the sentiment of democracy appears to be one of the most important elements , and he then will have the factors in hand from which to form a rational judgment . Such a study , it will be observed , must be historical in its form , though it will result in the most careful analysis possible of the thing studied ; but beyond the analysis , and of equal importance with it , such a study will disclose the character of . the age in which it was possible for democracy to grow and attain its present strength . To grasp the meaning of an historic epoch , which necessarily precedes the perfect understanding of any factor in it , consists in being able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manifests itself in that epoch . To do less than this is to acknowledge one 's self unprepared for confident judgment respecting any of its particular manifestations . Historians recognize modern history to have begun with the sixteenth century , and one may , with some degree of confidence , discover from a study of the great movements since that date , the principle of unity which renders this period different from other periods of our own civilization . This principle is the sense among men that each finds an existence independent of the life he lives in common with all ; that , however closely united to an hierarchy or a state he may be in external forms , within himself there resides a something that is sovereign . This sense of individuality is a very simple conception , but it has given color and tone to all modern life . It would be incorrect to say that this idea found its birth at the dawn of modern history , for there are many expressions of it by writers among older peoples . Many trace even the latest phases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the idea of individual responsibility which is a necessary forerunner of democracy . What is true of modern times is , that that which pi-eviously was a thought for men who think , has // now become a familiar companion even to common men ; that which once was an idea is now a force . The sixteenth century , at its dawn , presents two applications of this principle of individuality , each distinct in character from the other , but both finding a bond of sympathy in that old latin motto which Seneca did not think unworthy a place among his own grand thoughts- " flomo sum ; humani nil a. me alienum puto . " The one of these movements was in religious sentiment and passes under the name of the Reformation ; the other was an intellectual movement and is known as the Renaissance . They were both in perfect harmony with the humanistic spirit which burst in strength over this century , as also were both the result of a turning of men 's thoughts in upon themselves , and of recognizing that in man resides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this century is the ease with which this idea grew . Thus with regard to the Reformation , the suggestive fact does not lie in the appearance of a leader of this revolt against Rome , for the corruptions of the Church had not unfrequently been proclaimed in tones as bold and clear as those of Martin Luther ; it lies in the readiness with which men and women were willing to give him a following . This of itself shows that Luther rather answered questionings already in men 's minds , than submitted to them ideas entirely strange . A voice , however strong , finds no responsive echo upon the level of a prairie ; there the cry is dissipated until of its own feebleness it dies . Only among the rugged hills and mountain crags are words taken up , told and retold , as though though earth herself believed them true . Thus at the dawn of the sixteenth century , men were no longer careless of them . selves ; they no longer lay in a dead-level of security and insensibility . Luther spoke among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceased to reverberate . These intellectual ' and religious movements , however , although they sprang at once into vigorous life , quickly reached the limit of their possible development without the infusion of new elements . The intellectual movement was at first mainly classical . It consisted in a study of that beauty found in the style and thought of the Grecian and Roman poets , orators , // and philosophers . This was certainly humanistic when compared with the study of the mongrel Latin of the Church fathers , but its tendency was to lead , by the contrast which it presented between the high plain of ancient thought and the low plain of modern living , to a kind of indifferentism , or to the feeling that one 's surroundings were created to serve as a whetstone to one 's wits , results which were , in some degree , exemplified in the character of Erasmus . But classical knowledge is not a mine inexhaustible . Awakened intellect called for fields of wider activity . Then it was that Nature , which outside of Italy had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students as worthy the closest scrutiny , since there were to be found the keys to many mysteries respecting man . Secondary elements also entered in to shape the intellectual growth of our latest civilization . The discovery of new routes , new lands , new facts , and the extended application of inventions , gave to imagination a breadth and grasp which it had never previously attained . It is the coworking of all these forces that has created for us modern music , speaking the passions of men ; modern novels , portraying the character of men ; and modern science , disclosing the surroundings of men ; each finding its origin in the common thought of individuality , and each being an exemplification in particular form of that great spirit which all recognize as the spirit of modern life . The religious movement , no more than the intellectual , was complete in itself . It was in reality less an application of individuality than at first appears to have been the case . The Reformation did not rid men of the idea of authority , it resuited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book . The only application of individualism in this , was the assertion of the right of private judgment in choosing for one 's self what authority should be allowed . The personality of the Reformation then , is reducible to personality of judgment in choice of masters . It would be far from the wish of any historical student to disparage the importance of this step , for , logically carried out , it means liberty of opinion . The wars , too , through which even this much personality was asserted , were too severe and exhaustive to permit him to // think lightly of it , while the fact that he has marked this as the step which carried Christian civilization out of the old into the newest historic epoch , shows that he regards it as having given a new tendency to all development . This development , however , has not been in the direct line of religious change . With the exception , possibly , of the establishment of various sects , differing upon minor points , the religious world of to-day stands where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as they appear from history , are of a political character . It consequently arises that any further study of individualism finds its material in the development of political ideas in States . But the political idea which at present rules the Western world is that of DEMOcRACY . We are thus led directly to the subject of our study . Democracy does not necessarily mean , as usually employed , a definite form of government . It is rather the expression of political individualism , and hence , so far as it implies a government , is to be recognized as the manifestation in political life of the spirit of modern times . Democracy as an idea rests upon the political maxim that sovereignty lies with the people , hence it follows that the faith which an advocate of democracy is called upon to exercise , is faith in the final judgment of the people , as well as in their integrity and sense of justice . This is the political sentiment in individualism , and as such harmonizes with that which will prove to be lasting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or in science . If this conception of democracy be correct , it appears inaccurate to consider constitutionalism as synonymous with it . Constitutionalism implies a law of the nation superior to every thing but the national will . This form of government is for the most part employed by those who are endeavoring to realize democratic ideas , but constitutional governments are not necessarily democratic ; nor , on the other hand , are democratic ideas among a people incompatible with a choice of monarchical forms The old charter of Holland and the Magna Charta of England are instances of non-democratic constitutional governments , while the Napoleonic empires in France illustrate democratic monarchies . What I wish to emphasize is , that democracy , as a spirit // among men , is something apart from as it is more enduting than any form of government whatever . It is true that at the present time those peoples who have accepted democratic ideas are endeavoring to realize them by some form of representative governments ; and one would not go far astray in predicating the presence or absence of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence or absence of constitutional forms among them . The only notable exception to this is Russia , the form of whose national government is a pure monarchy , while part of the Russian people at least understand and embrace democratic sentiments . The entrance of Japan into this group of nations is so recent that one may not speak with confidence respecting the result of the many proposed reforms there , but one may state with perfect safety , that no people are such ardent admirers of the political philosophy of the Western world as the Japanese . It is no matter of surprise , in this somewhat extended application of democratic ideas , including peoples so widely severed in history and habits as the Japanese and Swiss , the Russian and American , that a study of democracy in its various environments should disclose different meanings attached to the word by these different peoples . From this fact , however , one is not at liberty to conclude that democracy springs from different sources . With the single exception of the local governments in Russia , it finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only goes to show either that the elements which make up its realized conception are mingled in various proportions , or that some peoples include elements which others entirely reject . Although this diversity is at first perplexing , it will disentangle itself when one discovers that there exists a principle of classification whereby most states may be thrown into one of two categories . This classification is made upon the lines marked out by the kind of democracy accepted among two important peoples , other states being referred to them according as the coloring of their sentiment approximates more nearly to that of one or the other of these leading nations . These peoples are the English and the French . So different are they in their character , that one expects to find whatever passes through their hands , moulded to harmonize // with the peculiar sentiments and habits of each . These two peoples have marched together down the line of history , but they have marched back to back rather than side by side . They have thus seen different reflections and received different impressions from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their reforms have ever been the application of rules , tried at first in a small way , to the affairs of the nation . A proposition for change without a precedent of some sort upon which to base it , is always weak before the English people . Even the Liberalism of Ei*gland is conservative in this , that it admits the argument of historical develop . ment to be the strongest of all considerations . The French , on the other hand , are by their nature Liberals . Precedent for them has no binding force . The argument from history is the weakest of all arguments . The French do not understand the meaning of the word reform , they only know revolution . Change for them is the application of some principle which may spring from the nature of things or from the imagination of their own writers . In France the political philosopher is the strongest of all men , and the only political sin appears to consist in not accepting a new idea . Thus the Con* servatism of France is Liberalism in this , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be conserved by adopting the newest methods and giving way to the newest fashion of sentiment . It was in this manner that Napoleon built a monarchy out of democratic material . Nowhere is this contrast more strongly marked than in the origin and realization of the idea of democracy among the two peoples . The individualism of the Reformation , passing over the Channel , became quickly rooted in its extremest forms among the Presbyterians and the Puritans . The reformed Church of England did not accept this part of Luther 's doctrine , nor can it be said now to embrace democratic ideas . The Lutherans and the Puritans , on the other hand , stood upon common ground as regards personality , and the churches of both were democratic in form as in education . Without tracing each step , it occurred that , through the medium of church management and church polity , the idea of popular sovereignty came to be quite generally accepted outside of the nobility of // England . In the application of this idea there arose , curiously enough , the same doctrine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Jesuit writers also laid claim , that society and government were at best but a social contract . Indications of this may be found in the political writings of Milton , while the theory of Cromwell 's government would have served equally well for Robespierre . The fact of importance is this , that the fIrst manifestations of democracy in England arose by applying the rules of church government to national affairs ; the idea of popular sovereignty , against which subsequently arose as a party cry the doctrine of the divine right of kings , found its origin in the sense of personal responsibility . Thus national democracy in England may be said to be the result of the application of a precedent derived in the practise of church democracy . Seek now the origin of this same sentiment in France . rphe Reformation , so strong in Northern Germany and England , did not achieve much that was lasting in France . So long as the spirit of the Renaissance and Reformation worked together , both intellectual vigor and spiritual strength were to be observed but when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it did not find itself sufficiently strong in France to carry the nation with it , and it was overmastered by the political element . Thus the religious movement dropped out of the life of this people and the intellectual movement assumed a form peculiar to itself . There were great writers in France after the death of Rabelais , Calvin , and Montaigne , and before the appearance of the philosophers of the eighteenth century , but the subject of their discourses was ethics and customs . They did not touch directly either religion or politics . In one sense these writers perpetuated the humanistic spirit of the Renaissance , since their studies were addressed to human actions and sentiments . They did not , however , comprise any decided democratic tendencies , for they were confined to the upper classes and did not embrace in their analysis all men as an essential unity . The rise of that democi-acy in France , which showed itself to be such a tremendous force in the Revolution , was effected through the acceptance among the people , high and low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ilelvetius , Condillac , Voltaire , and Rousseau . The work of these four men forms a unity , when we notice its effect , although each was independent of the other . The first two contented themselves with speculative philosophy and attacked the basis of knowledge and ethics which had been previously received . Both were greatly the fashion in France . It was not , however , until Voltaire , by his keen wit and satire had made men appear ridiculous to themselves by pretending to believe what they did not , that the necessity of a constructive philosophy was recognized .. This , such as it was , was supplied by Rousseau in his doctrine of natural right , and through the medium of this were the French people led to embrace democratic ideas to which they were comparative strangers before . The origin of democracy being thus so different in France and in England , it could but occur that the two nations should present varying phases of this political sentiment . Democracy in France embraces three elements : sovereignty of the people , liberty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrast with this at every point : it does not know equality , it differently defines liberty , and it but partially applies the principle of sovereignty . It is instructive to contrast more closely these elements . Popular sovereignty , as an idea , arose with the Puritans , but it was not until nearly a third of the present century had passed , that the idea was even partially realized . The House of Commons , it is true , had long previously asserted its right to rule England in preference either to the Crown or the Lords of the realm , but not until the Reform bill of 1832 was there any guarantee that the House of Commons should represent the people of England . In one of Lord Beaconsfield 's political novels , the author somewhat sarcastically alludes to the good old tinies when ten families ruled England , and that they did it by the seats they controlled in the lower House . At present the government represents the people who possess the franchise , but by no means does every Englishman hold a vote . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political unit by virtue of his being a man , not by virtue of his being a man of certain income . This discloses the first point of contrast between the democracy of these two nations . Liberty and freedom have been ideas for which men in all // ages have striven , but how ( lifferent have been the objects of aspiration ! A Roman could not understand the feeling of a Swiss patriot , who , in the name of freedom , should defend his village-nation . An English Baron of the field of Runnymede could not enter into sympathy with the demands of laborers for freedom and right . But it is not necessary to introduce men belonging to different ages to discover various conceptions of these sentiments . They do riot to-day awaken in the breast of an Englishman and a Frenchman the same feeling , or present to the imagination the same ideal . English liberty is conceived to be freedom to acquire privileges and to be unmolested in the exercise of one 's faculties . French liberty may not with such ease be defined . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense coloring of personality . Man finds his true position in some sort of a society . His personality exerts itself when impressing itseIf upon the character of society . He exercises his liberty in attempting to mould society but recognizes at all times that he , as an individual , is inferior to it . As an illustration , the late bill for the expulsion of the Jesuits , which would have been entirely out of harmony with English principles , was considered in perfect keeping with French ideas of liberty , because those teachings tended to the subversion of the State . The freedom of action in industrial affairs , also , presents another example of these conflicting conceptions of liberty . The domestic governmental functions of England do not , as a rule , extend beyond the dispensing of justice . So long as law is complied with , there is no limit placed to accumulation of wealth or to the control of wealth accumulated . Nor does the State consider it proper to enter , in the name of the people , into any industrial enterprise for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effecting injurious results . English industrial liberty appears to consist in defending individuals from the encroachments of society . France , on the other hand , conceives liberty to require that society be defended from the encroachments of individuals . Wherever a business exists , in which a monopoly may be created ,  --  by which I mean that monopoly prices as distinct from competitive prices may be procured for services rendered ,  --  the French do not consider any one 's liberty invaded if the State assume control over such a // business . Thus not only , as in England , are the telegraph and post government property , but the railroads also are under public control , and , at the expiration of ' the present lease to the six companies , will become State property ; moreover , any great measure , in which the people of France are interested , is undertaked by the government . Again , English liberty places property and person upon the same basis . It is characteristic that in many of the State speeches , persons and property are continually united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ graded below persons as a thing not worthy the same consideration . Upon this point the two peoples fail entirely to understand each other . Thus the English do not see how that communism in theory is possible , while the French wonder that , in the presence of all the distress which the common people of England have undergone , the worst form of popular outbreak has been confined to Chartism . The strongest point of contrast , however , as regards the sentiment of democracy found in these two representative nations , is the presence of the idea of equality in the one and its entire absence in the other . In England , equality is considered neither** desirable nor attainable , wl:ile English philosophy teaches that it is incompatible with liberty . This position is sustained by the consideration that , if its realization were attempted , by the distribution of all that which through law might be distributed , the actual inequality of personal talents and gifts would result in raising again class relations and dependencies ; but this , it may be remarked in passing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only , which consists in freedom to acquire privileges . For England to realize equality , it is not sufficient that her land laws be changed and the custom of entailment modified , the character of the people also , must be so far reformed that the charms of social equality may be recognized . In France equality is the basis of liberty . As a sentiment it pervades all peoples and is in part the explanation of that air of sociability which permeates all life . Historically as well as philosophically is equality here the basis of democracy . The monarchism of France , leveling , with the exception of a few // families , all ranks , until over ninety per cent . of the nation was found in the third Estate , prepared the way for the founding of a democracy accepting the dogma of natural right and natural equality . Such are the important points of distinction between the English and the French sentiments of democracy . Other nations show some variations from these typical forms but are allied to one or the other according as*they*display the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as this country is concerned , one might expect that the people of the Unites States would present a commingling of foreign elements . The American colonists were English . They were proud of the strengthand position of the mother country whose habits and customs they had brought with them . When the troubles arose , however , which separated them at last from the old world , they accepted quite readily the political philosophy which at that time was assuming such strength in France , and their remonstrances , declarations , and speeches readily fell into the phraseology of the social contract . Thus it turned out that the revolution which began in maintaining the rights of Eng . lishmen , ended in vindicating the rights of man . These social contract principles were , possibly , the more readily received , since the northern colonies could trace them to the writings of the Puritans , while many of the southern leaders were essentially French . That which is peculiar in the democracy of the United States to-day , is the result of the co-working of these conflicting ideas under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one can conceive of French political philosophy planted in England , and the island of Great Britain extended by the addition of new lands to the size of a continent , he will have the forces , social , political , and physio* graphic , which have made democracy in this country what it is , and which cause the political and industrial tendencies in this country to differ from those of any other country in the world . This position , briefly stated , is the following : we accept here the idea of popular sovereignty in its extremest form . The Constitution so states it ; the laws of election and naturaliza. tion so recognize it . This is French , not English . The de* // mocracy of the United States , also , is allied to that of France in accepting equality as a political element , but this sentiment is not nearly so strong here as in France . It is confined to political equality . By instinct the American people are as aristocratic as the English . The first Congress would not permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but demanded a figure of liberty instead ; nor was that same body backward in withholding privileges from the society of the Cincinnati , fearing the establishment of a military aristocracy . The elder Adams , coming to take the oath of office as first Vice-president of the United States , in a carriage bearing upon the door a coat-of-arms , aroused the fears of a nation , and strengthened in the minds of the people the arguments against Hamilton 's binding scheme . On the other hand , when Thomas Jefferson mounted his horse , and , unattended , with his inaugural address under his arm , quietly rode to the capital , the act was greeted with enthusiasm as an exemplification in high place of equality . But in this country , equality and the desire for it does not extend beyond political life . When we pass into social and industrial life , class relations , class dependencies , class inequalities are as strongly marked in this country as they ever were in feudal England . The only difference is that they are less permanent , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This , however , is nothing which the people have consciously chosen ; it has been forced upon them by the presence of black loam five feet deep in the Mississippi Valley . The explanation of all this is to be found in the fact that , by the side of the French sovereignty and French equality , this country has adopted the English idea of liberty . Whether people know it or not , they are , in all domestic industrial organizations , puting into extreme practice the principles of English political economy . They call only for a fair field and that every man shall have complete control over all wealth which , according to existing law he may become proprietor in ; and , more than that , they cry that any change in the law or any extension of State functions to industrial undertakings , is an invasion of their rights . The case is this : Privilege here comes by possessions and liberty is here ( lefined as freedom to acquire // privilege . This is the excess of individualism and the extreme of English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control , while the people in this country submit to carry by their telegraph rates forty millions of fictitious stock . American democratic sentiment would present a more satisfactory coloring should it be tinged a little more highly with the idea of French liberty , which holds that society has some rights which men , be they in the form of corporations or not , are bound to recognize . If I have succeeded in the foregoing analysis , it will appear that democracy is not merely a political form but constitutes an element in the general life of the present age : it is not a thing to be judged by itself , but only in its relations to what makes up the spirit of modern life . It stands or falls then , not entirely upon its own merits , but with the great movement of which it is the political manifestation . He errs in the basis of his judgment who condemns democracy because he is able to criticise some things which it has effected . It is by no means contended that the tendencies and work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ideal government . There are both evils and dangers in the liberty of action which forms an essential part of it . But be . fore condemning democracy on these grounds , it is incumbent on the critic to show that the evils complained of are peculiar to democracy and not to be found in human nature which , under any form of government , would come to the surface . Thus no one can deny that the practice of universal suffrage is accompanied by some undesirable facts . It is an evil necessarily attendant upon the extension of the franchise to all classes that a government can , at no time , be more wise or more pure than the people from which it has sprung . But can a historian claim that any other form of government has always placed a wise man at the head of affairs ? Plato 's maxim that the wise should rule , is the very ground upon which democracy is defended , for there is a higher degree of probability that purity and wisdom will reside with humanity than with any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are urged ; but , to say nothing of the errors of kings , it is replied that these wrong choices of the peo // pIe have never been permanent . He who would urge this consideration can not do better than to clothe his slovenly idea in the striking illustration employed by Carlyle . " A certain people " says he , " once upon a time clamorously voted by overwhelming majority , not he , Barabbas ; not he , Barabbas , ' * ' and we are led to infer from what the author adds , that as a curse upon those who so voted , their descendents have been forced to support themselves by traffic in old clothes , therefore , universal suffrage is a failure . Is this an argument ? Is it even a complete statement of the case ? Does Mr. Carlyle 's readi ng of history stop with the cry of the Jewish mob ? Has he never heard that the popular vote of seventeen continuous centuries has condemned this choice , and reversed this judgment ? Is it nothing to the credit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither emperors nor priests ,  --  that the criminal of Calvary has been elected their spiritual king ? Nor again does it require any great amount of research to discover dangers in democracy . Perhaps the greatest of these is found in the fact that whatever pleasure arising from the sentiment of equality , may be derived , no matter at what grade people find their level . A race of slaves with a single master may be equal in their degradation and derive contentment and satisfaction from the fact . All democratic peoples are thus in danger of exercising their sovereignty to choose a master and to settle into an equality of servitude . Politically stated , this danger is that of growing into democratic monarchies , which , as compared with other monarchical forms , must be the worse . This may be brought about by the free deposition of popular sovereignty in the hands of a single man . It is true he would be their representative but he would also be their master . This is the rock upon which two French republics have been wrecked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In France it passes under the name of the Napoleonic idea ; here it is termed Ca3sarism . It is not in a statement of the evils and dangers which an analysis of existing political society discloses , that one may advance to a satisfactory answer of the question , is democracy to be def*nded ? For an answer to that question one must go outside of a mere study of democratic governments , and consider the relation which the political ' // 767 Cal life of a people bears to the other forms of life . A true man will always recognize his age as a whole . He will bring himself into sympathy with it so as to feel its life and its aspirations . If he can discern no life about him , if mind be sluggish and without hope , or if movement be feverish and purposeless , it is a pretty sure indication that he has come into the world in one of those dark and aimless periods when men without genius must content themselves with mere animal existence . Nay , they will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of originality does not find his duty marked out for him . History tells us that from the excess of such darkness light must spring . Here is an opportunity for genius to grasp an eternal principle and place it before men as worthy of realization . Under such conditions , and such conditions only , is it that the pathway of mind may be turned and the movement of centuries directed . Then it is possible for forerunners of light to appear : Men like John the Baptist , who heralded the advent of Christ , like Wickliffe and luss who prophesied of Luther , like Rabelais who forecast the appearance of Newton , like Bach who arrested the ear of the world for Beethoven , or like the Puritans and Rousseau , Quesney and Adam Smith , who gave direction to all political and industrial activity of this century .

If this position be tenable , there is no question respecting democracy . It must be defended until it work itself out and prove either a total failure or a success . It must be guided by the best minds toward the best possible achiev-ements in order // that , if it prove a failue , the world may never be called upon to return to it .

" Monarchies and aristocracies , theocracies and patriarchies have been abandoned because they have failed . Whatever new may lie in the immediate future , must be in the geperal line of development which the past has marked out . To turn back to old forms or to create new out of existing material is equally impossible . To rearrange the forces of modern life so as to lead to a more perfect growth is all that remains for one to do . In these facts lies a practical rule of ethics ; within the bounds thus described lies the sphere of leadership and guidance for a strong man . The great stumbling block , standing in the way of hearty acceptance of such a standard of action , is the groveling life which one observes to exist about him .

" It is a pleasure to live , " cried Urich von Hutton ; " mind is moving itself . " This was a true and reasonable ground for finding pleasure in life . But what can ofie say now when he sees that stomach has proved too strong for mind ; that intellect has become the servant of sense . Again the last part of the eighteenth century was happy in its optimistic dream . It had woven the perfectability of man out of " liberty , equality , and fraternity .

Selfish agitators , possessing nothing , but wanting every thing , say that Maithusianism is not true ; while selfish conservatives , possessing so much that they fear to demand more , employ this doctrine as an opiate to their consciences , that they may walk without pain in the presence of the suffering poor . Thus the two periods of hope which the last three hundred years have known , have shown themselves to be fleeting ; the gross and the selfish in the individual , emancipated from blind authority and following his own reason , has proven too strong for noble aspirations , and now one may see in every new mechanical improvement by which the nineteenth century is pleased to measure its progress , only fresh sources of degradation , for such an improvement is but a new servant to the senses . Certainly such a state of affairs is not propitious for the creation of much enthusiasm in favor of one 's own generation , nor can it serve as a basis for high hopes respecting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ripe fruit of modern times , these times deserve no loyalty from a true man . As such , however , I can not accept it . These results are but perversions of existing forces , grand in themselves and such as the world has never controlled before , to unworthy ends . They indicate one of those swingings in great movements which bring with them the seed for their own renovation . The mistake which this generation is making , and nowhere is it more marked than in the TJnited States , is one to which democratic peoples are peculiarly liable . It is the mistake of accepting numbers and wealth as the criterion of national greatness . " The difficulty for democracy , " says Matthew Arnold , " is , how to find and keep high ideals . - - Nations are not truly great solely because the individuals composing them are numerous , free and active ; but they are great when these numbers , this freedom , and this activity are employed in the service of an ideal higher than that of an ordinary man taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal toward which it may strive . Power , strength , and reserved vigor are present in the world to-day as they have never been in the past , but greatness is incasured by what is doing , not by the capacity to do . Let but a noble purpose be breathed into the souls of men and acts of // heroism and endurance will show that an exercise of faith is not among the lost arts . The task then which remains for one who has avowed himself a defender of democracy , is to present a purpose worthy the striving of a great people . Every society embraces two classes which must be taken into the account ; the one composed of men who think , the other counting among its members those who feel the result of what is thought . While the aims presented to these two classes must be harmonious , it is not necessary that they be the same . That suggested for the first class may be difficult of apprehension or even abstract , but it must be such as will bear men through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second class , on the other hand , demands a tangible , understandable end to be secured . The source of inspiration which students may find in the present order of things is , that for the first time in the history of the world , not only are all things taken into the domain of investigation , but this study also embraces all men from the highest to the lowest in the purpose for which it is undertaken . It is not enough that discoveries be made , they must also be popularized . The far-reaching tendencies of such a custom have been frequently dwelt upon , they are only suggested here to call attention to the fact that this is but another way in which the spirit of the modern age shows itself , and that the broader sweep and grander purpose of it may serve to inspire those who are capable of understanding it . The grand ideal which students of a democratic people may hold before them is first ,  --  what has been recognized by students of all ages ,  --  that a fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge is a lever which elevates men ; and second , that now for the first time has this lever been placed under mankind as a unit . No class , according to the theory of democracy , but feels the influence of culture . This process of elevation is not like driving a wedge between classes , as among the Greeks , the Romans , or in the Middle Ages , crushing those who lie below for the purpose of raising those who happen to be caught on the upper bevel . Thus in the all embracing grasp of their work , may men of science and education find the basis // of a high purpose ; dwelling in this purpose they become great , and the people which comprehends them is a great people . It is not in the wide sweep and popular tendency of study , however , that ohe may discern a purpose capable of moving nations . The people must have an aim calling for conscious effort . A movement must be placed before them in which they themselves may become actors and which so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own . An idea worthy of devotion , and able to arouse loyalty among democratic peoples , appears to me to lie in the still further development of practical liberty in industrial life . The tendency of the race has ever been toward greater freedom , and , now that all men are equal before the law , it is thought that the problem of liberty is worked out . Than this there can be no greater error . Whatever may be the legal status , the industrial conditions are such that the freedom which the law permits can not be exercised . Harsh class relations are out of harmony with democratic conceptions , and contradict what is demanded in the name of both equality and liberty . In advocating wider industrial freedom it is not necessary to avow one s self either a communist or a socialist in the sense in which these words are understood . It is , however , necessary to understand and to recognize the justice of the claims which have given occasion to socialistic agitation . The guiding principle of the industrial reformation here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for this alone can conserve the observed tendency of the modern age by the means which the modern age has provided . The practical plan through which that liberty promised by democracy is to be realized , is the abandonment of the wages system and the establishment of industries upon the coöperative basis . It is then the realization of co*ziperative economy which is to serve as the ideal of democratic peoples . If this appears disappointing in any way , and inadequate to the great task assigned it , the source of disappointment is that you do not understand cooperation , and do not perceive what an influence it will have in modifying character and changing the purposes for which men work . A society based upon cooperative indus // try is as different in itself and in its tendencies , from a society based upon wages industry , as the latter is from a society based upon slavery . Thus cooperation is a further step in the direct line of development which carried civilization from a state of slavery to freedom . It may be as difficult of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fact that it will be the perfecting of industrial freedom , is of itself a sufficient guarantee that , once fully apprehended , its realization will become a purpose in the hearts of men , to abandon which will be disloyalty , and the people thus apprehending it will become a great people . It will be observed that the material claims of cooperation are not here put forward . They are strong but they are subordinate . It was the sense of justice and brotherhood , combined it is true with baser interests , which set men free . It must be the sense of justice which completes that freedom . Co6peration , to serve the purpose li*re assigned it , must mean more than higher wages . It must be incorporated into the religion of men as pointing to one of those duties which spring from their social station . It is in the advocacy of cooperation that men may remain true to the spirit of derpocracy , and still be aggressive . In it is to be found liberty , defined by the duty which each owes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand from all ; in it is found equality which casts out jealousy , leads to sympathy , and recognizes the mutual relations which the possession of various talents brings ; in it is found fraternity , not of that maudlin type which expends itself in the prodigality of its expressions , but which measures advancement of civilization by the increased means of growth to all . In the highly organized and dependent state of industrial society of the present , justice can only be realized by permitting all to partake of profit ; but justice is a divine attribute . In the reformation of industrial society , therefore , may one see the further advance of this nineteenth century society towards godliness . It will be one step towards the grasping of that grand conception which presented itself to him who penned the following lines : " The equality of man can only be accomplished by the sovereignty of God . The longing for fraternity can never be satisfied but under the sway of a common Father . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
