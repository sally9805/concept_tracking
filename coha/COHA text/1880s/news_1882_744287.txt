txt If there is any game that Mr. WEED can play better than he can play poke ; he would do well to confine himself to such game and to abstain from poker forever . Nothing can be clearer than that he was never meant for a poker player . The purpose of his creation is undoubtedly a mystery , and is universally recognized as such by all his acquaintances but though he may not be able to imagine what he was made for , he must by this time know that he was not made to play poker . There are two aspects in which Mr. WEED 'S now celebrated game of poker with Dr. HEDGES and Mr. SCOTT may be regarded . The first of these is what we may call the scientific view . Mr. WEED had a hand of four aces , Mr. Seam held a " straight flush , " and Dr. HEDGES had a " full " which he had dealt himself . Mr. WEED , full of faith in the efficacy of his aces , proceeded to bet as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game went on until a " call " was made and Mr. SCOTT secured the nice little pot of $450,000 ? of which $150,000 represented the loss of Mr. WEED . It is not many years since the " straight flush " was introduced into the game of poker and given the power to beat four aces . The history of the development of the " straight flush " since the date of its introduction affords a curious instance of the way in which nature supplies every demand that is made upon her . In 1856 a " straight flush " occurred once in every 167,000 hands , " four aces " occurring at the same date once in every 9,027 hands . With the demand for " straight flushes " the frequency of their appearance increased , until at the time of the famous transit of Venus , when scientific parties were sent out by our Government to the end of the earth , the " straight flush , " according to the excellent authority of Prof. HA.EKNESS , of the Naval Observatory , could be expect . ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . In the very able paper on poker , read at the meeting of the American Scientific Association last August , it was asserted that the " straight flush " had so greatly increased in frequency that it was commonly met once in every 1,147 hands , thus being very nearly as common as four aces . These facts Mr. WEED ought to have known , for to Mt down to a game without knowing them would have been an incredible act of folly . Now , when he began to bet heavily on his four aces , and found that , no matter how much he might bet , Mr. SCOTT was always ready to " raise " him , he ought to have comprehended that the latter gentleman held a " straight flush . " The argument was a simple one . Evidently Mr. Score had full confidence in his hand , for no man continues to " bluff " when $10,000 or $20,000 is at stake , and his adversary is ready to bet to any amount . The only hand which could give him this full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WEED had four aces , and as the game did not take place on the Mississippi River , there was no reason to believe that Mr. SCOTT was relying upon a hand of five more aces . The chance that Mr. Scorr held a " straight flush " was greatly strengthened by the fact that he had drawn only one card . In those circumstances , even a wayfaring player , though he might be a protectionist , would have known the character of Mr. SCOTT 'S hand just as well as if his cards had been transparent . And yet Mr. WEED , with a fatuity rarely equaled in the annals of Democratic , conventions , went on betting on his miserably inadequate four aces until he lost $150,000 . In its practical aspect the game gives no possible excuse to Mr. WEED . The deal , which was made by Dr. HEDGES , reflected great credit upon his skill and judgment . Some men endeavoring to earn an honest living by poker would have dealt much more suspicious hands . Dr. HEDGES dealt Mr. Scow a " straight flush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act of great selfrestraint . Most men in Dr. HEDGES 'S place would have given Mr. SCOTT a " straight flush , " with an " ace high , " and given Mr. WEED a " straight flush , " headed by a king , with the expectation that the latter would bet his very last dollar on his hand . But Dr. HEDGES knew better . With the instinct of a thorough artist he would not overdo the matter in hand . He dealt Mr. SCOTT a hand which he knew would be good enough without the gaudy ornamentation of an ace , and he gave Mr. WEED a poorer , but yet an eminently seductive , hand . What Mr. WEED ought to have done , on discovering that he had lost the " pot " was to claim that he was not playing " straights " ? that " straights " should not be counted except by special agreement , but that , with a view to harmony , he would accept $10,000 from Mr. SCOTT and call it square . The wretched man , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorant of the ways of HEDGES and SCOTT as he was of the cardinal principles of poker . He actually paid $85,000 to his antagonists before it occurred to him that there was anything suspicious about the game , and that Dr. HEDGES was too bold and original a dealer for any discreet man to play with . Mr. WEED ought to study mumble-te-peg . It is a beautiful game , and just suited to his abilities . It is also an economical game , and , even if he were to play it with Mr. SCOTT and Dr. HEDGES , he could not lose anything except one or two front teeth .
