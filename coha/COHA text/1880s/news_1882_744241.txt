txt The wheat combination delivered out a great deal of the article to-day , which was trotted erotic ( ' by the delivery boys , and ultimately a large portion of it went back Into the clutches of the clique . The market advanced , then weakened , and rose again , closing about 1 cent above the last price Tuesday evening . The crowd had various theories to advance in regard.to the moves of the clique . The latest fairly authenticated report is that there has been a change in Its personnel . Messrs . Kent and Fairbanks have withdrawn , it is said , and Kershaw and Alexander Young , of Milwaukee , the latter Bill Young 's brother , have joined , and calculate to work the market awhile in May , June , and July . Walker is also said to have been succeeded by Dews as leading broker . An old observer said this evening he thought this new clique did not intend to buy up everything and squeeze the boys , but would make a feint of so doing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , while the combinations were generally selling through unknown brokers . He thinks they are retaining control of the cash wheat for the purpose of breaking the market when they have put out a leading line of short sales . Others think the opposite , and see good reasons for it , They argue that the clique has the market , and will milk and squeeze it from now until August . The meeting the Directors held Tuesday was breezy . The President selected the following committee to determine a settling price for the defaulted contracts in April wheat : A. M. Wright , C. 1 ) . Culver , Henry Tanner , W. F. Blair . and George Smith , Three of the Directors voted to confirm this committee and seven voted to reject the three first named above , giving out as a reason , it is said , that the three had all expressed themselves strongly against corners and manipulations . which seemed to imply that the clique would not receive justice at their hands . A diecussion was at once started which became decidedly hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protested against such action by the majority of the bare quorum present as uncalled for , unjust , insulting to some of the best men in the board , and an outrage on the directory . The meeting at last adjourned , all out of sorts , and will assemble to-morrow afternoon , when the President 's committee will probably be confirmed , even though the opposition lobbies actively among those who will take care not to be absent to-day . Leading members of the board declare the proceedings outrageous . They think the three named in the committee were rejected because they were known to he good men . who would demand a thorough Investigation of the April deal before they fixed on a settling price . Certainly one , and probably none of the three , had no defaulted April trades , and knew little or nothing about who had . or the quantity in default . Besides , they wore all men of high standing . who would he governed in their decision by the rules and the evidence , and not by any personal feeling , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was also to the effect that those who were confirmed have had little experience in such oases . which is looked upon as further proof that the majority favored the clique , and did not want a committee that would he likely to inquire too olosely Into its affairs . The proposed amendment to fix the settling price at the end of each month by a sort of averaging-up scheme was defeated to-day by a vote of 479 nays out of 760 votes cast .

The market was very weak after the noon hour . and rallied toward the Close . with rumors of a coming storm . There was a fair shipping demand throughout , but tho cash market varied with futures .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
