txt Mr. Thomas B. Reed , of Maine , has views about the probability of a reduction of the tariff by the Fiftieth Congress , and he has to-day expressed them at length in the form of an argument for the protectionist , Ho thinks it probable that the Democrats will disagree , as they did in the last Congress . But he also finds other diticulties . He says , " The first man I met says , reduce the sugar duty . ' That looks very simple ; but in 1883 that was tried and the whole Democratic Party voted against R. Why I The excuse was that it was a revenue duty . The reason was that Louisana was a Democratic State . There are also many protectionists who would vote to retain the full sugar duty , from a sincere belief , justified by recent discoveries , that we are on the verge of producing from sorghum and other sources all the sugar our country can consume . You will remember , too , that the Administration In more than one Treasury utterance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next scheme is to reduce protective duties ; but would that reduce the surplus ? What makes up a customs revenue 3 The amount of articles imported multiplied by the duty . If you reduce the duty you reduce tee multiplier , which would be all right if you did not increase the multiplicand . But when you reduce the duty you necessarily increase the amount imported . Indeed , that must be your very object . Why reduce duties if you do n't want more foreign goods ? But we are not left to conjecture as to results . A small example will make this By an interpretation of the law of 1883 worsted goods duties have been reduced . With what result ? Why , the revenue has doubled . If we do the same with other articles we shall have more surplus rather Man less . What effect such changes would have on the business of the country just at this moment I leave business men to conjecture and to dread . " Another proposition is to take the reduction from the interval revenue . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the Speaker would allow a proposition to take that $30,000,000 off it would easily pass . But he probably intends to use that as a weapon to attack protection under the guise of reduction of surplus . Thus the whole internal revenue tax is about a hundred millions . When iyou come to the question of reduction of the revenue by taking oil the whisky lax , cam man thinks that it has the advantage of abolishing runny offices , of leaving the trade of the country undisturbed , and Miss Willard , representing the Woman 's Christian Temperance Union , believes teat it will release the Government from a participation in the profits of a manufacture whielt no Government ought to countenance . On the other baud , that tax is defined as one easily collected , and much talk is made about leaving off the tax on liquor and putting it on clothes . The manufacturers , also , of whisky desire the tax continued , because it enables those of large capital to absorb the business . The expedient of creating a free list with coal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish thereon is , at course , only attacking protection in detail . You eau see by this slight enumeration what the difficulties are . If there was a sincere single desire to reduce the surplus , which is what the country really wants , there would be but little difficulty , but so many men want to use reduction of the surplus , which everybody agrees is a lever to du something which only a free trade minority wants ; to do , that the people of this country are liable to be deceived unless they keep their eyes on the main question , which is the reduction of the surpius without disturbance of the industries of the country . " Mr. William G. Raines will not be Mr. Clark 's successor as Clerk of the House of Representatives , nor will he be a candidate for that office when the Democratic caucus is held to-morrow night . It was decided by his friends to-night that it would be useless to try to defeat Mr. Clark , and lie was formally withdrawn from the race . This action was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were present except Messrs . Bliss , Belmont and Bryce. and the Democratic , Retiresea waves from Pennsylvania , ANew-Jersey , Connecticut , and Massachusetts . After the delegations from these five States had agreed that Mr. Raines had entered the lists too late successfully to compete with Mr. Clark , it was proposed to take advantage of the strong opposition to Mr. Donelson for Doorkeeper and present Mr. Raines as their candidate for that office . There was a long discussion over this proposition , and it was filially left to be settled tomorrow . Whether or not Mr. Raines will be a candidate against Mr. Donelson will depend on the report of a committee which was appointed to-night to sound certain prominent members as to their willingness to support the Eastern States in a demand2for the Dooraeepership . Some of Mr. Raines 's friends are . confident that so iulluential a member as Speaker Carlisle can be counted on to help the New-Yorkers as against Mr. Donelson , and if the committee should discover this to be a fact Mr. Raines will be presented to the caucus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to join in his support . If , on the other hand , the committee Linda Western and Southern members unwilling to vote for the Eastern men 's candidate , he will be dropped altogether . Mr. Donelsou'e friends . are boasting to-night that he has the pledged support of at least 10 more members than are needed to nominate Min In the caucus . There is Do Doubt , however , that they are anxious over the outlook , and their anxiety has not been lessened by the threatened candidacy of Mr. Raines . Mr. Hart 's adherents believe they have an excellent chance of carrying their candidate through . They think the Raines committee will not recommend that the New-Yorker be pitted agaiustDonelsun and they count upon polling the votes of all of Raines 's friends . These , they declare , will be more than enough to defeat Donelson. * ' Secretary Fairchild has completed the preparation of his annual report to Congress and the final pages of it were placed in the printer 's hands to-day . He has been engaged on this work almost exclusively for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department during that time has been ably conducted by Assistant Secretary Thompson . The report is all in the Secretary 's own handwriting and gives his views in regard to the surplus and the tariff question at considerable length . It will be made public immediately after its presentation to Congress next Wednesday afternoon . The President 's message will be sent to Congress on Tuesday . s A reporter for a New-York paper , newly come to Washington , and who is not familiar with the face and figure of the President , to-day electrified the readers of his paper with an account of the first appearance of the President on " Newspaper-row " last night . The President Was described as walking with a cane , a lady , and a cigar ; that lie was seen in front of the said newspaper otlice pointing out the beauties of the sight to his companion , and that be was observed by no one but the writer of the paragraph . The President did not leave the White House last night to ride or to walk , but Representative Cogswell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , did walk by the ollice iu question with a lady , a cane , and a cigar , and he now understands why lie was followed at a distance by a young man who displayed au extraordinary interest in his move-Inept &; s s The daily conference of the Democratic Senators developed to-day into another full-fledged caucus , in which there was a good deal of talk which was barren of definite results . As a matter of fact the Democrats are entirely at sea as to the final purposes of the Republican Senators concerning the seating of Mr. Turpte , who comes to succeed ex-Senator Harrison , of Indiana , and until these are known , Mr. Voorhees and his party can not decide just what to Liu . They rather expect a contest over Mr. Turpie , but they are far from certain of ii , and they du nut lute the uncertainty . Some of them urged today that a fiat-footed demand for information on this point be made on the Republicans , coupled with the threat of a blockade of tee Senate proceedings it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been deliberating pa the general subject , does not hnow what to recommend uglier the present circumstances , audit is not un lixely , if the Etipubllean Senators continue silent , tile Democrats will feel obliged to regard all the DOW Senators in the same boat as Millie , and to insist that as tee bulimia man is treated all must he . On this point a decision will be reached between now and Monday noon , and urgent whips have been seat out calling for the presence of every Democrat at that hour . Republican Senators nave also been warned by Mr. Ingalls and others to be on hand when the session opens and both parties will be ready fqr ally emergency . Some of the Democrats think there will be no rumpus . They argue that the Republicans have nothing to . gain by forcing a tint , and they assert that more than one Repubireau Senator is known to regard Turple 's title to a seat as valid . They , have as masks ' ' Votes as the Republicans at the , start , they remark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warrants , so that the only result of an objection to Mr. Turpie will be an ill-natured row of no benefit to the party which brings it on . These Democrats , however , agree with those who expect a fight that it will be wise to prepare for trouble , and the caucus to-day was entirely harmonious on that question . Just how to prepare Is the conundrum which still puzzles them . The situation as it stands is a very pretty one , and the opening session of the Senate promises to be of nitwit more than ordinary interest . It It It is probable that a ' ' 1 ) 111 will be prepared by the Surgeon-General of the Navy having for its object the improvement of the condition of the Assistant and Passed Assistant Surgeons of the navy . This bill lie will present to Congress . Secretary Whitney will , of course , ho consulted before any steps are taken in the matter . If the Secretary approves the plan every effort will be made to secure the passage of the bill . It will provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways increase the inducements to cutter the service . It is at present au impossibility to till existing vacancies in the corps . There are 13 places to be filled . The examination for admission is extremely difficult , and while many apply for appointment , few answer the requirements . The Surgeon-General desires to keep up the present high standing , but knows that if the examinations remain as rigid as now and the inducements to enter the service are no greater there will be even a greater number of vacancies than new . At this time 13 Assistant Surgeons are needed . Notice has been received from the Medical Board in Philadelphia that Dr. George McCaw Pickrell , of Richinoad , Va. , passed an examination for appointment as Assistant Surgeon . If he accepts a coin mission there will be 12 vacancies yet to be filled . These will be readily disposed of if the salaries of the Assistant and Passed Assistant Surgeons are increased sufficiently to compensate fur delayed promotion . Lieut . Edward S. Farrow , Twenty-first Infantry , has been recommended for retirement . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great for his physical strength .
