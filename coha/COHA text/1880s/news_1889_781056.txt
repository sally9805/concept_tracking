Joseph Coyle , another seaman , drifted about all night in a small boat and was picked up on the beaeh at Lewes in an almost lifeless condition by one of the life-saving crew . The Sunrise left Norfolk Thursday afternoon for New-York in tow of the tug-boat B. W. Morse . When off Barnegat yesterday morning the wind was blowing a gale trom the northeast , and the Captain decided to put into the Delaware Breaicwater . He went up the bay as far as Brown Shoals . This is one of the most dangerous ejloals in Delaware Bay , and vessels which anchor near there usually go well over toward the eastern side of the channel . Either ? thei Captain did not know this or else he mistook his bearings in the fog , for he dropped his anchor close to the bell buoy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakwater , a distance of nine miles . During the night the wind increased in force , and about midnight the Captain found the vessel was dragging her anchors . Finally one of the chains parted and the heavily-laden barge drifted down upon the dangerous shoal . She began to leak so rapidly that the Captain launched the skift Coyle . slid down the ropes and coast off the nooks . While the Captain was trying to hand Coyle the oars a huge wave lifted the skiff on its crest and the painter parted with a snap . As Coyle drifted astern he saw the Captain run forward as though to launch the other boat , and then the vessel gave a sudden lurch and seemed to go , to pieces . Coyle saw nothing more of the barge . The Sunrise was formerly the clipper ship of that name and was owned by the Morse Transportation Company of New-York.
