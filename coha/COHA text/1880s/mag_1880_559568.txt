IN modern times all civilized communities have employed representative institutions as the ordinary machinery of legislation and finance , and all have adopted , with necessary modifications , the form of the English House of Commons . Most communities , too , have thought it expedient to commit legislation to the 4ebate and decision of two Chambers ; while supply , i. e. , the distribution of financial burdens , has been left to the discretion of one Chamber , and always to that Chamber which more directly represents the popular element in the machinery of government , in imitation of the British House of Commons . It is now known that this House , which has been justly named the Mother of Parliaments , came into existence in order that an equitable system of assessment should be established ; that it speedily assumed the function of criticising the demands which the Crown made on the subject ; that at an early date it made the grant of supply contingent on the redress of grievances ; and that , two centuries after it was called into being , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form of laws . But no one has discovered the period at which it arrogated the privilege of granting supplies , and affirmed that its grants only were exigible by the Crown . It is certain that at an early date the three estates , the Church , the Lords , and the Commons , taxed themselves . But we do not know what were the circumstances under which the Commons were allowed to tax the other two orders , or , at least in the case of the clergy , to make their grants invalid without the assent of the lower House . But , though modern civilization has copied with greater or less exactness the constitution of the House of Commons , no political society has imitated the English House of Lords . An attempt was made to introduce an hereditary Chamber in some of the American colonies , but the purpose failed . Ready as communities of British // origin are to *copy or preserve the institutions of the country from which they are sprung , none of them has been willing to allow that the eldest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualification but that of birth , be possessed of the inalienable right of legislating for the rest of his fellow countrymen , or , in technical language , be legally entitled to a writ of summons to Par*liament , and be legally competent , in conjunction with a majority of others in the same condition , to reject the financial measures of the lower Chamber , and to exercise a wholly irresponsible control over all other legislative acts . Before the fiction that the sovereign can do no wrong was firmly established , English kings were made liable to all the consequences of misgovernment . No nation in Europe has so frequently made war upon and deposed its kings as the English has . Long before the great civil war it got the name of the disloyal nation . Since the doctrine of ministerial responsibility has been established , the Crown has apparently been more secure . But the first two Georges were seriously endangered by external enemies , and during the long reign of George III there were occasions on which the Crown was alarmingly imperiled by domestic discontent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the English people is , or may be , toward the ruling dynasty . It may be fervid ; but social observances prove nothing , and may mask what is wholly unexpected . It is quite certain that the English House of Lords could never have ventured on using the privileges which it claims . By the theory of its constitution it can reject , at its discretion , any measure , however urgent , which the administration and the lower House , representing the popular will , may affirm , and do so persistently , in defiance of repeated acts of the other legislative body . It claims to be the court of appeal from all other courts in which civil rights are adjudged , and for a long time it actually revised legal decisions by party votes . Though the privilege has long been disused , it claims not only to be irresponsible , but to coerce criticism , and to chastise those who dispute its pretensions . Its members can evade the consequence of civil actions , and can demand to be tried by their own order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to criminal procedure . Since the Lords succeeded in securing that members of their own body should be arraigned before the whole of the Lords , only one peer has been capitally convicted ; though it has been said that , had they not been triable by their own relations only , many more would have been put in peril . Till recently it was not neces // sary that they should be present in Parliament in order to record their votes . By an abuse , the historical explanation of which is very obvious , they had the right of voting by proxy , and many important questions have been negatived or affirmed by the suifrages of absent peers . Now , it is plain that , though many of these privileges are dormant , the fact that they are not abrogated gives the English upper House an indefinite power of obstruction , which has not been unfrequently used actively , and which , by virtue of its existence , may be very deterrent , or at least restrictive of political change . Like many other political organizations , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privileges . It has even published several bulky volumes , which contain much important antiquarian learning , great quantity of which is wholly irrelevant to the question at issue , on the dignity of a peer . Like other bodies , too , it has invented privileges , and has supported or insisted on them with more or less reason . Thus it has asserted that every peer whose patent of creation is incontestable , and whose peerage is represented in the lineal descendant of the ennobled ancestor , is entitled of right to a writ of summons , though such a right was not claimed before the accession of Charles I-indeed , could not have been safely claimed from a Tudor sovereign , and would not have been demanded from a Plantagenet . But such a claim , if an hereditary Legislature may exist at all , was necessary to the independence of the House , since otherwise the sovereign might have summoned none but the partisans of his own poli9y . It has affirmed , on more questionable grounds , that a single summons to Parliament , even without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the representation of which can be transmitted through females , and has thus revived a number of obsolete or dormant peerages . On still less grounds of right it has asserted that a peer can not relinquish his peerage by any act of his own , however formal , in its celebrated decision on the Purbeck peerage . And , lastly , it has claimed , as a right of indefinite antiquity , the most harmless or even useful of its privileges , that , namely , of a peer or peers recording his or their dissent from any act of legislation or of judicial procedure which may have been affirmed by a majority , and this with or without reasons for the dissent . The House of Lords had its origin in the council of the AngloNorman sovereign . As the great Greek publicist , Aristotle , asserted that the senate was the essence of constitutional government , so the // 47 Teutonic King was always assisted , and therefore controlled , by a council . From this council the English King obtained pecuniary aid in emergencies , in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its consent , formal or informal , he enacted laws . In theory , it appears , every tenant who held of the Crown , at least by the duty of military service , however small his estate might be , had a right to be present at the great gathering of this assembly . That so unwieldy a body was ever actually summoned may well be doubted . From very early times it became the practice to invite only the principal tenants , the holders of considerable lordships , to these gatherings . It does not appear that they came willingly , for the summons generally suggested some sacrifice . In point of fact , the earliest and most significant sign of disaffection was neglect of the summons , or premature departure from the council . Hence , when Parliaments were established , attendance on the summons was enforced by fines , the amount of which was fixed by Parliament itself , and , during the Tudor dynasty , absentees were compelled to find proxies for their appearance or good behavior-these proxies , for caution 's sake , being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was intended as a guarantee was construed into a privilege , and the system of proxies became a gross abuse . But till 1625 the King never treated the attendance of a peer as a personal right . The list of no two sessions of the House of Lords is the same . Persons summoned to one Parliament are omitted in another , and for no apparent reason . It is probable that few great peers were uninvited . It is certain that the issue of writs to many persons was uncertain or capricious . It is not easy to say when the Houses began to reciprocally criticise and recommend bills commenced in either House . It is only in the time of Edward IV , two centuries after Parliaments had become a regular part of the English Constitution , that the Commons changed the form of their measures from petitions to draft-bills . Before this time it seems that the sovereign promulgated laws , either without the action of Parliament , or gave fQrce of law to petitions presented from either of the three estates . The principal laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sanction whatever . The famous statute of 2 Henry IV , cap . 14 , under which the penalty of death by burning is denounced against obstinate heretics , was enacted , as the preamble informs us , at the instance and petition of the clergy , though it remained the law of the land up to the middle of Charles II 's reign . It is during the time of the later // Plantagenets that the House of Commons gained the right , or fulfilled the duty , of originating money-bills . It is probable , nay almost certain , that this peculiarity in the action of the lower House was due to the fact that only that section of the nation which was represented in the lower House was liable to the charges which were imposed by these grants . It is not strange , when resistance to the royal demands became invidious or even dangerous , that the Lords , and ultimately the clergy , relinquished to the House of Commons that power on which the political influence of this House was based , and from which popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventeenth century , the power of the purse was admittedly in the hands of the House of Commons , and this body resented with great energy any grant by the clergy to which the Commons had not consented . They not only claimed to be the interpreters of the King 's necessities , but they permitted no other order to interpret them . The House of Lords existed , but in a state of extreme decrepitude , from the accession of Edward IV to that of Charles I. Half the peerage , and that the wealthiest half , was exterminated before the Vorkist faction was triumphant . The revolt of the Nevilles was the ruin of the most powerful members of that faction , and the residue was impoverished by the success of Henry VII . It is not easy to conceive a more odious body than the Lords were during Henry Viii 's reign , for this King employed them as the willing instruments of destroying the victims of his caprice ; or a viler crew than they were in the reign of Edward VI , when the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or manliness were the prelates ; or a more contemptible Senate than they were in the reigns of Mary , Elizabeth , and James , for during this period of three quarters of a century not a single peer raised his voice in remonstrance against any grievance or any wrong . The faint sparks of public liberty were kept alive by the Commons only . It was at this time that England did its greatest service to human liberty , for the student of modern political forces will find that all that was worthy and hopeful in that dreary time whi4*h preceded the dawn of freedom was the work of some obscure men in the English Commons-men too , who , by that irony in which aristocratic institutions are so fertile , were the progenitors of the most dangerous enemies which liberty has had to encounter . Very often in England good men have made an honored name , and founded what is called a family . With very rare exceptions , the race has soon // become degraded . The best patriots of the Tudor and Stuart age begot descendants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study the degeneracy of families , let him take the names of Wentworth , of Hyde , of Holles , of Hampden . Some of these families began with bad men , and rarely swerved from the tradition of their origin in their successors , as the Churchills and the Finches . Nothing illustrates the political character of the English House of Lords in the early days of the Stuarts better than the character of those peers who took the side of the Long Parliament in the earlier period of its career . They were not a numerous body , and they were not over-useful to their allies . The Riches , Earls of Warwick and Holland , had been buccaneers , who bought their titles . Many of the others , such as Southampton , Salisbury , and Essex , had private grudges against the house of Stuart . They were fickle allies and dangerous leaders . There can be no doubt that the war , the final issue of which was never doubtful , was prolonged or embittered by the incompetence and perhaps worse qua*1ities of Essex , Manchester @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that the persistent bad faith of Charles was encouraged by a belief that he could rely on a party which might restore him without conditions , or on easy ones . Nor is there reason to believe that when , on February 6 , 1649 , the Commons abolished the House of Lords , they imagined that they were taking away an institution which had a constitutional right to share the functions of administration and legislation . There were men living who knew that the Lords had taken but little share in the functions of Parliament , that they were mere advisers of the King , that the advice they gave was rarely in the interests of the people , and that the struggle for liberty had been carried on by the Commons and by the Commons alone . During the period of the Plantagenets , the Lords made war on the King and on each other , risking their lives on the issue . In the reign of Henry VIII , the privilege of peerage was full of perils . It is true that the objects of a political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Crown . But the commoner was better off than the peer . Nothing but consummate prudence could keep the nobles of that time safe from the axe , and prudence was not always of avail . When Parliament was not sitting , the Crown could easily secure the conviction of a noble by packing a jury of peers ; and , when it was sitting , by the obvious and effec // tual process of attainder . It is not wonderful that , when at last the Lords got the mastery , they insisted on being tried by their whole order , whether Parliament was sitting or not . Since they have effected this change , only one of the order has been convicted for a capital felony , and he was a very objectionable lunatic . He must not only be an optimist , but very deaf to popular rumors , who is of opinion that none of the order have ever deserved to incur this penalty . The Court of the High Steward has not been summoned since the trial of Lord Cardigan . During the suspension of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held aloof froni Cromwell , declined the advances which he made them , when he sought to reconstruct a House of Lords , but engaged in no conspiracies against his government , and apparently held no correspondence with the exile , as many of them afterward did with his brother and nephew . They probably believed that sooner or later Cromwell would take the title of king , and , in such a case , they would have , in all likelihood , rallied round " the base , mechanic fellow , " as Charles called his rival and conqueror . But Cromwell 's conservative instincts were of great value to the English nobility . More victorious than Sulla , he could have planted his veterans on the estates of the Church and the English malignants , and have made the chances of a restoration all but impossible . He began such a policy in Ireland by placing his veterans there . But it seems clear that Cromwell wished to reign as well as to rule , and that his plans for this object were only half formed at his premature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history has ever so largely affected the current of events . It is , of course , idle to speculate on what would have happened , had the life of this great man been prolonged to a natural duration . It is clear , however , that he could have ousted Spain from the New World and the Low Countries , that he would have curbed , or at least have controlled , the ambition of France , and would have reversed the treaty of Westphalia in the interests of Protestant ascendancy . The army of Cromwell was , as has been observed , unlike anything before or since . It was not only irresistible* but it conquered before it fought , and its resources were inexhaustible . It was far superior to the English bowman , the most dreaded arm of the fourteenth century , or the Swiss pikeman , the mainstay of the French monarchs in the fifteenth , or the Spanish man-at-arms , the terror of the sixteenth . But Germany was exhausted by the ThirtyYears ' war ; and France was under a minority , // where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do in making head against the French nobles ; and Sweden was in the hands of the degenerate daughter of Gustavus ; and the democracy of Holland was infatuated in favor of the cold-blooded and selfish house of Orange . The Restoration was the opportunity for the English Lords . They sprang at once into an active House of Parliament , with many new privileges , which they called old , and many ancient claims , which they passed to the uttermost . They were completely independent of the sovereign , for Charles knew that it would be wise to temporize with Parliament , and he quite understood how much he owed to the Lords . He never thwarted them but once , and on that occasion they strove , in the interest of one of their order , to annul a conveyance by act of Parliament  --  the conveyance , namely , made by the then Earl of Derby to Sergeant Glynne of the estate which , after long having been in possession of that lawyer 's male descendants , is now occupied by Mr. Gladstone . The Restoration is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is the commencement of a twin institution , the modern English Church . Both these political instruments were so entirely changed at this epoch that their previous character has hardly any association with their later development-has little more than an antiquarian interest . The Anglican Church , from the accession of Elizabeth to the Act of lITniformity , a period of about a century , was a national Church , rejected by only a few sectaries . Since the Act of Uniformity it has been mainly a political institution , weak in the large towns , and powerful chiefly by its association with the landed interest . The House of Lords up to the same period was feeble , servile , and wholly unimportant as a political institution . But , immediately on the Restoration , it became as vigorous as the House of Commons , and in a generation it overshadowed and controlled that House . During the reign of Charles II , almost every statesman who took a prominent position in public affairs was a peer . It was in the House of Lords that the opposition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the House of Lords which expelled the Stuarts , and bestowed the crown on the remotest and , politically speaking , the most unimportant descendant of James I. The English royal family was placed on the throne , not only by an act of Parliament , which does not differ from any other act of Parliament , but was maintained on the throne by the Lords , for it was in this Chamber that the principles of the Revolution were dominant , and // it was this Chamber which thwarted the iutrigues of Bolingbroke and Atterbury for the restoration of the Stuarts . Several circumstances materially assisted the assertions of the Lords . They had been faithful to monarchical institutions , and yet had in the main secured their wealth , while they underwent an easy ostracism , which adhesion to the Protectorate would have instantly removed . On the other hand , the country gentlemen were more zealous for the exiled Stuarts , and were more seriously injured . The impoverished Cavaliers were all from the untitled gentry , for it would be difficult to find a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Again , many of those who had sided with the Revolution of Cromwell were ennobled for their adhesion to the Restoration of Charles . Some , like Ashley , afterward Lord Shaftesbury , had the baseness to sit in judgment on the men with whom they had acted , and to assist in the pitiful revenge which the restored King took on his enemies . Again , the last fifty years of the seventeenth century was a period in which wealth was accumulated in England with great rapidity , especially by companies trading on a common and chartered stock . Great improvements were also made during the same time in the art of agriculture , and rents rose with unexampled speed . The incomes of public officials had been small in the first half of the seventeenth century ; they became enormous in the second half , for Charles introduced into England the French system , by which fees of office were multiplied . The policy of the Tudor kings had broken down entails , and the lawyers of the Restoration devised a new conveyance , under which an infinitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an aristocracy is the inevitable government of any country , the law of which assists the aggregation of real estate in few hands , the English nobility had everything to favor them . Besides , it is impossible to adjust the balance of political power between two Chambers . One must needs serve the other , and Jacob will supplant Esau , or Esau vex Jacob . At this epoch the character of the House of Commons assisted the political superiority of the Lords . Gathered , in a fit of unreasoning passion and even more irrational loyalty , from the dregs of the Cavalier party , it sacrificed almost everything for which its predecessors had contended . It relinquished its control over the public purse , for it gave Charles a large hereditary revenue . It relinquished its control over the clergy , for it suffered Convocation to recast the Liturgy of the Church , contenting itself with the barren protest that it could have introduced changes , had it chosen , in the forms of public // worship : It relinquished its hold on the nation by consenting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was systematically bribed by the King . It was ignorant as well as venal , and was easily manipulated by the unprincipled adventurers who undertook business on Charles 's account . In self-defense , because here there was a common interest , the Lords allowed it to assert Parliamentary privilege , and even made use of it , in order to indirectly strengthen the dominant order , while it quarreled with it over details . But , most of all , the decayed boroughs were largely bought by the nobles , and the representatives of these wretched villages became the obedient nominees of aristocratic proprietors . It was not wonderful , after the experience of power and wealth which came to the nobles through the Parliamentary system of the Restoration , that , when the Stuarts betook themselves to their old madness of suspending Parliamentary institutions , the Lords conspired against them and expelled them . If Charles had lived ten years longer , and had continued during those ten years , as he did during the last four of his reign , to dispense with Parliaments , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother was . It was during the reign of Charles II that the Lords arrogated or extended many of their privileges , as well as appropriated the substance of political power . They revived their claim to sit as a court of justice , and even on certain memorable occasions asserted that they had an original jurisdiction . Ultimately the Commons conceded that they had a right to hear appeals . Such a travesty of justice was never imagined , and the wonder is that it was tolerated . That a number of men , amounting sometimes to nearly two hundred , who were rarely possessed of any legal education , should presume to review the decisions of the courts , and decide questions of law by majorities , was as absurd as it was audacious . The lawyers showed their opinion of the matter by neglecting to report the Lords ' decisions . But the right continued till , a serious scandal having been nearly perpetrated in 1769 , in the Douglas peerage case , the lay Lords tacitly abandoned the practice of voting on appeals , and left this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their House , and might have the leisure or inclination to attend to the pleadings . The Lords , during the same period , affirmed in the Purbeck case that a peer could not by any voluntary act of his own relinquish his peerage , and strove to restrain all criticism on their doings by the privilege of punishing what was called scandalum magnatum , inflicting penalties by their own act on those // who offended their order , as they did in the case of James Percy , or refusing to administer justice , as they did in the case of Gates . It is possible , as Macaulay has urged , though the protests do not bear out his interpretation of the facts , that the Lords were angry at having been made the dupe of this infamous man ten or a dozen years before he came before them for redress , but there was no excuse for the attitude which they assumed toward their petitioner , and it is certain that long after the Revolution a very considerable section of the Lords believed in the reality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Stafford 's attainder did not take place till 1824 , one hundred and forty-four years after his conviction , and this reversal was even then strongly protested against by one of the most respectable peers . The political power of the House of Lords , dominant since the Restoration , was made absolute at the Revolution . The peers expelled the male Stuarts , and became the heirs of their prerogative . That they succeeded to the functions of monarchy , and distributed them among the leading families of the Revolution , is curiously illustrated by their temporary patronage of letters . In every civilized community , except England , literary eminence is the readiest road to the highest administrative functions . In the United States , in France , and to some extent in Germany , conspicuous capacity in the noblest branch of human learning , history , is the passport to distinction , and , if the possessor of such learning cares for it , to the public service . In England it is a disadvantage , and , as a consequence , no public men are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historians are such mere annalists and mere antiquaries as English men of letters . The philosophy of history , notwithstanding the abundant materials for it , is at the lowest ebb in England , which does not even possess a respectable summary of its own political career . For a time , however , the Lords found it to be expedient ( and felt it to be expedient , till they discovered the easier art of corruption ) to use the services of men of letters in support of the new model . Thanks to Cromwell 's failure as a politician , the English people hated an army , and determined , thanks to the more conspicuous failure of the army which James gathered at Hounslow , to have done with armies in England , which , as the militia bill of the Long Parliament taught them , must be in the name of the Crown , but might be in the hands of a docile and well-regulated House of Commons . But it was necessary to conciliate , for a time at least , the // smothered republicanism of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the country clergy and the country squires . At the Revolution , there was no peer of Parliament who could have produced the effect which Shaftesbury achieved , by his letter " of a person of quality to a friend in the country , " and the Lords had to betake themselves to the services of men of letters . Such a man was sometimes a venal hack , as Defoe was in 1688-1720 , and many leader-writers in London dailies are now . But he occasionally was a man of spirit as well as of ability . The Whigs of the Revolution never made a greater blunder than when they discarded and offended Swift . There is , I believe , no English political pamphlet which for vigor equals this writer 's essay on the conduct of the allies , none in which there is more art , and , one must add , more sophistry . It was written when Swift had passed over to the Tories , when , after dancing attendance on Harley , and doing porter 's work for his employers , he was finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary calling and banishment to an Irish deanery . To understand the conclusion of Swift 's career in a modern parallel , we must imagine a leading English man of letters , who has gained a splendid but precarious reputation by the advocacy of a great and expectant party , offered , as the reward of his services , the bishopric of Toronto or of Cape Town ! The illegitimate children of Charles II had been raised to the highest rank in the peerage , but had joined the party of the nobles at the Revolution . Charles had done by his children what Louis XIV did by his . Before this time the title of duke had rarely been conferred on any but legitimate members of the royal family . After the Revolution it was very generally bestowed ; for the heads of the English aristocracy had no mind to occupy an inferior rank to the offspring of those courtesans , especially as they were superior to them in wealth and influence . But it can not be doubted that the extensive grant of this titl&amp;added to the political strength @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their power as a body in the reign of Anne , and were generally , indeed inevitably , Whig in their political tendencies . They were weakened , however , by the addition of the Scottish contingent in 1707 , and by the simultaneous creation of twelve Tory peers on December 31 , 1711 . Nothing but the pressure of the strongest political necessity induced the English Lords to acquiesce in the introduction of the Scotch nobles to their Chamber . The Scotch peers were nearly as numerous as the English , though the population of the northern part of the island was probably not // much more than a tenth of that in the southern , and the portion of Scotland which supplied this redundant nobility was not much more than a third of the district included in that northern kingdom . The English peers thought that sixteen of these nobles , elected for a single Parliament by the suifrages of the whole order , would have too great an influence in the House . They were in the right ; for , in point of fact , this Scotch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their means that Harley supplanted the Whigs , brought the war with France to an end , and reduced Marlborough to a private station . The Whig peers avenged themselves by carrying a resolution , in 1711 , which disabled any Scotch lord who might be introduced to the English peerage from taking his seat in the House , or from taking part in the trials of peers ; while , in the reign of George I , they actually attempted to limit the number of their own order by restraining the King 's power of creating peers . When Walpole and his rival Pulteney were simultaneously ennobled , the ex-Minister is said to have addressed the late leader of the opposition with- " Here we are , my lord , the two most insignificant fellows in the kingdom ! " He was alluding to the fact that , though the Lords were still the dominant element in the English Government , the power which they possessed was virtually wielded by those who had bought or inherited the greatest number of nomination boroughs . Such a man was the Duke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members whom Charles attempted to arrest in the House of Commons . Nothing seems to prove more conclusively how wholly aristocratic had been the Revolution of 1688 , and how clearly convinced the nobles were that the power which the Crown had hitherto wielded would pass to their hands , than the fact that no attempt whatever was made to reform the House of Commons , and to redress the absurdity by which the representatives of Cornish and Wiltshire villages actually swamped all the English counties by their numbers . It has been alleged that this reform was distasteful , because Cromwell had constructed his Houses of Commons with some regard to numerical equality in the constituencies , and that no precedents of his creation could be acknowledged . It is much more reasonable to conclude that the Lords foresaw the consolidation of their own power in the maintenance of a system which gave the counties and a few large toWns freedom of speech in Parliament , and secured the practical control of the Commons though the nomination boroughs . During the eighteenth century , whatever political independence there was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counties and a very few boroughs . The dullest page in English history is that of the century in which the English aristocracy managed the nation 's affairs . It contains , however , one episode the effects of which are greater and more lasting than any series of connected events in the history of civilized man . The Seven Years ' war settled for ever the question as to which of the European races should effect the colonization of the world . In 1750 it might have been well believed that France was destined for this function , or at least for the largest share in it . The peace of Paris not only stripped France of her colonies , but extinguished colonial enterprise among her people . ilenceforward all movements from the Old World are absorbed and lost in the great exodus of the English-speaking race . Nothing has ever been so critical as the issue of that struggle which gave Northern America and India to the English people , which gave them also the first start in the race by which they have occupied every place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angel of Fate had said , though no one had the wisdom to hear him , to the whole of Europe , other than the British Islands " Too late , too late ! ye can not enter now ! " But this work was not done by the English aristocracy ; it was effected by an adventurer , and , to all appearance , one of the least promising of adventurers-by the son of a man who had been dignified by the title of a governor , when he was really the manager of a trading-factory in India , and who had got wealth by dealing in a stolen diamond . But the elder Pitt was an Englishman , and knew how to deal with the instincts of his countrymen . In the Seven Years ' war he conquered the world for his race . The aristocracy of England were at their wits ' end for money wherewith to meet the charges of this war , for in the middle of the eighteenth century a direct tax on land was the most important and the most obvious item in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plantations ; and , though it is certain that , had the colonists been properly invited to aid in the charge incurred , they would have cheerfully taken such a share of the burden as their resources would have permitted them , they resented the high-handed mode on which the English Parliament determined . Then came the War of Independence . The acknowledgment of American independence led in England to the abolition of that control over the Irish Parliament which had lasted since the reign of Henry VII , and of that penal code by which the aristoo // racy of the Revolution intended to extinguish the religion and the nationality of the Irish . But the greatest issue of the American War of Independence was the outbreak of the French Revolution , the natural but frantic fears of the English nobility , the reaction which Pitt was too timid to resist and too ambitious not to utilize , and the postponement for nearly half a century of Parliamentary reform . It is admitted by Sir A. Alison , the Tory historian , that the war with republican France was undertaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English politicians are aware that hitherto nothing has been so effectual a barrier to any change , however necessary it may be , as the committal of the people to a vigorous foreign policy  --  the maintenance , in political phraseology , of the place of England in the Continental system . At last , but only by the force of such widespread disaffection as almost amounted to a popular revolt , Parliamentary reform was conceded . It was not a very drastic measure , for , though many decayed towns and deserted villages were disfranchised , the distribution of representation remained very unequal , and , even under a second reform act , is still full of anomalies . But the power of the House of Lords fell with the first Reform Bill . The English aristocracy is indeed , thanks to the concentration of land in few hands , still exceedingly powerful , possessing the whole of one House and being overwhelmingly strong in the other ; though the estimate which is made of their income , even if they had , as they notoriously have not , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an eighth of the reputed income or earnings of the whole nation . But they do not any longer directly control the policy of the nation . An administration may be inconvenienced , but it is not at all imperiled when it is in a very decided minority in the Lords , if it be not strengthened by such a contingency . When a Conservative administration is in office , nothing is likely to disturb the calm of the House of Lords . When a Liberal government is in power and is strong , the resistance of the Lords to a measure is nearly as obsolete as the veto of the Crown , though the practice of reading and debating bills in the Lords certainly tends to the delay of business , and the upper Chamber is occasionally able by such delays and by their amendments to postpone a change or to modify it . But it is not easy to conceive that this Chamber would put any serious obstacle in the way of popular demand . Perhaps this is the reason why , when noblemen respond to the toast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to speak of it as , after all , a representative body . The Lords rarely meet in any number , and their debates are soon over . An after-dinner sitting or a general gathering is a very exceptional event . Were it not for the understanding that a certain number of the Cabinet shall be in the upper House ( a mere conventional arrangement ) , it is probable that it would be often difficult to get a House together at all , even though there is no rule that there should be a quorum present . The writer once asked a Liberal peer of his acquaintance why it was that the House had not established a standing order constraining the younger peers at least to serve on committees , and was answered that " it was hard enough to get a dozen peers together for business , and that , were such a burden put on them , so numerous a gathering would be impossible . " It is true that a few of the lords work very hard . The writer once expressed his surprise at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was told that " some of them must work in order to save the whole from absolute inanition and futility . " In point of fact , the English nobility understands its altered position , and is at no pains to affect diligence in the business of a Chamber which has no real business to do ; which is contentedly idle when Conservatism is in the ascendant , and is discontentedly idle when Liberalism is at once active and popular . But , even if the Lords were ever so willing to work , they could not find work to do , for their activity would be suspicious and would be resented . Frequent demonstrations by the order , large gatherings , energetic debates , long division lists , would be met with irritation or treated with contempt . On all great matters , the peers of the English Parliament are impotent , and their speeches excite little more than the languid interest of a debating club seated in an historic Chamber . As a genuine political force , the upper House is practically obsolete and unreaL It retains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker and the Commons are still summoned to its bar , when the Clerk of Parliament , after solemn reverences to the throne and the commissioners , haughtily informs the mouth-piece of the lower House that the royal assent has been given , or that the gifts of good subjects have been accepted ; but the power which the House wielded from the Restoration to the Reform Bill has become a pageant . As a legislative body , the Lords have become , as Walpole said , " the most insignificant fellows in the kingdom . " If , as many , perhaps most , publicists allege , the c&amp;5rdinate ac // tivity of two Chambers is necessary for the balance of political forces , the English nation is not possessed of this requisite in the House of Lords . But , as is generally the case with countries where government is administered on the lines of an unwritten constitution , the English people has secured a double Chamber in the Cabinet and the lower House  --  the latter expression implying the unofficial part of the Commons , and with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cabinet , which is always in session , really , and by means of its following , dominates over the opposition . This is illustrated by the fact that it is very difficult for a private member , however numerous and respectable may be his following , and however reasonable may be his proposals , to carry what is called a private as opposed to a government measure through the House ; and impossible , unless the government of the day favors or accedes to his projected law . This fact explains what must be strange to those who study the working of the English Parliament , how it often happens that a measure , propounded by a private member , may be rejected by decisive majorities in one session , and be carried by as decisive a majority , and by the same Parliament , in another session . Another noteworthy fact is , that no economist in the House of Commons , however energetic and persevering he may be , and however good a case he may make out , ever succeeds in rejecting or even in reducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is thrown away , for governments are very sensitive to criticism in supply , or at least very unwilling to provoke opposition to their estimates ; but the direct effect of divisions on government expenditure , even in the smallest details , is practically nil . For nearly a quarter of a century the late Mr. Joseph Hume strove to check government expenditure by criticism , and confessed that all his efforts had been unavailing , all his time wasted . But he stuck manfully to his habit . In nearly the last year of his life , when the Duke of Wellington was being buried in St. Paul 's with great and lingering pomp , an acquaintance of the writer , who , holding some official rank , was placed near the aged economist in the cathedral , heard him say sadly , in the most solemn part of the service : " Great Heaven ! who is to pay for all this ? " He had no doubt that the House of Commons would sanction the payment for the last ostrich-feather and the last yard of crape . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereditary capacity an anomalous position , for they have at last conceded to the administration permission to create a limited number of lifepeers , // chiefly with the object of supplementing the legal element in the Chamber . Many English writers have alleged , and with great show of reason , that , if an upper Chamber is useful and if the hereditary principle is to be respected , it is expedient to leaven the anomaly with a large infusion of some popular element , and that the most conservative process by which this change can be effected is to create life-peers from such members of the Commons as have served the public in the lower House well and for some time . But , if the experiment were tried on a small scale , it would have but little effect on the very large hereditary element which can , if it pleases , present itself in the house of Lords ; and if it were largely used , apart from the fact that it would make the Lords inconveniently numerous , the expedient would continually weaken the lower House by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who quitted the popular for the irresponsible Chamber . The admirers of a brand-new peer are always far fewer than those of a popular leader , as Chatham discovered , and many inferior men have found since . A man may be excused the dignity which he has inherited ; it is another thing to run after Naaman the Syrian , and get a change of raiment from him . There are of course vain men , insignificant men , and adventurers , whom titular dignity makes neither better nor worse . But there has been sound political good sense in the attitude which the two most considerable English statesmen of modern times , Peel and Gladstone , have taken in reference to what was once thought the final course of a political career-the acceptance of a peerage .
