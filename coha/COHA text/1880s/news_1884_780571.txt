txt " Not a single lecture that I have given in the United States has been attended with nearly as much responsibility as my subject tonight , " said Mgr . Capel last evening at St. Vincent Ferrer Church . where he had been announced to speak on " The Inquisition and Toleration in Religion . " If any of the memberil of the press be present , " he continued , " may I be permitted to ask them to spare me and to spare us Catholics anything like an inaccurate report ? It is not possible that the press of the country should be sufficiently interested in this subject to give it a large amount of space . But I do wish that what we teach be represented faithfully to the public . I stand here with the permission of his Eminence , I stand here with the permission of the Dominican Fathers , to exercise that authority which comes from the Holy ' See . " There is not a father hero present , " began , Mgr . Cape , " there is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orphan brother with us who does not wise to protect the home in which he or she may live against every iniquity without . That is a proposition which no Catholic , no Protestant , or no non-believer can : deny . For it is the duty of each to save household from the iniquitious teachings of they world in which we live . Are there any here so ; degraded as to tell me that an iniquitious novel may enter their homes ? Are there any here who will tell me that abominations may be read ( in their households ? Are there any here who : will tell me that the iniquities of the world shalt be described in newspapers or novels ? If so , let them leave the church . " Mgr . Capel paused , but no one moved . " The Catholic Church has always endeavored to protect her members . She has said , ' My children , exposed to danger that may bring you misery , I must be your mother . I must teach , you that certain books are wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that companionshiA with such and such people must be attended with evil effects . ' What would be the most effective way for the father of a family to protect his dear ones from insult ? I suppose 50 out of 100 men would say . ' Kick the fellow out who would interfere in this way . ' The other 20 would say , ' Well , we must be thoughtful and not act hastily . ' I am with the 80. if you please . I may be wrong theologically , but that 's my opinion . Now 1 will make a statement , which L. shall ask the members of the press to take down .. It is this : Whatever the world does at the period in which we live to protect property , what . ever the world noes at this minute to protect honor , ci fortiori is it to protect the purity and truth of the Catholic Church . Whatever is done for the protection of a man 's life , is all that and more for the sake of his purity . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hang a man for taking the life of another , I will imprison and I will bang the man who takes from me my faith . Give me for my faith precisely that which you give for other interests . The interest of property is one , and the lowest . The interest of honor is two . The interest of life is three . The interest of faith is four , and above all . Who of you will say a word against this ? I am hero to listen to objections . Let him who objects stand up and say so . " No one rose to Mgr . Capel 's suggestion . " All this of which I have spoken . " he resumed , " was the principle MIMI which the Inquisition was founded . It is a repetition of he power of father awl mother over their household . Thus it was in the hands of the saintly Dominican and his order . " Ladies and gentlemen , " said Mgr . Cape ! , Producing a paper , " I 'm going to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fail me . The Inquisition exists at this moment just as it existed in the days of Saint Dominick . The Inquisition has its centre in Rome , and its name is written in golden letters . You enter the building and are met by tender friends and kindly faces , with an amount of politeness which , were America to possess its one-rill= liontli part , would make every American a kohtleman .. or a lady . And that Inquisition . bears ing its own honored name , but a name that those without would fain destroy , stands there on its own ground  --  a model institution . Twelve Cardinals  --  Princes of the church  --  have since 1,542 composed its corporate body . An ? emissary discharges its functions as Judge Ordinary . A Councilor is one of the Superintendents . A consultator selected by the Pow ) himself from among the most learned theologians and canonists constitutes the delensor- : ship of those guilty . Qualificators are appointed to drive their opinion on questions submitted to , them , and an acocat is charged with the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tute the completion of this congregation . So constituted , the examiners are presided over by the Pope . and no judgment of that inquisition can be given except by the Pope himself . " My dear friends , you who on this side of the Atlantic , and I who on the other , boast of ajury , ' here is a jury of 12 Princes  --  men of renown el learning , in goodness , and in influence  --  who ! have been selected among the 200,000,000 of , human beings who constitute the Church . Cath ' - , olic . Twelve shoemakers and 2 butchers may ; pair their opinions here and men are . proud to say they are acquitted . But to be judged by Cardinals , by those possessed of judgment-that is the inquisition . Now , " continued Monsignor , ! " it is the custom to turn back and say . ' ' Look at the past . ' Nothing so provokes ; me as to hear intelligent men always talking , of the past . For God 's sake give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why talk non- ' sense and rubbish , colored like that of the east . Do n't think that I am affrighted ' by reference to it , however . ' Look at the horrors of the Inquisition , ' people say . Now , what are those people ? What do they know of it ? Have those who talk of the Inquisition read an original book ? Not a bit of it . What do they . read ? Some Protestant writer 's translations . The Inquisition did its duty like the father who. would spare its family from iniquity . Never in its history did it forget its duty . When it was necessary , under Ferdinand and Isabella , to call in a tribunal to save children and that tribunal asserted its own power , that was not the Catholio Church . It was an engine of King Ferdinand ' and Queen Isabella that made the people suffer , ' as it was used for political purposes . The Pope wrote against it article after article , and the church spoke of the cruelties exercised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjects . The principle of the Inquisition was , however , no false teaching . " Now , " concluded the lecturer , " we live in. the nineteenth century , but as regards toleration ' do n't let us make a mistake . The nineteenth : century is pretty well the same as 20 centuries , ago . I have watched pretty carefully your elec- ! tion . You have called each other liars , rascals , ! and thieves , and you have said it and accepted its as if it were a favor . A great and noble people ! ) Good . I turn back to the pages of Levi , who wrote the history of Rome , and I find the same speeches almost to a word . I find the same kind : of demagogues , who , while they say to all the ' people ' Be as free as the air add you must follow me , I 'm a Blainelte , or a Clevelandite , or a Mrs. Bella Somebodyite , or a St. Johnite . ' I look with extraordinary interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic , in the days in which we live . On the ground of friendship love you . An ardent Protestant , however , says , You would like to have them all of a heap , by a good big fire , eat . the last bit of flesh well cooked , and feel that you have got them . ' No , that is not true . The Catholic Church is the most char. , ita.ble institution . Wo ask no favor . Give fair play . Let us state our truths . Every human ' being who acts according to his conscience , who ' has no doubt about his position , let him continue in his way Laud the God or mercy will give him his reward .
