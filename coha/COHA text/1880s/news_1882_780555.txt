txt The proposition to permit the delivery of Winter wheat on contracts calling for wheat was formally placed before the Board of Trade to-day , being posted in the usual way . There was also another posting of wheat , about 46,000 bushels in the National Elevator being declared out of condition . This lessens by so much the quantity available for delivery on April contracts , and gives the longs an additional advantage . They advanced the price yesterday . They say now that our surplus wheat is wanted for distillation , being too valuable for milling purposes . The information comes from New-Orleans that five steamer cargoes of wheat are on the way ( by rail ) to that city from , California . The wheat was sold to be delivered there the first week In May , and is contracted to go through to Europe in 33 days . This is indeed a new departure . It has long been talked of by British merchants as a fact of the future , which might be expected to revolutionize the trade . On ' Change to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The market for June advanced I cent , then declined l% cents , and closed about the same as on Wednesday , while April was 1 cent higher , The British markets were called quiet , but warm , and the quantity here available for delivery on contracts was reduced 40.000 bushels by the posting of so much in the Natiohal Elevator . while our receipts continued small . The posting scarcely helped the price of the longer futures , as some people were mean enough to construe it as a reflection on the character of the other wheat in store , and it perhaps reduced the number of outside buyers ' orders . There was also some uncertainty with regard , to the proposed new rules which would affect the wheat deal , but holders were firmer in sympathy with the higher prices for this month insisted on by the promise or a further advance tomorrow . Then came advices from St. Louis of numerous telegrams from Southern Illinois and Missouri , stating that millions of chinch-bugs are at work in the wheat fields and that some farmers are already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telegrams said : " Texas crop half ruined by rust and chinch-bug. " but this news did not seem to produce much effect , and the market weakened later when New-York was quoted weak , with shippers holding back because afraid of the effect of large Importations into Great Britain . Seller , April , was held all the time at $1 40 , with few settlements at that figure .
