txt The most significant item in the tax-list of this City , just submitted by the Commissioners of Taxes and Assessments to the Aldermen as a Board of Supervisors , is not the increase . of nearly fifty millions in the valuation of real and personal property , but the decrease of nearly two and a half millions in that of bank shares . Any one who has taken notice of the marked revival in building and improvement on real estate , especially in the up-town wards , and of the advance in rents and market value of this class of property all over the City , was prepared to expect a large increase in the valuation for the purpose of taxation . This improvement was a result to be anticipated from the revival of general prosperity in business , and the corresponding and somewhat greater increase in the valuation of personal property has been produced by the same causes . But what is to be said of the falling off , at the same time and under the same circumstances , in the amount of taxable bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On its commercial activity and facilities its prosperity mainly depends . Banking is an important part of the machinery of commerce . As trade increases the operations of banks multiply , and they have occasion to employ larger amounts of capital , in order to afford the facilities which constitute their peculiar function . If they are in any way cramped or discouraged in doing this , all business is more or less hampered and kept back from its normal development . If they suffer from no burdensome restrictions , they not only respond promptly to the demand for greater facilities , but furnish an actual stimulus to the activity which is induced by other causes . But at a time when business is active and increasing , and the value of property is enhancing at a rapid rate , we find that in this great commercial city , the centre of the exchanges of the country , the aggregate valuation of bank shares ? in other words , the amount of bank capital in use ? is falling off . For this there must be some cause outside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is suggested by the appearance of this item in the tax-list . If we turn to the rate of taxation of banks in the past , a rate that will be substantially maintained this year , we find the incubus which is crushing upon this important part of the machinery of our commerce and clogging its movements . In the first place , the Federal tax upon the national banks of this City amounts to more than 2 per cent , of their capital every year . To this the State adds nearly 3 per cent. , subjecting them to the tremendous burden of about 5 per cent . The consequence has been seen in a steady decline for several years in the amount of capital invested in this branch of business . The capital of the banks of this City in 1872 was over $84,000,000 ; in 1880 it is little more than $60,000,000 : . A single comparison will serve to emphasize the significance of this fact . In Boston , where the tax is little more than one-half as great , the bank capital during the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase . With a population three times as great as that of Boston , with a volume of trade still larger in proportion , with bank clearings of twelve times the volume , and with its position as the centre of exchanges for the Western Continent , New-York has only about $11,000 , - 000 more invested in banks than that provincial city . These Simple facts show what our rural legislators have been doing to promote the greatness of the American Metropolis . They have been binding its banking interests unmercifully with the strangling bands of taxation , and they have shown a disposition to draw them tighter instead of affording relief . That business has not yet suffered more than it has is due to the fact that foreign capital has found its way into this market to relieve it from asphyxia . It has heretofore been subject only to the national tax of one-half of 1 per cent. , but our Legislature has found it out , and by a law recently signed has put another half per cent . upon it , while endeavoring to thrust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Supreme Court promised to release them . The only relief afforded by the new law is in extending the privilege of deduction for debt , so as to apply it to bank shares as a part of the personal property of the holders . The relief is insignificant , and will not perceptibly lighten the burden which is crushing an all-important agency of our-commerce . Will the assessment of bank shares this year under the ' old law or that of the future under the new law bear the test applied last Winter by the Supreme Court of the United States ? The capital which they represent can not be taxed at a higher rate than " other moneyed capital in the hands of individual citizens . " Looking again at the tax-list , we find that the valuation of personal property other than bank shares is less than one-sixth that of real estate , while it Is. a . denionitrible fact that the classes of property Which it covers amount in the aggregate .. ; of value in any commercial community t ? - sum fully as great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ connection with . which ' it is owned or employed .

Is the " Other moneyed capital " represented in personal property assessed and taxed . at as great a rate 2 Again , laws have been " passed ' laying special taxes on corporations and various aggregations of capital which bear no comparison with that imposed upon bank shares . Does this conform to the spirit of the national law ? The banks of this City propose to find an answer to these questions . A large number of suits have been brought against the Tax Commissioners to have the levy of this year set aside . It is almost a question of life and death for the banks , and it is a matter of no small moment to all the business interests of the City , and if We can not get rational legislation in this State , it will be something if its oppressive laws can be . set aside by the courts .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
