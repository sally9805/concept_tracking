FIFTH ACT .  --  Same as at end of Fourth Act . NOTE FOR STAGE MANAGER . SPECIAL ATTENTION should be given to the climax scenes of Act Second and Act Third . These scenes are very effective if properly acted , and very flat if not properly acted . Their effect depends upon the instantaneous response of every actor to his or her cue . If there is a moment 's hesitation on the part of any one the interest drops , and it can not be revived . The phrases , " Go on , Mr. Benedict , " &c.,; in Act Second , should be taken up with great energy and unction by each of the actors in succession . Near the end of Act Third the general movement of all on the stage should be continued with energy , until fall of curtain . Main text @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . Evening reception . The centre gallery . Arches R. and L. leading to other galleries , in which pictures are seen . Centre door with gallery and pictures beyond . Wide balustrade , C. , with stairs leading up from below . Pictures on all the walls . Statuary , &c.; A landscape on the side up R. Nearer front a portrait of a lady , low neck , and a picture to be referred to as the " Card Players . " On the left side an easel with a picture representing a white cat , &c.,; appropriate to SIR MORTIMER 'S speech about " Nemesis . " On an easel , L. C. , a large painting referred to as the head of Cyrus the Great , and so arranged that SACKETT can fall through it . Music at rise of curtain . Guests moving to and fro . Gentlemen mostly in evening dress-suit . Ladies in opera costumes . Some looking at pictures with catalogues in their hands . Others passing through entrances R. and L. and C. , and up and down the stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture on easel L. C. The ARTIST motioning in dumb show , apparently pointing out its merits in detail . During the conversation he walks out with party , L. , still talking to them . OGDEN with a gentleman pauses up L. , before the white cat picture , SIR MORTIMER MUTTONLEGG standing at her R. LIVINGSTON with a gentleman pauses before the landscape up R. , MAJOR LUDDINGTON WHIST joins her , standing on her L. OGDEN ( coming forward with SIR MORTIMER , L. ) . No. 395  --  What is the subject of No. 395 , Sir Mortimer ? SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( looking at catalogue ) . A-h  --  " Nemesis "  --  by J. H. Dolphe . OGDEN . Ah ! I was wondering if that was " Nemesis "  --  Nemesis is such a sweet pretty subject to illustrate . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer R. Y-e-s , that is  --  ah  --  yes  --  very pretty subject indeed  --  a-h  --  by the-way  --  what is a " Nemesis , " Miss Ogden ? Do you know if the catalogue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Nemesis "  --  I should have taken it for a  --  cat  --  watching a  --  a-h  --  mouse  --  and a  --  chair  --  and  --  a-h  --  a big piece of cheese on the table . OGDEN . Why " Nemesis " is the name of the-cat , I suppose , Sir Mortimer . SIR . MORT . Oh  --  a-h  --  exactly  --  I  --  a-h  --  never heard the name before . The ARTIST goes out with party L. F. motioning as if talking earnestly . LIVINGSTON ( L. ) . Oh ! what a darling picture  --  the clouds are so very delicate  --  as fleecy  --  and as light as wool or  --  or cotton , they look so very real . THE MAJOR ( L. C. ) . They do look real  --  remarkably like cotton in that respect , Miss Livingston . LIVINGSTON . And the water is so exactly like real water  --  it seems as though you could bathe in that little brook  --  No  --  it is n't a brook  --  it 's only a stone fence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odd mistake . No gentleman could make it . I never mistook a stone fence for water in my life . LIVINGSTON . No. 273 . What is the subject of this one , Major Whist ? THE MAJOR ( reading from catalogue ) . " A Landscape . " I should almost have expected as much if I had n't seen the catalogue  --  these artists are particularly definite in their choice of titles . The ARTIST re-enters with a lady and gentleman  --  proceeds to motion before painting as before . OGDEN ( R.C. ) . Oh ! Sir Mortimer . You English gentlemen have travelled so much , and seen so many pictures , you must favour us with your criticisms as you go along , I do so dote on English gentle  --  I mean I do so dote on pictures , Sir Mortimer . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( R. ) . Y-e-s . OGDEN ( sits C. ) . What do you really think of this one , for instance ? You must n't be too severe on our American artists . SIR MORT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a-h  --  y-e-s  --  I  --  a-h  --  strong , decidedly strong ; we can  --  ah  --  hardly compare American artiste with Raphael or Michael Angelo  --  particularly when they are painting  --  a-h  --  cats . This picture is a-h  --  strong  --  in its way . I should say that the cat , however , was much stronger than the mouse . OGDEN ( sits ) . Very appropriately so , Sir Mortimer . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer And  --  a-h  --  the  --  ah  --  cheese  --  is  --  a-h  --  stronger than either . The ARTIST walks out R. E. with lady and gent , motioning as if speaking earnestly . LIVINGSTON . And this one , major ? THE MAJOR . " A portrait of a lady " ( consulting his catalogue ) . Another very definite title  --  who would have imagined , if we had n't seen it in print , that this was a portrait of a lady ? I should have mistaken her for the wife of a fortunate Wall Street broker ; and here is the Wall Street broker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his catalogue ) . " Gentlemen playing at cards . " The " gentleman " who has just played the knave , you see , has won the trick . Refer again , Miss Livingston , to the picture of the broker 's wife ; there are diamonds on her breast  --  how insulted she would be if she were called  --  a gambler 's wife !  --  Au revoir , Miss Livingston . He bows easily and strolls L. , the ARTIST re-enters at this point with two ladies from R. 1 . E. He proceeds to point out the merits of his pictures in dumb show . LIVINGSTON ( meantime to gentleman as the MAJOR walks away ) . Major Luddington Whist is in one of his bitter moods to-day .  --  It has been hinted in society that he is a gambler by profession . If that be true , he is sometimes , annoyed , perhaps , that other successful gamblers should secure a more certain footing in society . THE ARTIST ( L. C. enthusiastically ) . This has been the work of my life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! It is the head of Cyrus the Great  --  as you will see , of course , at the first glance . This noble man  --  Ah , Miss Livingston ! ( Detaining Livingston , who is running by with a gentleman . ) Delighted to see you this evening , Mr. Alterbury.  --  One moment , Mrs. Turningham . ( Turning and detaining the lady and gentleman , who had moved as if to leave . ) Your pardon for the interruption . ( To LIVINGSTON ) Delighted to see your respected parents in my studio again  --  Christian Association building  --  do not misunderstand me  --  we artists merely occupy studios in the building  --  we have no other personal association with Christians ! I was calling Mrs. Turningham 's attention to the last finished product of my easel . This has been the work of my life , ladies . I have spent years upon every detail ; it is the head of Cyrus the Great , as you see , of course , at a glance . This noble man  --  Ah , Miss Ogden ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gentleman . SIR MORT. strolls across up stage and looks at pictures , moving quietly down L. The MAJOR , looking at pictures R. , moving gradually up. )  --  Delighted to see you , Miss Ogden ; mamma well ? I was calling the ladies ' attention to the last finished product of my easel . This has been the work of my life , Miss Ogden . I have spent years upon every detail  --  it is the head of Cyrus the Great , as you see , of course , at a glance . This noble man  --  OGDEN ( looking at the picture on other easel , R. C. ) . What is the subject of this one , Mr. Langdon  --  No. 78 ? THE ARTIST . That  --  a-h  --  a young artist  --  promising  --  but crude as yet  --  thin in colour  --  and he needs experience in drawing . As I was about to remark  --  may I call your attention , by-the-way , to a little touch of colour here ?  --  that nose was the labour of months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away in different directions , strolling up and off at their leisure . The ARTIST proceeds , intent on his picture , pointing out each feature with his finger. )  --  You notice the curl of the lip ; I studied that from an old Egyptian relic  --  there are weeks of study in the curl of that lip  --  pride  --  royal dignity  --  military precision  --  a touch of cruelty . The inner corners of the eyes , too : do you see the world of meaning in the inner corner of that eye  --  the left eye , particularly ? Could any one fail to recognize that left eye for the left eye of Cyrus the Great ? You will excuse the enthusiasm of an artist  --  but this particular head is the crowning effort of my artistic life . Notice , if you please , the curl of the ear  --  do you not agree with me. that there is something peculiarly  --  ( Discovers that he is alone and talking to himself ; looks R. and L. indignantly , and marches out R. 1 . E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . E. ) . That is a particularly charming young girl with her papa , in front of the picture of Diana at the bath  --  charming girl . THE MAJOR ( coming down L. ) . Sir Mortimer Muttonlegg ! SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer Major Luddington Whist : at your service , my dear major . THE MAJOR . What do you think of our American art , Sir Mortimer ? SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer I  --  I think  --  y-e-s  --  a-h  --  that is  --  a-h  --  very nice painting in America . ( Aside , looking out R. ) That girl has an exquisite complexion ! ( Aloud , to MAJOR . ) Some very nice painting in America ( advancing ) . THE MAJOR . Speaking of art , Sir Mortimer  --  What do you think of our American ladies ? SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer Well  --  a-h  --  I do n't profess to be much of an art-critic , my dear major ; but , a-h  --  in regard to your American ladies , I  --  a-h  --  the fact is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your American girls are the most unaccountable creatures . We English gentlemen ca n't understand them at all , you know . By-the-way , yon do n't happen to know the young lady standing before the picture of Diana at the Bath  --  with an elderly gentleman ? THE MAJOR . Oh ! but I do though  --  one of the greatest belles in the city , Miss Effie Remington . Rich , piquant , wild as a young hawk , an heiress too ; half the fellows in New York are in love with her . ( Looking off L. ) Ah ! and there is Miss Virginia Vanderpool  --  another of our belles  --  with Mr. Cornelius Wethertree  --  the elderly bachelor  --  who has made love to every marriageable young lady within his reach for the last thirty years or more . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer She 's a deucedly charming girl ! is n't she , major ? A deucedly charming girl . THE MAJOR . The Vanderpool you mean ? Yes , a devilish , fine girl , my dear Sir Mortimer , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than three minutes on the road . It will pay the lucky one among her admirers in the end , however  --  her father owns half a dozen railroads , and a branch of National Banks . I 've shuffled the cards in that direction myself . I think it will pay in the end . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer But I was speaking of the other , my dear major  --  I referred to the Remington . Charming girl . THE MAJOR . Charming ! yes . Her father is nearly as rich as Papa Vanderpool himself . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer But seriously I referred to the young lady 's personal charms . THE MAJOR . And so did I. Old Remington is worth more than half a million  --  his daughter Effie is his only child  --  could anybody 's charms be more " personal " than that ? They walk up . The MAJOR afterwards strolls out at his leisure . Enter VIRGINIA VANDERPOOL and WETHERTREE , L. 1 . E. WETHERTREE . The picture of " Cupid sharpening his Arrows " is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to me , however , Miss Virginia  --  especially when one of his arrows is at this moment  --  VIRGINIA . Ah ! Mr. Wethertree , you know how to make such delightful speeches . Enter MRS . ALSTON , R. 1 . E. MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Ah ! Virginia , my love . VIRGINIA . My dear Olivia . ( They meet and kiss . ) WETHERTREE ( getting R. ) . Upon my word , ladies , I envy you both , I do upon my life . VIRGINIA ( L. ) . Oh , you naughty man . I was only just telling him , Mrs. Alston , that he knew so well how to make those delightful speeches . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston ( C. ) . I have frequently noticed it myself . WETHERTREE ( bowing ) . You flatter me , ladies . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston How could it be otherwise with so many long years of experience ? WETHERTREE . A-h-e-m ( turning away ) . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Ah ! Sir Mortimer Muttonlegg . Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortimer . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( L. ) . Ladies ! MRS . A. Mrs. Alston ( C. ) . Mr. Cornelius Wethertree studying American art and American society at the same time , my dear Sir Mortimer . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer Y-e-s  --  I  --  a-h  --  find it a very agreeable  --  a-h combination  --  in fact  --  I  --  a-h  --  by-the-way , Mrs. Alston , you are a  --  very beautiful  --  a-h  --  combination of nature and art yourself . She bows to him . WETHERTREE ( R. ) . And it would require a very acute observer of both nature and art , madam , to discover where one leaves off and the other begins  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! MRS . A. Mrs. Alston ( after bowing to Wethertree ) . Really , gentlemen  --  you are so very complimentary  --  allow me to return the compliment , Sir Mortimer , though art , perhaps , deserves the greater share of credit . As for yourself , Mr. Wethertree , nature asserts herself so strongly there  --  she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WETH. turns up R. SIR MORT . L. MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Virginia , love , have you decided where to spend the summer yet ? VIRGINIA . We are going to Saratoga . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Delightful , my dear , I am going to the Springs also . VIRGINIA . Father says we sha n't , but that does n't make any difference , you know . Enter EFFIE , R. 1 . E. looking cautiously R. and L. MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Of course not , my dear . Poor dear Alston ! he used to be so determined not to go to Long Branch or Saratoga . There is n't half the interest in going now that I am a widow , and can do as I please . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( looking at EFFIE ) . Deuced fine girl . WETHERTREE ( also looking at her ) . That is a magnificent creature . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston ( seeing Effie ) . Why Effie dear . EFFIE . Eh  --  oh  --  how you startled me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . ( Kisses her . ) WETHERTREE . I should n't mind being in Mrs. Alston 's lace . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( up stage ) . I  --  a-h  --  rather envy Miss Vanderpool . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Not alone , my dear Effie , at the reception . Where is your papa ? EFFIE . I left father discussing the question of pre-Raphaelite art , whatever that may be , with another old gentleman that knows as little about the subject as papa does . H-s-h  --  ( Putting her hands to her lips mysteriously , then taking them by the wrists and moving forward . ) H-s-h , I 'm on a lark to-night . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston A lark ? VIRGINIA . What 's the fun now ? EFFIE . H-s-h , it 's an awful lark . I would n't tell you what it is for the world ; there will be a row if papa finds it out . VIRGINIA . Yes . Oh ! that 's real jolly ; but wo n't you tell us ? EFFIE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ha  --  ha  --  ha ! Oh , but it 's an awful lark . I say , girls , have you made up your mind where you 're going to spend the summer ? I 'm going to Saratoga . VIRGINIA . Is n't that splendid , Alston ? So are we . EFFIE . Ha  --  ha  --  that 'll be jolly . Father says I sha' n't go to Saratoga , but I 'm getting ready all the same , and when the time comes I 'll pat him under the chin , and I 'll put my arms around his neck , and I 'll pinch his cheeks , and every time he goes to say " No , " I 'll put my lips over his mouth , and I sha n't let him open his lips until he says " Yes . " WETHERTREE and SIR MORT. come down R. and L. WETHERTREE ( L. ) and SIR MORT . ( R. ) . Ahem ! A-h-e-m . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Sir Mortimer Muttonlegg  --  Miss Effie Remington . VIRGINIA . Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delighted to make your acquaintance , Miss Remington . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( R. ) . Positively charmed to meet you , Miss Remington . WETH . Wethertree I assure , Miss Remington , that nothing  --  SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer Nothing could possibly  --  WETH. and SIR MORT . I  --  They approach C. until their heads meet in front of EFFIE , they look at each other and then turn up stage indignantly . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Ha  --  ha . A double conquest , Effie . VIRGINIA . Two birds with one shot . EFFIE . Down on both alleys . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Tell me , Effie ; with all your little conquests and your flirtations , is there no one yet  --  with a moustache , for instance , and with fascinating manners , you know ,  --  is there no one that calls for a genuine sigh now and then ? EFFIE . Heigho ! Y-e-s , he has got a moustache . MRS . A. and VIRG . Ha  --  ha  --  ha . EFFIE . Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly partial to ? MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Well , I 'm a woman , and we women must be petted , you know . How is it with Virginia ? VIRGINIA . Heigho , I am a woman too , I suppose . EFFIE . I once thought I never should care for one man more than another , men are all so stupid after you know them . But when Robert  --  MRS . A. Mrs. Alston Robert ! VIRGINIA . Robert ! why that is the name of my  --  ( checks herself ) . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston How very odd ; mine is named Robert also . EFFIE . Yours Robert , and yours ; why is n't it funny ? What 's his last name , Virginia ? VIRGINIA . Oh ! that 's a secret . EFFIE . A secret . That 's real nice ; tell us all about it . VIRGINIA . But it 's a real secret ! What 's your Robert 's last name ? EFFIE . That 's a secret , too . VIRGINIA . Yes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's a real secret . Olivia , what 's the last name of your Robert ? MRS . A. Mrs. Alston ( R.C. ) . If you young girls can keep a real secret , surely a widow can be equally profound . But what an odd fancy , Effie ,  --  a rosette upon your shoulder . EFFIE . Do you think it pretty ? It 's only a fancy of mine for to-night . I say Vanderpool ! Alston ! do n't let these fellows stay around me ; I have other business to attend to now ; take ' em with you when you go . MRS . A. Mrs. Alston My dear Sir Mortimer , I was looking for Bierstadt 's picture in the East Room , will you join me ? SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer ( R. ) . Certainly  --  a-h  --  only too happy , of course . ( Aside . ) Confoundedly awkward . I began to hope we should be left alone . MRS . A. takes his arm . VIRGINIA . You were going to show me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room , Mr. Wethertree ? WETH . Wethertree Certainly : I  --  ah !  --  ( aside )  --  I wish Cupid and his arrows were shot . WETH. and VIRG. go R. , MRS . A. and SIR . M. go L. WETH . Wethertree Good-afternoon , Miss Remington . SIR MORT . Sir Mortimer Au revoir , Miss Remington . Both going . They see handkerchief which EFFIE drops . Both gentlemen run to pick it up . SIR MORT. gets it . Then EFFIE drops her jan , which WETHERTREE picks up ; they both bow . Meet each other C ; as before , draw up indignantly . Return to their ladies , and exeunt R. and L. , leaving EFFIE alone . EFFIE ( alone ) . Now for my lark : he was to have on a white rose-bud , tied with a white ribbon . Let me see  --  ( looks at watch )  --  oh ! it 's fifteen minutes yet . I was to have the rosette  --  ( arranging it ) : that 's right . I wonder what sort o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll do : I 'll keep my hand over the rosette , and if I do n't like his looks , when I see the rose-bud , I 'll steal away and I 'll take off the rosette , and he will never know that any one was here to see him at all !  --  Ha , ha , ha ! ( Going L. 1 . E. LADIES and GENTLEMEN cross as she is going out L. She stares at the GENTLEMEN 'S lapelles . When they look in return , she draws up with dignity , and passes L. ) Oh , but it 's an awful lark ! Exit L. arch . Enter BENEDICT , followed by ROBERT SACKETT , upstairs . BEN . Benedict Hold on , Bob . What the deuce ! Fifteen minutes of nine ; exactly fifteen minutes a-head of time : that 's not what I call punctuality . Punctuality is on time exactly to the minute . Five minutes after time , a broken engagement . Fifteen minutes a-head of time , a quarter of an hour lost . Punctuality neither loses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear Sackett , absolutely , regularity should be the rule of every man 's life . Regularity has been the rule of my life ; I am a success . Regularity is the rule of nature . Nature is a success . But this appointment of yours at nine o'clock . You have n't told me as yet what the nature of the appointment is . Whom are you to meet ? A hundred to one it 's a woman . You have been as glum all the afternoon as if you had just buried your first wife , and the lady you had chosen for your second was about to marry another man . SACK . Sackett My dear Benedict , if you love me , do n't trifle with a subject so sacred as that of matrimony . Wedlock ! Two souls in the fond embrace of everlasting love ? Two hearts that beat eternally in unison  --  two  --  BEN . Benedict Two mouths to feed , two sets of limbs to clothe , too much , too long , too many children , too two fools  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . BEN . Benedict Oh ! certainly I do . The sublimity of love is the regular thing at our age . I was in love myself once , sublimity and all . It is , without exception , the most disagreeable memory of my life ; I could n't be regular in anything , except my meals . Why , I actually forgot to wind my watch three mornings in succession . SACK . Sackett You say you were in love ; you did n't marry the girl , it seems . BEN . Benedict Being a bachelor still , I certainly did not . The lady jilted me , and married another gentleman . She did better , however , than if she had married me . Her husband died in less than three years  --  I did n't . She is now a dashing widow , the envy of her own sex and the admiration of ours . SACK . Sackett Ah ! Benedict  --  Benedict , it is plain you have never loved as I love . BEN . Benedict No ; I dare say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wretched individual ; the fact is , I 'm in a quandary . BEN . Benedict M  --  , m  --  . The lady who has secured your affections does not return your love ? SACK . Sackett She adores me . We are engaged to be married . BEN . Benedict ( R. ) . She is poor , perhaps ; what of that ? You have an income . SACK . Sackett Her father has retired from Wall Street , with six or eight railroads in his vest pocket . BEN . Benedict Her parents object to the match ? SACK . Sackett Her parents never saw me , and they have n't the slightest idea that I 'm engaged to their daughter . BEN . Benedict Ah , I see ; the time has come for you to declare your love , and you are in suspense as to the result ? SACK . Sackett Quite the contrary . I 'm not in the least suspense . BEN . Benedict Well , but if you really love the girl  --  SACK . Sackett Really love her ! Never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name is Virginia ; beautiful name , is n't it ? BEN . Benedict Very well , my dear fellow ; if you love the girl  --  SACK . Sackett My dear Benedict , please do n't say " if I love the girl . " My love is as fixed as the fixed stars themselves : please do n't say , " If I love the girl . " BEN . Benedict Well , you love the girl  --  the girl loves you  --  you feel no misgivings about the final result . I can not see where the difficulty lies ; you said you were in a quandary ! SACK . Sackett Y-e-s , so I am . The fact is , Jack , I 'm engaged to another girl also . ( BENEDICT starts ) . I know it is n't quite regular , Jack ; but it 's true . BEN . Benedict ( after a pause ) . M  --  , m  --  , that is awkward . However , if you have been imprudent , my dear Bob , the manly , regular course is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other girl , at once , that you do not love her  --  and  --  SACK . Sackett Not love her , my dear Jack ! I love Effie devotedly  --  her name is Effie . I adore the very earth she steps upon . Not love my Effie ! Ah ! Benedict , Benedict , it is evident you have never loved as I love . BEN . Benedict No ! egad I have n't ; one woman at a time was enough for me . SACK . Sackett We 're engaged to be married . Her father is an elderly brute ; being a father , of course he could n't be anything but a brute . He 's a gruff old coon , a rich old widower , he has never permitted my acquaintance , nor tolerated my advances . He is more jealous of his daughter than of his gold .

One night I had been sitting alone with the widow in the conservatory ; my arm was about her waist , you know , and all that sort of thing . What the deuce I had been saying to her I never could recollect . But the widow suddenly informed me that she accepted my proposal , and was mine for ever . BEN . Benedict She was yours for ever ?

She is a tender , delicate , delicious little creature . But the widow was an accident  --  a magnificent woman  --  all that a man could wish  --  and more too ;  --  but an accident . Jack , purely an accident . BEN . Benedict And what do you propose to do about it , Bob ? SACK . Sackett Do ? Why , nothing for the present .

As it came nearer , I discovered a fair young creature . BEN . Benedict ( starting ) . Another woman ! SACK . Sackett Another woman ! no , sir  --  an angel ! I sprang into the middle of the road ; the horse stopped suddenly before me , and the fair young creature fell over the dashboard into my arms . On the impulse of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is all I have to remember her by ; a beastly young brother came up in a moment . She thanked me in the politest possible language , and that is the last I 've seen of her . I 've not had a moment 's peace since that night . Such an exquisite throat ; and a wealth of golden hair fell back upon her shoulders ! Unknown enchantress of my life  --  my fair incognita !  --  I  --  BEN . Benedict But what has all this to do with your visit to Saratoga ? SACK . Sackett ( R. ) . I hurried to the Mansfield House next morning . She had been there , but had left two hours before . The party , so far as I could learn , consisted of an elderly gentleman  --  her father , of course  --  the angel herself , and her brother . I traced them to Lake George ; from there they had started for Saratoga ; and here I am in search of the golden fleece  --  BEN . Benedict ( L. ) . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private parlour  --  No. 73 . SACK . Sackett My dear Benedict , I could n't think of it . I dare not remain in Saratoga five minutes . I do n't propose to run into any more danger than is necessary . I intend to engage rooms at the Driftwood House , near the banks of the lake . And now my favour from you , Jack . I want you to stare at every woman in Saratoga ; look every old gentleman out of countenance  --  until you find my fair unknown . Remember . Jack , she has a profusion of golden tresses , an oval face , medium height , an elderly father , and a young brother . Search every hotel in Saratoga , hire the fastest horses you can get , and report to me , at least three times a day , at the Driftwood House . If you find her , Jack , I 'll leave the rest to chance and Providence . I 'll follow her to the ends of the earth . By-the-way . Jack , how do you get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now and then , you old icicle  --  eh ? BEN . Benedict ( L. ) . Ahem ! Well , I say , Bob , you 'll promise not to laugh at me ? SACK . Sackett Oh ! eh ! Not  --  ha ! ha ! ha !  --  then there is  --  ha ! ha ! Oh , certainly ! I 'll promise not to laugh  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! ( checks himself ) . BEN . Benedict ( L. ) .

By-the-way , Jack , what is the widow 's name ?  --  ha ! ha ! ha ! BEN . Benedict Her name  --  Mrs. Olivia Alston ! ( SACK . stops laughing , draws a long face , and staggers ) . Eh ! what 's the matter , Bob ? SACK . Sackett Nothing ; only a little stitch in the side . ( Aside ) It 's my widow ! BEN . Benedict ( looking R. ) . There she is now , Bob , coming this way , with a gentleman . She 'll be here in two minutes . I 'll introduce you . SACK . Sackett No , thank you , Jack . I have a very particular engagement elsewhere at this particular moment . I wish you joy , old boy : and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then on my account  --  ha ! ha ! ha !  --  and you 'll not forget the Driftwood House , Benedict ? BEN . Benedict Certainly not .
