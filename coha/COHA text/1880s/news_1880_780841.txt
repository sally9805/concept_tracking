Gentlemen interested in the proposed company are in the city , and will be heard to-morrow by the House Committee on Commerce . They have secured important concessions from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American and Central American States , among which is the exclusive right to build and operate a telegraph line which will furnish the much-needed direct communication between the United States and South America , and render it unnecessary hereafter to pay the heavy cost of communication by way of Portugal . These gentlemen ask nothing from the United States except a charter . The action of the Senate Committee on Territories , in favor of the Vest bill , which provides for the establishment of courts in the Indian Territory , and which is regarded as a long step in the direction of opening the Territory , to settlement , is in accordance with Mr. Vest 's emphatically expressed .. views on this subject , and induced Senator Carpenter to introduce in the Senate to-day , a resolution instructing the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire whether Congress has any right to make the Indian Territory a separate Judicial district and organize a court or courts therein , and if so what jurisdiction ought to be conferred upon said courts . The committee is asked to report by bill or otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose constituents seem to be in favor of forcibly opening the Territory , insisted that the resolution should go to the committee of  --  which he is Chairman , and which has virtually answered the inquiry already by its support of the Vest bill . But Mr. Carpenter contended that the Judiciary Committee should have it , whereupon Mr. Garland 's objection to the present consideration of the resolution carried it over in accordance with the rules . William McGarrahan has renewed his contest of over 20 yeaas standing with the NewIdria Mining Company , for the possession of the Panoche Grandktract , now occupied by that company , and has had introduced into the House a bill to refer the whole controversy to the Court of Claims , with the right to appeal to the United States courts , the several claimants to brine suit against the United States . The bill is pending before the Committee on Privete Land Claims , and to-day Col. Michael L. Woods appeared before the committee on behalf of McGarrahan . Col. Woods argued that the testimony showed that the NewIdria Company had originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim to 1,920 acres , located under California school land warrants ; then it claimed . 480 acres under the Mining laws , which claimwas rejected in 1870 , after which a motion for a rehearing was made , which was finally denied by Secretary Schurz on the 26th of last July ; then William Neely Thompson located 20 acres under the Mining laws , for which Secretary Schurz granted a patent a few weeks ago , notwithstanding his knowledge of the pendency of the bill before Congress . Col. Woods also argued that the New Idria Company , in securing a patent , has not won a substantialvictory , as the 20 acres are - of little value without a portion of the akjoining timber lands . The property being reserved . to the grantee until a final rejection of his grant , by the act of Congress in 1851 , in pursuance of the terms of the treaty , is not subject to entry by any one . Consequently , the New Idea Company has been a trespasser from the beginning . Its application to enter as public lands the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rejected by Secretary Schurz , it was claimed that the company is liable , either to McGarrahan or the Government , for the immense treasure which it has taken from these mines , said to cover over $12,000,000 .

The House Committee of Ways and Means gave a hearing to-day to the manufacturers of quinine , who desire the duty on the imported article technically known as " sulphate of quinia , " whicwas removed by act of Congress during the sloecial session , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Rosenbartete of Philadelphia , and C. T. White and D. C. Robbins , of New-York , manufacturers of sulphate and other salts of quinia , made arguments before the committee in support of their memorial . The points made were that the law removing the duty was hurriedly passed through Congress , without giving them any opportunity to be heard ; that it went into immediate effect , affording them no opportunity to Prepare for the change , and that while the duty upon imported . quinine has been removed , the articles from which it is manufactured are still taxed  --  fusel-oil paying a duty of $2 per gallon ; alcohol , $1 70 per gallon ; soda ash , 14 cent per pound ; and cinchona bark , 10 per cent . ad. valorem . To offset these duties and taxes , they argued that a duty be imposed upon foreign sulphate of quinia , to enable them to compete with foreigners , whose Governments have guarded their interests most carefully , and who have , in consequence , great advantages over the American manufacturers . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 48 cities in various parts of the country , favoring an import duty on foreign quinine of at least 10 per cent . ad valorem . The memorial sets forth that the continued manufacture of sulphate of quinia in this country is a matter of great consequence to the people at large ; that the American article is uniformly of excellent quality and superior to the imported , and should , as a matter of policy , be protected . A large number of letters from physicians and druggists were also offered as cumulative testimony to the statements set forth in the memorial . A hearing was given by the Ways and Means Committee this morning , upon a memorial signed by 200 or more merchants and . manufacturers , praying that the prohibitory duties now levied upon chrome iron ore and bi-chromate of potash may be removed , " in order that the large industrial pursuits of our country may be encouraged and enabled better to compete with England and Germany for the trade offered . by Brazil , South and Central America , Cuba , &c.,; and to cheapen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all wearing apparel and many articles of household apparel . " The memorialists urge that chrome iron ore is entirely crude , and bi-chromate of potash is used as a material in dyeing cotton and wool by nearly all the manufacturers of the country , and as the basis for all chemical colors essentially the same as indigo , logwood , and other dyestuffs which are now exempt from duty .
