AND ARTICLE 1. - SOME ADMINISTRATIVE DIFFICULTIES OF THE INDIAN PROBLEM . WHEN the Secretary of the Interior can say , as Secretary Lamar said in his Annual Report for last year , that less than one hundred Indians out of the two hundred and fifty thousand in his charge had been in arms against the authority of the Government during the year , and that they were confined under military guard in Florida , that long period of our history during which the Indian has stood defiantly athwart the progress of our civilization may well be considered as ended . But the submission of the Indians has not solved the " Indian Question . " On the contrary , it has made the call for renewed effort all the more urgent . It is much easier to drive a tramp from your path with a club , than to persuade him to learn a trade and become respectable and self-respecting . The nation must now take up in good faith and an unwearying patience , the task of raising the Indians to the comfort and dignity of selfsupport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who // have been reduced from independence to beggary by our national growth . We owe it to ourselves and to our children to remove from our national life all the plague spots and elements of weakness which these tribes of paupers left to themselves will surely prove to the communities which they may infest . The task will tax to the utmost the philanthropy and the Christianity of the Nation . This paper proposes to deal with some of the difficulties which surround it . 1 . The first great difficulty is found in the nature of the work itself . It is missionary work of the most perplexing kind . It is no easy matter to raise the ignorant and degraded that infest the slums of our own city . But they can not fail to absorb something of good from the general cessation of business throughout the community on Sunday , even if they have no lot nor part in the special observance of the day . The most neglected reprobate in New Haven must know some one whose character and standing has impressed him as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his imitation . The missionary in the foreign field , who finds a people sunk no deeper in ignorance and superstition* than the *ndians , is not obliged * The following extract from the report of Agent Osborne regarding the Poncas , ( Indian Ri*port , 1886 , p. 136 ) , describes the depths of this superstition . The Poicas have been considered rather above the average in progress and education , though they lost ground by their removal from Dakota to the Indian Territory in 1876 . " The general condition and habits of these Indians are not at this time enviable ; . . . . I pledge you my most sacred word and honor that at this time all of them are lazy ; that four-fifths of them are filthy ; that they do not eat in family circles nor upon neatly spread tables , nor upon tables at all ; that there are not exceeding a dozen of them who can shelter a horse , and no song save that of the dance is ever heard amongst them They have from one to three wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they choke ponies to death at the graves of their dead , and for weeks afterwards carry provision to the dead Indian and leave them at the grave . When the death of a favorite child occurs , the father , or the mother , if the father is dead , will give away all possessions , even leaving the family utterly destitute of food and raiment These old men and women amongst them , with whom the chase of the buffalo and the war dance and song form pleasing memories , who regard the plow with scorn and the horse as only an instrument of sport , must be dead and utterly forgotten before a pride in civilized pursuits sufficient to redeem them from the love of savagery can be inculcated. " // to see all his teachings spat upon by those of his own race whom his people chance to see , but is helped by the character and full sympathy of his visitors . Not so with the worker , official or otherwise , in the Indian service . He preaches the dignity of labor and the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but the samples of civilization seen by his Indians are too often renegade whites who have fled to the frontier to escape the sheriff , or in the hope of living without work . The Indians are fortunate if these white exemplars of all the virtues have not stolen their ponies or their timber or their land or their daughters . The average Indian is not deficient in logic nor in keenness , * and he needs no one to point out for him the wide discrepancy between the theory of the missionary and the agent and the practice of the frontiersman . All this is on the theory that the officials are honest and devoted  --  a theory to which exceptions have been by far too frequent . More than this  --  the tribes differ among themselves no less widely than do the immigrants who inundate our shores . The treacherous Apache needs a very different treatment from his peaceable neighbor , the Pima . The sullen Utes are not to be classed with the Navajoes who occupy reservations of similar character . A ' Sioux is one sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort . But the Indian office is required to deal with all kinds under the same rigid and inflexible law and under the constant watch of a Congress composed largely of partisans organized into opposing political camps and ever on the alert for political advantage . Moreover , these be now the piping days of peace with no customs and traces of the war surviving * Illustrations of the Indian shrewdness are not wanting in the experience of all who have been brought into personal contact with them . It is but a few years since a young Kiowa brave , who had promised some of the Friends , then beginning their excellent work with that tribe , that he would abstain from raiding settlers in the " States , " naively excused his next raid into Texas by saying that " Texas did n't belong to the United States anyhow and if Washington ( i. e. the President or Great Father ' ) did n't want him to raid into Texas , he had better move Texas farther away . " This judgment on Texas does not differ much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the army . It is proper to add that a few lessons from Gen. Mackenzie gave this tribe not long after new ideas as to the polftical and geographical relations of Texas to the Union . // save our war taxes and our pension roll , and it is n't permitted to the Indian service to clear up its accounts , or meet its emergencies by that panacea for all blunders in quarter-masters ' accounts- " lost in action . " The condition and surroundings of the Indians differ as widely as do the Indians themselves , and the evils to which they are especially exposed are no less various . In Arizona and California the whites steal their water ; in Dakota and Montana , their mines ; in Minnesota and Michigan their timber ; at all times and in all places their lands and their cattle and ponies. * The Indian ofilce is compelled to contest every point with some schemer who plans to better himself in some way at the expense of the Indian and who being a free and independent American citizen often seeks the services of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who spent considerable time some years since in investigating the causes of the Apache outbreaks of 1875 in Arizona always stoutly maintained that one campaign was caused solely by some whites near a reservation who had a surplus of grain and could find no way to sell it except by getting some troops into their neighborhood to furnish a market . 2 . Another great difficulty is found in the clumsiness of the Government as an executive agency for any purpose whatever - much less for a purpose which demands such delicacy of handling as this . This clumsiness is a by-word everywhere . Any one who needs illustrations of it can find them in the nearest Government work . 3 . The executive capacity of the Government is feeble enough here at home , where critics abound . Its efficiency is decreased in much the same ratio as the force of attractionthat is , in the square of the distance from headquarters . As it is essential to the success of any plan for Indian improvement that the Indians should be for a time secluded from white intrusion * It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western part of the Indian Territory , whose own raids were far from infrequent , have not lost more at the hands of renegade whites than they have themselves taken from the adjoining States . At one time , there was an organized gang of horse-thieves who made regular trips between Kansas and Texas , selling in Kansas the horses taken on the northerly trip and in Texas those taken on the return . // this very seclusion but adds to the inefficiency of the agencies at command . If the Government can not put up a building or grade a street in one of our cities with economy and good judgment in spite of the steady criticism of all who are interested , how can it be expected to handle with success the still more difficult task of reforming a whole people and doing it in a coyner ? The Indian Agent to have any influence with his Indians must be the supreme ruler on their Reservation . This almost of necessity arms him with full power to hide his own short-comings or misdeeds , as any employc who turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present Commissioner , who seems a capable and conscientious officer , has undertaken to introduce the oriental system of having a dual executive whose two halves shall watch each other , by appointing direct from Washington the clerks and some other subordinates at all the agencies and thus making them independent of the agent . This plan has once been tried and has failed , and unless rumor misrepresents its working its fresh trial will end in fresh failure . Certainly no plan could more effectively double the perplexities and scatter the resources of an agent . A thorough watch on all the Indian Agencies is essential , but it should not be intrusted to those who might possibly profit by a change of agent . No agent who has not the full confidence of his superiors can have the confidence of his Indians . Nor should any agent who can not be trusted to choose his own assistants under the general direction of his superiors , be trusted with any other duty in the service . 4 . Scarcely less is the difficulty that comes from the peculiarly homogeneous character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ differ from each other in other things they are all alike in this . Very seldom can an Indian be found brave enough to defy the public sentiment of his tribe . Our streets abound with whites thus defying public sentiment , but in this the Indian very strongly resembles that blatant excrescence in the industrial world known as " Organized labor . " No hungry seeker for work in our shops ever cowered under the epithet of " scab " as does the young bnck when he first undertakes to hold the plow or the plane , and thus assumes in public estimation the duties and the place of the squaw. // 5 . When an agent has succeeded in persuading some of his Indians to take the first feeble and hesitating steps in the " white man 's road , " he is at once confronted by the difficulty in finding them work . The Indian on his reservation is pretty closely shut in either to farming or cattle raising . Perhaps he can do neither of these to advantage , and , if so , so much the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost invariably proved disastrous , and the Indians must work out their own salvation in substantially their present locations . Jay Gould is reported to have compared that division of the M. K. &amp; T. R. R. which lies in the Indian Territory to a tunnel 200 miles long , so far as any local business is concerned ; and there are many Indian Agencies so located as to furnish opportunities for work but little better than some of the prisons in the State of New York whose inmates in obedience to the dictates of the " horny-jawed sons of toil " are kept in idleness  --  to which idleness after only a few months trial the New York Prison Commissioner attributes a decided lowering of the health and moral tone of the convicts . The five foregoing difficulties of the problem are inherent . There are some others which might and should be remedied . 6 . The many-headed and clumsy management of the service . Some things can be done by the President alone ; a very few others by the Commissioner of Indian Affairs ; while the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committed by law to the Secretary of the Tnterior . No agent in the remotest part of the field can buy so much as a bale of hay for his mules or a bag of potatoes for his Indian school without making formal application to the Commissioner of Indian Affairs for it . The Commissioner himself can do no more than to forward the request to the Secretary for his action . If all goes smoothly , the Secretary in due time " has the honor to inform " the Commissioner that his application has been granted , and the Commissioner in turn notifies the Agent . If the Indian service were a simple one in which all the elements were fixed in routine , and one could readily foresee the needs of his Agency for a month or so ahead , this might perhaps be endured . But he would be a remarkably smart man who could lay in suitable store in advance of the 1,001 things which are // 1887.1 Difficulties of the Indian Problem . needed about an agency , whose complex operations combine the keeping of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some educational work , some hospital service , and , at a well-conducted agency , some missionary work as well. * But let us suppose that our Agent , having got the authority of his superiors for the expenditure , and feeling protected thereby , proceeds to buy what he needs and paying for it from public moneys in his hands in due time renders his account , furnishing in duplicate or triplicate the receipt of the seller . He is * Some idea of the difficulties of one branch of the agency work may be gathered from the following extract from the report of G. W. Scott , superintendent of the Fort Stevenson Industrial School in Dakota for 1886 , which is found on p. 4 of the Indian Office Report for last year . . . . The office of superintendent has been a coveted position . Upon my arrival I found that special preparations had been made to receive me . A small , dingy room , with fire-place in one end , calico curtains , a dry-goods box for a wash-stand , an outfit of tin utensils @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spring wagon , an older team , were at my disposal for conveyance . No office had ever been established here . The work had been done at Fort Berthold . An invoice book , invoices , record of pupils , were turned over to me . A quantity of material for official correspondence was furnished by the agent . The steamboat line had kindly withheld the delivery of the year 's supplies , and unloaded about 10,000 pounds of freight as soon as the receipts for property had been signed . This was weighed , booked , and shelved away . The teachers concluded to leave , thus closing up the class-room work for two months . During the winter I acted as teacher , clerk , industrial teacher , and once in a while was superintendent . No clerk was sent to my aid during the year . I persevered as a " hewer of wood and drawer of water , " believing that " whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth . " Employes took sick , children ran away , the inspector cultivated my acquaintance . A journey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost in a blizzard , and on my return trip froze both ears and feet . The time for putting up ice came . The industrial teacher sickened and resigned . The superintendent had to " buckle on his armor " and go forth , only to be unlucky enough to fall in the river . The enjoyment of the emoluments of office became as " sounding brass and a tinkling cymbal . " A large force of boys was kept busy severa1 days and succeeded in storing away enough for the summer 's use . The annual estimates had to be completed by the 10th of January . A long list of abstracts and vouchers was made up , and labeled quarterly accounts . A board of survey was convened and unserviceable property disposed of . The thermometer dropped down to 50 degrees below zero , and I had to drive ten miles to a notary to swear that I was honest . My official bond was n* guarantee to either ability or honesty . Hence , sing me the praises of the office of superintendent // April , D'ificultie8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his account will be approved by the Accounting Officers of the Treasury , who claim to have final and supreme authority over all expenditures and at times appear to question not only the legality of the expenditure but also its wisdom . They thus practically assume all the peculiarly administrative powers of the Indian *office and add an element of no small uncertainty to a service none too certain before . The result of this not infrequent clash of authority between the administrative and the accounting officers is that the Agent or his bondsmen suffer . The Agent , being advised of the disallowance at the Treasury of items in his accounts which had been fully authorized by his superiors , very naturally ignores the demand of the Accounting Officers that he deposit money to make his accounts good . The balance remains open against him on the Treasury books until some new Chief of Division determines to end the delay , and instead of crediting the Agent with the sums honestly expended turns the papers over to the U. S. District Attorney through whom the bondsmen are in due time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to predict that no jury in such a case would ignore the authorization of the Secretary of the Interior to the same extent as the Accounting Officers did , or would fail to decide against the Government when it could maintain its case only by repudiating the acts of its own high officials ; and in any service but that of the Government all such claims would be at once abandoned . * * Within the last ten years , a business man in the West came near financial ruin because the Government brought suit against him as the only survivor of the bondsmen for a man who was appointed by the Secretary of the Interior 25 years before to distribute among a certain Indian tribe about $25,000 , which had accrued to them under some treaty provision . There was no charge of fraud in the payment or of any irregularity in the disbursing officer 's accounts ; but the Treasury Department had suspended the entire amount in the accounts , because it seemed to the Accounting Officers that the Secretary of the Interior had no legal warrant for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the help of his " member " to satisfy the Treasury that the suit was as hopeless as it was unjust and it was withdrawn before his credit was ruined . If the public prints are to be believed , an Agent recently removed has been charged with the value of 252,122 potinds of corn , not because he did n't deliver that quantity to his successor , but because , forsooth , his successor in weighing the corn found 80 pounds more than the retiring // Of course the probability , or even the possibility of such a performance is a very serious drag on the service . The Agent dislikes to take any such risks , nor does the office wish to have him . Instead , therefore of having all the elasticity which such a service needs , every law and every ruling tends to hamper its freedom of movement . 7 . Another very fruitful source of trouble in the service is the utter worthlessness of the interpreters . This has in nearly every case been at the root of our Indian outbreaks . The interpreter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married some Indian woman as the easiest way to get a living . By such marriage he is able to secure his full share of the rations and other assistance which the Government renders , and as he is often a person with no mean capacity for intrigue he becomes a factor of no small importance and troublesomeness . He generally lacks the education which is essential to a good interpreter and fails ever to give the nicer shades of meaning . It is never certain that he will not distort his message to suit his personal ends or those of his faction . Through his inefficiency or his treachery the Indians often find , as all ignorant persons do , that they have assented to things which were the farthest from their thought , and so they naturally fight against such an interpretation of their agreement as seems to them nothing other than a swindle. * Agent reported . In any line of business outside the government service a correspondence in two independent weights as close as this would have been looked upon as proving their absolute accuracy . * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treaty provisions is found in the Osage Treaty of 1865 . By this negotiation , the Osages agreed to place their old reservation in Kansas in the hands of the U. S. General Land Office for sale , and to buy a new reservation for themselves from the Cherokees in the Indian Territory . It was nominated in the bond , also , that the Indian Office could use some share of their funds , after paying them some annuities , for the civilization of other tribes of Indians , but the Osages have always stoutly maintained that they never understood this provision . It is not probable that they did , as the display of generosity is , if intentional , far beyond the average of civilization . This fund is very serviceable to the Indian Office , as the Osages now have more than six millions of dollars to their credit on the books of the Treasury . The annual income of each member of the tribe is nearly $2,000 , and the future disposition of this money in a way to benefit the tribe is no easy task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay its interpreters as much as the army pays its interpreters , and the service in the two branches has compared closely to the sums paid . Some Agents have mastered the sign language , * which is the common heritage of the American Indians , and thus talk freely and directly with their Indians , but the bulk of the officials are at the mercy of the interpreters . 8 . These defects in the organization of the service are largely due to the inability of the Indian Office to secure proper attention of Congress to its needs . However hardly the Indian may fare in the struggle for life outside of Congress , he fares even worse in that body . The reports of the Commissioner will show the same defects reported year after year to Congress . That body never seems to get nearer to a consideration of the Indian question than to grant some railroad the right of way through an Indian reservation , or to provide for the payment from the tribal funds of some claim for supplies furnished to the Indians , or depredations committed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is the action of Congress at its last session in passing the bill for the allotment of land in severalty.t This is a great step forward . The Henry George theory of abolishing all private property in land has been tried on the two hundred reservations for the last one hundred years , and has failed utterlyhas failed as completely in diffusing civilization and equality of progress and of comfort among the so-called " civilized tribes " of the Indian territory as among the Sioux . No one has given any reason for denying to the Indian the same right * Some Cheyenne Chiefs during a trip to " the States " in 1872 , visited in Philadelphia a school for the deaf and dumb . On their return home , they reported as the most wonderful thing they had seen , that they found a school " where their own language was taught . " The similarity between the signs used by the Indians and those of the highly cultured mutes is very striking . * This measure will be of benefit only if judiciously administered . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the members of certain tribes , and distributing their tribal lands and funds has as a rule proved disastrous . The Pottawatomies , having wasted their individual shares , were , in a few years glad , although citizens of the U. S. , to find a refuge in the Indian Territory , where they now are . // to become a citizen that has been freely granted to all of our immigrants . No one has expected that the Indian would progress farther in self-reliance and self-support than a white man would who lacked all incentive to individual effort . And yet with no active opposition , but with all the argument which the Indian Office and the best public sentiment of the country could furnish , it has taken years of effort to get this measure through Congress. * * Other measures of great importance are still pending . Among these are : 1 . A measure to remedy the defects of the law of 1883 , by which all funds arising from pasturage or sales of timber , coal , or other product of an Indian reservation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are covered into the Treasury , but can not be expended for the use of the Indians to whom they belong without further Congressional action . Before the legislation of that year , all such moneys were received and disbursed by the Agent under direction of the Commissioner . Under that law , they must be deposited in the Treasury , and once there , must remain idle until Congress acts . The amounts involved are not large , but the damage done by their retention is not easily calculated . 2 . A thorough revision of the Intercourse Act , passed in 1834 and in substantially the same form now as then , when the country west of the Mississippi was an unbroken wilderness , which was to be set apart as the home of the Indian so long ( to quote the language of the treaties ) " as grass grows and water runs . " Surely the marvelous growLh of population in the last fifty years demands some modification of this statute . 3 . Some legislation upon the subject of crimes committed by one Indian against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some such provision it is too much to expect that the Indian will abandon his old law of retaliation and subject himself to the " reign of law , " especially of a law that has yet to be enacted . The authority of the chiefs and counselors of the tribes has vanished . The young " bucks " are beginning to realize this , as well as the further fact that no law has yet been put in its place . How soon the sense of their freedom will overcome the force of habit and break all bounds , no man can say . The Indian Office has invented a temporary make-shift in the shape of " Courts of Indian Offences " but these lack due legal sanction , and may at any moment fall to the ground . 4 . Some provision under which the Indian Office may suspend the operation of the law requiring that rations should be distributed weekly , in cases where the law works hardship to the Indian , as it does in most cases where the Indian has started to farm . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to hold them in check and near the agency . It should not be permitted to operate on the Indians who have located at points distant from the agency in order // With the help of this law , and the general improvement of the methods of the service , we may confidently expect that the next five years will show more genuine improvement than any twenty years that have preceded them . The Government has done many things it ought not to have done and left undone as many things it ought to have done . And yet , in view of the manifold obstacles that have been encountered at every point , and the constant opposition from foes without and foes within , there is cause for satisfaction that so much has been done . A start has , however , been made and nothing will now be so helpful as the steady pressure on Congress of an enlightened public opinion which shall insist that the Indian Question be not crowded off the stage at every session of Congress , but that it receive some share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand . Here the Indian Rights Associations find their field and their justification . No one has ever questioned their entire disinterestedness and sincerity . If their membership will only look on these Associations as a means of increasing their individual efficiency , and not as a means of relieving them from responsibility , their power for good will be indefinitely increased . Without the service which they have rendered in their special field , the advance of the last ten years would not have been made. * to help themselves , and who are in many cases obliged to spend two or three days of every week in trips from their homes to the agency for the week 's supplies . To such Indians less frequent issues might be safely and profitably made . 5 . Further and more generous provision for the education of the Indian youth . Last year 's expenditure for this purpose reached nearly a million dollars . This seems liberal , but there are as yet accommodations for less than half of the children , and an expenditure of sixty-five dollars per year per scholar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that to two-thirds of the children who are taught in boarding and industrial schools , food and clothing must be furnished as well as tuition . A wise economy will get all the children in school at once and keep them there , thus in time solving the problem in the quickest and easiest way . * The Indian Rights Association should not be confounded with the Indian Defense Association , which seems to have for its main purpose the maintenance of the present oligarchical rule over the so-called civilized tribes in the Indian Territory , and which is reported as oppos // At just this point , also , the wisdom of President Grant 's much ridiculed plan of establishing the advisory Board of Indian Commissioners and appointing Indian Agents only on the recommendation of the principal religious denominations of the country is most clearly seen This plan recognized as the special need of the Indian service , that the dry work of administrative routine should be quickened by an infusion of the missionary spirit ; and , applying thee highest principles of Civil Service Reform , committed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the work of choosing fit men . An Agent endorsed by his denomination , and appointed by the Government , became the authorized representative of both and could bring home to both the especial needs of his Indians . The hold of the service on the public was thns greatly strengthened . It is unfortunately true that not all of these denominations rose in their selections to the full measure of their duty and their opportunity . They often yielded to the claims on their sympathy of those who needed employment , so that their candidates were not always energetic and efficient . But their appointees were a great improvement over the average of their predecessors , while a man of ordinary capacity thus stimulated and strengthened by his denomination , became often an excellent officer . Furthermore , no denomination ever opposed the removal of an appointee whose inefficiency was shown . To have thus freed the service from political influence both in the appointment and in the removal of employees was a great gain . The record no less under Republican than under Democratic administrations shows that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he abandoned this plan for the old one which gave him an unrestricted choice in the selection of agents . The personnel of the service did not improve under his personal selections ; nor has it since improved . More than two-thirds of the agents have been changed within the last two years ; but such a proportion of changes ing the recently enacted Severalty bill for fear that it may some time be put in operation among those tribes . In this the rulers of the civilized tribes make common cause with the chiefs of the wilder tribes . The exclusive privileges of both will suffer alike by any measure that tends to emancipate the body of the tribe . // in a service where experience so largely increases the value of an efficient man and where change for its own sake should be deprecated , tends to show quite as clearly the defects of the system under past administrations as under the present . No one thing would do so much for the service as a return to President Grant 's plan and the hearty cooperation of the religions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the religious bodies themselves would again assume the responsibilities of the work ; but if they should , and would bring once more to the help of the Government the sagacity and devotion which characterized ten years ago the Orthodox Friends under the lead of Drs . Rhoads and Nicholson , or the Episcopal Church under the lead of Bishops Whipple and Hare , or the Congregational Church under the lead of Dr. Strieby and the American Missionary Association , the Indian and the administration would alike be fit subjects for congratulation . The service would gain in the points where it is the weakest , while the religious and philanthropic sentiment of the country now fully awake to the claims of the Indian would find and gladly seize the abundant opportunity to satisfy its conscience thus given and would generously help him in his weakness and his need .
