Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : ROSEMARY . from The poetical works 1888 " There ' s Rosemary , that ' s for Remembrance . " Years ago , when a summer sun Warmed the greenwood into life , I went wandering with one Soon to be my wife . Birds were mating , and Love began All the copses to infold ; Our two souls together ran Melting in one mould . Skies were bluer than ever before : It was joy to love you then , And to know I loved you more Than could other men ! Winds were fresh and your heart was brave , Sang to mine a sweet refrain , And for every pledge I gave Pledged me back again . How it happened I can not tell , But there came a cursed hour , When some hidden shape of hell Crept within our bower . Sudden and sharply either spoke Bitter words of doubt and scorn ; Pride the golden linklets broke ,  --  Left us both forlorn . Seven long years have gone since then , And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fellow-men , Crushing down the past . Far away over distant hills , Now I know your life is led ; Have you felt the rust that kills ? Are your lilies dead ? Summer and winter you have dwelt , Like a statue , cold and white ; None , of all the crowd who knelt , Read your soul aright . O , I knew the tremulous swell Of its secret undertone ! That diviner music fell On my ear alone ! Ever in dreams we meet with tears : Lake and mountain  --  all are past : With the stifled love of seven long years Hold each other fast ! Though the glamoury of the night Fades with morning far away , Oftentimes a strange delight Haunts the after-day . Even now , when the summer sun Warms the greenwood far within , Even now my fancies run On what might have been . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : TOO LATE . from The poetical works 1888 Crouch no more by the ivied walls , Weep no longer over her grave , Strew no flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Sunbeams cover that silent mound With a warmer hue than your roses ' red ; To-morrow 's rain will bedew the ground With a purer stream than the tears you shed . But neither the sweets of the scattered flowers , Nor the morning sunlight 's soft command , Nor all the songs of the summer showers , Can charm her back from that distant land . Tenderest vows are ever too late ! She , who has gone , can only know The cruel sorrow that was her fate , And the words that were a mortal woe . Earth to earth , and a vain despair ; For the gentle spirit has flown away , And you can never her wrongs repair , Till ye meet again at the Judgment Day . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : FLOOD-TIDE. from The poetical works 1888 Just at sunrise , when the land-breeze cooled the fevered air once more , From a restless couch I wandered to the sounding ocean shore ; Strolling down through furrowed sand-hills , while the splendor of the day Flashed across the trembling waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in distant moorings , many an anchored vessel tall ; Heard with cheery morning voices sailor unto sailor call . Crowned with trailing plumes of sable , right afront my standing-place Moved a swarthy ocean-steamer in her storm-resisting grace . Prophet-like , she clove the waters toward the ancient mother-land , And I heard her clamorous engine and the echo of command , While the long Atlantic billows to my feet came rolling on , With the multitudinous music of a thousand ages gone . There I stood , with careless ankles half in sand and half in spray , Till the baleful mist of midnight from my being passed away ; Then , with eager inhalations opening all my mantle wide , Felt my spirit rise exultant with the rising of the tide ; Felt the joyous morning breezes run afresh through every vein , Till the natural pulse of manhood beat the call-to-arms again . Then came utterance self-condemning ,  --  oh , how wild with sudden scorn Of the chain that held me circling in a little round forlorn ! Of the sloth which , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can act in meek submission to the lowness of its part ,  --  In the broad terrestrial drama play the herald or the clown , While the warrior wins his garlands and the monarch wears his crown ! " Shame " I said , " upon the craven who can rest , content to save Paltry handfuls of the riches that his guardian-angel gave ! Shame upon all listless dreamers early hiding from the strife , Sated with some little gleaning of the harvest-fields of life ! Shame upon God 's toiling thinkers , who make profit of their brains , Getting store of scornful pittance for their slow-decaying pains ! Give me purpose , steadfast purpose , and the grandeur of a soul Born to lead the van of armies or a people to control . Let me float away and ever , from this shore of bog and mire , On the mounting waves of effort , buoyed by the soul 's desire ! Would that it were mine to govern yon large wonder of our time : Such a life were worth the living ! thus to sail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treasures manifold ; Foremost to achieve discovery of the peerless lands of gold ; Or to thrid the crashing hummocks for the silent Northern Pole , And those solemn open waters that beyond the iceplains roll ,  --  Cold and shining sea of ages ! like a silver fillet set On the Earth 's eternal forehead , for her bridal coronet . Or to close with some tall frigate , for my country and the right , Gunwale grinding into gunwale through the rolling cloud of fight . When the din of cannonading and the jarring war should cease , From the lion 's mouth of battle there should flow the sweets of peace . I should count repose in cities from my seventy years a loss ,  --  Resting only on the waters , like the dusk-winged albatross . I should lay the wire-wrought cable  --  a ghostly depth below  --  Along the marly summit of the plummet-found plateau ; To the old Antipodes with the olive branch should roam , Joining swart Mongolian races to the ranks of Christendom . Oftentimes our stately presence in a tyrant 's port @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dungeon and the grave ; And a hymn should greet our coming , far across the orient sea , Like the glad apostles ' anthem , when an angel set them free . Such the nobler life heroic ! life which ancient Homer sung Of the sinewy Grecian worthies , when the blithesome Earth was young , And a hundred marvellous legends lay about the misty land Where the wanton Sirens carolled and the cliffs of Scylla stand . How their lusty strokes made answer , when Ulysses held the helm , And with subtle words of wisdom spake of many a wondrous realm ! Neither Circ , nor the languor of enchanted nights and days Soothed their eager-eyed disquiet ,  --  tamed their venturous , epic ways ; And the dread Sicilian monster , in his cavern by the shore , Felt the shadow of their coming , and was blind for evermore . So lived all those stalwart captains of the loyal Saxon blood , Grasping morsels of adventure as an eagle grasps his food ; Fought till death for queen and country , hating Anti-christ and Spain ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Hacked and hewed the molten idols of each gray cathedral pile , And with Carthaginian silver dowered the virgin English isle . Up and down the proud Antilles still the ringing echoes go : Ho ! a Raleigh ! Ho ! a Drake !  --  and , forever , Westward Ho ! Why should not my later pan catch the swell of that refrain , And , with bursts of fresh endeavor , send it down the age again ? But I know , that , while the mariner wafts along the golden year , Broader continents of action open up in every sphere . And I deem those noble also , who , with strong persuasive art , Strike the chords of aspiration in a people 's lyric heart . If in mine  --  of all republics the Atlantis and supreme  --  There be little cause for mouthing on the old , undying theme  --  Yet I falter while I say it :  --  ours of every crime the worst ! For the long revenge of Heaven crying loud and calling first : But if fiery Carolina and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laugh to scorn the warning mouth ,  --  In the lap of hoary Europe lie her children ill at rest , Reaching hands of supplication to their brethren of the West ; Pale about the lifeless fountain of their ancient freedom , wait Till the angel move its waters and avenge their stricken state . Let me then , a new crusader , to the eastward set my face , Wake the fires of old tradition on each sacred altar-place , Till a trodden people rouse them , with a clamor as divine As the winds of autumn roaring through the clumps of forest-pine . I myself would seize their banner ; they should follow where it led , To the triumph of the victors or the pallor of the dead . It were better than to conquer  --  from the light of life to go With such words as once were uttered , off the isle of Floreo : Here die I , Sir Richard Grenvile , of a free and joyful mood : Ending earth for God and honor , as a valiant soldier should ! But my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like other men ; Thoughtful of the cost of feeding , valiant only with the pen ; Lying , walled about with custom , on an iron bed of creeds ; Peering out through grated windows at the joy my spirit needs . And I hear the sound of chanting ,  --  mailed men are passing by ; Crumble , walls , and loosen , fetters ! I will join them , ere I die ! " So the sleeping thoughts of boyhood oped their eyes and newly stirred , And my muscles cried for usage , till the man their plainings heard : While the star that lit me ever in the dark and thorny ways , Mine by natal consecration , by the choice of after days ,  --  Seen through all the sorrow thickening round the hopes of younger years ,  --  Rayless grew , and left me groping in the valley of my tears . Seaward now the steamer hovered ; seaward far her pennons trailed , Where the blueness of the heavens at the clear horizon paled ; Where the mingled sky and water faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ launched from childhood 's hand . With a statelier swell and longer , up the glacis of the shore , Came the waves that leapt so freshly in their youth , an hour before . So I made an end and , turning , reached a scallop-crested rock , In the stormy spring-tides hurling back the tumult of their shock . There reclining , gazed a moment at the pebbles by my feet , Left behind the billowy armies on their oceanward retreat ; Thousands lying close together , where the hosts a passage wore , Many-hued , and tesselated in a quaint mosaic floor . Thinking then upon their fitness ,  --  each adjusted to its place , Fairly strewn , and smoothed by Nature with her own exceeding grace ,  --  All at once some unseen warder drew the curtains wide apart , That awhile had cast their shadow on the picture of my heart ; Told me  --  " Thou thyself hast said it ; in thy calling be of cheer : Broader continents of action open up in every sphere ! Hold thy lot as great as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find his time to enter , though unheralded and lone , On the inner life 's arena  --  there to sound his battlecry , Self with self in secret tourney , underneath the silent sky . Strong of faith in that mute umpire , some have conquered , and withstood All the pangs of long endurance , the dear pains of fortitude ; Felt a harsh misapprehension gall the wounds of martyrdom ; In the present rancor measured even the scorn of days to come ; Known that never should the whiteness of their virtue shine revealed , Never should the truer Future rub the tarnish from the shield . That diviner abnegation hath not yet been asked of thee : Art thou able to attain it , if perchance it were to be ? O , our feeble tests of greatness ! Look for one so calm of soul As to take the even chalice of his life and drink the whole . Noble deeds are held in honor , but the wide world sorely needs Hearts of patience to unravel this ,  --  the worth of common deeds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ; As the dreaming soldier , after all the perilous campaign , Struggling long with horse and rider , in his sleep smites fiercely out , And , with sudden pang awaking , through the darkness peers about ,  --  Hearing but the crickets chirrup loud , beneath his chimney-stone , Feeling but the warm heart throbbing , in the form beside his own ,  --  Then to knowledge of his hamlet , dearer for the toil he knows , Comes at last , content to nestle in the sweets of his repose , So fell I , from those high fancies , to the quiet of a heart Knowing well how Duty maketh each one 's share the better part . As again I looked about me  --  North and South , and East and West  --  Now of all the wide world over still my haven seemed the best . Calm , and slowly lifting upward , rose the eastern glory higher , Gilding sea , and shore , and vessel , and the city-crowning spire . Then the sailors shook their canvas to the dryness of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one . At the last I sought my cottage ; there , before the garden gate , By the lilac , stood my darling , looking for her truant mate . Stooping at the porch , we entered ;  --  where the morning meal was laid , Turning over holy pages , one as pure and holy played ,  --  Little Paul , who links more firmly our two hearts than clasp of gold ; And I caught a blessed sentence , while I took him to my hold : " Peace , " it said , " O restless spirit , eager as the climbing wave ! With my peace there flows a largesse such as monarchs never gave . " 1857 . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : THE ORDEAL BY FIRE . from The poetical works 1888 To many a one there comes a day So black with maledictions , they Hide every earthly hope away . In earlier woes the sufferer bore , Consolement entered at his door , And raised him gently from the floor . To this great anguish , newly come , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a faint exordium . His days and nights are full of groans ; Sorely , and with a thousand moans , For many wanderings he atones . Old errors , vanquished for a space , Rise up to smite him in the face And threaten him with new disgrace . And others , shadows of the first , From slanderous charnel-houses burst , Pursuing , cry , Thou art accurst ! Dear , feeble voices ask for bread ; The dross , for which he bowed his head So long , has taken wings and fled . The strong resources of his health Have softly slipt away by stealth : No future toil may bring him wealth . Dreading the shadow of his shame , False friends , who with the sunshine came , Forego the mention of his name . Thus on a fiery altar tost , The harvests of his life are lost In one consuming holocaust . What can he , but to beat the air , And , from the depth of his despair , Cry " Is there respite anywhere ? " Is Life but Death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust Dissolve , and crumble into dust ? " There are , who , with a wild desire For slumber , blinded by the fire , Sink in its ashes and expire . God pity them ! too harsh a test Has made them falter ; sore distrest , They barter everything for rest . But many , of a sterner mould , Themselves within themselves infold , Even make Death unloose his hold , Athough it were a grateful thing To drain the cup his heralds bring , And yield them to his ransoming ; To quaff the calm , Lethean wave ,  --  In passionless tenure of the grave Forgetting all they could not save . What angels hold them up , among The ruins of their lives , so long ? What visions make their spirits strong ? In sackcloth , at the outer gate , They chant the burden of their fate , Yet are not wholly desolate . A blessed ray from darkness won It may be , even , to know the sun Hath distant lands he shines upon ; It may be that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Because the heavens cease to smile ; That scorn of cowardice holds fast , Lighting the forehead to the last , Though all of bravery 's hopes are past . Perchance the sequence of an art Leads to a refuge for the heart ,  --  A sanctuary far apart . It may be that , in dearest eyes , They see the light of azure skies , And keep their faith in Paradise . Thou , who dost feel Life 's vessel strand Full-length upon the shifting sand , And hearest breakers close at hand , Be strong and wait ! nor let the strife , With which the winds and waves are rife , Disturb that sacred inner life . Anon thou shalt regain the shore , And walk  --  though naked , maimed , and sore  --  A nobler being than before ! No lesser griefs shall work thee ill ; No malice shall have power to kill : Of woe thy soul has drunk its fill . Tempests , that beat us to the clay , Drive many a lowering cloud away , And bring a clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consumes , Either the inmost soul entombs Or evermore the face illumes ! Robes of asbestos do we wear ; Before the memories we bear , The flames leap backward everywhere . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : THE PROTEST OF FAITH . TO REV.  --  from The poetical works 1888 Dear Friend and Teacher ,  --  not by word alone , But by the plenteous virtues shining out Along the zodiac of a good man 's life ; Dear gentle friend ! from one so loved as you ,  --  Because so loving , and so finely apt In tender ministry to a little flock , With whom you joy and suffer ... and , withal , So constant to the spirit of our time That I must hold you of a different sort From those dry lichens on the altar steps , Those mutes in surplices , school-trained to sink The ashes of their own experience So low , in doctrinal catacombs , that none Find token they can love and mourn like us ,  --  From such an one as you , I can not brook What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  pleasant unto me , Drunk from a chalice worthier men have held And emptied to the lees . I can not brook The shake o ' the head and earnest , sorrowing glance , Which often seem to say :  --  " Be wise in time ! Give up the iron key that locks your heart . I grant you charity , and patient zeal , And something of a young , romantic love For what is good , as children love the fields And birds and babbling brooks , they know not why . You have your moral virtues , but you err : To err is fatal . O , my heart is faint Lest that sweet prize I win should not be yours ! " In some such wise I read your half-dropped thoughts ; Yet wondrous compensation falls to all , And every soul has strongholds of its own , Invisible , yet answering to its needs . And even I may have a secret tower Up storm-cleft Pisgah , whence I see beyond Jordan , and far across the happy plains , Where gleams the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all our hopes and perfect faith . I may have gone somewhat within the veil , Though few repose serenely in the light Of that divinest splendor , till they shine , With countenance aglow , like him of old ,  --  Prophet and priest and warrior , all in one . But every human path leads on to God ; He holds a myriad finer threads than gold , And strong as holy wishes , drawing us With delicate tension upward to Himself . You see the strand that reaches down to you ; Haply I see mine own , and make essay To trace its glimmerings  --  up the shadowy hills Forever narrowing to that unknown sky . There grows a hedge about you pulpit-folk : You reason ex cathedra . Little gain Have we to clash in tourney on the least Of points , wherewith you trammel down the Faith , It being , at outset , understood right well By lay knights-errant , that their Reverend foes , Fore-pledged to hold their own , will sound their trumps , Though spearless and unhorsed ! Why take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go bowing off With mutual courtesy , and fair white flags Afloat at camp , and every fight is drawn ? As soon encounter statues , balanced well Upon their granite , fashioned not to move , And drawing all mankind to hold in awe Their grim persistence . If , indeed , I sin In counting somewhat freely on that Love From which , through rolling ages , worlds have sprung , And  --  last and best of all  --  the lords of worlds , Through type on type uplifted from the clay ; If I have been exultant in the thought That such humanity came so near to God , He held us as His children , and would find Imperial progress through the halls of Time For every soul ,  --  why , then , my crescent faith Clings round the promise ; if it spread beyond , You think , too far , I say that Peter sprang Upon the waves of surging Galilee , While all the eleven hugged the ship in fear : The waters were as stone unto his feet Until he doubted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and drew him on To closer knowledge ! So , if it be mine First of us twain to pass the sable gates , That guard so well their mysteries , and thou , With some dear friend , may'st stand beside my grave , Speak no such words as these :  --  " Not long ago His voice rang out as cheerly as mine own ; And we were friends , and , far into the nights , Would analyze the wisdom of old days By all the tests of Science in her prime ; Anon would tramp afield , to fruits and flowers , And the long prototypes of trees and beasts Graven in sandstone ; so , at last , would come , Through lanes of talk , to that perennial tree ,  --  The Tree of Life , on which redemption hangs , But there fell out of tune ; we parted there , He bolstering up a creed too broad for me ! I held him kindly for an ardent soul , Who lacked not skill to make his argument Seem fair and specious . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young ; he wandered off , And fell afoul of all those theorists Who soften down our dear New England faith With German talk of ' Nature , ' ' inner lights And harmonies ' : so , taken with the wind Of those high-sounding terms , he spoke at large , And held discussion bravely till he died . Here sleep his ashes ; where his soul may be , Myself , who loved him , do not care to think . " The ecstasy of Faith has no such fears As those you nurse for me ! The marvellous love , Which folds the systems in a flood of light , Makes no crude works to shatter out of joint Through all the future . O , believe , with me , For every instinct in these hearts of ours A full fruition hastens ! O , believe That promise greater than our greatest trust And loftiest aspiration ! Tell thy friend , Beside my grave : " He did the best he could , With earnest spirit polishing the lens By which he took the heavens in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He caught , or thought he caught , from time to time , Bright glimpses of the Infinite , on which He fed in rapturous and quiet joy , That helped him keep a host of troubles down .

God grant his yearnings were a living faith ! Heaven lies above us : may we find him there Beside the waters still , and crowned with palms ! " Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : THE SLEIGH-RIDE. from The poetical works 1888 Hark ! the jingle Of the sleigh-bells ' song ! Earth and air in snowy sheen commingle ; Swiftly throng Norseland fancies , as we sail along .

Earth and air in snowy sheen commingle , Far and nigh ; Is the ground beneath us , or the sky ? Heavenward yonder , In the lurid north , From Valhalla 's gates that roll asunder , Red and wroth , Balder 's funeral flames are blazing forth . O , what splendor ! How the hues expire ! All the elves of light their tribute render To the pyre , Clad in robes of gold and crimson fire . Jingle ! jingle ! Let the Earth go by !

" The Tempest . I. Queen of the shadowy clime ! Thou of the fairy-spell and wondrous lay : Sweet Romance ! breathe upon my way , Not with the breath of this degenerate time , But of that age when life was summer play , When Nature wore a verdurous hue , And Earth kept holiday ; When on the ground Chaldan shepherds lay , Gazing all night , with calm , creative view , Into the overhanging blue , And found , amid the many-twinkling stars , Warriors and maidens fair , Heroes of marvellous deeds and direful wars , Serpents and flaming hair , The Dragon and the Bear , A silvery Venus and a lurid Mars . II . Come at thy lover 's call , Thou , that , with embraces kind , Throwing thy tendrils round the lives of all , Something in all to beautify dost find ! So thine own ivy , on the Gothic wall , Or pendent from the arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to adorn and adds perennial charms . And therefore , Romance , would I greet Thee by the fairest of fair names , Calling thee debonair and sweet ; For sweet thou art  --  inspiring Manhood 's dreams , When all aweary of the actual life ; And sweet thy influence seems To Woman , shrinking from the strife , The sordid tumult of the wrangling mart . But doubly sweet thou art , Leading the tender child by gentle streams , Among the lilies of our flowery Youth ; Filling his all-believing heart With thoughts that glorify the common truth ; Building before him , in the lustrous air , Ethereal palaces and castles fair . III . With such mild innocence the Earth Received thy blessings at her birth ; And in the pastoral days of yore , To Man 's enchanted gaze , Nature was fair  --  O , how much more Than in our wiser days !

IV . Yes ! on romantic pilgrimage , To the calm piety of Nature 's shrine , Through summer-paths , thou ledst our human-kind , With influence divine . In that orient , elden age , Ere man had learned to wage Dispassionate war against his natural mind , Thy voice of mystery , Reading aloud the Earth 's extended page , Bade human aspirations find In the cool fountain and the forest-tree A sentient imagery ; The flowing river and the murmuring wind , The land  --  the sea  --  Were all informed by thee !

VI . Such was thy power , O Pastoral Romance ! In that ambrosial age of classic fame , The spirit to entrance .

Still from thine ancient dwelling-place descend And idealize our too material earth ; Still to the Bard thy chaste conceptions lend , To him thine early purity renew ; Round every image grace majestic throw ! Till rapturously the living song shall glow With inspiration as thy being true , And Poesy 's creations , decked by thee , Shall wake the tuneful thrill of sensuous ecstasy . 1850 . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : WILD WINDS WHISTLE . from The poetical works 1888 I. Sir ULRIC a Southern dame has wed ; Wild winds whistle and snow is come ; He has brought her home to his bower and bed . Hither and thither the birds fly home . Her hair is darker than thick of night ; Wild winds whistle , &c.; Her hands are fair , and her step is light . Hither and thither , &c.; From out his castel in the North Sir Ulric to hunt rode lightly forth . Three things he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird that should sing at will , With carol sweeter than silver bell , Day and night in the old castel ; A lithe little page to gather flowers ; And a crystal dial to mark the hours . 2 . Lady Margaret watched Sir Ulric speed Away to the chase on his faithful steed . From morning till night , the first day long , She sat and listened the bonny bird 's song . The second day long , with fingers fair , She curled and combed her page 's hair . The third day 's sun rose up on high ; By the dial she was seated nigh : She loathed the bird and the page 's face , And counted the shadow 's creeping pace . 3 . The strange knight drew his bridle-rein ; He looked at the sky and he looked at the plain . " O lady ! " he said , " ' t was a sin and shame To leave for the chase so fair a dame . " O lady !

" He has taken her hand and kissed her mouth : Now Ho ! sing Ho ! for the sunny South . He has kissed her mouth and clasped her waist : Now , good gray steed , make haste , make haste ! 4 . Sir Ulric back from the chase has come , And sounds the horn at his castel-home . Or ever he drew his bridle-rein , He saw the dial split in twain ; The bonny blithe bird was stark and dead , And the lithe little page hung down his head . The lithe little page hung down his head ; Wild winds whistle and snow is come ; " O where , Sir Page , has my lady fled ? " Hither and thither the birds fly home .

" Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : THE HILLSIDE DOOR . from The poetical works 1888 Sometimes within my hand A Spirit puts the silver key Of Fairyland : From the dark , barren heath he beckons me , Till by that hidden hillside door , Where bards have passed before , I seem to stand . The portal opens wide : In , through the wondrous , lighted halls , Voiceless I glide Where tinkling music magically falls , And fair in fountained gardens move The heroes , blest with love And glorified . Then by the meadows green , Down winding walks of elf and fay , I pass unseen : There rest the valiant chieftains wreathed with bay ; Here maidens to their lovers cling , And happy minstrels sing , Praising their queen . For where yon pillars are , And birds with tuneful voices call , There shines a star ,  --  The crown she wears , the Fairy Queen of all ! Led to that inmost , wooded haunt By maidens ministrant , I halt afar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls me near her throne , And waves her wand , As in my dreams , and smiles on me alone . O royal beauty , proud and sweet ! I bow me at her feet To kiss that hand : Ah woe ! ah , fate malign ! By what a rude , revengeful gust , From that fair shrine Which holds my sovran mistress I am thrust ! Then comes a mocking voice 's taunt , Crying , Thou fool , avaunt ! She is not thine ! And I am backward borne By unseen awful hands , and cast , In utter scorn , Forth from that brightness to the midnight blast : Not mine the minstrel-lover 's wreath , But the dark , barren heath , And heart forlorn . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : THE FEAST OF HARVEST . from The poetical works 1888 The fair Earth smiled and turned herself and woke , And to the Sun with nuptial greeting said : " I had a dream , wherein it seemed men broke A sovran league , and long years fought and bled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gore , And all my beautiful garments were made red , And all my fertile fields were thicket-grown , Nor could thy dear light reach me through the air ; At last a voice cried , ' Let them strive no more ! ' Then music breathed , and lo ! from my despair I wake to joy ,  --  yet would not joy alone ! " For , hark ! I hear a murmur on the meads ,  --  Where as of old my children seek my face ,  --  The low of kine , the peaceful tramp of steeds , Blithe shouts of men in many a pastoral place , The noise of tilth through all my goodliest land , And happy laughter of a dusky race Whose brethren lift them from their ancient toil , Saying : " The year of jubilee has come ; Gather the gifts of Earth with equal hand ; Henceforth ye too may share the birthright soil , The corn , the wine , and all the harvest-home . " " O my dear lord , my radiant bridegroom , look ! Behold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sword a share , the spear a pruning-hook ; Lo , I awake , and turn me toward thy beams Even as a bride again ! O , shed thy light Upon my fruitful places in full streams ! Let there be yield for every living thing ; The land is fallow ,  --  let there be increase After the darkness of the sterile night ; Ay , let us twain a festival of Peace Prepare , and hither all my nations bring ! " The fair Earth spake : the glad Sun speeded forth , Hearing her matron words , and backward drave To frozen caves the icy Wind of the North ,  --  And bade the South Wind from the tropic wave Bring watery vapors over river and plain ,  --  And bade the East Wind cross her path , and lave The lowlands , emptying there her laden mist ,  --  And bade the Wind of the West , the best wind , blow After the early and the latter rain ,  --  And beamed himself , and oft the sweet Earth kissed , While her swift servitors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beck of Earth , Foster her children , brought a glorious store Of viands , food of immemorial worth , Her earliest gifts , her tenderest evermore . First came the Silvery Spirit , whose marshalled files Climb up the glades in billowy breakers hoar , Nodding their crests ; and at his side there sped The Golden Spirit , whose yellow harvests trail Across the continents and fringe the isles , And freight men 's argosies where'er they sail : O , what a wealth of sheaves he there outspread ! Came the dear Spirit whom Earth doth love the best , Fragrant of clover-bloom and new-mown hay , Beneath whose mantle weary ones finds rest , On whose green skirts the little children play : She bore the food our patient cattle crave . Next , robed in silk , with tassels scattering spray , Followed the generous Spirit of the Maize ; And many a kindred shape of high renown Bore in the clustering grape , the fruits that wave On orchard branches or in gardens blaze , And those the wind-shook forest hurtles down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Earth her children summoned joyously , Throughout that goodliest land wherein had ceased The vision of battle , and with glad hands free These took their fill , and plenteous measures poured , Beside , for those who dwelt beyond the sea ; Praise , like an incense , upward rose to Heaven For that full harvest ; and the autumnal Sun Stayed long above ; and ever at the board , Peace , white-robed angel , held the high seat given , And War far off withdrew his visage dun . Stedman , Edmund Clarence , 1833-1908 : BETROTHED ANEW . from The poetical works 1888 The sunlight fills the trembling air , And balmy days their guerdons bring ; The Earth again is young and fair , And amorous with musky Spring . The golden nurslings of the May In splendor strew the spangled green , And hues of tender beauty play , Entangled where the willows lean . Mark how the rippled currents flow : What lustres on the meadows lie ! And hark , the songsters come and go , And trill between the earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Or borne afar our blissful youth ? Such joys are all about us spread , We know the whisper was not truth . The birds , that break from grass and grove , Sing every carol that they sung When first our veins were rich with love , And May her mantle round us flung . O fresh-lit dawn ! immortal life ! O Earth 's betrothal , sweet and true , With whose delights our souls are rife And aye their vernal vows renew ! Then , darling , walk with me this morn : Let your brown tresses drink its sheen ; These violets , within them worn , Of floral fays shall make you queen . What though there comes a time of pain When autumn winds forbode decay ; The days of love are born again , That fabled time is far away ! And never seemed the land so fair As now , nor birds such notes to sing , Since first within your shining hair I wove the blossoms of the Spring .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
