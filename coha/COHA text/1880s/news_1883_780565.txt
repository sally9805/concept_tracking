txt The Italian opera season of 1882-3 came , to an end yesterday . In respect of the struggles of the management to attain certain ends , it has been the most eventful one known since Col. Mapleson hoisted his standard above the walls of the Academy . The great struggle of the year has been , like that in many great races , on the home stretch . The question of yesterday was , " Who has engaged Patti for the coming season 1 " All day long the sounds of battle rolled around the neighborhood of Fourteenth-street and Irving-place , and it was late last night before it was known that Co . Mapleson had finally engaged Mme. Patti for next season . The importance of this engagement to the gallant impresario can hardly be estimated without a reference to the fact that : he has been this season the one unfailing attraction of his company . No matter what the opera may be Patti always draws . This engagement , combined with others already made by Col. Mapleson for next season , gives him an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to his own statements , is very far behind in his preparations . A reporter of THE TIMES went to the Academy of Music yesterday afternoon to see Col. Mapleson and find out what had been done in regard to the great engagement . In the business office of the house were T. M. Croft , Mr. Mapleson 's business manager , wearing a thoughtful look and a heavy brown overcoat . He was chewing meditatively the end of a cigar , and appeared to be awaiting developments and an invitation to go  --  out and see a man . Near him stood Mr. Arment , who has charge of the subscription lists for the Academy seasons . His silk hat looked a little dim and lustreless under the effect of the bad weather , but he wore a smiling face . On the other side of the room loomed up the figure of Mr. Angelo , wrapped in a dark blue overcoat that would have covered a pair of small horses . He also looked thoughtful and anxious . Behind him , on a broken-backed chair , sat Frederick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Academy . In the background was Mr. William Specht , one of ? the ticketsellers. while through a little round window in the door leading to the box-office peered the countenance of the other , Mr. Perry . Every one of these men had an anxious and expectant look . Every time a door banged they all started and looked around , and when it proved to be only a sweeper passing through the room they sighed and relapsed into their former state of silence . The silence was broken only by an occasional suggestion to go across the way and inspect some recently imported Rhine wine . " What are you all waiting for 1 " asked the reporter . " Waiting to find out about that Patti engagement , ' was the answer . Just then the door opened and CoL Mapleson entered the room . In a moment they all surrounded him and plied him with questions , but he only shook his head . " Colonel , " said the reporter , " have you settled the Patti contract ? " " No , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so ? " " How can I tell ? Every time I make her an offer I hear of something new from Mr. Abbey . " " Ras he made her any new offer ? " " I understand he has offered her another $1,000 . " " But it is impossible to manage an opera company on such principles . " " That depends on circumstances . You 've heard of the engagement of a mysterious baritone named Cashman , have n't yon ? Well , I 've been inquiring as to who he is . " Have you found out ? " " Yes , " said the Colonel , drawing the reporter to one side and speaking in a portentous whisper . " It 's Vanderbilt himself ! Now , you ca n't fight Vanderbilt , you know ; that Is , not if you 're only an Italian opera manager . I hope to know definitely by this evening what is to become of Mme. Patti . I am really becoming anxious about her . " And the Colonel smiled grimly . " What about Lucca ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , certainly she is . " " But it is stated , " objected the reporter , " that she is to sing in Vienna , opening in September . " " Oh , no . At least she is to sing there only for six nights . That will not interfere with her coming here . " " Are Sembrich and Tremelli coming over ? " " Yes , and several other members of the Covent Garden company . You see there is a reserve from which I can draw and Mr. Abbey can not . " " He says he has Valleria and Lablache en-gaged . " " That is not true . Valleria is under engagement to me , and so is Lablache . The latter did not come over this season because she had a son very ill . " " What about Gerster ! There are rumors afloat that you have not got Gerster . " " Do n't believe them . She will not sing in this country if she does not sing under my management . Her coming , however , is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she will sing at the Metropolitan Operahouse . " " Mr. Abbey has a very , strong tenor in Signor Campanini . " " He has , if Signor Campanini comes over . " " Do you think there is any doubt of it ? " " Yes , I do . A singer 's voice , let me tell you , is like a very fine musical instrument ? that 's just what it is , in fact . It has got to be kept in use all the time . Now , when Mario was singing for me in London he was doing splendidly ; but he came to me and said he needed a rest . I argued with him and told him he did not , but ho insisted , and I released him . He never sang another note . Annie Louise Cary went away from me to take a month 's rest , and she never sang again . Now , Campanini has been taking a year 's rest . Do you think he would do that and live by spending his own money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him any price to sing for them ? I do n't believe he intends to come to this countess at all . " " It is understood that Mr. Abbey has not engaged a conductor for next season . Whom do you think he will get ? " " That 's very hard to tell , for it is so late in the season now that it would be hard to get any good man . I know this about Mr. Abbey , he has bid for a number of my people , but he has made more trouble for me about Patti than about any one else . I think I have enough trouble . Here I am just back from seeing Mme. Scalchi. and persuading her to sing tonight . She thought that Mlle. Rossini was advertised more than she was , and she was highly indignant . I settled that matter , and came back to the Academy , only to find that Ravelli had decided not to sing . Then I rushed off to see Frapolli , and ask him to do Rhadames , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went around to Signor Clodio 's house , and there they told me that ho had gone out to take a walk at 9 o'clock this morning , and nothing had been seen of him since . Now , is n't that a nice peck of trouble ? " Just at this moment Signor Clotho entered the office and the impressario seized him and conveyed him away to the private office in hot haste . Last evening the reporter went to the Fifth-Avenue Theatre to have a talk with Mr. Abbey . This incipient impressnado was found standing in front of the box-office , radiant in his evening costume . A very shiny silk hat crowned his raven locks , and his luxuriant dark mustache stood out on each side of his mouth with an air of distinction . A standing collar of generous height encircled his neck , and a dark overcoat with expansive silk facings hung hung upon his broad shoulders . In the centre of his dazzling white percale shirt glittered a single stud , the central figure of which was a large emerald surrounded by half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large gold seal . His countenance was smiling , and his manner of speech gave evidence that . he was not weighted down with the importance of his position as an impressario . " What have you done in the operatic line , " asked the reporter , " since your last interview with THE TimES ? " " Oh , nothing , " replied Mr. Abbey , smiling complacently . Things are in about the same state as they were . I 'm in no hurry . " " Have you signed your contract with Mme. Patti ? " " Oh , no . I hear Maploson has , though . I hope he 'll enjoy it . " And Mr. Abbey indulged in another quiet laugh . " Have n't you made any new engagements since you got Cashman ? " " No , I have n't done anything at all . " " What is your agent , Mr. Copleston , doing in Milan all this time ? " " Oh , he 's looking around . He has n't dono anything since the last time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Abbey Mr. Copleston had done precisely the same amount of work . " Have n't you engaged a conductor yet I " " No , not yet . " " Do n't you think it is getting rather late in the season ? " " Oh , no , there is plenty of time . " " Well , whom have you engaged besides the persons already announced ? " " Oh , no one . I 'm in no hurry . I shall have a pretty good company , you 'll see . I 'll be all right . " And Mr. Abbey , still smiling softly as if he had a score of Pettis somewhere in reserve , walked away . Then the reporter went down to the Academy , where all kinds of rumors were floating around . In the corridor he mot T. M. Croft , the business manager , who had a ? face as long as if he had lost his position and failed to get one with Mr. Abbey . " Anything new ? " asked the reporter . " Abbey 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw the contract . " " Who showed it to you ? " " Abbey 's agent , Marcus Mayer . " And this report flew around the lobby of the Academy for an hour or more . No one knew what was the real fact , but every one said that Col. Mapleson would announce it in his farewell speech . After he had delivered this speech and made the announcement of the engagement of Mme. Patti , thus setting all minds at rest , the reporter met him coming from the stage . " Well , " said the Colonel , " you seethe matter is settled at last . " " What is your contract ? " " Oh , it 's the usual thing , just the same as it was this season . She is to sing 50 nights . " " What are the terms ? " " I am to pay her $5,000 per night . You see , Mr. Abbey has bin me up to that pike , and made me pay her $25,000 more than I have dono this season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good . He is just what I have already called him , a guastamastiere , that 's what he is . Do n't forget that word . And do n't forget that Cashman is Vanderbilt . " This settled the long-vexed question as to who was to have Patti . It was understood . that Mr. August Belmont had become Mr. Mapleson 's surety for the fulfillment of the contract . It was rumored yesterday that Mr. Abbey had engaged Mine . Cavalazzi , the dameuse and wife of Mr. Charles Mapleson , for next season . The reporter met the lady 's husband in the corridor of the Academy and asked him what truth there was in the report . " There is some foundation for the report . Mr. Abbey has made her an offer ' , but the matter has not been settled yet , and I do n't know how it will be settled . " When the offer was made , the terms being better than Mme. Cavalazzi had with Col. Maploson , he advised his son to accept it . It was understood last night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Col. Mapleson WA , S that by so doing she keeps herself in constant employment throughout the year , singing both in London and America : Mme. Patti alighted from her carriage on the Guiou pier at 11:20 o'clock last night and went on board the steam-ship Arizona , which sails for Liverpool at 6 o'clock this morning . The diva was accompanied by her companion and Signor Nicolini , and brought in the . . carriage with her her birds , which had been placed in covered cages . Mine . Patti had on a long sealskin dolman . The party went to two state-rooms on the port side , about half way between the main companionway and the saloon , which had been reserved for Mine . Patti . Soon after entering her room she was visited by Capt . Brooks , Mr. William H. Guion , Mr. Gibson , the Passenger Agent of the Guion Line , and several others . She was looking well , and laughed and chatted quite gayly , but when Mr. Guion remarked that the beginning of the voyage would probably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she exclaimed with evident concern : " Do n't say that ! " She soon recovered her spirits , however , and spoke of her prospects of returning to this country . The diva was escorted into the cabin by Capt . Brooks in order to see a number of handsome floral tributes which had been sent to her . One was a huge pillow of roses on which was the inscription " Au revoir " in small white flowers . Mine . Patti bent over the flowers , and , after inhaling their fragrance , pronounced them beautiful . Before retiring to her state-room the great prima donna chatted in the saloon with a few of her friends , and appeared to be in the best of spirits . Many of the other passengers had remained up in order to got a glimpse of Mme. Patti , but there were few visitors on board the vessel when she arrived .
