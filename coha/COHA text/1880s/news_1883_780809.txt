txt The Mohr &; Mohr Distillery Company , of Nos. 49 and 51 Sycamore . street , made an assignment today to Charles F. Rankin . The bond of the Assignee has not yet been fixed , The Mohr &; Mohr Company was the oldest house in Cincinnati , and one of the largest houses of its kind in the country . In an interview with Mr , Thorpe , of the firm , a reporter was informed as to the causes of the assignment , In the Lafayette fire , and the late fire on Sycamorestreet , the losses of the firm were $100,000 at least . The losses on some bad debts during the last 18 months were about $50,000 , Mr. Mohr senior lost in his operations on Third-street and on his plantation in Clermont County over $100,000 . The firm , moreover , has been carrying several thousand barrels of whisky in bond . The slowness of Congress to act made a depression in business , which caused a decline of 10 to 20 cents per gallon on whisky . To meet large engagements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The probable amount of the assets , it is thought , will he about $400,000 . Mr. Mohr states that had the bonded bill gone through the firm would not have been embarrassed . If the bill is passed the firm will be able to pay dollar for dollar . He says that other distillers will be pushed as they have been , and the bonded bill only can save them . There are failures to come all over the country . The St00 , e00 mentioned above is the face value of the assets ; the market value will be much less . The failure did not become known ou ' Change until after 12 o'clock , and the announcement did not cause much surprise . A. majority of the merchants said that it was just what they had been expecting . The company has had very bad luck for the last two years . When burned out they had very little insurance , but it seems to be accepted that the lack of confidence in the passage of the Bonded Whisky bill by Congress is the principal cause of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borrowers for some time , and their paper has been below par . Charles F. ItankinAthe Assignee , was busy all day arranging the debts of the assignment . He said tt was impossible to say as yet what the liabilities were or to estimate the assets . At the office of the firm no one could be found but the book-keeper and the clerks , who referred all callers to Mr. Paul Mohr , Secretary of the company , who was out . The general opinion is that the failure of the firm is only the preoursor of more heavy failures among the whisky men . Trade has been very dull in anticipation of a change in the Bonded Whisky law , and now that pretty much all hope of the passage of the bill has fled , a general prostration of the trade is expected . From the best sources of Information that are open , estimates of the liabilities of the firm toot up $250,000 . The Cincinnati banks hold a good deal of the firm 's paper , but it is nearly all secured .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
