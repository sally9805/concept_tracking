txt The Treasury statement to be found in our columns this morning is satisfactory so far as the assets are concerned and their character . The net cash balance on the 81st ult. was $76,381,099 , while the gold balance over the $100,000,000 reserve against the legal tender notes was $51,879,524 . There are now outstanding , covered by the silver in the Treasury , something over $90,000,000 of silver certificates , while there is nearly as much of the accumulated silver ( $86,849,668 . ) It will thus be seen that , in spite of the steady coinage of silver dollars under the Allison act  --  the amount coined in March was $2,600,000 ? there has been but a comparatively slight increase in the net silver balance during the month , there has also been an increase of $7,000,000 in the net gold balance , and there has been a reduction in the total debt , less cash in the Treasury , of $14,087,844 . This large reduction in the debt has been accompanied by an increase in the revenues and a decrease in the expenditures as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the revenues as thus compared is $3,765,433 , of which $2,181,000 is in customs , and the diminution of expenditures has been $10,862,955 , of ' which $3,637,000 has been in ordinary-expenses and $7,871,000 in . pensions , there being a , slight increase in miscellaneous expenses. , , If we compare the nine months from July 1,1885 , with the nine months - from July ' 1 , 1884 , , we find the same results still . more clearly brought out . For these two periods there has been in round numbers , an increase in th ? revenues of $10,000,000 and a decrease in the total expenditures of $23,000,000 , making a net difference in favor of the Treasury so far as concerns assets and liabilities of . $33,000,000 . If the Treasury were a business corporation , the revenues of which came from sales and the expenditures of which were made in the course of ordinary business , this would be an excellent showing . It has been usual for a long time to treat the subject in this way . For many years the country read every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of congratulations over the blessed prosperity of the Government , as shown by an overrunning Treasury and enormous payments of the debt mostly not yet due . The Republican organs , with entire sincerity , and encouraged by the spirit in which their statements were received , were accustomed to attribute these results to the virtue of the party in power . Year after year the party conventions " pointed with pride " to the gigantic reduction of the debt made " by the Republican Party , " and undoubtedly a good deal of the distrust which was felt for the Democrats in the matter of finance had its origin in the feelings generated by these remarkable claims . The comparison of the two periods we have brought together  --  practically belonging , the earlier to the Republican Administration and the later to the Democratic ? if judged by the same standard , would show that this distrust was unfounded and that the prosperity of the country , as measured by the income and outgo of the Treasury , is greater under a Democratic than it was under the latest Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we regard that standard of judgment as fallacious and mischievous , and that we should tolerate no claim to superior excellence for the present Administration based on any such comparison . The fact is that so much credit for financial good management as can fairly be claimed for the present Government belongs exclusively to the Executive branch , and that the Representative branch is entitled only to blame . The increase of revenue is the work of neither , but the House of Representatives is to be severely condemned not only for the fact that the revenues have not been substantially reduced , but for the fact that no serious attempt has been made to reduce them . The diminution of expenses , in the same manner , is mainly in pensions , and we hardly think any earnest Democrat in Congress will claim that he or his party has tried very hard to bring that about , or that it has been due to legislation , or that the legislators have spared any pains to make these expenditures heavier . What the Democratic Executive has done is , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ward off the evils inherent in the law regulating the currency and to prevent the injury to the credit and commerce of the country that must come sooner or later from the forced coinage of legal tender silver dollars . But as to the Democratic House , it has done nothing yet to redeem the promises made by its party . Unless it does so at the present session , the curious spectacle will be presented of a party providing the country with an honest , sagacious , and trustworthy Executive , and balking all his efforts for the good of the country through a stupid , reckless , and extravagant majority in the popular branch of the National Legislature .
