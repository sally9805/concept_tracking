txt The respectable dullness of the proceedings with which the work of legislation was reslimed at the national capital yesterday can hardly be accepted as an augury for the entire short session . While no momentous changes in the laws of the land . are confidently looked for in the three months during which the Forty-ninth Congress will conclude its work and its existence , there is every prospect of interesting debates and ardent contests , which we fancy will not wait long for their beginning . Senator PLATT promises to plunge the Senate at once into the sea of trouble which awaits it in attending to his resolution to do away with secret sessions . This question is at once delicate and difficult , since the inclinations of a majority of the Senators run strongly counter to what they know to be the popular wish . The contributions to THE TIMES over the signature " Publicola " ? which will presently be issued in a pamphlet  --  will be useful to the opponents of the secret sessions , supplying an arsenal of weapons of which we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HEWITT may be relied upon to bring up promptly his proposed changes in the administrative part of the tariff laws , for he will have at most not more that ten days or two weeks of working time in which to resume and achieve  --  if Mr. RANDALL shall graciously permit him to achieve  --  the task in which he failed last Winter . Undoubtedly an earnest effort will be made , and probably in connection with Mr. HEWITT 'S measure of administrative tariff reform , to secure the abolition or reduction of some of the war taxes , and this will give to the proceedings of Congress for the time being an interest which hardly any other theme of discussion could call out  --  always provided that the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations consents to allow any discussion of the tariff .
