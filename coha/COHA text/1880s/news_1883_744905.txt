txt The political experience of Mr. GItORGE BLISS should make him a very competent critic in all matters pertaining to party organization . Some of his suggestions to the Chairman of the Committee of Eighteen are at least worthy of thoughtful consideration . It seems to be tolerably certain that seven hours is not a long enough time in which to take the vote of an entire Assembly district at a single polling place . At the regular elections ten hours are allowed , for voting ? and the election districts are , ? limited to 400 voters each . In some of the Assembly districts from 1,800 to 2,000 Republicans have been enrolled , and the inevitable result of attempting to take the vote at a single polling place , even if the whole day and evening is allowed for it , will be crowding and confusion during the later hours . The probable effect will-be the massing of voters to give advantage to a clique and the crowding out of their opponents . The proper remedy is a number of polling places proportioned to the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ objections to continuing the voting beyond a ? single day . There is also value in the suggestion that the District Committees and the district delegates in the County Committee should vary in number according to the number of Republican voters to be represented . But Mr. BLiss 's criticisms and suggestions are so numerous and so pertinent as to raise new doubts as to whether the plan of reorganization is to prove workable . The radical cure for the evils of the caucus system is a preliminary election held under all the sanctions of law for the selection of the candidates and delegates of all parties .
