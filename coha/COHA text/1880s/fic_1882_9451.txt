Time  --  The Present . Main text Scene : Drawing-room in Miss Dalrymple 's House . Windows to ground at back , showing distant landscape . Doors R. and L. Miss Dalrymple and Lucy discovered at rise of curtain . Miss Dalrymple , Miss Dalrymplebonnet and shawl on . Lucy , I am obliged to go out for an hour  --  Lucy . Lucy What , ma'am , with your bad elbow , and you expecting your nephew every minute ? After sending for the new doctor , too ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple New doctor indeed ! I wish old Jenkins had n't died  --  though to be sure for the last twenty years he never gave anything but syrup of squills , for fear he should make a mistake , and he was so shaky that when he counted my pulse he always made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sent for this new doctor , and he has n't come yet . My elbow might have died in half the time . I mean I might have died . What is this new doctor like ? Lucy . Lucy I do n't know , ma'am ; he only came day before yesterday ; but I have heard he is young and good-looking , and they say there 's been quite an epidermic among the single ladies this morning . But must you go out , ma'am ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Yes , Lucy . The creatures  --  I ca n't call them anything else  --  no sooner heard that my elbow was troubling me than they called a meeting to elect that Mrs. Smith Presidentess . I am not going to let them beat me like that . No ; if I was n't strong enough to walk there , I 'd crawl , even if I had to be carried on a shutter . And when the conspirators meet they will find me among them  --  the Nemesis of Smallington Centre ! Lucy . Lucy But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're a Nemesising it , ma'am ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple I do n't think he will ; there 's no fast train now from New York till the afternoon ; and if Mr. Arthur 's anything like what he was eight years ago when he went away , a slow train wo n't suit him . But call Miss Sylvia , and I 'll tell her what to do in case he should come ; and be sure not to say anything to her about my having had the rheumatism this morning . I do n't want to frighten her . Lucy goes toward door as Sylvia enters R. I was just going to call you , miss . Exit Lucy R. Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Did you want me , aunt ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Yes , my dear . I have to go out ; there are traitors in our camp . I must make a martyr of myself , or the Dorcas Society will be wrecked  --  yes , wrecked , by that awful , designing Mrs. Smith ! A widow indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Probably dead ! Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple I do n't believe it , though to be sure she 's enough to have killed any one . What do you think  --  she actually proposed to admit gentlemen to the Society 's Tuesday evenings ! Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Horrible ! Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Was n't it ? Now , dear , if by any chance my nephew should come while I am away , try to make him comfortable . Treat him as I myself would . I hear he has quite reformed . And you know he 's my only relation except you . And let me tell you of a little idea I have in my head . If only he should like you , and you should like him  --  why , can you guess what might happen then ? Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Like would cure like , I suppose  --  truth of the homoeopathic principle once more asserted . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple I do n't believe in infinitesimal doses . Sylvia . Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple You 've never seen him , of course , my dear , but I do n't know , really , whether that is n't rather an advantage ; you 'll be all the more predisposed to like him . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple I 'll do my best , aunty dear . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple You 'll have very little difficulty , my love . You 'll be surprised in him  --  you 'll find him quite a striking young person . A little flighty in his conversation , perhaps , but  --  Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Oh , I like vivacity , aunty . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Then I 'm sure you 'll get along very well with my nephew . Good-by , my dear . The machinations of that Mrs. Smith demand my attention . Now , do n't fail to receive your cousin kindly  --  avoid any appearance of cold reserve , and do n't be astonished if he 's a little odd and  --  foreign in his conversation . Good-by . Exit Miss Dalrymple L. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall never know what to do with him , if he should come . It is horribly awkward  --  to be left to receive a strange cousin  --  all alone . What shall I call him ? I ca n't say " cousin " ; it sounds too familiar . And then  --  if he 's a forward young man . ... And what am I to talk to him about ? I ca n't awaken reminiscences of his youth , that 's clear . And I dare n't talk about his foreign travel . I do n't see , though , why I should bother myself so much about him . Aunt Dalrymple 's scapegrace nephew , indeed ! A pretty person ! I should n't care to see him if there were n't another man in the place  --  and there are other men in the place . There 's the clergyman 's eldest son just getting to be twenty-one and quite nice ; and the new doctor who came day before yesterday , and the girls all say he 's perfectly sweet . I sha n't worry much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slightest preparation for him . I 'll receive him just as I am , and he may start the conversation . Bell rings . The bell ! There he is ! And I 'm sure I look horrid . Runs to mirror and arranges ribbons . Oh , dear , that 'll never do . I 'll just run up stairs for a moment . Exit Sylvia , R. Enter Lucy L. , showing in Chisholm . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Here I am at last ! I suppose you thought I 'd never get here ! Lucy . Lucy Miss Dalrymple has been expecting you a long time , sir . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm I 'm very sorry to have kept her waiting . Take her my card . Aside I do n't see why a doctor should n't carry a card , as well as any one else  --  especially when it 's his first visit . And I 'm sure I had a card somewhere about me . Feeling in pockets Ah ! here it is ! Gives it . Lucy , Lucygoing R. Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's come at last . And he does n't look so very scapegrace-y either . Aloud I 'm so glad you 've come , sir ! Exit R. Chisholm , Arthur Chisholmalone . So glad  --  wonder whether she wants me , too . Of all the towns for sick single women , this is the worst  --  I mean the best . It 's business for me , if it is .... sentiment for them . I 've had only one male patient to-day  --  but I 'm bound to say he occupied more time than even the worst old maid on my list . Let me see , what was his name . He did give me a card . Feels for it I suppose I must have left it at the house . I 'd have been here two hours ago , to attend to this unfortunate elbow , if it had n't been for him . A very neat black eye he had  --  a very artistic little mouse . Got it in a fight with a bar-keeper , and wanted it toned down before he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in distemper  --  magnesia and honey  --  and he 's drying off now . Ah , now for the next old tabby . Sylvia enters R. Tabby ! why , she 's a kitten , bless her ! Sylvia , Miss Sylvia Dalrymplerushing to him . Oh , I 'm so glad you 've come ! Taking both his hands . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Thank you  --  you 're very kind . Aside Well , I 'm glad I have come . Aloud You see I 've only just  --  Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Yes , we know you 've only just arrived . We had expected you a little earlier ; but we wo n't reproach you now you are here . Sit down , do they sit , C. and L. C.. You must make yourself quite at home , you know . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm I 'll try to . Aside Nice cordial style about the people here ! Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple My aunt has been so anxious to see you . Chisholm , Arthur Chisholmaside . Her aunt , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aunt ! Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple I hope you 're quite well . Aside He seems to feel a little strange . I must be more cordial . Aloud Quite well ? Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Quite well , thanks . Suddenly How 's your elbow ? Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple My elbow ! Aside He is very flighty . Perhaps that 's a foreign idiom . Chisholm , Arthur Chisholmembarrassed . I mean  --  I mean  --  I mean  --  heavy rain yesterday  --  bad weather for rheumatism . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple And bad for the corn , too . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm The corn ! Well , to tell you frankly , corns are not exactly in my line . Sylvia , Miss Sylvia Dalrympleaside . He has no inclination for an agricultural life . I 'm afraid he 's not thoroughly reformed . Perhaps he has not sown all his wild oats . Aloud Now tell me all about yourself . You do n't know how much interest I take in you . What have you been doing the last eight years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is  --  you see  --  Sylvia , Miss Sylvia Dalrymplequietly . Oh ! I beg your pardon  --  I ought not to have asked that , for I suppose you have been very  --  very  --  hesitates . Chi sholm . Arthur Chisholm Well , I have been rather  --  rather  --  hesitates . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Yes , of course , but that is all over now , and you 're going to settle down here and be quite proper and steady , are n't you ? Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Yes , certainly , Miss Dalrymple . Aside It 's nice to have a pretty girl stow so much interest in one . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Oh , you need n't be so formal . I feel already as though we were very old friends . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Thank you ! Aside I wish she 'd begin about her elbow ; she did n't seem to like my referring to it . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Now , I do n't know what to call you . I ca n't address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward one of whom I am going to see so much . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm I hope so . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Oh yes , indeed . Now we have you here , we 're not going to let you slip away in a hurry . We 'll not allow you to fall back again into  --  rather  --  rather  --  you know . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm I do n't want to . I think it 's very nice here . Change of tone Your elbow 's better , I suppose ? Sylvia , Miss Sylvia Dalrympleaside . What a queer phrase that is ! I wonder what it means ? It wo n't do to appear too innocent . Aloud Oh yes , thank you . Chisholm , Arthur Chisholmaside . She need n't thank me . She 's getting well too soon . She 's very pretty . What an interesting invalid she 'd make ! Aloud I think all you need is toning up . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple And I 've heard that all you need is toning down . Chisholm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be harmonious . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Why should they not , Ar  --  Arthur ? Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Arthur ? Rapidly moving his chair up to hers Miss Dalrymple ! Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple You may call me Sylvia . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm You are only too good . Seizing her hand , speaking hurriedly Ah ! if you could but know what an instantaneous impression your beauty , your grace , your delicacy have made upon me , you would not wonder , Winona  --  Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Sylvia , you mean ! Chisholm , Arthur Chisholmas before . Sylvia , I mean  --  you would not wonder that this young heart yearns toward you , in all its  --  its  --  its adolescent efflorescence , Miranda  --  Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple But my name is not Miranda ! Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Of course not . Sinking on his knee Ophelia , I can no longer restrain the throbbings of a heart that  --  Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Oh hush , Arthur ! You must not speak to me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my aunt  --  our aunt . Chisholm Arthur Chisholmrising , startled . Our aunt ! Aside Look here , this is getting a little too rapid for me . Resuming his professional air I trust your elbow is entirely well ? Sylvia , Miss Sylvia Dalrympleaside . That elbow again ! Oh , gracious me ! I do believe  --  upon my word  --  the poor fellow  --  he 's just a little  --  crazy , you know . The hot climates  --  or something  --  have turned his head . And looking out window there is aunt coming . Aloud Arthur , aunty 's coming . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm The deuce she is ! Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Yes . Are n't you glad to see her ? Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Well , no , not particularly . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Not glad to see aunty ? Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm I wish " aunty " was in  --  Afghanistan . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple O Arthur ! Aside He 's really crazy . I must humor him . Aloud Well , suppose we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you coming ? Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Yes . Then you 'll feel more like seeing aunty . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm Perhaps I shall . Come along , by all means . Sylvia , Miss Sylvia Dalrympleleading him R. You go . I 'll follow in a moment . Chisholm enters room . Sylvia immediately shuts and locks door . He 's quite crazy , poor fellow . I am afraid he 'll do aunty some mischief . However , he 's safe there for a few minutes , and I can send for the gardener to help control him . Miss Dalrymple , Miss Dalrympleentering L. Of all the disgraceful outrages ever perpetrated , this last outbreak of my wretched nephew 's is the worst ! Sinks into chair . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple What has he done , aunt ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Done ! What has n't he done ? Broke into the Dorcas rooms , just as I was about to overwhelm that Smith woman , with a dreadful black eye and very drunk , and , seizing me round the waist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her horrible , vulgar laugh and secured nearly all the votes ! Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple You must forgive him , aunt . He is not accountable for his actions . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple I hear he has been in the town for hours  --  that he had a fight in a low saloon , where he got that terrible eye . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple I did n't notice anything the matter with his eye . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Has he been here then ? Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Yes . I 've locked him up in that room . Chisholm , Arthur Chisholmpounding on door . Sylvia ! let me out . I 'm not afraid of your aunt . She 's nothing to me . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Listen to that  --  the ungrateful boy , for whom I have done so much . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple I am sure I tried all in my power to keep him quiet and happy . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Yes , dear , I am sure you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chisholm pounds on door . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Shall I risk letting him out ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Call Lucy and the gardener first . He may be dangerous in this state . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple But they must n't hurt him . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Hurt him ! I 'll have him taken at once to the police-station . Chisholm pounds . Yes , sir . My gardener and my maid shall take you to the police-station . Chisholm . Arthur Chisholm I 'll smash your gardener and your maid and the whole family if I get a chance at you . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Hear the wretch ! Lucy , Lucyentering L. O marm ! O Miss Dalrymple ! What is all this horrible noise ? Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Lucy , where 's the gardener ? Lucy . Lucy He 's out , marm , for the day . You gave him permission this morning . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Then how shall we get rid of this drunken wretch ? Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miss Dalrymple What is he , then ? Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple He 's only crazy , aunty , dear  --  only the least bit insane . Chisholm pounds ferociously . He 's only a little bit flighty and foreign in his ways . But I 'm not afraid of him . I 'll open the door . Lucy . Lucy Oh , law ! miss , do n't go near him . It may be contiguous . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple Oh , he was really quite nice and calm with me . Miss Dalrymple . Miss Dalrymple Yes , open the door , Sylvia ; and I myself will lead the miscreant to the tribunal of justice . Lucy . Lucy She means the police-station , where the green lamp is . O marm , do n't be so hard on him . Sylvia . Miss Sylvia Dalrymple O aunty , spare him ! Kneeling . He 's really so very nice .
