txt It is not to be assumed that the financial policy of the National Government is an ' issue in the State politics of Massachusetts and . it is not probable that many votes will be cast for either Mr. ANDREW or Mr. A-ES because of the declarations on that subject in the platforms of their respective parties . But it is clear that if the question is to be brought into the canvass at all it ought to be treated with reasonable firmness and intelligence . In that regard the platform of the Republicans is far above that of the Democrats . The former says : " A sound currency based . upon specie in conformity to the monetary standard of the world is of the most vital importance to the interests of the country . The continued . coinage of silver dollars at the present ratio is a constant menace to the stability of our finances . We demand the repeal of the law which requires the further coinage of this debased. money . " This is sound in principle , rests on well known facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Democrats , on the contrary , content themselves with a declaration " empty and . fine as a swordless sheath . " They say " honest money must be maintained , " assuming , contrary to the fact , that we now have only honest money . They add : " The gold and silver coinages of the Constitution and the circulating paper medium based on both coinages , and easily convertible into either , must be defended . against all assault . " If they stickle for the constitutional currency , why do they not adhere to the old . Democratic doctrine that legal tender United . States notes are not constitutional ? Since they do not do that , what virtue can they see in a " paper circulating medium " " easily convertible into either " gold at 100 cents to the dollar or silver at 75 cents So far as we know there is no advantage in any such hybrid and bastard currency as this . There are men , like the Republicans , according to their platform , - who believe in a currency convertible into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " defend " the present dangerous and complicated system ? If so , why do they not say so plainly ? If there is any meaning in their phrases at all it is a meaning favorable to the continuance of the compulsory coinage of silver dollars . They can not suppose that this is demanded by any considerable interest in Massachusetts . They have not the excuse for their cowardly nonsense that it may win or save a few votes . No one of the few voters in Massachusetts who believe in the Bland dollar is in danger of voting with the Republicans . The Democrats might have ignored the question altogether without attracting attention ; but their ridiculous straddle will , if it have any effect at all , disgust conservative men and . tend to alienate them from the party and the ticket . Probably it will have no serious influence , which leaves the Democrats in the discreditable position of having been not only foolish , but foolish for nothing .                  @ @ @
