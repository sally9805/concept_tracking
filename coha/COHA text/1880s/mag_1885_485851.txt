TrimiE is a type of poetic volumes , well known to reviewers , and so marked that it recurs every month or two with unfailing certainty . The volumes are so alike that if they were changed at nurse , so to speak , and each were printed under the name of a different author , the writers themselves would scarcely know the difference . They are often smooth and almost always blameless , but it is impossible to criticise them individually since they have no individuality . If the author is a woman , there are poems on Abraham Lincoln , on Decoration Day , and on the malriage of a young friend ; on " parting , " " retrospection , " and " our boy . " Books of this class are Ashes for Flame , and Other Poems ' by Caroline Dana Howe ( Portland , Me . : Loring ) ; ' Stray Thoughts and Poems , ' by Mary Hildreth Parker ( Boston : Cupples , Upham &; Co. ) , this being liberally illustrated , with plates that add little to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Boston : Roberts ) , with many illustrations of flowers and birds by Dorothy Holroyd  --  these last being of more value than the text ; and the ' Poetical Works ' of Mrs. H. J. Lewis ( Boston : Cupples , Upham &; Co. ) , with a portrait of the author . Similar volumes are Poems , ' by Jamin Willsbro ( Philadelphia : Lacy ) , and America , and Other Poems , ' by Henry Hamilton ( Putnams ) , the latter being mainly religious and patriotic . Of essentially the same quality of mediocrity , and not improved by Scriptural subjects and a ponderously didactic tone , is the thick volume entitled Elijah the Reformer , ' a ballad epic and other sacred and religious poems , by George Lansing Taylor . D.D . ; ( second edition , Funk &; Wagnalls ) . ? Our Father in Heaven ; the Lord 's Prayer in a Series of Sonnets , ' by William C. Richards ( Boston : Lee &; Shepard ) , similarly illustrates the hold that devout themes still have upon the community @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader of what is called " the regious. press . " Mr. Henry Abbey 's Poems , ' which now appear in a new and enlarged edition ( Kingston , N. Y. : Abbey ) , are of a higher grade than the foregoing in respect of culture and variety , but not as regards individuality ; they take no strong hold . In Camp Fire , Memorial Day , and Other Poems , ' by Kate Brownlee Sher wood ( Chicago : Jansen , McClurg &; Co. ) , there are some strong lines . In Afternoon Songs ' ( Scribner ) , Mrs. Julia C. R. Darr shows increasing maturity of thought and talent , while her themes sometimes suggest unfavorable comparison with authors of more unquestioned genius . Thus the verses entitled " The Fallow Field " ( p. 36 ) bear marked resemblance to a poem under the same title by the late Mrs. Helen Jackson ; the measure is the same , as are some of the thoughts , while the poem as a whole is inferior . In the following striking verses Mrs. Dorr is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Dorr 's verses rise above the average leval , there are other writers who fall unequivocally below it . Such is Mr. Masson Pell Helmbold , who , by his own dates , can be but twentyone , and who publishes Thisbe 's Lament , and Other Poems ' ( Philadelphia : Lippincott ) . One would not wish to speak unkindly of anything so youthful ; but it is difficult not to regret the premature appearance in public of one who writes of " cute-eyed sin " ( p. 22 ) , and addresses a nightingale : " 0 primal moral of all morals here ! 0 bird that singest all alone in arboreal shade " ( p. 18 ) , or sings " so haste you now and find a lassie And take her home and love her , And though she 's virtuous , sweet , yet sassy ( sic ) , She 'll raise you far above her " W. 70 ) . Again , in Verses , ' by Francis Allen Hillard ( Putnams ) , the author ventures out of the stronghold of mediocrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FEET . " When toying zephyrs coax the hem Of fair Diana 's dress , And hide-and-seek play in the folds With fond and soft caress ; " The arched glory of her feet Breaks from the sheeny cloud ; Then soft as thought is hid again Within its snowy shroud " ( p. 1:38 ) . Here we pause , with more discretion than the author has exhibited . Utopian Dreams and Lotus Leaves , ' by George W. Warder ( London : Sampson Low &; Co 1 , has at least this definite characteristic , that it is surcharged with echoes of Joaquin Miller , and , like that writer 's first volumes , is printed in London . It contains the author 's portrait and autograph ; he seems a resident of some one of our Western States , and has the inclination for high-flown names that we have often deplored in the poets of that region . The chief personages of ids longest poem are Ethel Vane and Truman Gray , and later we have Earl Duffing , Pauline Golden , Beaumont , and Moiselle . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic , but he gives an acrostic ( p. 213 ) for " Cora Baker , Lovely Blonde , " and closes a poem : " Far beyond time 's rolling tide , As an angel pure and pretty , Blooms with life immortal , Ettie , Now a rose on Eden 's hillside " , p. 203 ) . A Voyage to the Fortunate Isles , ' by Mrs. Sarah M. B Piatt , appears in a new combination and with the sub-title " Select Poems " ( Boston : Houghton , Mifflin &; Co . ) . It contains many of those tender , imaginative , exclamatory , and utterly desolate domestic lyrics , a ith which all this lady 's re ders are familiar . Had it been called A Voyage to the Unfortunate Isles , ' it would have explained itself . Alone among poets , Mrs. Piatt has succeeded in linking the thought of childhood almost wholly with moods of sorrow . There may be parents so miserable as to find a sense of relief in the companionship she gives them ; but it is painful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she must have impressed the conviction that they have no business ever to smile again . One of the most powerful of Turgeneff 's Pictures in Prose ' is that in which a wayfarer , turn where he will , sees always a grave opening before him . It is the task to which . Mrs. Piatt has successfully addressed herself to paint this same symbol on the walls of every nursery . If poems must be written on the deaths of little children , it is better to strew their biers with flowers , as is done by Maurice Francis Egan in a thin volume of Songs and Sonnets , ' which , small as it is , yields half its space to " Carmina , ' by Cond6 Benoist fallen ( London : Kegan Paul ) : " OF FLOWERS . " There were no roses till the first child died , No violets , no balmy-breathed heartsease , No heliotrope , nor buds so dear to bees ? The honey-hearted woodbine  --  no gold-eyed And white-lashed daisy flower , nor , stretching wide , Clover and cowslip-cups , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young spring breeze Runs giddy rates playing seek and hide : For all dowers died when Eve left Paradise , And all the world Was flowerless awhile , Until a little child was laid in earth ; Then from its grave grew violets for its eyes , And from its lips rose-petals for its smile , And so all flowers irom that child 's death took birth . " ( 1 ) . S. ) It may be added that there is a good deal of wealth and delicacy in this little volume , and that it contains a sonnet inscribed to Richard Watson Gilder . Mr. Gilder 's own volume , ' Lyrics , and Other Poems ' ( Scribners ) , is , however , much superior to any that are likely to be dedicated to him , and he stands clearly the first in promise among the younger men to whom we must look to inherit the poetic laurels of Emerson and Longfellow . This was apparent from the first appearance of his New Day , ' a volume whose very weaknesses were not unwholesome , any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ germ . He is now visibly growing stronger , without losing sensitiveness ; and if any one wishes , after a conscientious reading of Will Carleton , to know what a really poetic treatment of a farm subject is , we recommend the following : " deleted material There is to be observed in the poem just quoted this exquisite felicity in execution , that while the ballad reveals to us the whole secret of little Polly 's life , yet she herself does not come before us at all ; she is not a presence , but an absence , and Wins all our hearts simply because of her non-appearance on the stage . Imbroglio , a Drama , ' by George Allender ( San Francisco : Carson ) , is a repulsive blankverse play of domestic life in that city . It is as nauseous as the most unpleasant police report , if taken seriously ; while , if we view it as literature , it is full of such passages as this , taken almost at random ( the italics being our own ) : " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell Me liberty , slicking her tyranny With talk of the divinity of marriage " ( p. 20 ) . In a dramatic way , the book has a " White Form " and a " Black Form " which start up to reason with a villain ; and the dialogue takes sometimes such condensed and vigorous forms as this : " MALONE-Ha ! HENCHMAN Ha ! MALONE-Devil ! HENCHMANDevilette ! MALONE- Henchman ! HENCHMAN ? Malone ! " 118 ) Lilith , the Legend of the First Woman , ' by Ada Langworthy Collier ( Boston : Lothrop ) , is another poem in blank verse with lyrical interludes . The selection of its theme indicates rather more originality than is displayed in the execution ; nor can this unpleasing spectre be made attractive by ingenuity . The author 's theory that the word lullaby comes from two Arabic words meaning Beware of ( p. 5 ) needs confirmation , the more obvious derivation seeming simpler and more pleasing . The Queen of the Hid Isle : An Allegory of Life and Art : Love 's Perversity ; or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas ( London : Triibner ) , is a book ostentatiously whimsical , of which the author says , in her dedicatory poem : " For I have made myself a clean , new mould To pour my fancies in , of mad burlesque , Yet full of death withal as charnel air . " I first of men have carved in lane ' s gold So queer a pagod freaked with arabesque , Though treading Wagner 's ground ' twixt Goethe and Baud elaire . " This does not sound very wholesome ; but there is some crude power in the poems . In Wishmaker 's Town , ' by William Young ( Henry Holt &; Co. ) , we find equal affectation , but without the power . Still another long poem is Montezuma : An Epic on the Origin and Fate of the Aztec Nation , ' by Hiram Hoyt Richmond ( San Francisco : Golden Es-a Co . ) . It deals with a theme which has hitherto resisted the utmost efforts to make it poetical ; nor has Mr. Richmond the gifts to achieve ? success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by S. Selous ( London : Jones ) , is another continuous poem , in ballad measure , often sinking into doggerel , and dealing with the tragedies of fashionable wedlock . Old Newbury and the Pioneers ' ? privately printed , but with a preface by the supposed author , Mr. A. G. Riddle , of Washington , D.C. ? is a narrative poem based on early Ohio history , and with a good deal of local coloring . ' In the Hospital , ' by Grace Denio Litchfield ( Putnams ) , is a poem commemorative of the services of physicians , and is inscribed to the author 's father , There are many volumes of verse published in England which owe nearly their whole value to their containing what Longfellow called " Poems W ' Places . " To read them is like looking at a set of amateur photographs of picturesque spots ; the perpetual interest in the themes makes us charitable to all mediocrities of execution . One of these is ' Hesperus , Rhytlim and Rhyme , ' by E. M. Edmonds ( London : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Athens . Another is By Solent and Danube , Poems and Ballads , ' by W. Wilsley Martin ( London : Trilbner ) , also interesting as having a rather exuberant poem on the return of the Prince Regent from India  --  a fact worth noting because the utmost loyalty of British bards so rarely succeeds in turning a rhyme in behalf of that not very interesting heir apparent . In the days of " Great George our King " it was otherwise . A higher type of " poems of places " consists of those books in which English scholarship does so much toward naturalizing the intellectual wealth of other lands . One of these is The Song Celestial , ' by Edwin Arnold ( Boston : Roberts ) , in which he gives us a versified translation of the Bhagavad Gita from the Sanskrit  --  impressive and interesting , of course , but less so , to our thinking , than the prose versions of the same fine dialogue . Another poem in this department is the Master Thaddeus ' of the Polish poet Mickiewicz , translated into English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . We once noticed in these columns the same lady 's version of Konrad Wallenrod , ' by the same author , and we find this book the more attractive of the two , being made readable , despite its length , by the vivacity of the narration and the curious picture of old Lithuanian manners ; it is like a visit to the Mus6e de Cluny . But more valuable than either of these is Translations of Ancient Arabian Poetry , ' by Charles James Lyall ( London : Williams &; Norgate ) . This is a book full of wealth indeed , crowded both in text and notes with rich Oriental thoughts and chivalrous manners , and rich withal in delicate human touches such as this : " Nay , but our children in our midst , what else But our hearts are they , walking on the ground ? If but the breeze blow harsh on one of them Mine eye says no to slumber all night long . " ( P. 28 ) . Of illustrated American volumes the Boys ' Book of Lyrics ' ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can hardly be said to add anything to the plain prose narratives rf the events it commemorates : give a boy the facts , and his imagination will supply the heroics . The popularity of Will Carleton 's poetry is too well assured with his public for it to make the smallest difference to him whether the critics like his City Lyrics ' ( Harper &; Brothers ) or not ; it is like saying that one does net like Spurgeon 's preaching . The New King Arthur ( Funk &; Wagnalls ) is by the author of The Buntling Ball , ' and must , therefore , according to the evident expectation of the publishers , have many readers ; but we should be sorry to be among them , except for editorial duty ; it bilongs to the dreariest class of college poetry . This book is not illustrated , except very tawdrily on the outside ; nor is the Rev. J. W. Chadwick 's pleasing little collection , The Two Voices : Mountains and the Sea ' ( Troy , N. Y. : Nims ) . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything that is poor ; but the vein of sea-side poetry has been pretty well worked in previous collections , and the matter is not helped , we should say , by undertaking to bring the mountains upon the scene . After all , the " two voices " are essentially distinct , and the attempt at combination really impairs both . Poems , ' by William Wetmore Story ( Boston : Houghton ) , gives us in two dainty volumes the poetic labors of one who has perhaps worked in too many fields for his own fame . The first volume contains " Parchments and Portraits " ; the second , " Monologues and Lyrics . " They show scholarship and cultivation , with a strong flavor of Browning , and their merit stops short of genius . Dramatic and Later Poems , ' by Matthew Arnold ( Macmillan ) , includes but five distinct poems , three of which were contained in the two-volume edition of the same publishers in 1883 ; the others , " Merope " and " Westminster Abbey , " appearing here for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Newman , D.D . ( E. P. Dutton &; Co. ) , should fitly have been called Selected Hymns , ' most of those written by this author after his conversion to the Roman Catholic faith being avowedly omitted . This seems hardly fair , either to the theologian or the poet ; and it is such arbitrary selection as this which furnishes the very strongest argument for an international copyright law . Another little book includes the ' Complete Poems ' of Charles Dickens ( White , Stokes &; Allen ) , but it is really a doubtful service to his memory to reprint them ; not that they contain what is objectionable , but what is mediocre . The very dingiest book on the table before us is , in its way , one of the most promising ; act by reason of genius , but because it smacks of the soil . In Poems of the Prairies , ' as it is called on the cover , or , as the title-page says , Annabel , and Other Poems , ' by Ellen P. Allerton ( Alden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Kansas , and the whole book has the flavor of her residence . Beyond the name " Annabel " in the title there is nothing exotic , nothing forced . Such themes as " The Way-side Trough " and " The Sod House on the Prairie " have in them more of promise than dozens of odes on the Parthenon ; and a poem like " Walls of Corn " has the supreme merit that it could hardly have been produced anywhere else than just where it was written , in the prairie region of the West : deleted material A Journal Kept by Richard Doyle in the Year 1840 . Illustrated with several hundred Sketches by the Author , and a Portrait . Scribner &; Welford . Tax year which cut such a figure in the world 's history was also memorable in the life of Dicky Doyle . In 1840 this most amiable and gifted artist was about fifteen years of age , and then first , on the publication of his humorous design , " The Tournament , " his talent gained a commercial value and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family had a " show " of the week 's artistic product , and Dick exhibited " history " after " history " ? that is , a painting of some historic theme in academic fashion . But he was his father 's own son in having a predilection for current satire and caricature , and a wonderful facility in the use of his pencil . To his father 's happy suggestion that Richard keep a journal we owe this volume , a delight in itself and a most interesting revelation of the development of genius . The reproduction is in facsimile , and the broad , clearly written MS. page is interspersed with pen-drawings , some purely fanciful . but the majority almost photographic memoranda of the domestic circle and of passing events . The father , the brothers and sisters ( no mention is made of the mother ) , the tutor , and intimate friends and visitors , are depicted to the life . Dick himself looks for all the world as if he had just stepped out of Auton House . ' It is well-nigh impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naif record , so creditable to the boy 's intelligence and heart . His humor is spontaneous and irresistible , as where he says , of a debate with conscience about rising in the morning , " So , after a desperate combat with my inclinations , in which I fought under great disadvantage ( as I was lying down ) " ; or where , in a cell in the Tower , he fears lest the door may close on him , " even if it did not do it of its own accord , which perhaps it would not , being so small and probably timid with strangers , " etc . Then his passion for music , leading him to avoid no opportunity of hearing the military bands play in the Park , or of witnessing reviews , which lie depicts with admirable spirit , still further recommends him to readers youthful and adult . The Journal has , moreover , a serious and impersonal side , as a mirror of the spirit of the time . If we look first at political incidents we meet with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Queen 's engagement and marriage ; Oxford 's a ' tempt on her life ; Guizot unsuspecting at the races while Palmerston was planning the quadruple alliance ; Louis Napoleon 's fiasco at Boulogne ; in October , war imminent with France ; the siege and capture of Acre . The intellectual movement is evidenced by the appearance of popular novels in parts ? Ainsworth 's Tower of London , ' with Cruikshank 's illustrations ; Marryat 's Poor Jack ' ; Boz 's Master Humphrey 's Clock , ' with designs by Phiz and Cattermole , for which dealers besiege the doors of Chapman &; Hall ; a new story by the author of Valentine Vox . ' Macready is acting Ruthven in " Mary Stuart " at Drury Lane , and Charles Kemble Felix in " The Wonder , " by the Queen 's command ; and Leigh Hunt 's " The Legend of Florence " has its first night . Braham and Grisi and Tamburini are the lights of the operatic stage  --  the manager of the Italian Opera being forced by a riot to engage the lastnamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) plays in concert , and as we had Braham 's portrait in " Masaniello , " so we have a quite sufficient one of the great pianist in his prime . Landseer 's " Laying Down the Law " and Machse 's " Macbeth " are the pictorial sensations in May at the Royal Academy . Dick visits Chantrey 's studio , of which he gives a view , and meets Count D'Orsay at the lithographer 's . He also figures the famous diving-bell at the Polytechnic Institution , and pokes fun at the popular scientific exposition attempted there . The costumes of the day , of course , are faithfully reproduced  --  the low-necked gowns for girls and women , the belted tunics , and flat , tasselled caps for boys , as imaged for us in the Rollo books  --  and all the uniforms of the soldiery . On p. 45 , that curious survival by which the English railway ticket-office is called bookingoffice is explained at a glance .
