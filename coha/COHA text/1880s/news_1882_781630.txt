txt The Long Island farmers recently held a meeting to take measures to protect themselves  --  as they phrase it  --  against fox-hunters . They decided that , inasmuch as foxhunting is injurious to agriculture and the local cats , they would hereafter prosecute every fox-hunter for trespass who should ride over their land . Truly the way of the American foxhunter is hard . Ho wants to hunt foxesand to hunt them in the true English way , but nature and the farmers place almost insuperable obstacles in his way . He is compelled to substitute the anise-seed bag for the fox , and instead of having the hearty co-operation of the " lower classes " in demolishing their fences and vegetables he is met with gibes and bad language and lawsuits . The pleasures of American fox-hunting are mainly social . Around the dinner-table the bold hunters tell delightful stories of their fox , hunting exploits when visiting eminent British noblemen . Tompkyns rehearses the tale of the immense yellow fox which he followed in company with the Norfolk hounds from near Yarmouth straight across England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He describes the long run through the New Forest , where the hounds lost the scent because the fox took to the trees and sprang from one branch to another forty feet above the heads of the huntsmen , thus crossing nearly the whole of a British county . His finest effort is his picture of the fox as the animal turned at bay on the seashore and killed seven hounds besides severely wounding Lord Bloates before ho was finally shot by the master of the hunt . Tales like this stir the blood of the veteran hunter of anise-seed bags and give to him what is the chief pleasure of his fox-hunting days . It is not our fox-hunters ' fault that there are virtually no foxes on Long Islant They have tried to remedy this defect , but without avail . The last imported fox that was taken to flip " meet " and let out of a bag did not conduct himself creditably . He ought to have started off at the top of his speed instead of sitting down on his haunches and panting in an imbecile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lowbreeding in him to play with the hounds instead of being afraid of them . Had this miserable fox had any self-respect he would not have lain down on his back with his four feet in the air when the huntsmen intimated to him with whips that he ought to get up and run , and his final exploit of springing into a lady 's lap and beseeching her protection completed his disgrace and checked the custom of trying to hunt imported foxes . It was possible , by " making believe a good deal , " for the fox-bunters to enjoy a ride after an anise-seed bag , but now the churlish conduct of the farmers bids fair to stop even this simple sport . The farmers claim that to have their fences ridden down , their land plowed up by the heads of fallen horsemen , and their vegetables trampled under the feet of horses , does not meet their views . In all probability they have greatly exag-. gerated the injuries which they suffer from fox-hunting . Take the item of fences , it is understood that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the upper rails of all fences which are to bo jumped removed and that as soon as the hunt has passed he causes the rails to be replaced . Thus , it seldom happens that a fence is knocked down by a horse , and it is not clear that the farmers sustain any injury worth mentioning from this source . It is true that a good deal of land is plowed up by the heads of huntsmen who have been thrown , but it does not follow that any large amount of damage is inflicted in this way . Of course , when a hunter plows up ten feet of a strawberry-bed he injures it to some extent , but as an offset to this we may cite the benefit which arises from his frequent stirring of the soil of grass and potato fields . We would probably be justified in deciding that the good thus done by the fox-hunter fully balances his occasional destruction of strawberry and celery beds , and were the farmers to look at the matter without prejudice they would be compelled to admit this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hounds upon , and in connection with , local cats must , however , be conceded . ' Desirous as the Long Island fox-hound is of catching the anise-seed bag , he can not resist the temptation of a eat . When the pack swoops by a farm-house and the family cat exposes herself to view , the hounds instantly rush upon her . Tho cat , instead of taking to the open , usually rushes into the garden and through one of the windows of the farm-house , and as the hounds invariably follow her until they kill her under the sofa or on the sewing-machine , the nerves of the farmer 's wife and daughters sustain a painful shock . This cat feature of Long Island fox-hunting is the one thing which the farmers can not overlook . In this matter they undoubtedly have right on their side , and . unless the fox-hunters can employ some new kind of dog , with a profound indifference to cats , they will doubtless be compelled to abandon their favorite sport .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
