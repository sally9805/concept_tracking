txt Italy is about to build a new iron-clad even larger than the monsters which she has lately added to her fleet . As she has only very lately been able to meet her expenses and avoid a deficit in her Treasury , she is accused of an act of great folly in building ships more costly than any hitherto built by England or France . It does not , however , require very much reflection to perceive that Italy has been much wiser than any of her neighbors in deciding to build Ships of unparalleled size and efficiency . That Italy with her enormous sea-coast must have a fleet ready to defend it hardly needs to be said . However possible it might be for her to reduce her Army and to rely on a partially trained Militia for defense against invading armies , it would be impossible for her to build a navy at a few weeks ' notice , and she must , therefore , keep in readiness an efficient force of iron-clads . She can not build as many iron-clads as France possesses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had it would be unwise to spend it on vessels that , at best , could only be a fair match for those of France . Large vessels , however , cost proportionately less than small ones , and , as they can carry thicker armor and heavier guns , are proportionately more formidable . It costs less to build an iron-clad of fourteen thousand tons than two of seven thousand tons each , and the former can be made invulnerable to the guns of the latter . This fact is the explanation of the system pursued by the Italian naval authorities . Instead of trying to compete with France by building iron-clads of the pattern of those built at Toulon and Cherbourg , they decided to build vessels which no French ironclad could venture to fight . The Italia and the Lepanto , now building , were designed to carry armor of thirty-six inches in thickness and guns of one hundred and twenty tons . There is not a gun afloat in any Navy which can pierce thirty-six inches of iron armor , and there is not an iron-clad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the 100-ton guns in use on board the two smaller Italian iron-cladsthe Duilio and the Dandolo . The whole French fleet could not successfully attack these four ships , and hence Italy has made herself more powerful at sea by building four monster iron-clads than she would have been had she provided herself with an exact imitation of the French fleet at an expense enormously in excess of that which she has actually incurred . As there is no doubt . that other nations will now undertake to build vessels as formidable as the Italia and the Lepanto , Italy has decided to build a still larger vessel , carrying still thicker armor and still heavier guns . Her statesmen , instead of adopting the system pursued in England , of waiting until France builds a big iron-clad and then building one slightly bigger , propose to always have in process of construction one or two ships that will be far more formidable than any that can be found afloat in any foreign Navy . Of course , this will cost money , but it is really the most economical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to own a navy , and is far wiser than the system , or rather lack of system , displayed by other nations . Hitherto England and France have played the iron-clad game by themselves , and in a timid way which must excite the scorn of any skillful poker player . If the principles of that expensive game can be gathered from Gen. SCHENCK 'S famous text-book , it seems that when one man makes a bet the other man must bet at least the same amount or drop out of the game . If , however , the second man bets much higher than his rival , the latter will frequently surrender the " pot " ? whatever that may be  --  without making any further effort . England and France have been content to simply " call " one another 's iron'clads , and neither has won any signal victory in the contest . Italy has now taken a hand , and with a boldness that will charm the statesmen of our great West has promptly " raised " both her rivals " out of their boots " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " see " the Italia or the Lepanto , and until they have the means to do so they are virtually out of the game . Thus has one of the youngest of the European nations founded its naval system on the great American game of poker , and by so doing has demonstrated her superiority to the richer but more timid States . Beyond any doubt , the different nations of Europe will now engage in a struggle as to which can build the largest iron-clads . Italy , however , has the advantage of priority , and can not lose it except by carelessness . In time the limit of size in building iron-clads will be reached , for no nation can build a vessel drawing more water than can be found in her harbors . When this limit is reached it will be time for a general agreement to abandon the iron-clad game as being too expensive , and to return to the cheaper unarmored ships of twenty-five years ago .                  @ @ @
