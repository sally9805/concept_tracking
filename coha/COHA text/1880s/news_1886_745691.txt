txt The report that Mr. GLADSTONE has in effect asked Mr. PARNELL to submit to the Ministry a plan for local self-government in Ireland is not improbable . The first question to be asked concerning any measure of home rule is whether it will satisfy Ireland , for if it will not do this it does not matter what answer may be returned to the second question , whether it will pass the House of Commons . It is to be hoped that the comments of the Nationatist:journals upon the report that such a suggestion has been made do not represent the opinion , or rather the feeling , of the Irish people . These journals say that it is absurd to ask suggestions upon measures the main principles of which they declare to be already settled . Now , in the first place , this declaration is not true , and in the second , if it were true it would be nothing to the purpose . The most authentic organ of Irish opinion is the body of Irish members of Parliament . There is no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they will accept is likely to be acceptable in Ireland . It happens that they have never said  --  it looks as if they had been careful not to say  --  what would satisfy them . It is impossible to extract from their speeches even the " main principles " of a measure which England could afford to grant and which Ireland would be content to take . Moreover , supposing the main principles of the measure to be settled , the measure must not merely be a declaration of these principles , but it must furnish a method for applying them in detail to the . new relations that are to exist between England and Ireland . At every detail there will be difficulties which can be overcome only by a conciliatory disposition on both sides and by a consultation of all the interests to be affected by the change . Unreasoning hatred of England on the part of Irishmen and unreasoning hatred of Ireland on the part of Englishmen are states of mind that disqualify the patients from taking part in the process of pacification with any benefit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been made at all , has unquestionably been made frankly and in good faith , because he is sincerely anxious to know , in the most authentic form available , the opinion of the people for whose benefit he is trying to legislate . It would not merely be churlish , it would in a manner be treacherous , for the Irish representatives to withhold from . him the assistance he invokes . There are two suppositions upon which such a refusal could be accounted for , but neither of them would be creditable to the persons whose conduct would call for explanation . One is that they themselves would be at a loss to formulate any plan . Declamation against English oppression , from the stump and elsewhere , is comparatively easy , but it will not do as the basis even of a practicable project for home rule . Something more in the line of constructive statesmanship is needed , and has not thus far been supplied . The organization of the Land League , and later of the National League , has been a masterpiece in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agitation that Ireland , or perhaps any other country , has ever possessed , and Mr. PARNELL is entitled to the utmost credit for having devised and executed so powerful a machine . But the League is not an end , it is a means , and before it can be unqualifiedly praised it must be shown what object it is meant to attain . It may be that its " main principles " are familiar enough , but how it is proposed to apply these principles in detail  --  this , we repeat , is the main question , this is the test of Mr. PARNELL 'S rank as a statesman , and to this question it has never been possible to get any specific answer . The other supposition upon which the refusal of the Irish members to cooperate with Mr. GLADSTONE for the legislative relief of Ireland would be accounted for is even less flattering to them . It is that , whether or not they are able to devise a working plan , they have no intention of trying to do so , but that they mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be proposed in Parliament by refusing to commit themselves to it in advance . This attitude may give them a tactical advantage in the House of Commons , but it is evidently not the way to get any Irish legislation out of that body . Mr. GLADSTONE is willing to commit his Ministry to a scheme of pacification  --  to their scheme of pacification if they will submit one that is unobjectionable , or one which , in his judgment , the Liberal Party can be argued into accepting . But apparently they are unwilling , or they will be if they refuse his invitation , to commit themselves even to their own scheme . If they desire that the state of " smothered war " which has for so long been the relation of Ireland and England shall continue , such a refusal is a very likely way of attaining the object . But if they mean to make peace they can make it only on terms that will be accepted by the present or some subsequent House of Commons , and the first step toward securing such terms is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition when its representatives were either unable or unwilling to tell explicitly what it wanted .
