txt The brokers have been watching with interest to see what position the State would take in regard to the results of the Treasury investigation . In order to hold ex-State Treasurer Burke for issuing the bonds supposed to have been destroyed , the State would have had to acknowledge them of value , and that would nave been good for the bondholders . If , on the other hand , the State maintained that the bonds were annulled and worthlesd , that would have been , good for Burke . But the State has steered clear of both dilemmas and found other transactions upon which to hold the ex-Treasurer . Attorney-General Rogers to-day served notice on the Times-Democrat Company to return to the State $1,640 received in checks from the State Treasurer for payment of alleged coupons and paid . out of interest funds of 1880 and 1881 . A. similar notice was served on J. H. McCormick , an fild bookkeeper in the Times-Democrat office , to return $10.120 , and upon Maurice J. Hart to pay back $30,760 . There is something startling about these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not give full particulars for obvious reasons . In the Hart transaction the money was paid over without a single coupon being filed , Mr. Burke simply drawing his cheek . The McCormick transaction is on a different line . That gentleman says that he never owned or saw a bond or coupon in his lite and knows nothing of the matter . although he admits that when Major Burke asked him to indorse checks he did so . The check for the payment of the $10,000 was indorsed in this way . To offset it , several packages of alleged coupons were deposited in the Treasury and marked with Mr. McCormick 's name in a handwriting which , Mr. Rogers says , is that of Burke . Inside of the packages the coupons proved to be nothing but strips of blotting paper . The latest advices from Major Burke say that he will leave on the Etruria to-morrow . If he does come to New-York he will be apprehended , because it is likely that the Grand Jury will find indictments early next week . Witnesses have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Criminal Court will charge the grand inquest on Tuesday . Several boxes supposed to contain blank constitutional bonds were found in the branch depository of the State National Bank . marked as belonging to Gov . MoEnery . Tho information of their finding was the first knowledge Gov. aleEnery had of their exigtenee . Auditor Steele and Treasurer Pipes will be here to-morrow , and the boxes will be opened by them and an inventory taken . They will have their official report ready by that time , and it is expected to furnish more disclosures . Major E. A. Burke of New-Orleans , ex-Treasurer of the State of Louisiana . will sail for the United States on the Etruria to-morrow . He says that he has no knowledge of the charges that have been made or of the present situation at New-Orleans , except such as have been conveyed to him in a few brief cable dispatches . These , however , have determined him to hasten home in order to meet at once any question that may arise touching the administration of the office of State Treasurer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of the period that he held office , he said to-night , his time and attention were almost wholly absorbLd in - the work of the International Exposition at New-Orleans During all this time the affairs of the State Treasurer 's office were left almost entirely in the hands of men in whom he had absolute confidence . At the time when he surrendered this office , an exhaustive inquiry into its administration was made by a legislative committee , aided by experts from Eve banks and from the commercial agencies of R. G. Dun &; Co. and bradstreet 's . The report of this committee . issued in July . 1887 , makes the position of the coupons perfectly clear . Major . Burke em-phasized the fact that it was at his special request that the committee of inquiry examined singly every coupon that had been paid . He denies that ho ever paid any invalid coupons . A small number of coupons , lie declares , were put aside and were never paid . These are now in his . possesSion and Will snow for themSelves . If it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Louisana in any way .
