txt On Saturday morning , when the members of the Merchants ' Exchange read that the Transportation Committee had passed on a bill supplemental to the InterState Commerce law , and instructed the manager of the Freight Bureau to present it to the State Railroad Commissioners , and urge them to present it to the Legislature for passage , a petition was signed by many , asking that so important a matter be laid before the Exchange previous to being sent to Albany . There seems to be some misunderstanding as to the committee 's action , but at any rate the Trustees will first consider the bill . Its title is " An act to prevent extortion or discrimination in the rates charged for the transportation of freight and passengers on railroads and railways in this State , and to punish the same . " It provides that no railroad in this State shall charge or receive for the transportation of any passenger or freight for any distance within this State the same or a greater compensation than is at the same time charged or received for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like quantity of freight over a greater distance of the same railroad . The same provision applies to receiving , handling , or delivering freight of the same class and quantity at different points , and also to the receiving , handling , or delivering of freight at the same point for different persons . Railroads shall have but one price for private persons , companies , or corporations for transPortatiou from the same point and for equal distances for the same quantity and class of freight , and they shall not charge or receive for the use and transportation of any railroad car or cars upon their roads a greater or higher rate of toll or compensation than they shall at the same time charge , collect , or receive from any other person or persons , for the use and transportation of any railroad car or cars , of the same class or number , for a like purpose , being transported from the same point in the same direction , over an equal distance of the same railroad ; nor shall any such railroad company make any such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means of any rebate , drawback , shift , or evasion calculated to evade the provisions of this act . Within six months of the passage of this act the Railroad Commissioners shall make for each of the railroad corporations doing business in this State a schedule of reasonable maximum rates of charges tor the transportation of freight and cars on each or said railroads , which shall not be exceeded . These schedules may be revised at any time by the Commissioners . Provision is made for the publication of these schedules , and their receipt in suits at law . A penalty of $5,000 for each offense is provided for the violation of any provision , and any one suffering through such violation may recover three times the damage sustained . The provisions of this act shall extend and apply to any railroad or railway and the branches thereof , and any road or roads which any railroad or railway corporation has the right , license , or permission to use , operate , or control , wholly or in part , within this State , but nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad corporations from issuing commutation , excursion , or - thousand-mile " tickets as the same are now issued oy such corporations .
