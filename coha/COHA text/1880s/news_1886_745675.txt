txt The'House took a very sensible course yesterday in adopting without dissent Mr. HANSACK 'S resolution empowering the Committee on Expenditures in the Department of Justice to inquire into " any expenditure on the part of the Government relative to the rights of the Bell and Pan Electric Telephone Companies . " Partly through the persistent efforts of the Bell Company to sustain a dangerously weak case ? by misrepresentation and a fog of unfounded statements , and partly through the importance which properly belongs to it , the subject has become one of great interest , and the public is entitled to a full knowledge of what its servants have done in response to the demand for an inquiry into the status of the Bell patents . But the publication of the figures showing expenditures in the Department of Justice will reach only in an indirect way the root of the Pan Electric scandal . It will probably be found that there have been no expenditures which might not have been made not only with perfect propriety but without criticism or remark by an Attorney-General who never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House might more surely reach the offenders in this case by passing a r esolu- - tion expressing its opinion that a person who accepts as a gift while in Congress or in the service of the Government large or small quantities of the stock of a corporation is deserving of censure , and that the ownership of such stock should disqualify him from serving in any office in which he would be liable to be called upon to take official action upon questions involving the rights or privileges of the corporation in which he was interested . The Senate would be mightily incensed by such a resolution , but we do not see how the shameless greed of United States Senators is to be properly rebuked unless by the House . Mr. GARLAND and Senator HARRIS can do something to clear themselves by publicly burning their Pan Electric stock . But a Congressional vote of censure would add a deserved and wholesome public rebuke to the prickings of their private consciences.                    @
