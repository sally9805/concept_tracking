txt In the star route trial to-day , the remainder of the ddcumentary evidence relating to the route from Ojo Caliente to Parrott City , was put in , and the examination of the sub-contractor , Anthony Joseph , was begun . The first sub-contractor was J. H. Watts , and he failed . Joseph began work on the route on Jan. 1 , 1879 , six months after the beginning of the contract term , and threw up his contract on Aug. 25 , 1879 . The running time was reduced to 50 hours on May 12 , 1879 , and at the same time the number of trips was increased to three a week . These changes raised the pay from $1,639 per annum to $13,413 . The examination concerning this route has thus far been directed to three points  --  the evidence that the several defendants were interested in the service , the fraudulent nature of the sworn statement which governed the pay for expedition , and the impossibility of carrying the mails through in 50 hours . In support of the first point it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first quarter from John W. Dorsey ; that he made a sub-contract with John W. Dorsey and M. C. Reraell ; that Miner wrote to him about the service on behalf of John W. Dorsey , and that Stephen W. Dorsey wrote to him several times about it and paid him for his last quarter . Among the letters was one from Stephen W. Dorsey inclosing a form of petition and asking Joseph to get signatures for increase of service . The sworn statement of John NV . Dorsey concerning expedition was as follows : Wesmxtrrox , D. C. , April 23. 1879 . The Hon. Thomas J. Brady , becond Arm slant Poetmaster-General : Siit : The number of men and animals necessary to carry the mail on route No. 38,145. on the present schedule and three trips a week . Is 5 men and 15 animals . The number necessary on a schedule of 60 hours , three times a week , is 12 men and 42 animals . JOHN W. DORSEY . This was sworn to on April 26 before a notary public . According to this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the proportion of 20 to ** swore to-day that on Jan. 1 , with one trip , he used three men and six horses ; that in February he added one trip and used six men and nine horses , and that after he put on three trips , and tried to carry the mails in 50 hours , he used 11. men and 27 horses , although ho had a herd of other horses out of which he frequently renewed his stock . While the evidence thus far on this point is not so conclusive as in the other routes , it shows that the sworn statement was an arbitrary one , having little if any direct relation to the facts . Joseph received in all for his eight months ' work less than $500 . For his last quarter he was paid $109 by Stephen W. Dorsey at the latter 's ranch , and he testified that the ox-Senator told him that failures to perform service on the fast schedule bad eaten the pay by fines , so that he had received nothing and therefore could not pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a remission of the fines for Joseph 's benefit . Testimony was taken to show that , owing to the roughness of the country and the absence of bridges , the fast time could not be made . The drivers could not go by night , because the swollen streams forced them to go up into the mountains until they reached spots where they could be Lorded . There was a contest over a missing letter , said by Joseph to have been sent to him by Stephen W. Dorsey before Jan. 1 , 1879 . Joseph was at last allowed to repeat the substance of its contents . In it Stephen W. Dorsey had urged him to take hold of the work on Jan. 1 , 1879 , and had said that be would be personally responsible for the pay . This was before the sub-contract was made . The prosecution evidently desired to put in the letter , to show at how early a day Stephen W. Dorsey , then in the Senate , was interested in the route . It having been shown that the Postmasters and others bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mails in 50 hours , the witness was asked to say whether or not it was impossible at that time . He replied that it was impossible to do it from April to August , 1879 , but before the answer was admitted there was argument in support of the objection made by the defense , and the ruling of the court was peculiarly significant as touching the subject of conspiracy . The defense held that Brady could not be bound by the contents of any letter addressed to him by the Postmasters or others , setting forth that the costly expedition could not be performed , or by statements made to him by sub-contractors to the same effect . " The notice , " said Judge Wylie , " put him on inquiry , and he must be bound not only by the statements in the notice , if they are true , but also as to such further facts as he might find by the inquiry which he ought to make . If ; it should be proved here that a fifty-hour schedule was one which a contractor could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it cost an unnecessary sum , then , I think , although he might have had a great deal of business is his office to attend to , this expedition might be judged to have been made in bad faith , because before making an order involving great expense he ought to have made inquiry , and if he found that the additional work proposed was too great , the safest way for him would have been to do nothing . If the expedition had already been ordered when he was put on inquiry , then it ought not to have been continued . " This seems to be an important ruling , affecting the position taken by the defense that Brady can not be held responsible for his expedition orders because they were petitioned for . The protest made by the Postmasters and sub-contractor in this case is dated in New-Mexico , April 29 , 1879 , or 18 days before the expedition was ordered , but is stamped as having been received by the department on May 31 , or 19 days after the order took effect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written as soon as the petitions for faster time began to be circulated , and were sent to and received by the department before the orders were made .
