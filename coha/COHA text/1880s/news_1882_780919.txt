txt Many weeks-ago , with something of a flourish , the Stalwart members of Congress and Stalwart visitors in . Washington frem New-York proclaimed it about the capital that Secretary Folger was to be the Republican candidate for Governor of New-York in the coming Fall esmtpaign . This announcement may have been made simply for effect . If it was , it was approved in high places and was talked of with great earnestness by men who seldom make political announcements concerning New-York State for the idle pleasure of observing the manner in which those announcements will be received . At the time that his name was first mentioned as that of a candidate , Secretary Folger was asked if he had authorized his friends to make use of his name . The Secretary did not seem to be surprised to hear his name mentioned in that way , nor did manifest any special de-light or any desire to talk about it . Looking up calmly from his desk , he replied : " That is a subject upon which I prefer not to converse at this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rule , the suggestion that Mr. Folger should be the candidate was received cordially . With a few it was received timidly , and by one or two it met with prompt and emphatic disapproval . The Folger boom was kept going for , perhaps , a week , when it appeared to have been abandoned . The men who had been most enthusiastic about it said that it was only in abeyance . Judging from the indications to be found here , and from the uncertain sound given forth by the New-York Stalwarts , the question of a candidate has been lost sight of , and the rallying cry has resolved itself into anything to beat Cornell . W hen the proposition to make Mr. Folger the candidate was fust heard , it was admitted by all politicians who had anything to say about it that Gov . Cornell would be a powerful adversary to overcome , and that unless it could be plainly seen that the State Convention could be induced to concentrate upon another , a man who would be approved by both wings of the party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican vote , it would be almost useless to think of attempting to prevent Cornell from obtaining the nomination . The course of events soon made it doubtful whether an Administration candidate would be any stronger in the State tor being known only as a thick and thin Administration man . The Stalwarts began to find out that there was a wheel within a wheel  --  that the old Stalwart lines of a year ago were broken , and that while nearly all the half-breeds had gone over to Cornell , some of the Stalwarts who had been his friends indicated an intention to cast their lot with that very lucky politician . A fortnight ago there was a promise of a revolution  --  a " shake-up , " as the boys called it  --  that was to change the political conditions in New-York State most profoundly . Men who had been complaining because the President and Secretary Folger were too slow , bemuse they did not have any policy , and because Mr. Folger , particularly , was too judicial , congratulated each other that , with the adjourning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry bones that would convince everybody that there was a new Administration , and that it was not halfbreed . As one of the enthusiastic and expectant Stalwarts put it , the President went to New-York , after deciding to remove two half-breeds at Albany , and he came back . The Albany half-breeds were replaced by Stalwarts , and then the music stopped . It is to speak only feebly to say that there is disappointment here  --  a feeling akin to that which a boy might feel who had gone to see Jumbo and been obliged to go home with only a glimpse of the baby elephant . There has been a promise of great things , a candidate bas been put forth , music was to be made , and there has been only one inefficient toot , and now there is an undertone of complaint not altogether unlike a wail of submission to fate , or superior luck , and a disposition to wait and see something happen . Having used Mr. Folger 's name for a brief space , the Stalwarts find that it will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first instance , he was labeled as an Administration candidate and trotted out to be given as a dose of medicine . Then , before he had been asked his pleasure in the matter , he was apparently dropped , and the Stalwarts seemed to have gone on a fishing excursion for a candidate . if you sound a Stalwart to-day , the chances are that in reply to your- question , " Who 's to be nominated for Governor ' - " he will answer that he does n't know . Draw him on to talk , and he will declare that he considers Folger to be out of the question , and that the best thing to do will be to unite on some strong man aczeptable to both factions . To some this strong man is the Hon. John H. Starin . The Administration men admire him . The men who are out and out for Cornell say " No ; we 'd rather have Folger . " Then these uncertain Stalwarts have cast about for another strong man acceptable to both factions , and they suggest the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor . The danger will be that it will become too popular with the Cornell Stalwarts and excite the fear that the gain will be too much on the Cornell side . Mr. Albert Daggett , who has just left this city , having tarried for a week after his weighing contract expired in the hope of saving it at the last moment , is warm for the Wadsworthproject and wants to couple the nomination of Wadsworth for Governor with that of Mayor Seth Low for Lieutenant-Governor . He left here for home with the avowed determination of making a tour through the State to prepare the lienublicans for such a ticket , or anything to beat the Administration candidates . While Secretary Folger will not talk about this subject to correspondents , and has only treated the mention of his name in connection with the nomination as a pleasant jest , there is reason to believe that the unwisdom of the Stalwart method of conducting the canvass , or rather of neglecting to make a canvass , has annoyed him . He knows a good deal more about politics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way to do it , than some of the men about him . No one knows better than he that Cornell can not be beaten by threatened shake-ups . To a man who has been so long in political life in NewYork State as ho has been it is as plain as the ? ars on a mule that if a man is to be a candidate he must look about to find him friends and to give those who are not his friends reasons why they should support him rather than somebody else . lklr . Folger knows that while the Stalwarts are idle , there is much work ; being done for a candidate who will not be the choice of the Administration men . It has been stated here recently that the Secretary of the Treasury has expressed an opinion that any man who is put before the people of New-York State as the Administration candidate will be handicapped . If he could have been the choice of the convention , even in a contest , without making that contest as a Stalwart of the Stalwarts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to receive the nomination . As it is , there is good reason for believing that he would prefer to wave ? Attila , balance of iris term as Secretary of the Treasury , rather than be used as the figure-head in a personal fight against Gov . Cornell.
