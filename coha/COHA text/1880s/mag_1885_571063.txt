ARTICLE IJi-WILLISTON SEMINARY. * EAcH of the larger endowed Academies of New England is fortunate in its location . The wide prospect from Andover Hill is suggestive of the world-wide fame of the school ; and the lovely elm-shaded park , in which stand the buildings of the Theological Seminary and the Church where the members of the Academy worship , is a hardly less peaceful and charming scholar 's retreat than one of the college-gardens of Oxford and Cambridge . Phillips Exeter seems to have found a fitting abode in the wealthy , aristocratic , New Hampshire county-seat . St. Paul 's School , the most prominent of the younger academies , enjoys the seclusion and independence of a pleasant New England farm , and is yet within easy reach , by a country drive of unusual beauty , of Concord , the capital of New Hampshire . Williston Seminary is not less favored as regards situation . It is at Springfield that the Connecticut River begins to ex. change the somewhat monotonous beauty of the fertile meadows which border the lower portion of its course for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White Mountains . The twenty miles from Springfield to Northampton are full of pleasant surprises . First comes the great dam at Holyoke , which would of itself repay a pilgrimage , in a country less abounding in waterfalls than our own . Then , as the train winds its way along the western border of the stream , the sawtooth outline of the summits of Mt . Holyoke and the majestic mass of Mt . Tom become the prominent objects in view . Of these twin heights , Mt . Tom is the more lofty , reaching an elevation of more than 1200 feet . Directly west of Mt . Tom and less than three miles from the Connecticut River , lies l*asthampton , the site of Wilhiston Seminary . * The following may be mentioned as sources of additional information to those who desire to follow out more minutely the history of the school : 1 . Annual Catalogues of Williston Seminary since 1842. 2 . Historical Discourse by Professor W. S. Tyler , and Oration by Professor Cyrus Northrop , delivered at the Quarter Century Celebration of Williston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Williston , by Professor W. S Tyler , 1874. 4 .

Pomeroy . The two hills , Mt . Tom and Mt . Pomeroy , of nearly equal height , and enclosing the town on the east and west , dignify Easthampton , and give it a character of its own . They have , too , such an effect upon the air that visitors uniformly suppose that the town is situated upon a considerable elevation . The present population of the place somewhat exceeds 4,000 . Easthampton furnishes a remarkable example of the union of manufacturing and agricultural activity . Nowhere else is the New England farmer of the genuine type better represented . Industrious , shrewd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religions , the farmers of the vicinity are men of a superior order who do much to maintain a conservative and somewhat severe public sentiment . The natural thinness of the soil is more than compensated for by the ease with which it is cultivated and by the excellent and accessible market which the manufacturing industries have created . Farming has continued to be profitable and sons are content to till the acres of their fathers . On the other hand , the manufacturing enterprises , with scarcely an exception , have been prosperous . They have yielded large returns to their stockholders and have furnished well-nigh uninterrupted employment , even during the most depressed times . There is to be found then at Easthampton a substantial and prosperous farming community and , combined with this , that bustle and activity which successful , well-established manufacturing is needed to supply . Half a century ago Easthampton was a purely agricultural village . It was chiefly inhabited by the Lymans , Clapps , and Wrights , and was sometimes derisively called by the people of Northampton , of which it was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frugality and religiousness of its inhabitants . Its minister was the Rev. Payson Williston ( Y. C. 1783 ) , a native of North Haven , Conn. , where his father , the Rev. Noah Williston ( Y. C. 1757 ) had been minister . Among his sons was one , Samuel , born in 1795 , who , after having been compelled by weakness of the eyes , which continued through life , to relinquish a course of study begun at Andover preparatory to college , finally settled in his native town . Here he tried school teaching and farming , meeting many discouragements in both . He married when only 27 , the noble wife who still sur // vives him and whose continued presence in her 88th year is a constant benediction to the village which has so long been her home . In a way not without romantic interest , Mr. Williston was led to initiate in the United States the manufacture of covered buttons , first by hand labor and since 1835 by machine power . Though the beginnings of this industry were the most modest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competence and future wealth of its projector was soon assured . Mr. Williston never forgot his original desire to be a minister , nor that consecration to the highest aims which the choice of this calling implies . While intensely fond of making money and laborious and self-denying to the extreme to this end , he had an equally strong sense of his stewardship of all that he had acquired , and an abiding desire to use for God 's glory and the good of mankind the wealth which flowed in upon him . As early as 1837 , when the last two of his five children , all of whom died in infancy or early childhood , were sick , he set apart a considerable sum to be applied to the service of his fellow-men . What its destination should be , was not at first clear in his mind , but personal preference and the counsel of friends finally led him to found , equip , and gradually endow , in his native town , the Classical and Scientific Academy which bears his name . Williston Seminary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preceding , a series of articles had appeared in the Hampshire Gazette , setting forth the advantage to the towns of Hampshire County of a well-equipped academy and foreshadowing the probability of such a foundation in the near future . The author of these articles was Professor W. S. Tyler , of Amherst College , then hardly thirty years old , and already the trusted friend and counselor of Mr. Williston in the disposition of his wealth . Nor was this service of Professor Tyler 's his last to the school . He has been , from that day to this , constantly interested in its welfare , has shrunk from no duty which its interests required of him , and has had great influence in shaping its development . May its prosperity and increasing usefulness be such as to repay all his thought and devotion ! The first Principal of the School was the Rev. Luther Wright ( Y. C. I 822 ) , a native of Easthampton . He had had much experience in teaching , and came to Williston from Leicester Academy , where he had been Principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character and an efficient schoolmaster of the last generation . Among his associates in these early years // were men of such mark as the Rev. Dr. Richard S. Storrs of Brooklyn , and the Rev. Dr. E. K. Alden of Boston , Secretary of the A. B. C. F. M. Pupils of both sexes were at first received , as was then usual in New England academies . The largest number of young ladies in attendance during any one year was one hundred and eighty-seven . During 1864 , the last year during which girls were received , the number was fifty-four . The number of names of boys and girls in the first catalogue was one hundred and ninety-one , and the total rose in the year 1846 to five hundred and forty-two . This rapid increase shows how warmly the school commended itself to the public ; and it is also apparent that , with a teaching force of only four or five , the classes could not have been carefully graded nor any very systematic training secured . The attendance must have been very fluctuating . Scholars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were able , but the school consisted mostly of serious-minded young men and young women , who were received as boarders in most of the farmers* homes ( there were then no dormitories ) , and who enlivened the village by their presence . During the first five years of the school 's existence , 95 per cent . of the attendance was from New England , and 60 per cent . from Hampshire County . But about 1845 began the development of the High Schools under the leadership of Horace Mann . This lessened the local patronage , and the rising prestige of Mt . Holyoke Female Seminary diminished the number of young lady pupils . It became apparent that the school had served its purpose as a local benefactor ; it was now to seek and gain a national reputation . Mr. Wright was succeeded in 1849 by the Rev. Josiah Clark ( Y. C. 1833 ) . Mr. Clark combined many of the qualifications which must be found in a successful Principal . No American teacher has gained a deeper hold upon the tenderest affection of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conscientious industry , of deep , though quiet , enthusiasm . Earnest , self-denying , humble , deeply religious , he pervaded by the influence of his personal character the whole great school , ruling it through the loyalty and admiring affection of his Senior Class . His was a lovely character . He had a feminine delicacy and diffidence . All boisterousness and self-assertion was foreign to his nature . Doubtless he failed to impress himself strongly upon the coarser characters ; but he left an indelible impress upon the nobler natures and he drew such boys in great numbers to the school . The proportion of graduates of Williston , between the years 1850 // and 1864 , who have gained . Hue regrediendum est unde egressi sumus . " To these principles , so far as we have abandoned them , must we return . " At the close of Mr. Clark 's administration , the remarkable statement was made that the fourteen classes , which graduated under his principalship , had furnished to Yale , Williams , and Amherst , ten Valedictorians , eight Salutatorians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , throughout Mr. Clarke 's administration , an interval of three years excepted , there stood by his side as associate-principal , Mr. Eli A. Hubbard , a man of great nprightness of character and an able teacher . The value of his services at the head of the English Department of this school and later as a member of the State Board of Education has been universally recognized . Mr. Clark withdrew from the school in 1864 , in the very height of his usefulness , and Dr. Marshall Henshaw , at that time Professor of Physics in Rutgers College , but previously an efficient head of Dummer Academy at Byefield , Mass. , was appointed his successor . Dr. Henshaw proved himseW during his administration of twelve years , a most laborious worker . He gave his entire devotion by day and by night , in term and in vacation , to the school . He was a graduate of Amherst College , in the class of 1845 . An accurate scholar , his vigorous mind turned with equal ease and interest to the classics and to science . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Greek and Latin , was rigorons and effective . He was also a remarkably clear and successful lecturer on Physics . Mr. Williston had always felt a stronger interest in the scientific side of the school than in the classical , and Dr. Henshaw won his way to his entire confidence by working earnestly for the development of this department . The English course was extended , additional teachers were engaged , and the English scholars equalled in number those of the classical course . These were the years immediately succeeding the war . There was then in the country a large number of young men whose patriotism had interrupted their education , and who , when their term of service in the army had expired , felt that it was too late to complete , or to attempt , the college course which might have been their original choice . To such a course which did not demand extensive preparation and which could be speedily completed was most welcome . Their experiences in the war had taught them sobriety , self-reliance and // obedience , and they gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the scientific department in the years between 1865 and 1870 . Mr. Williston died in 1874 . The last industrial enterprise of his life , the erection of the Williston Thread Mills , was his only unsuccessful one , and reduced the amount of his property by at least a million dollars . He is said to have regretted this loss most keenly because his plans of beneficence to Amherst College and to Williston Seminary were thereby curtailed . It will be proper to state at this point , as briefly as possible , exactly what were Mr. Williston 's benefactions to the school which bears his name . He kept , from the first , a careful account of all sums expended in behalf of the school , and it is interesting to note in the successive catalogues , the gradually increasing capital invested . Up to 1864 , the date of IVIr . Clark 's resignation , Mr. Williston 's gifts were estimated by himself at $140,000 . By the close of 1875 , shortly before his death , the entire outlay upon buildings , equipment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's final bequests were as follows : ( 1. ) $200,000 was to be paid over , on the settlement of the estate , to the endowment fund of the school . ( 2. ) $50,000 was to be immediately invested as an accumulating fund until it should reach the sum of $100,000 . A part was then to be applied to the erection of a new building to contain a School-Chapel , a Library with Reading Room , and Physical , Chemical and Mineralogical Cabinets . Of the remainder , $20,000 was appropriated to the equipment of the scientific cabinets and the purchase of books for the Library ; $15,000 was to be set aside as a Fund , the income of which was to be used for the increase of the library and the improvement of the cabinets ; $30,000 was to be reserved as a charity fund for the aid of worthy students in need . ( 3. ) $150,000 was to pass to the Seminary upon the death of Mrs. Williston , but was not to be available as income-yielding until it should accumulate to $300,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $250,000 . This with the $270,000 previously mentioned brings Mr. Williston 's entire liberality to the institution to a total of more than half-a-million dollars , not including the accumulating fund of $i50,000 hereafter to be received . The $50,000 , the second bequest , was immediately placed at // interest and the time is approaching when it will be available for the purposes specified . The complete settlement of the estate proved so difficult , owing to the embarrassments of the Williston Mills , that the *2OO , OOO the first bequest , was not paid over until 1883. * During the administration of each of the first three Principals Mr. Williston was always conspicuous as the power behind the throne . He had a keen sense of his proprietorship in the school . He was its Patron , present on public occasions , addressing the boys whenever any school difficulty arose , visibly and actively intervening as he judged fit . The Trustees were simply his advisers , the Principal of the school was his agent . To this intervention all the Principals adapted themselves with greater or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he fully sympathized with Mr. Williston 's views . On the death of Mr. Williston , the Board of Trustees acquired a new prominence , and , impressed by the magnitude of the money-trust which they expected immediately to administer , began to concern themselves more closely with the conduct of the school . Dr. Henshaw found it difficult to adapt himself to this policy , and by his own resignation terminated his administration in 18Th . In the same year that brilliant classical scholar Dr. J. M. Whiton ( Y. C. 1853 ) was appointed principal , resigning in 18Th . Dr. Whiton was succeeded by Dr. J. W. Fairbanks , a graduate of Amherst College in the class of 1866 . Dr. Fairbanks resigned in 1884 . The preceding resum6 of the history of Williston Seminary was essential in order to give an idea of the vicissitudes through which the school has passed and of the conditions which surround it in the present . It remains to describe the work to which the school desires henceforth to devote itself ; to outline its facilities for doing this work well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school-life and school organization , and to suggest certain directions in which expansion and improvement may be hoped in the future . The scope of the Article , as well as the writer 's relation to the school , will impose manifest limits in treating of some of these subjects . It will have been apparent that Williston Seminary in the first stage of its existence under Principal Wright was essentially a great rural academy , differing from other country schools only * The entire income of the school from invested funds during the current year ls $13,600 . This is exclusive of the amount received for tuition and room-rent. // in the age and maturity of its scholars and in the ability and acquirements of some of its teachers . With Mr. Clark came suddenly the era of its eminence , in a more than local field , as a classical fitting-school ,  --  one comparable in all respects with the Exeter or the Andover of that period , whose honored heads , Drs . Soule and Taylor , were not superior in Christian courtesy , scholarship , or power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in connection with the school an English department and an exceptionally well administered one , but the successes of the school were measured by the achievements of its classical graduates . The English side was after all only an appendage . With the administration of Dr. Henshaw was inaugurated an earnest attempt , while sacrificing nothing of the reputation which the Academy had gained as a classical school , to superadd a completely organized Scientific Department of high excellence , and to this end the strong wills of Mr. Williston and Dr. ilenshaw were unitedly bent and for this object money was unstintedly expended . The ten years which have passed since Mr. Williston 's death have been years of transition . In them , as in all periods of rei*djustment and reconstruction , much energy and effort has been expended without visible result and many hopes which seemed reasonable have been disappointed or deferred . This period has now , we trust , ended and several things are now settled . First . A financial basis adequate for the present operations and future development of the school is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the special work to which it will devote itself are fixed . It will be an institution of secondary instruction , and will restrict its activity to the preparation of boys and young men , in the best manner possible , for the academic or scientific college or for business . This recognition of its work as distinctly secondary involves the abandonment of a plan which lay very near to Mr. Williston 's heart , that of creating , out of the Scientific Department , an English College with President and Professors . Had his prosperity continued to the close of his life he would without doubt have set apart sufficient money to carry such a project into execution and the result would perhaps have been an additional would-be college , attempting an indefinite work for which there was no real demand and competing with older institutions for its pupils . Could Mr. Williston have foreseen // the increase in the number of technical schools and the wide range of study now offered in the courses of our colleges , he would perhaps have modified his own original plan . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effort of those who are charged with the administration of his gifts must be so to use them as will be productive of the greatest good ,  --  thus fulfilling the spirit if not the letter of his instructions . Thirdly . The organization of the school in two coordinate departments , and the general plan of study in each may be regarded as settled . There will of course be modifications in details . The shorter , or three-years , course of study in the Classical Department will be abandoned as soon as arrangements can be made which shall secure , in cottages controlled by the school , that home-care suitable to the age of boys who are commencing at its lowest stage a four-years course of preparation for college . In a lengthened course more time can be given to the early stages of mathematical study , especially to Algebra  --  and to the Modern Languages . It is desired particularly to emphasize , henceforth , the quality of the mathematical training of classical graduates . The reputation of the whole Scientific Department demands this . In the Scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularly in pursuing simultaneously the studies of different classes , will be abridged . Thus greater stability will be given to the scientific classes and membership in them will be more highly valued . it seems desirable , too , that a larger proportion of the scientific graduates should study at least one language-be it Latin , German , or French-other than their native tongue . Williston occupies a unique position among the large endowed schools as respects the development of its scientific department . Other schools have gained an equal reputation as nurseries of classical scholarship . Other schools have offered in an English course opportunities of instruction in Mathematics , the elements of Natural Science , History and Literature , to those who have not wished to prepare for the Academic College . But in all such eases , at least until very recently , the reputation of the school has rested almost wholly upon the achievements of the classical graduates . The English course has been merely an appendage to the school . At Williston , on the other hand , there has been for twenty years a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extent even to create the demand for , a course of Scientific and English training sufficiently rigorous and exact to // confer mental sharpness and vigor , sufficiently broad to give mental expansion , and withal sufficiently brief to deliver over its graduates into the practical callings before the taste and aptitude for manual labor should be seriously impaired by advancing years . The aim of the school at present is to maintain courses of classical and scientific study of equal length *nd each of a high degree of merit , on a parity with each other . A constant difficulty thus far has lain in the inferior advantages of early instruction and home training enjoyed by our scientific boys . No miracles can be wrought of course , and inferiority at the outset will be followed by a corresponding inferiority at the close of the course . A beginning has been made this year in raising the qualifications for admission , and the work of the lowest class has been increased . Stricter grading , greater permanence in the teaching force , and consequent increased dignity and stability in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composite organization of Williston Seminary ( with its two co*5rdinate departments ) increases the difficulty of its management . Success will only be possible through identity of methods of instruction and equality in the standard of proficiency demanded , in both departments . It is also essential that those entrasted with the conduct of the school should have sufficient breadth of view to recognize that different minds require different systems of training and should enter with interest and sympathy into Mr. Williston 's hopes for both Departments . Much can indeed be said in favor of bringing two such courses side by side on equal terms . Given equal exactions and equal thoroughness in both courses , and each side of the school may be expected to learn much from the other . The classical boys who are not destined to commence so early the struggle for daily bread , may gain some valuable lessons from the young men of more practical bent , for whom the scientific department was founded . The scientific scholars should be the gainers from association with those who enjoy the literary training and the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give . A warm recognition of the claims , both of the ancient and the modern world , should characterize the graduates of the Williston Seminary . To the general public it will probably always be a recommendation of the school that it affords complete courses of classical and scientific study in separate departments . Many parents who design to send their // 50fl5 to business or to a technical school , would yet be glad that the boys should enjoy association with those of their own age who are studying Latin and Greek , if at the same time they are taught the fundamental studies with unexcelled thoroughness . Fourthly. - It will perhaps be expected that the general policy of Williston Seminary in regard to what may be called school management , should be outlined and that a few words should be said as to the relation desired between teachers and scholars . There is little danger that the need of authority on the one side and of obedience on the other should be overlooked , especially since the school is situated in a manufacturing community of masters and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it would be a sad mistake to compare a school to a factory , or to suppose that methods which may produce buttons and thread suffice for the education of men . It must always be borne in mind that , however necessary prohibitions and measures of repression may sometimes be , they constitute but a small part of school management , are purely negative in their influence , and can never create character . A prominent feature of any really successful policy must be that it supplies that stimulus to right conduct which comes from personal influence , persuasion , and helpful sympathy . The main influences upon which the good order and successful work of a school depends are rigid exaction of the severe intellectual effort which of itself precludes the possibility , as it usually removes the desire , of dissipation ; quiet , but prompt and unfailing , attention to the beginnings of wrongdoing in individuals ; and thoughtful precaution which removes out of the way in advance whatever might disturb the quiet tenor of school activity . Most impressive to a scholar who comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the mechanism of a large school operates . He delights to participate as a conscious factor in the movement of the great whole , while he feels at the same time his own littleness and glows with admiration for the school . It is , after all , the school which educates the boy and to the influence of which he yields himself to the fullest extent . The teachers , then , must put into the life of the school what they expect the boys to take from it . Perfect straightforwardness in all dealings with boys and genuine interest in their welfare will always secure the confidence which boys are glad to give , and will bring the opportunity of suggesting and outlining to the // better boys those standards of what is becoming the school , which shall in time prevail , and which , once accepted , any boy would sooner cut off his right hand than disregard . Affection for the school can be appealed to almost without limit and , if the appeal be made in an honest and manly way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made to feel that they and their friends are most deeply concerned in the prosperity of the school , and that they are its natural guardians and defenders quite as truly and often more efficiently than teachers and trustees can be . They may be frankly and truly told that as they are inheritors of a noble past , so they should be the architects of a yet nobler future . Their sense of proprietorship once aroused , it will be found that they will welcome any innovation , any reasonable added labor or new exaction , if only they are persuaded that the aim and tendency of these things is to render the school more worthy of themselves and their friends . And when such feelings have been touched and begin to grow , will a boy expose himself to the forfeiture of the privileges to which as a member of the organism he has the title ? Among the institutions belonging to the boys most characteristic of Williston Seminary must be mentioned the Debating Societies of the classical and scientific departments . The school possesses in the Adelphi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auxiliary of which it is proud . Founded about 1850 and for many years the only debating society in the school , the Adeiphi has always been conducted with great spirit and interest and it is perhaps the best school debating society in the United States . Its members are mainly from the two upper classes in the classical department-often every Senior becomes an Adelphian ,  --  and its meetings are held on Friday evenings . The literary exercises , which are entirely public , are attended by many members of the school who have not joined the society and who avail themselves of the exemption from study hours which is conceded on Friday evenings for that purpose , so that there is usually a good audience to listen to the speaking and to stimulate the debaters to do their best . Attendance and punctuality and decorum are rigidly enforced by fines . Failure to fill appointments is also punished by fines which are so heavy that members do not often * The society of the Scientific Department , the Gamma-Sigma , resembles the Adeiphi so closely in organization , times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one serves also as a description of the other // incur them . The most important exercise is , of course , the Debate , participated in by six previously appointed disputants , by members of the society from the floor , and by non-members who may l ) e present . ( No one can become a member of the society who has not first given proof of his powers by taking part in debate ) . The Oracle , or school-paper , is a spicy account of the events of the week contributed by various hands and containing amusing reports of scholars ' blunders and teachers ' wise and foolish sayings . There follow the Reading at Sight from some English author , the Oration , and lastly the Critique . This last is written during the progress of the exercises of the evening , and is uniformly serious and searching . It extends to the bearing and decisions of the presiding officer , the attitude , gestures , and delivery of the disputants in debate . Friday evenings in the Adelphi are among the brightest experiences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one of the main school-buildings , is large , pleasantly furnished , and well-lighted . It accommodates about one hundred . The boys come together here after the heavy work of the week is done , dressed in their best , and the dignity and propriety which characterize their proceedings on their own ground are the best proof of their essential manliness and love of what is orderly and right . There is no place like this for learning the details of Parliamentary Law . A new President , or a President pro tempore who may not be familiar with Gushing 's Manual , is likely to have his ignorance fully exposed . Everything is done according to Parliamentary form . If a song is wanted , a motion to that effect is gravely made from the floor , and , after having been solemnly entertained by the President , is duly seconded and voted upon . It will be readily seen how strong a stimulus such a debating society supplies to the composition-writing and regular oratorical exercises of the school . During the writer 's connection with Williston Seminary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a composition go by default , and has far more often had to urge upon his classes brevity than greater length . Another institution of the boys ' which might merit a few words of mention is the Wiiistonian , or weekly school paper , an eight page sheet conducted by the Adelphi Society and furnishing a valuable training to its editors . There is , moreover , an Athletic Association managed by a committee consisting of the school-president and of one member // from each of the three upper classes . Mr. Hand , one of the teachers , is the present treasurer . The duty of this association is to look out for the interests of the school in foot-ball and in base-ball , to select and provide for the training of the " elevens " and " nines , " to arrange match games , and to care for the gymnasium . This committee also aids the teacher of gymnastics in arranging for the athletic exhibition at the end of the year . The geographical situation of Williston Seminary can hardly fail to have an important bearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ southerly of the great preparatory schools , and lies not half so far removed from New York as Andover , Exeter , or St. Paul 's . It is surrounded by the colleges to which it sends its pupils-Dartmouth , Williams , Harvard , Amherst , Yale , and Princeton . Its location will always commend it strongly to Southern New England and to the Middle States . Connecticut boys have long resorted here in large numbers , and at the present time twenty-five boys , a sixth of the whole membership of the school , are from Connecticut . A desirable feature of Williston is the relatively large number of its teachers . There are at present nine , who give their whole time to the school . The classes are consequently of moderate size , never exceeding thirty , and the older teachers do not teach on the average more than three hours per day . Their teaching is therefore more effective and they have some opportunity to carry forward their own studies and to serve the school outside of the class-room . Labor in an endowed Academy such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great rewards to a true teacher . The definiteness of the work , its supreme importance , the impressible and interesting period of life at which boys are received , the certainty of gratifying results in school and college if well-understood means are faithfully employed ,  - -  these are the considerations which stimulate to earnest effort . For graduates who contemplate the teacher 's calling I know no better place than a teachership at Williston to test their fitness for the work they have chosen , no larger opportunity of usefulness , no position in which , with all its difficulties and perplexities , they will more certainly find that interest felt is reciprocated , and merit appreciated . The dormitory system has a larger extension at Williston than at the other preparatory schools . There are possible accommodations for one hundred and twenty scholars in the Seminary // halls . The original argument for these dormitories was of course their economy . The evils and dangers attendant upon them are at the present time strongly impressed upon the public and need not be referred to more definitely here . It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not wholly deprecate the influence of dormitory life upon the boys . They believe that , experienced for a year or two in the later part of the course , it usually proves a means of developing self-reliance and of strengthening character . At the same time the general policy which it is hoped the school may adopt is one of distribution . They hope that ere long a considerable portion of the younger boys may be lodged in homes , controlled by the school , and superintended by ladies specially fitted by temperament and by experience for this duty . Whether scholars live in the dormitories or in private houses , it is their conviction that in a school like this considerably greater demands may and should be made in the class-room than would be necessary in a school the scholars of which were living at home . The statement is not too strong that the existence of such a school as this with the unavoidable temptations which beset its pupils is only justified by the exceptionally high character of the training given . It mast attempt and accomplish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it has failed . It might be interesting to indicate the type of character produced at Williston . It will help in doing this to consider from what homes the boys come . They come with few exceptions from religious households , and at the present time a large proportion are boys of slender means who know that they must look to their education to better their condition and whom necessity spurs to effort . A leading trait of the Williston boy is selfreliance-another equally characteristic trait is his democratic spirit . A school more free from exclusiveness or class- or casterule can hardly exist . There is much in the school community that is sound and healthful and that is full of promise for the future . It is pleasant to think of the refining influence which a beautiful new chapel , with all the aid it will give to the daily religions service , will exert , of the stimulus which the new library and scientific cabinets will afford , of the various ways in which the future wants of the school in various directions will be satisfied through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
