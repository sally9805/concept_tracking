txt Since the 30th of June , last year , the public debt of the United States has been reduced $114,834,575 , or , in round numbers , by $115,000,000 , being an average of $11,500 , - 000 per month , and at the rate of $138 , - 000,000 per year . The highest point for the interest-bearing debt of the United States was in August , 1865 , when it stood $2,381,530,295 . The reduction since made is $1,023,715,412 . The annual interest charge in 1865 was $150 , - 977,697 . At the close of ? the fiscal year . 1882 it was but $57,360,110 , and it is now some $4,000,000 less . The lowest rate of . interest paid'in 1865 was 5 per cent. , the highest was 7.3 per cent . ; the average was a little over 6 per cent . ; the lowest rate at present is 3 per cent. , the highest is 3-. , per cent . These figures are sufficiently- striking . They do not indicate the highest wisdom in the management of the national finances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid upon the people has been needlessly heavy on account of the depreciation of the Government notes previous to 1878 , on account of extravagant expenditure , and on account of ill-adjusted Customs duties which have checked many branches of manufacturing industry and produced confusion in others . But the enormous available resources of the country and the capacity of our people to bear without serious difficulty a strain wholly unprecedented in economic history are all the more proved . This fact comes out still more plainly when the history of our debt is compared with that of England . Since 1857 ? 26 years  --  the net reduction of the debt of England has been but $535,000,000 . In his latest budget the Chancellor of the Exchequer announced a project for the further reduction in the next 20 years of $850,000 , - 000 , making for the 46 years an average annual reduction of a little over $30,000,000 . During the 18 years since 1865 the average annual reduction of the debt of the United States has been nearly twice that amount , or over $58,000,000 , while last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or nearly six times the average annual reduction in Great Britain . As bearing on the material condition of the two nations , it must , moreover , be remembered that taxation in Great Britain is far more carefully adjusted than in the United States , and its burden bears more lightly upon the earning capacity of the people . If we compare the financial condition of the United States with that of the other great republic of the world , France , there is a still more striking contrast . France , like the United States , has had to struggle with the burdens of a gigantic war , and though civil war is far more costly than a foreign war , ' even when followed by such loss of territory and such a money indemnity as France had to bear , France is to-day in a far weaker and more insecure position than the United States . The Government is now engaged in the process of refunding a relatively small amount , some $140,000,000 , of the 5 per cent , debt into 41 per cents , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only of the Ministry but of the , republic itself . The debt being very largely held by the smaller tradesmen and peasants , who have put their money into it at various rates of purchase , from 84 per cent . to above par , the loss of one-tenth the annual income , of the bondholders creates the most acute discontent  --  a feeling wholly unnoticed in this country , when ' by a mere administrative act of the Secretary of the Treasury the interest on over a thousand millions of the debt was reduced from 5 per cent. , per cent. , and 4 per cent . to 34- per cent. , a reduction ranging from 124 per cent . to 30 per cent . of the revenue derived from the , bonds . These facts show how very much more closely the French people are compelled to calculate their incomes , and how much more seriously the exactions of the Government affect their comfort and their security . The most important elements of difference in the condition of our ' people and that ' of the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from war and from the necessity of providing for war , and the vast field of undeveloped resources which lies open before us . Setting aside the territory of this country which is relatively untouched , there is in what we usually regard as the developed portion scope for the prosperous industry of our people greater than exists in the United Kingdom and in France combined . The region which 20 years ago was the field of civil war is known to-day to be almost incalculably fertile in the essential elements of material progress . Its agriculture may fairly be said to have but scratched the surface of its soil ; its manufactures are hardly more forward than those of the sea-board Northern States at the opening of the century ; its wealth of coal and metals is practically immeasurable ; its commerce has hardly burst its swaddling-clothes ; the newly awakened energy and ambition , of its people are constantly directed ; and for many years will be directed , ' to almost unimagined fields . While the finances of the United States require the soundest end most prudent treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World can scarcely comprehend . It will not happen within this generation , certainly , that our economic writers will be arguing for the reduction of our debt , as English writers now are as to theirs , that it must not be left for succeeding generations who may have to face the exhaustion of the natural resources of the land , and to supply from the public Treasury some help to the hopeless poverty of the working class .
