UNIVERSITY TOPICS . THE YALE STUDENT . WiLat a Yale Student ought to be . The Introductory Lecture of the Phi Beta Kappa Course for 1886-87 . By President DWIGHT , Yale University . 1887 . Tuis familiar lecture by President Dwight to the students of the University does not easily lend itself to criticism . It does not undertake to set forth a theory of education , nor to describe any part of the machinery by which good education may be brought about . It does not concern itself with the outward forms of University life or instruction . Such things are wholly aside from its intention . It rather is like the serious and well considered advice of an elder brother in regard to the ends which those should pursue who find themselves members of the University , and who may be desirous of getting the very best for themselves out of the opportunities which are open to them . Such advice might on another occasion very properly enter into the minuter rules for the conduct of the details of scholastic life , for the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the purpose of this address is wholly apart from anything of the kind . This purpose is to lay down certain broad principles , which should shape the aims of the young men who seek to be the true Sons of Yale . This purpose is accomplished with a sort of affectionate solemnity which makes the lecture almost pathetic , and which can not fail to impress the readers as it must have impressed the hearers of the address . It is not surprising that the hearers asked for a copy for publication ; for no thoughtful man who heard it could fail to appreciate its value . The general character of the address may be gathered from a paragraph near the close in which President Dwight sums up what seem to him the characteristics of the ideal Yale student , which have been so nearly fulfilled in the past as to give hope that they may remain the ideal which the thoughtful Yale student of the present and the future will set before himself . // " Our question returns to us then : What ought a Yale student @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yale men of the past have been , or rather , just what our University desires to make all its sons , and does make them , so far as its influence and teachings are unhindered in their work . He should be a man whose prime quality and foundation of character is manliness  --  the sense of duty , so all-controlling in his life that he is ready for duty 's call , whenever and wherever it comes to him-that manly sense of obligation to God and man which puts work before pleasure and inspires the soul to meet what is hard or distasteful with the spirit of a conqueror . He should be large-minded and fairminded in his search for truth , in all his studies and investigations . The truth should be his light , and the end of his seeking should be the perfect light with which no darkness is intermingled . In his effort to gain this , he should hold firmly to the past and reach forward to the future . He should make the past open the way to the future and neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge all , both men and things , according to their true value ; holding wealth and station and power in less esteem than character , and making the development of character and the rendering of service to the world the purpose of his education from its beginning to its end . He should rightly adjust the emotional and intellectual elements of his life-giving to neither exclusive influence in his thought or action , but , while seeing the truth with a clear mind , grasping it also in his feeling , with a heart for mankind and the experimental knowledge of what friendship is . He should be a true gentleman , of the inward rather than the outward sort , if he can be but one , but both inwardly and outwardly so far as the aspirations of the soul can find a perfect answering reality . He should be free from all pretence and hypocrisy-honest and earnest-aiming to be , not to seemesteeming no honor desirable except that which comes in return for character and service . He should be full of reverence for the Divine truth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind open to conviction and a heart large enough for thankfulness and love and every Christian virtue . He should in a word , be ready to take the lessons which the common mother reads to him from all her past life and give them their own transforming and elevating power within his soul . " The body of the address is occupied in elaborating the principles which are summed up in this quotation , and the introduction // deals with the necessarily modifying effects upon a young man of the environment which he finds in the University . This description will show why the lecture does not easily lend itself to criticism . We do not feel inclined to criticize the loving counsels of a father to his children , as he points out to them the ways of rectitude , and emphasizes the accepted principles of right living , and makes clear the aims whose pursuit will secure the development of true manliness . As little do we care to criticize such an address as this , even if we found anything in it which seemed to call for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a great deal of interest by those who are interested in the progress of the college . All the utterances of President Dwight are sure to attract attention from the graduates of the college for some time to come for such indications as they may furnish as to the policy which the new administration is likely to pursue . His words , whether spoken in the lighter form of an after-dinner speech , or in a serious address like this , will be listened to with something more than curiosity . Especially when he tells what his conception is of what a Yale student ought to be , hearers will expect to derive from the utterance some inferences as to the means which are likely to be used for the fulfillment of this ideal . It is hardly possible to describe the aim of education in the University , without giving some hint as to how that ideal is to be reached . It may be said that President Dwight 's idea of the proper aim of education in Yale University is the development of manliness in the student in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the paragraph which I have quoted . This may seem to a great many persons a mere commonplace , but to those who have carefully watched educational movements during the last few years , it will seem full of significance , when taken in connection with the peculiar position which President Dwight now occupies , and with some things which he says in this address . For the popular demand , which is often heard , that University education shall be more " practical , " has behind it a very different notion from this . There is unquestionably a popular impatience with the old conception of a " liberal " education , and there is a call for some system of education in which everything which a student learns shall be directly contributory to the very practical ends of helping him to make money , or to achieve success and eminence in the special department of work to which he may devote himself in active life . This demand is sometimes made // explicitly and with a full understanding of its meaning , but oftener it is made only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education is . So strong is the demand that many very able and distinguished educators , who were themselves educated on a different system , have yielded to it , and have gone off to follow very strange gods indeed . The theory of a liberal education is that the student shall learn things which are not going to be of any practical use in such a sense ; that he shall have his mind so cultivated as to have interests altogether outside of the special line of work to which he may devote his life ; that he shall have in his own mind resources of thought and training which shall make him something better than a narrow-minded specialist . It is this that makes the difference between liberal education and technical training . The purpose of a college curriculum has always been to provide studies which shall develop the student into a broad-minded man by an education preliminary to the training which he may receive in a professional school or in any business which he may undertake . A great deal of the confusion which has entered into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure to keep before the mind the essential character of a liberal education . The study of the classics has maintained its place in our colleges just because it is " unpractical , " and far removed from any possible usefulness as a direct means of earning a living , except in a few cases . But the study of the classics is not essential to the idea of a liberal education . It is a question of degree . When it can be shown that another class of studies can serve as well this purpose of broad culture , independent of their usefulness in special and technical training , there can be no real objection to substituting them for the classics . There is practically no dispute about the necessity of modifying the old curriculum in the direction of greater freedom of choice on the part of the student . The conditions of modern life , and the immense progress of human knowledge in almost every direction make this inevitable ; but in these changes it is fatal to all sound notions of education to lose sight of the distinction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of technical training . Much of the clamor for an unrestricted choice of studies has resulted fi-om a losing sight , on the part of some persons from whom one would expect better things , of the fact that the aim of a college education is not to fit a man for success in any particular department of life , // but to train him to cultured , broad-minded manliness . The belief thali a man 's true life is in the abundance of the things which he possesses , the making haste to get rich which is the worst characteristic of the present age , and which marks it as essentially materialistic in its life and aims , this spirit surely ought to meet with the sturdiest resistance from our colleges and universities . Arid yet unfortunately there can be no doubt that one of the prevailing arguments in favor of unrestricted option in the curriculum is precisely , that , if the student is allowed free choice , he will be apt to choose those studies , which , instead of broadening his mind by multiplying its interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special training for success , as success is too apt to be measured by the popular standards . No one can object to any amount of technical training , and it ought to be the very best which our educational institutions can furnish , but there is very serious objection to pretending to give liberal culture , while the real aim is something altogether different . In the clamor for something " practical " iu the way of education , it is not well to lose sight of the fact that University life should have for its aim the very practical end of turning out widely-cultivated , manysided , broad-minded men . It would have been altogether out of place , and wholly aside from the purpose of the speaker in this familiar address to the students , for him to turn aside from the discussion of what a Yale student ought to be , to the consideration of the means which the government of the university might see fit to employ for the purpose of making him what he ought to be . But it is not impertinent for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to draw from it the inference that the new administration is not going to lose sight of the true theory of a liberal education , or to confound it with those courses of study which have a special aim and a technical value . It is eminently proper that technical and professional schools should form an important part of the university , but it would be to lose all that has hitherto made a college education most valuable , should the old conception of liberal culture perish in the multiplication of special studies . Whether I have properly interpreted President Dwight 's conception of what a Yale student ought to be , the reader may judge from the following extract : " As kindred , again , to this second element in the Yale spirit , I mention a third which seems to me to have always belonged to // the life of the institution  --  the disposition to estimate both men and things according to their true value . There is no place in the world , I am sure , where a man is judged more justly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who has imbibed the spirit of our University is no respecter of persons , in the bad sense of that phrase . He does not look at family descent or early advantages or wealth , but at mind and character . The externals are only secondary and subordinate  --  a good , indeed , if the man is worthy of them , but not of the essence of the man . What is internal , what the man is in himself and makes of himself , is the all-important thing . I heard a prominent graduate of our University say , not long since , that , when he was a student here some thirty years ago , there was in the student community almost a contempt for wealth . This was , no doubt , a strong rhetorical expression , but it represented a fact of the life of those days . The thoughts and ambitions of the men here at that period were in the line of higher things than wealth , and in their estimate of one another they regarded this as nothing . The whole life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last five and twenty or thirty years , we have become a wealthy nation . We have passed from the simple life of a quiet town , as it were , to the luxury and abundance of a great city . The devotion of the people to money-getting has become so great as even to be alarming , and the one desire which seems to unite all men together is the desire to make something , in this matter of money , out of nothing . There is surely no worse sign of the the times in our day than this . But I believe that much of the old spirit still remains here-at least , so far as our judgment of men goes . The Yale class of to-day does not measure its honors for its members by any external standard . The pathway to success in every department of our life here is open to all alike . The rewards and , what is often more coveted , the friendships come to the poorest as well as the richest , to those who have had the least of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truly as to those who have had the most . And , for one , I hope that the Yale spirit will never be changed in this respect at any period of the future . " As I allude to this subject , may I be permitted , young gentlemen , to add a word of suggestion , or even of exhortation . If the evil tendencies which are manifesting themselves so strongly among our people are to be checked , and the glory of the old // ancestral character is to be preserved , the result must be accomplished through the influence of educated men . Those who go forth from the universities and colleges must show by their living , by the estimate of things which they manifestly form , by the energy which they display in the pursuit of the higher and nobler objects of desire , by their exaltation of learning and mental culture and the power to do good service to the world and honorable character above all external things , and , if we may use the strong expression , by a contempt for wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young men of this generation are in greater danger of being led away in the false path , in this regard , than those who lived in former times were . They need , therefore , the more carefully and constantly to open their minds to the higher influences of the university life . May I not say , also , that they owe it to the best interests of the country and of the future to keep alive these higher influences , and to see that the spirit which has characterized our university in other times abides here always . We are called , at every stage of our life , to do that which lies before us as the work of the time . In doing this , we best fulfill the Divine will and the manly duty . The student 's work is in the student 's life , and no higher obligation rests upon him than to pass on to other generations the true spirit which has been transmitted to himself . And here let me say , that no unimportant share in the future character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ era which precedes that future . We ask what is the University ?  --  and the question is one which may have different answers . In one sense , no doubt , the University has no existence which is independent of any or all of the men who compose its membership . In another , it finds its life in the continuous life of that governing body which directs its affairs and , in its selfperpetuating power , is the only undying thing within it . But in still another and , as it may seem sometimes , the truest sense , the University is that brotherhood to which we all belong-the brotherhood of living men who , for the time , abide in these rooms , and walk through these grounds , and move onward in these studies , and enjoy this peculiar life . The spirit of the place dwells in us , and if it is to go forth from our company to those who follow us in the purity and glory in which it came to us , and bearing with it the same blessing and inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearts as we received it . Let it not be that in our time , or by our action , it shall be so changed that the // means of living shall be more highly valued here than the life lived , or the external things attaching themselves to a man shall rise , in the thought of Yale students in the future , into a higher place than the internal things which are of the man himself . " I think that no one can read this passage and have any doubt as to whether I have put a true interpretation upon President Dwight 's address . Whatever changes may be made from time to time in the undergraduate curriculum , and whatever degree of choice may be accorded to the stndent between different lines of study , it is certain that the idea of liberal culture will not soon be abandoned at Yale in answer to the demand for a more practical education . This matter has not necessarily anything to do , directly , with the question of more or less freedom of choice on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin shall be studied by all students . But there has been a systematic attempt on the part of a great many persons , who have never given any particular attention to educational matters , to insist on putting any discussion of the aims off education out of the way by making a tremendous clamor about required studies and the classics , as being " unpractical . " The first necessity of deciding what is the aim of any individual 's education has been left almost untouched by many of those who have been loudest in their statements as to the means which should be employed in educating him . The subsidiary questions of ways and means will gradually work themselves out , if there is a distinct understanding as to what the purpose is . If it is distinctly understood that the aim of a collegiate education is to fit a man for life , rather than for any special department of human activity , to broaden him rather than to narrow him , to make him a many-sided man rather than a specialist with no interests outside of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see how the student 's absolute freedom of choice can be compatible with it . There are two distinct temptations which beset students , and which are nurtured by such freedom . There is the temptation to take the studies which are easiest , which besets the indolent . And there is the temptation which besets the industrious and intelligent , to choose the studies which interest them particularly , and which are along some single line or some very few lines . This latter temptation is far the more dangerous and important . It is not a matter of much importance to the world whether the indolent and stupid are well educated ; but it // is a matter of the very highest importance whether the industrious and intelligent are well educated . And the temptation of such students is always to confine their attention , with ever increasing closeness , to particular lines of study in which they have become interested . This danger is largely avoided , when they are compelled , in the earlier years of their training , to turn their attention to a considerable number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do under any system which has in view the widest cultivation of the intelligence . Under such a system hitherto , the study of literature has naturally held a large place , and it must always do so . Of late years natural science has put in a successful plea for a larger place than it has hitherto occupied , and no one has seemed inclined to deny it room . And modern literature has insisted , with great propriety , that it was quite as good as ancient literature , and ought to be considered in the education of a gentleman . These new claims hare somewhat disturbed the old curriculum , and in some cases have broken it up altogether . But if the conception of a liberal education is to continue , it is certain that the study of literature must retain a very considerable place in the curriculum of the future . There will have to be new adjustments ; indeed such adjustments are everywhere going on . The question between literature and natural science will have to be settled , and its due proportion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancient and modern literature will have to be settled in the same sense . But I can not see any possibility that the study of literature can ever be superseded in a course designed for the liberal education of young men . And further , I do not see how the study of modern literature can ever be made very thorough and valuable , unless its foundations are laid in some knowledge of the literatures of Greece and Rome . The proportion which the study of the classics ought to bear to other branches in a collegiate course is certainly open to discussion , but I find it difficult to understand how they can be altogether dispensed with , if such a course is to be consistent with the fundamental idea of liberal education . The old phrase , which gave to the studies of " polite literature , " or the literature of polish , the name " humanities , " was not a random one . It contains a very important truth . The study of literature is the most humanizing of all studies . It brings a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and makes him know that these are his brethren . Its place can be supplied // by no other study , and it must therefore always hold its place in any education which hopes to be recognized as " liberal . " It may seem that I have wandered a long way from my text , which I found in President Dwight 's address to the students of the university over which he has recently been called to preside . But what I have said has been naturally suggested by the words which I have quoted from that address . It contains , as it seems to me , a very solemn assurance that the conception of a liberal education is to be maintained in Yale University , as the cornerstone of its future policy . And when this is once established it leaves the field clear and open to fair-minded discussion of the ways and means . When this conception is taken for granted , there can be no obstacle to the fullest discussion of the limits of the optional system , of the place of Greek and Latin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and modern literature , nor of the amount of room to be given to the study of the natural sciences . The main point may be regarded as settled , for so long a time as President Dwight shall influence the policy of the university . This point is that the aim of a collegiate education is to educate the student to a broad-minded manliness . With this point settled , the discussion of the minor points , which have great interest , may go without the confusion which has hitherto been obvious , whenever they were raised . THOMAS R. BACON .
