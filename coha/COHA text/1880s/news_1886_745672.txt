txt A remarkable story has been brought to light through last week 's Issue of the Southern Churchman . The kernel of the story is that Miss Annie White , daughter of L. S. White , of No. 83 McCullougn-street , Baltimore , was taken from her home without the consent of either of her parents , through the assistance of some of the members of St. Gabriel 's Sisterhood , at Peekskill , N. Y .. with the object of making her a member of that order . This order Is one of the Sisters of Mercy , whose chief active duties consist in nursing the sick . Mr. White 's objection ' to his daughter 's taking such a course , apart from that of leaving her home , was the fact that she is and has been for years an invalid and utterly unfit for the severe duties of a sister . After recovering from an illness which threatened to be fatal several months ago , Miss White expressed a desire to enter a sisterhood , and applied to that connected with Mount Calvary Church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the consent of her parents , which she could not obtain . By some means she established communication : with the Order of St. Gabriel , of Peekskill. which encouraged her in her desire , and finally provided her with the facilities for leaving her home without her parents ' knowledge . This took place last October . Since that time , Mr. White has heard from his daughter several times .. There was no legal mode by which he could get her back : , as she is of age . Re applied first to the Mother Superior of the order and then to Bishop Potter , of New York , but without success . Then , as a last resort , he addressed the following letter to the southern Churchman , which was published in last week 's issue : BALTIMORE , Jap. 10 . MR . EDITOR : I take the liberty in laying before you facts which , in their bearing , are of vital importance to every parent in our land . I doubt if there is a civilized country on our globe outside or our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tolerated . One of my daughters was for several years a helpless invalid , her life hanging , as it were , upon a thread . For months , yea for years , no one could tell whether or not the prayers that were constantly offered for her , the skill of her physician , and the ceaseless care and attention of devoted parents , sisters , brothers , and friends lavishly bestowed would prevail , or death be the victor . The many anxious hours passed by us drew our hearts ' affections more closely to her , Providence willing that she should be spared to us , although now she is a delicate , physically frail being . After her recovery she became infatuated regarding sisterhoods , ' and reasoned herself , with the assistance of others who had no right to advise , that God had called her to be ' a Sister of Mercy . " My family are all Episcopalians and endeavored to dissuade her from such a course ; that it God had designed her for such work He would have given her the proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there were duties nearer home . She applied to an English sisterhood connected with Mount Calvary Church , ( of - which she and others of my family are members , ) but was refused , unless she came with the consent or her parents , notwithstanding she was of legal age . This consent was firmly and positively refused , and we supposed that ended the matter . However , through the secret aid of others , she became acquainted and corresponded with St. Gabriel 's , at Peekskill , N. Y. , which institution agreed to accept her without any conditions , and regardless of the fifth commandment . I wrote to the Mother Superior of that order stating all the facts , and earnestly entreated her to second our efforts , which we believed were warranted by the feeble constitution of our child . I was told that the Mother Superior was ' a lovely Christian character . ' The reply of that Christian woman was , in substance : ' I regret that we can not agree iu regard to the matter or duty , ' failing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher authority ' in the matter of duty than those who were so deeply interested . in September last my daughter 's trunk , packed with her clothing , was spirited away from my house unknown to all of us , to even our servants , and on the second day of October she was abducted , ( 1 can call It by no other name. ) having been secretly furnished with a railroad ticket to New-York , and , as we have reason to believe , accompanied by a Plater from St. Gabriel 's . She was sick in bed the day previous , left us without notice , and Oaring the temporary absence of her parent . Of course , alas ! in this country , we have no legal remedy , but , believing that there was in the Episcopal Church some ecclesiastical authority , some Christian tribunal to which we could appeal in behalf of sorrowing hearts and the sacredness of a man 's home , I wrote to the Rev. Dr. Watkins , of New-York , setting forth all the facts and asking him to aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter was indorsed by Dr. P. C. Williams , of this city , my family physician , who wrote that the facts in regard to the health ' or our child were painfully true , ' and requested Dr. Watkins to aid us in the natural and laudable desire to recover our daughter and at the same time to expose and resist a power which can thus invade the sanctity of home . To this letter I received , through Dr. Watkins , the following reply from Bishop Potter : NEw-YORK . Jan. 4. 1888 . MY DEAR DR . WATKINS : The inclosures accompanying yours of the ' 81st ult. are rather startling reading , but I do not see what can be ' done unless you or the young lady 's friends can furnish me with evidence ( A ) that she is of feeble mind , or ( B ) that she is detained without her own consent . She is of age . and if she hasacted voluntarily I am as powerless as the courts to touch her . Of course the thing , so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as you see . I have not enough as yet on which to base my intervention . Affectionately yours . H. C. POTT The " inclosures " referred to in the above letter were the letters from Dr. Williams and myself . I supposed that the Episcopal Church of the United States is founded upon what is right ; is governed by . Christian laws rather than legal laws ; that the Bishop of a diocese possessed some ecclesiastical authority ; but Bishop Potter , of New-York , after acknowledging that the statement of tee facts was " startling reading , " and that " the thing was most wrong , " confesses that he is powerless to act . Now , 1 appeal to you . Is there any remedy ? If so , where ? Truly yours . L. S. ? WHITE . No. 83 McCulloh-street . In speaking of the affair to-day Mr. White said : " My daughter was stolen away from me ; that 's all there is about it . She had been under the doctor 's care for years , and tier life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our family psysician , says that she only bad one lung left and needed constant care . When she recovered from her sickness and expressed a desire to join the Sisters of Mersey . I. said to her : ' How can you expect to nurse any one . Why , you require nursing yourself . " She then said she would wait in the hope of my changing my mind . I was away from home a great deal last year , and her intercourse commenced , I suppose , with the Sisters of St. Gabriel in my absence from the city . It was conducted almost entirely by correspondence . My daughter left one day after I had left the house , and when her mother had gone out , and she could only have done so with the assistance of others . " " Did she receive any visitors at her home from the sisterhood ? " " Not that I know of . After she expressed a desire to become one of them I noticed she received a great many letters with a peculiar monogram upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received one myself , from Sister Theodora , I believe , in which she asked for an interview with me in order that she might convince me that my daughter was taking the right course . I considered the request not only absurd , but impudent , and declined to have an interview with her . " " Do you know why they desired to get Miss White in opposition to her parents 2 " " No unless it was their desire to make a catch .. " Has Bishop Potter any authority over their order ? " " He says be bad none , but it looked strange to me that the Bishop had no moral weight in correcting an evil which he admits to be most wrong . I am informed on good authority that , although he is a conservative man himself , he is afraid to excite the hostility of the powerful High Church element , from which the members of St. Gabriel 's come .
