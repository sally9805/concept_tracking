txt A writer in an English scientific journal fancies that he has discovered that North America was at one time colonized by the Romans . The argument with which he supports this view is purely philological . He claims that many of the so-called Indian names of rivers , mountains , and valleys in this country are really Latin names slightly misspelled . Even so imaginative a discoverer does not venture to believe that the Indians are Romans , but he firmly maintains that the Romans lived here , furnished most of our local geographical names , and were finally driven out or exterminated by the Indians . Of course Oils pretended discovery is nonsense . If the Romans had ever colonized America Roman remains of some kind would be found . here . ' The first thing the founder of a Roman colony in Europe , Asia , or Africa always did was to build an amphitheatre and an aqueduct . He built the amphitheatre in order to receive the subsidy  --  or guarantee fund , as Col. MAPLESON would call it  --  which the Roman Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aqueduct because , as the founder of a colony , he had a legal monopoly in water melers. ? At least this is the only rational explanation of the countless aqueducts and amphitheatres built by Roman colonists . When the colonists were overpowered and massacred by barbaric tribes parts of the amphitheatres and aqueducts defied destruction , and remain to this day to demonstrate the energy and business enterprise of the Romans . Had the Romans colonized America we should find ruined amphitheatres and broken aqueducts all over the country ; but , as a matter of fact , we find no traces of such works . Hence we may conclude that no Roman colonies were ever planted here . It may be urged that half a dozen stray Romans may have been accidentally cast ashore here without any intention of founding colonies , ' and hence that they and their descendants may have had no reason for building aqueducts and amphitheatres . . Even in that case they would have left some relics behind them . We should have found from time ' to time Latin grammars , copies.of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the bones of occasional Christian martyrs who had been knocked out in one round by Nuraidian lions  --  Pontifex Maximus 's rules . But we have found none of these things . Not the slightest tangible vestige of a Roman has been dug up in any part of the continent , and it is even doubtful if ? Bishop . BRYENNIOS could find a relic or a remain which would bear critical examination . As to the philological argument , it is entirely . worthless . If the Indians are not the descendants of the . alleged Roman colonists , and no one pretends that they are , is it credible that they should have preserved the Latin names given to rivers and mountains by the conquered colonists ? Are we to suppose that the colonists put up signboards on the banks of the Chattahoochee and the sides of the Appalachian range , and that the Indians permitted these signboards to remain and adopted the Latin names inscribed on them ? The idea is ' simply ridiculous . If the Indians ever drove Roman colonists away it was-because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such circumstances Indian public sentiment would not have allowed a Latin name to be retained anywhere from the Atlantic to the Pacific . In point of fact many of the geographical names used in this country are distinctly Sanskrit in their origin . Take Yaphank , for example . It contains the syllable " ya , " which is the characteristic of the imperative mood in Sanskrit , and also the syllable " hank , " which is undoubtedly the Sanskrit " bhan " ? the letter " p " being euphonic . Thus the word Yaphank , or in its original form " yabhan , " means " Do n't stop here , " and all travelers on the Long Island Railroad will at once recognize the propriety of the name . Take again the word Chattahoochee , which we are told is a corruption of the Latin word ' " Magnus . " It is only by the most skillful monkeying with GRIMM 'S law that the former can be derived from the latter , whereas it is easy to perceive the resemblance between Chattahoochee and the Sanskrit word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cotton . " Then there is the name " Butler , " which is in this country erroneously supposed to mean deleted 4 lines The effort to derive the word " Butler " from the Latin " curriculum " is , on the contrary , one of vast difficulty , and it . may be unhesitatingly said that the advocate of the theory of the Roman colonization of America has not succeeded in proving any relation between the two words . ' It would be easy to show that many more Indian words , such as Patchogue , Pompanoosuc , and Winipiseogee , are almost identical with Sanskrit words and bear only a very slight resemblance to any words that can be found in the Latin dictionary . If we are to depend upon philology alone we might , therefore , decide that the Indians are Aryans , and that they originally spoke a Sanskrit dialect . There is , at least , as much evidence of this as there is that this country was once colonized by the Romans , and it is a much more soothing and soporific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
