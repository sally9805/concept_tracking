Old letters ! They are like faded rose leaves in a book ! The thoughts in them are withered now ; even the loving wishes have long ago lost their fragrance . How many of the hands that wrote them are lying over still hearts today ! Heigh-ho ! She takes the letter in her hand and throws it into the fire . Several more from the drawer follow it , after rapid glances , with alternate laughter and sighs . She pauses over another Helen Thomaston . Fourteen years ago  --  is it so long ? We were both eighteen . Reads " Arthur and I are to be married next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florence , I feel perfectly sure that we shall always love each other .

Laura and I are such good friends now  --  I could never believe she meant any wrong  --  and she was so sorry for it afterwards ; but if Laura Malvern had not come between Edward Warburton and me  --  I  --  we  --  Looking thoughtfully  --  Heigh-ho !  --  " Of all sad words of tongue or pen , The saddest are these : It might have been .

I was nearly twenty ; he always treated me as if I might have been his daughter . Reads " My darling little birdie . " Heigh-ho ! Kissing letter and then looking up at portrait There is no one to call me his " little birdie " now ! She places her handkerchief to her eyes and rests her face in her hand , with her elbow on the table . She crumples the letter and tosses it back of her to the fire , sighs , brushes her eyes and is about to take another letter . She suddenly starts up Oh ! No ! I forgot ! She hurries to the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands at the table , smoothing it out as she proceeds John is looking down upon me from the canvas . Puts away the letter ; walks up to L.C. , stops before the portrait and looks up at it with a sad expression Dear John ! She turns up to the window , leaning against the casing , L. , and looking out Rain  --  rain  --  rain ! I shall die of ennui ! A widow always misses her husband so much on a rainy day . Looking up at portrait over her shoulder Mr. Brownlee used to be such company for me  --  when I could n't get out of the house . Again looks out of the window , now becoming deeply serious Rain  --  rain  --  rain ! It was on just such a day as this  --  will it always come into my mind when it rains ? And I try so hard to keep it out ! Buries her face in her hand , silently moves down . Raises her face ; goes to piano , wearily ; plays an accompaniment and sings Footnote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dreary ; It rains , and the wind is never weary ; The vine still clings to the mouldering wall , But at every gust the dead leaves fall , And the days are dark and dreary . " My life is cold and dark , and dreary ; It rains , and the wind is never weary ; My thoughts still cling to the mouldering past , But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast , And the days are dark and dreary . " It was just such a day as this  --  thirteen years ago . Edward and I  --  we  --  parted for the last time  --  in this very room . People have called me frivolous . I am  --  what can a woman be ? What must a woman be ? I have never lived my own life . I have done the best I could in a life that should have been lived by another woman . My own life  --  he was a part of it . I have not lived at all since then ! She leans listlessly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table and stands fumbling through the old letters with an absent air . She raises a package from beneath the pile , done up in faded tissue paper and tied with a faded ribbon Why , what are these tied up so carefully ? The wrapper is old and faded and the ribbon About to untie it  --  Why I  --  I  --  Turns over the package ; reads " June 12 , 18  --  . Footnote : 1kb When love begins to sicken and decay "  --  I thought  --  I  --  I thought  --  I had destroyed those letters . No  --  I  --  I  --  mean  --  I  --  I thought I had returned them to him . No  --  I remember ! Oh ! I  --  should have destroyed them before my marriage . It was neither respectful to Mr. Brownlee , nor consistent with my own dignity as his wife . She walks to the mantel with dignity and makes a motion to throw the package into the fire . She withholds her hand and hesitates , looking down at the package . She repeats this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes off the wrapper , which she crumples and throws into the fire Of  --  of course it is n't wicked for me to keep them now . She looks at the letters a moment , then turns her head slowly and looks over her shoulder at the portrait of her husband . Again makes a motion to throw the packet into the fire ; hesitates again . She finally places the letters in the bosom of her dress , then yields to her real feelings , drops her face into her hands and sobs . Enter a servant , Henry , R.U.E . He has a card upon a small silver salver . He steps in stiffly and stops , down R.C. Mrs. Brownlee draws up , dashes the tears from her eyes quickly , and extends her hand with dignity . He moves to her . She takes the card ; starts slightly as she looks at it . Draws up Show the gentleman into this room , Henry . He moves up to retire Ah ! Henry . He stops and turns back You may place that drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Brownlee continues aside A distinguished visitor  --  the minister plenipotentiary of the United States to a foreign court .

She moves to the mantel and looks into the mirror , draws back It is not the same face  --  it is not the same . Moves L. Has he , too , changed so much ? Exits , L.1.E . Henry reenters , R.U.E . Warburton , who enters L. glances back , with a slight inclination of the head to Henry , who immediately retires . Warburton casts his eyes around the room for a moment ; then he glances about a little nervously , though his general manner is composed and dignified . He looks into the fire , slowly removing one of his gloves Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Rather out of season for a fire  --  very comfortable though . It is hardly colder than this in Vienna , in the middle of December . How my heroic ancestors , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climate of Massachusetts is a profound mystery to me . I should hardly be willing to endure as much for the benefit of my posterity . My wife , poor dear , succumbed to the moderate chills of Paris . Even the warm skies of Southern Italy failed to restore her . Heigh-ho ! Poor darling ! He looks around the apartment Surely this room  --  I can not be mistaken  --  now that I see the inside of the house . It must be the same  --  Looking at the room and yet  --  Ah ! I see , Mrs. Brownlee probably returned to the old family mansion after the death of her  --  her husband . He stops , R.C. , looking down thoughtfully It was in this very apartment  --  eighteen hundred and  --  Footnote : 1kb He takes a wallet from his breast pocket , opens it , looks through the folds and takes out a card photograph Ah ! Mrs. Warburton ! A good , gentle , sweet creature . Kisses it and returns it . He looks through the folds , takes out another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looks at the picture steadily Florence . She was a girl of nineteen , then  --  luxuriant hair  --  complexion as delicate and as brilliant as the tint of an apple blossom . It is only a fading memory . She is very different now , I suppose . Looks at paper Ah ! Here it is . Reads " June 12 , 18  --  " Note : 1kb Thirteen years ago . Reads " They sin who tell us love can die ; With life , all other passions fly , All others are but vanity . " Southey . What nonsense great poets can write ! He looks at the picture a moment , then suddenly starts ; looks as if hearing a sound ; hastily returns the paper , pictures and wallet to his pocket . Straightens up and stands in an expectant attitude to receive Mrs. Brownlee . She does not enter . He sees his mistake , turns upstage and then down L.C. to mirror . He looks at himself , running his hand through his hair , etc. , etc . Thirteen years make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being . There was not a gray hair in my head at that time  --  not a wrinkle in my face . Ah ! well we must all grow old  --  Walking to table men and women alike .

Pauses ; looking at it steadily Evidently taken only a year after our  --  our  --  after our last meeting . Heigh-ho ! There is a fuller and deeper womanhood in that face , but she hardly looks older than when I last saw her . Do women shed their early griefs so lightly , then ? Perhaps there is a date . He takes the card from the album ; looks at back ; starts Eighteen hundred and  --  Footnote : 1kb The present year ! He stands a moment , staring at the card , turning the face and back alternately . He then walks before the mirror , where he looks at his own face , then at the picture . He repeats this action several times . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the album , shuts the cover with some force , and moves to and fro , thoroughly piqued .

He bows acknowledgment and proceeds to comply We should hardly have known each other , Mr. Warburton , if we had met elsewhere . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton I can be more complimentary , madam . Old Father Time has shown you more gallantry than he accords to the majority of ladies . He has politely touched his forelock , apparently , and passed by on the opposite side . Mrs. B.

Mrs. Florence Brownlee Honestly , then , I am sincerely glad you think so . A woman ninety years old is quite willing to be mistaken for eighty-five . I confess to the most durable weakness of my sex . I will not flatter you , Mr. Warburton . The arduous duties of public life , I will not say time  --  Warb . The Hon.

Mrs. Warburton died exactly five years ago  --  last November . She was an admirable woman . I was devotedly attached to her . I really could not have been more warmly attached to Mrs. Warburton if she had been my own sister instead of my wife . Mrs. Brownlee glances up at him , quickly , then away Poor , dear woman . She was hardly fitted for the gay official life of a European capital ; extremely domestic in her tastes . You never met Mrs. Warburton ? He takes wallet from his pocket ; takes out card ; is passing it to her ; she raises her hand to receive it . He suddenly withdraws it No . Returns it ; takes another This one . Mrs. B.

Edward Warburton Quite  --  quite  --  I assure you . No one who knew her could help loving her . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee She should have been very happy in such a love . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton I really wish you could have known Mrs. Warburton . We often spoke of you  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee You  --  spoke  --  of me ? Warb . The Hon.

You and Mrs. Warburton could have laughed over it together . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Certainly ; Mrs. Warburton and I could have laughed over it together . Warb . The Hon.

Mrs. Florence Brownlee I was speaking of Mr. Brownlee and myself . I had never experienced anything more than  --  the mere  --  the mere thoughtless flutterings , so to speak , of a young schoolgirl 's heart , you know . Warb . The Hon.

Mrs. Florence Brownlee We  --  were  --  were very happy together . But it could not last . She averts her head , drawing her handkerchief from her pocket , and quietly pressing it to her eyes . He regards her , half puzzled , half incredulously , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edward Warburton Pardon me , madam , if our conversation has recalled unhappy recollections . I did not intend to intrude upon the sacred feelings of a devoted wife . Permit me to change the subject . I will mention the particular object , aside from a natural desire to meet an old friend , the immediate object of my present visit . I have called to render an act of justice to yourself , and to offer you an apology . On my arrival from Europe , about a week ago , after an absence of several years , I visited the old family residence of the Warburtons in the vicinity of Concord . It is the first time I have been to the place for years . The estate has but recently returned , in fact , to my possession . Day before yesterday  --  in the afternoon  --  I was rummaging among a lot of musty papers in a long-deserted room of the old mansion , and I came across a bundle of old letters . Taking packet from his pocket They were carefully wrapped in tissue paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Florence Brownlee You found them among some other old rubbish , in a deserted room ? Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton A sort of storeroom . They had been very carefully put away in a secret drawer of an ancient mahogany cabinet , which one of my ancestors brought over in sixteen twenty . Imagine my surprise , madam  --  I was positively startled  --  to discover that they were your own letters to me  --  written during our  --  our  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Our flirtation . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Our flirtation  --  thirteen years ago . He lays the packet on the table Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee You will pardon me , Mr. Warburton , if I say I have been at a loss to understand why you had never returned those letters before . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton That question puzzled me , when I first found them . It is for that , madam , I owe you an apology  --  though I confess it is now very late to offer one . I removed the dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subject . I thought about it an hour or more . There was no one in the house to disturb my thoughts . It seemed almost as if it were this morning that I tied those letters in a packet , intending to return them to you . I recalled our last meeting distinctly . We  --  we  --  if you remember  --  we  --  we  --  had quarreled . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Yes . We had quarreled . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton On the previous evening . Of course , we can both of us  --  Very seriously laugh over the matter now . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Of course . We can both laugh over it , now . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Those early lovers ' quarrels are so amusing to look back upon in after years . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Perfectly ludicrous . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton How little you and I dreamed at that time that we could laugh over the affair so heartily , now . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee We would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warburton Heigh-ho ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Heigh-ho ! Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton I am still at a loss , madam , to explain how I happened finally to retain those letters in my possession . I trust , however , that you will accept my apology without that definite explanation which it is now impossible for me to give . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Certainly , Mr. Warburton , I accept your apology . I will also return to you your own letters to me . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton You have  --  retained them  --  so long  --  madam ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee In the expectation that my own might eventually be returned to me . She strikes bell on table I am a housekeeper , Mr. Warburton . It is a disgrace to a woman not to understand where everything is , in her house . I know precisely where your letters are at the present moment . Enter Henry Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Indeed ! Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Henry , you may ask Martha to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom  --  second floor front  --  the third drawer from the top . She will find a small rosewood box , inlaid with mother-of-pearl , in the outer left-hand corner of the drawer . You may bring it to me . Exit Henry , R.U.E. Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Permit me to compliment you , madam ; I have never known a more accurate housekeeper . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Thank you . A careful housekeeper becomes so accustomed to keeping everything in perfect order . She does it instinctively  --  without giving any one thing in particular a second thought . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Exactly . Precisely . A slight pause As I was just saying , when I found this packet of letters  --  I sat down by myself  --  in the old mansion , and I recalled every circumstance of our  --  our  --  last meeting  --  distinctly . You were then a young girl of barely nineteen  --  and a young girl of that age , of course  --  as you know  --  as we all know  --  Complacently a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ha !  --  the most unreasonable thing in the world . Ha ! Ha ! Ha !  --  Sitting back in his chair , calmly trifling with his watch guard and looking front . She draws up and looks across at him , then away . She sits bolt upright as he proceeds , in an attitude suggestive of slowly rising indignation Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! A hot-headed young girl , who imagines herself in love , is a more formidable creature to deal with than any one of the six great Powers . Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! I have never met anything in my diplomatic career so difficult to treat with . I had no connection with the Alabama difficulty , but I dare say that was a mere bagatelle  --  compared with the successful unraveling  --  of an  --  emotional entanglement  --  with a girl of nineteen .

Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Ha ! Throwing back his head and still trifling with his guard Girls will be girls ! She utters a quick , spiteful growl between her clenched teeth , turning to the fire again . He glances at her over his shoulder Eh ? He rises , turns towards her , and continues , inquiringly I beg your pardon ? Mrs. B.

Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Madam ? Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Have you ever found any use for such a thing as memory during your experience as a diplomatist ? Warb . The Hon.

If such a faculty is ever demanded in diplomatic life  --  I  --  you will pardon my frankness  --  but  --  I  --  I really wonder at your success . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Pleasantly I do not understand you . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee On second thought , I am wrong . The art of forgetting with accuracy requires an excellent memory . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Really , madam  --  I  --  Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee You were speaking of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I were concerned  --  about thirteen years ago .

May I ask , sir , whether every young man of twenty-seven is an infallible philosopher ? Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Yes , my dear madam , I trust nothing I have said in reference to that affair has given rise to the slightest unpleasant feeling on your part . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee Oh ! Certainly not , sir . Not in the least , sir . Quite the contrary . The manner in which you have referred to our mutual associations has been calculated to arouse a particularly pleasant feeling on my part ! She taps the fender with her foot Warb . The Hon.

And yet it is one which must be always more or less interesting to both of us  --  as a part of our early personal experience . I meant to say nothing about yourself in particular , as a young girl , which we should not both recognize as characteristic of young girls in general . I can say with perfect frankness , indeed , that I really think  --  you  --  never appeared to greater advantage than on that occasion . Your appearance , in fact , has lingered in my memory from that day to the present . You had on a plain white dress , trimmed prettily with a few fresh violets , which I had just gathered for you in the garden . You were standing near the window  --  I remember your exact attitude  --  when you first began the quarrel . She turns suddenly , drawing up and looking at him indignantly You remember ?

Mrs. Florence Brownlee For the first time , Mr. Warburton , since we have been indulging in these  --  pleasant  --  reminiscences  --  your memory has assumed its normal functions . It was the fact that I was not a " dunce " that compelled me to regard your relations to Laura Malvern as the proper subject of an explanation . Moving towards R. of table , and speaking with increasing vehemence Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton Quickly approaching L.

Laura had so many charms she could afford to waste them . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton There was a stately air about her  --  an air , so to speak of  --  Mrs. B.

She receives a small box of rosewood and mother-of-pearl from Henry That will do , Henry . Exits , R.U.E . Mrs. Brownlee glances at Warburton , who is looking over the music at piano . She stands turned away from him , and takes the packet of letters from the bosom of her dress , glancing back at him over her shoulder once or twice as she does so . She places the letters in the box , closing the lid , deliberately , and locking it ; then looks over at him Warb . The Hon.

Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton I see . He takes up the packet of her letters from the table . They look , down a moment from the respective packets in their hands What curious creatures young lovers are . It takes so slight a thing to make them quarrel . Mrs. B.

I did them up carefully in a paper , but I lingered over each so long it look me all the morning . Mrs. B. Mrs. Florence Brownlee It was noon before I finally had the ribbon on your packet . Warb . The Hon. Edward Warburton I failed to send them to you ; somehow , I could not find it in my heart to part with them at that time ; some foolish , longing fancy .

Mrs. Florence Brownlee Really  --  I  --  really fail to see anything so very amusing in that , Mr. Warburton . He stops laughing and looks across at her I was barely nineteen at that time . As you have yourself recalled , I dressed in simple white . I do n't see anything so particularly inappropriate on your part in comparing a young girl  --  who  --  who was not positively ugly  --  in comparing a young girl at that age , with a rosebud .

She finally restrains herself and speaks demurely Go on . Warb . The Hon.

Warburton stops laughing ; looks up at her over his shoulder ; rises , moving to R.C. ; turns and looks up at her , seriously . She turns down L.C. , stops before mantel , glances over at him , then looks into the fire . He crosses to her Florence ! Extending his hand . She glances back at him , averts her head and slightly extends her hand towards him .
