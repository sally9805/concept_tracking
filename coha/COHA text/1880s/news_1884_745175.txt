txt The back part of the United States Hotel , a building situated on Pennsylvania-avenue , a short distance west of the Capitol , fell in without warning this evening and buried in the ruins a number of the inmates . The building has a frontage of 125 feet on the avenue and a depth of 185 feet . the rear end opening upon an alley leading from Third-street to Four-and-a-Half-street . A small portion of the rear wall was first to give way and a general collapse of the whole rear portion immediately followed , sending up a great cloud of dust . A general fire alarm was sounded ? which brought to the scene of the disaster a number of fire engines and hook and ladder companies and a force of police . There were about 45 persons in the hotel at the time the disaster occurred , including guests and employes , and it was impossible at first to ascertain how many were buried in the mass of debris , which covered the ground upon which the rear portion of the building had stood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing that all who were there imprisoned were not dead . A large force of men went to work at once , and in the course of an hour Ernest Snooks , a boy 11 years of age , a son of a restaurant keeper near the hotel , and Annie Dickson , a colored chambermaid , were taken out , both alive , but badly injured . In the meantime it had been ascertained that the number of persons buried in the ruins did not probably exceed seven , viz. : Mrs. Belding , wife of the proprietor ; Ernest Snooks , Mrs. Addie Fletcher , a colored chambermaid ; Annie Dickson , Solomon Wilson , a colored pantry cook ; ? Harrison , a colored employe about the hotel , and Henry Hall , a colored cook . The part of the building which fell contained chiefly rooms appropriated to the use of the employes of the hotel , and it is believed that none of the guests have been either killed or injured . The United States Hotel is one of the oldest structures in the city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an unsafe condition . The barkeeper is reported to have made complaint to the Inspector of Buildings some days ago with regard to its condition , dangerous cracks in the walls having become visible on the outside . The portion which fell was erected about 25 years ago , and was five stories in height . Mrs. Belding , the wife of the proprietor of the hotel , was rescued at 11:30 o'clock to-night , after having been imprisoned four hours . She was on the first floor of the back building and was caught in a narrow V-shaped space , formed by a part of the second floor resting in a slanting position against the sidewalk . After the firemen and volunteers had worked two hours digging down into the debris from the surface , a force of firemen under Capt . Cronin entered from the front building , against the back of which the timbers and bricks had partly longed , and , hearing groans , worked their way back by removing timbers and supporting others . They finally got near enough to see Mrs. Belding. and talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water and whisky . She was not crushed , but held down by her clothes and penned in by the fallen timbers . Jacks were brought and the weight held up while saws and axes were used to cut away to her . At last the rescuers got close enough to cut her clothing away , when they were enabled to extricate her . She was apparently not severely injured , but very much exhausted , and she fainted as she was carried out . Meantime the men at work on the surface of the ruins continued their labors , to which they were every now and then stimulated by the groans and appeals of at least two persons who were beneath the mass of rubbish . While . they were digging , workmen from the Brush Electric Light Company rigged up two large lamps on an adjoining building and the light from these made the scene as bright as day . About 12 o'clock the rescuers talked with one of the imprisoned men , who said he was not badly hurt , but was held by his arm being caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his courage , and the firemen are now working vigorously to get to him . The manner in which the broken timbers and bricks and mortar have lodged makes the labor of removing the debris exceedingly difficult . The building fell about half an hour after the dining room had been cleared after dinner .
