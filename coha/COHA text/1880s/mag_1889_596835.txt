VALLANDIGHAM . GENERAL BURNSIDE took command of the Department of the Ohio ( March 26 , 1863 ) with a zeal against the insurgents only heightened by his defeat at Fredericksburg . He found his department infested with a peculiarly bitter opposition to the Government and to the prosecution of the war , amounting , in his opinion , to positive aid and comfort to the enemy , and he determined to use all the powers confided to him to put an end to these manifestations , which he considered treason- 1 One of Burnside 's own staff-officers , Colonel J. M. Cutts , wrote to the President July 30 : " Order 38 has kindled the fires of hatred and contention . Burnside is foolishly and unwisely excited , and if continued in command will disgrace himself , you , and the country , as he did at Fredericksburg. " 2 At the first threat of civil war Vallandigham made haste to declare himself opposed to any forcible execution of the laws . He declared the States of the Union the only judges of the sufficiency and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one dollar of money whereby one drop of American blood should be shed in civil war ; and in February preceding the inauguration of Mr. Lincoln he proposed to amend the Constitution by dividing the Union into four sections , giving each section a veto on the passage of any law or the election of Presidents or Vice-Presidents , and allowing to each State the right of secession on certain specified terms . Having thus early taken his stand , he able ; and in the execution of this purpose he gave great latitude to the exercise ofhis authority . He was of a zealous and impulsive character , and weighed too little the consequences of his acts where his feelings were strongly enlisted . He issued , on the x 3th of April , an order which obtained wide celebrity under the name of General Order No. 38 , announcing that " all persons found within our lines , who commit acts for the benefit of the enemies of our country , will be tried as spies and traitors , and , if convicted , will suffer death . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view of this order , the writing and carrying of secret letters ; passing the lines for treasonable purposes ; recruiting for the Confederate service ; harboring , concealing , or feeding public enemies within our lines ; and passing beyond this reasonable category of offenses , he declared that " the habit of declaring sympathies for the enemy will no longer be tolerated in this department , and persons committing such offenses will at once be arrested , with a view to being tried , as above stated , or sent beyond our lines into the lines of their friends . " And in conclusion he added a clause which may be made to embrace , in its ample sweep , any demonstration not to the taste of the general in command : " It must be distinctly understood that treason , expressed or implied , will not be tolerated in this department . " This order at once excited a most furious denunciation on the part of those who , either on account of their acts , or their secret sympathies , felt themselves threatened by it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were entirely loyal to the Union1 criticised the order as illegal in itself and liable to lead to dangerous abuses . The most energetic and eloquent of General Burnside 's assailants was Clement L. Vallandigham , who had been for several years a member of Congress from Ohio , whose intemperate denunciation of the Government had caused him the loss of his seat , 2 and whose defeat hadonly heightened the acerb- retained his position with more consistency than was shown by any other member of his party . After his defeat by General R. C. Schenck , in his canvass for rei*lection to Congress , he renewed his attacks upon the Government and its war policy with exaggerated vehemence . In a speech delivered in the House of Representatives on the 14th of January , 1863 , he boasted that he was of that number who had opposed abolitionism or the political development of the antislavery sentiment of the North and West from the beginning . He called it the development of the spirit ofintermeddling , whose children are strife and murder . He said : " On the 14th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and war disunion . More than that , I believed , what you all in your hearts believe to-day , that the South could never beconquered - never . And not that only , but I was satisfied . . . that the secret but real purpose of the war was to abolish slavery in the States , // ity of his opposition to the war . General Order No. 38 furnished him a most inspiring text for assailing the Government , and he availed himself of it in Democratic meetings throughout the State . A rumor of his violent speeches came to the ears of the military authorities in Cincinnati , and an officer was sent , in citizen 's clothes , to attend a meeting which was held at Mount Vernon , Ohio , where Mr. Vallandigham and other prominent Democrats were the orators of the day . The meeting was an enthusiastic one , full of zeal against the Government and of sympathy with the South . Mr. Vallandigham , feeling his audience thoroughly in harmony with him , spoke with unusual fluency and bitterness , greatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presence of the unsympathizing recorder , who leaned against the platform a few feet away and took down some of his most malignant periods . He said it was the design of those in power to usurp a despotism ; that it was not their intention to effect a restoration of the Union ; that the Government had rejected every overture of peace from the South and every proposition of mediation from Europe ; that the war was for the liberation of the blacks and the enslavement of the whites ; that General Order No. 38 was a base usurpation of arbitrary power ; that he despised it and spat upon it and trampled it under his feet . Speaking of the conscription act , he said the people were not deserving to be free men who would submit to such encroachment on their liberties . He called the President " King Lincoln , " and advised the people to come up together at the ballot box and hurl the tyrant from his throne . The audience and the speaker were evidently in entire agreement . The crowd wore in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Butternuts , " and amid cheers which Vallandigham 's speech elicited the witness heard a shout that " Jeff Davis was a gentleman , which was more than Lincoln was . " The officer returned to Cincinnati and made his report . Three days later , on the evening of the 4th of May , a special train went up to Dayton , with a company of the i i5th Ohio , to arrest Mr. Vallandigham . Reaching Dayton they went at once to his house , where they arrived shortly before daylight , and demanded admittance . The orator appeared at an upper window and , being*informed of their business , and with it . . . the change of our present democratical form of government into an imperial despotism . . . . I do not support the war ; and to-day I bless God that not the smell of so much as one drop of its blood is upon my garments . . . . Our Southern brethren were to be whipped back into love and fellowship at the point of the bayonet . Oh , monstrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that after nearly six thousand years of folly and wickedness in every refused to allow them to enter . He began shouting in a loud voice ; pistols were fired from the house ; the signals were taken up in the town , and , according to some preconcerted arrangement , the fire bells began to toll . There was evidently no time to be lost . The soldiers forced their way into the house ; Vallandigham was compelled to make a hasty toilet , and was hurried to the cars , and the special train pulled out of the station before any considerable crowd could assemble . Arrivingat Cincinnati , Vallandigham was consigned to the military prison and kept in close confinement . During the day he contrived , however , to issue an address to the Democracy of Ohio , saying : I am here in a military bastile for no other offense than my political opinions , and the defense of them , and of the rights of the people , and of your constitutional liberties . . . . I am a Democrat - for the Constitution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - this is my only crime . . . . Meanwhile , Democrats of Ohio , of the North-west , of the United States , be firm , be true to your principles , to the Constitution , to the Union , and all will yet be well . . To you , to the whole people , to Time , I appeal . While he was issuing these fervid words his friends in Dayton were making their demonstration in another fashion . The town was filled with excitement all day . Crowds gathered on the streets discussing and denouncing the arrest . Great numbers of wagons loaded with rural friends and adherents of the agitator came in from the country and , the excitement increasing as night came on , a crowd of several hundred men moved , hooting and yelling , to the office of the Republican newspaper . Some one threw a brick at the building , then a volley of pistol shots was fired , and the excitement of the crowd wreaked itself on the unoffending building , which was first sacked , and then destroyed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived from Cincinnati , and before midnight the crowd was dispersed and order was restored . Mr. Vallandigham was promptly tried by a military commission , convened May 6 by General Burnside , consisting of officers of his staff and of the Ohio and Kentucky volunteers . Mr. Vallandigham made no individual objection to the court , but protested that they had no authority to try him ; that he was in neither the land nor naval forces of the United States , nor in the militia , and was therefore amenable only to the form and administration of government , theocratic , democratic , monarchic , oligarchic , despotic , and mixed , it was reserved to American statesmanship , in the nineteenth century of the Christian era , to try the grand experiment , on a scale the most costly and gigantic in its proportions , of creating love by force and developing fraternal affection by war , and history will record , too , on the same page , the utter disastrous and most bloody failure of the experiment . " // civil courts . This protest was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . It was proved that he made the speech of which we have already given an abstract . He called as witness in his defense Mr. S. S. Cox , who was also one of the orators of the occasion , and who testified that the speech of Mr. Vallandigham , though couched in strong language , was in no respect treasonable . When the evidence was all in , the accused entered a protest against the entire proceeding , repeating the terms of his original protest , and adding that his alleged offense itself was not known to the Constitution nor to any law thereof . " It is , " he said , " words spoken to the people of Ohio , in an open and public political meeting , lawfully and peaceably assembled under the Constitution and upon full notice . It is words of criticism of the public policy of the public servants of the people , by which policy it was alleged that the welfare of the country was not promoted . It was an appeal to the people to change that policy , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box . It is not pretended that I counseled disobedience to the Constitution or resistance to laws and lawful authority . I never have . Beyond this protest , I have nothing further to submit . " There were no speeches either in prosecution or in defense . When the court was cleared it remained in deliberation for three hours and returned a decision that the accused was guilty of the charge of " publicly expressing , in violation of General Order No. 38 , from Headquarters Department of the Ohio , his sympathy for those in arms against the Government of the United States , declaring disloyal sentiments and opinions , with the object and purpose of weakening the power of the Government in its efforts to suppress an unlawful rebellion . " They therefore sentenced him to be placed in close confinement in some fortress of the United States , to be designated by the commanding officer of the department , there to be kept during the continuance of the war . General Burnside approved the finding and the sentence , and designated Fort Warren , Boston Harbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But before the finding of the commission was made public , Mr. George E. Pugh , as counsel for Vallandigham , applied to judge Leavitt of the United States Circuit Court , sitting in Cincinnati , for a writ of habeas corpus . On the iith of May the case was heard , and extended arguments were made by Mr. Pugh in favor of the motion , and by Mr. Perry , who appeared on behalf of General Burnside , against it . But the most noticeable feature of the trial was a written address from General Burnside himself , presented to the district attorney , in which he explained and defended his VOL . XXXVIII. - i8. action . He began by saying that he was prohibited by law and by his duty from criticising the policy of the Government ; that such abstention from injurious criticism was binding on every one in the service . He then went on to say : If it is my duty and the duty of the troops to avoid saying anything that would weaken the army by preventing a single recruit from joining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disrepute , or by causing dissatisfaction in the ranks , it is equally the duty of every citizen in the department to avoid the same evil . . . . If I were to find a man from the enemy 's country distributing in my camp speeches of their public men that tended to demoralize the troops , or to destroy their confidence in the constituted authorities of the Government , I would have him tried and hung , if found guilty , and all the rules of modern warfare would sustain me . Why should such speeches from our own public men be allowed ? He even went so far as to disapprove the use of party names and party epithets , saying , " The simple names of patriot and traitor are comprehensive enough . " If the people he said do not approve the policy of the Government they can change the constitutional authorities at the propertime and by the proper method . Let them freely discuss the policy in a proper tone ; but my duty requires me to stop license and intemperate discussion , which tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whilst the latter is in the presence of the enemy it is cowardly so to weaken it . . . . There is no fear of the people losing their liberties ; we all know that to be the cry of demagogues , and none but the ignorant will listen to it . Judge Leavitt denied the motion for habeas corpus in a long decision , in which he thoroughly reviewed the legal points involved in the case . The essential point of his decision was this : General Burnside , by order of the President , had been appointed to the military supervision of the Department of the Ohio , includ. - ing , among other States , the State of Ohio . The precise extent of his authority was not known to the court , but it might properly be assumed that the President had clothed him with all the powers necessary to the efficient discharge of his duties . It is not claimed that in time of war the President is above the Constitution . He deriveshis power , on the contrary , expressly from the provision of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and navy . The Constitution does not specify the powers he may rightfully exercise in this character , nor are they defined by legislation . No one denies , however , that the President , in this character , is invested with very high powers , which he has exercised , as commander-in-chief , from time to time during the present rebellion . // His acts in this capacity must be limited to such as are deemed essential to the protection and preservation of the Government and the Constitution . And in deciding what he may rightfully do under this power , where there is no express legislative declaration , the President is guided solely by his own judgment , and is amenable only for an abuse of his authority by impeachment . The occasion which calls for the exercise of this power exists only from the necessity of the case ; and when the necessity exists there is a clear justification of the act . The judge concludes that if this view of the power of the President is correct , it implies the right to arrest persons who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the military operations of the Government . And if the necessity exists , I see no reason rhe said why the power does not attach to the officer in command of a military department . The President can not discharge the duties in person ; he , therefore , constitutes an agent to represent him , clothed with the necessary power for the efficient supervision of the military interests of the Government throughout the department . . . . In the exercise of his discretion General Burnside issued the order ( No. 38 ) which has been brought to the notice of the court . Judge Leavitt would not comment on that order , but only referred to it because General Burnside had stated his motives for issuing it , and also because it was for its supposed violation that he ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham . He had done this under his responsibility as the commanding general of the department , and in accordance with what he supposed to be the power vested in him by the appointment of the President . It was virtually an act of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Constitution , and the court therefore refused to annul or reverse it . The arrest , trial , and sentence of Vallandigham took the President somewhat by surprise , and it was only after these proceedings were consummated that he had an opportunity seriously to consider the case . If he had been consulted before any proceedings were initiated there is reason to believe he would not have permitted them ; 1 but finding himself in presence of an accomplished fact , the question 1 General Burnside , feeling , after the trial , that his act had subjected the Administration to violent attack , thought proper to signify to the President that his resignation was at his service if desired , to which the President answered : " When I shall wish to supersede you I will let you know . All the Cabinet regretted the necessity of arresting , for instance , Val. - landigham , some perhaps doubting there was a real necessity for it ; but , being done , all were for seeing you through with it . " Lincoln to Burnside , May 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether he should approve the sentence of the court , or , by annulling it , weaken the authority of the general commanding the district , and greatly encourage the active and dangerous secession element in the West . He concluded to accept the act of Burnside as within his discretion as military commander ; but as the imprisonment of Vallandigham in the North would have been a constant source of irritation and political discussion , the President concluded to modify his sentence to one which could be immediately and finally executed , and the execution of which would excite far less sympathy with the prisoner , and , in fact , seriously damage his prestige and authority among his followers . The method of punishment which he chose was doubtless suggested by a paragraph in Burnside 's Order No. 38 , which had mentioned , as a form of punishment for the declaration of sympathies with the enemy , deportation " beyond our lines into those of their friends . " He therefore commuted the sentence of Vallandigham , and directed that he be sent within the Confederate lines.2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Vallandigham was sent to Tennessee , and , on the 25th of May , was escorted by a small cavalry force to the Confederate lines near Murfreesboro ' . After a short parley with the rebel videttes , who made no objection to receiving the prisoner , he was delivered into the hands of a single private soldier of an Alabama regiment , Mr. Vallandigham making a formal protest to the effect that he was within the Confederate lines by force and against his will , and that he surrendered as a prisoner of war . The arrest and sentence of this distinguished Democrat produced a profound sensation throughout the country . It occasioned general rejoicing in the South . The Government in Richmond saw in it a promise of counter-revolution in the North , and some of the Confederate generals built upon it the rosiest hopes for future campaigns . General Beauregard , writing to a friend in Mobile , a said the Yankees , by sending Vallandigham into Bragg 's lines , had indicated a point of attack . He suggested that , Hooker being disposed of for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the 2 The order under which Vallandigham was sent South was dated the 19th of May and transmitted by telegraph from Washington to General Burnside : " The President directs that , without delay , you send C.

Let Bragg - or some better soldier who is sufficiently shadowed forth in parenthesis- " destroy or capture ( as it is done in Europe ) Rosecrans 's army ; then march into Kentucky ; raise 30,000 more men there and in Tennessee ; then get into Ohio and call upon the friends of Vallandigham to rise for his defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Missouri to throw off the yoke of the accursed Yankee nation ; then " - his plan growing more and more magnificent as it took grandeur and color under his pen - " call upon the whole North-west to join in the movement , form a Confederacy of their own , and join us by a treaty of alliance , defensive and offensive . What would then become of the North-east ? " demanded the doughty creole . " Hoxv long would it take us to bring it back to its senses ? " The feeling in the North , if less exuberant in its expression , was equally serious . No act of the Government has been so strongly criticised , and none having relation to the rights of an individual created a feeling so deep and so widespread . No further legal steps were taken in the case , except an application which was made by Vallandigham 's counsel for a writ of certiorari to bring up the proceedings of the military commission for review in the Supreme Court of the United States . This motion was denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be issued by the Supreme Court to any such military commission , as the court had no jurisdiction over the proceedings of such a tribunal . But in the Democratic newspapers , in public meetings , in a multitude of leading articles and pamphlets , the question was discussed with the greatest earnestness and even violence , the orators and politicians of the Democratic party regarding the incident as the most valuable bit of political capital which had fallen to them during the year . Even some of the most loyal newspapers of the North joined in the general attack , saying that by the statutes Vallandigham was a prisoner of state , and that the Secretary of War was bound to report him as such to the circuit judge of the district in which his supposed offenses were committed , to be regularly tried by the civil tribunal . But the principal criticism was , of course , confined to the ranks of the opposition . Their newspapers and public men vied with one another in a chorus of condemnation . To a meeting , held in Albany on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an act which has brought dishonor upon our country ; it is full of danger to our persons and our homes ; it bears upon its front a conscious violation of law and justice . . . . The transaction involved a series of offenses against our most sacred rights . It interfered with the freedom of speech ; it violated our rights to be secure in our homes against unreasonable searches and seizures ; it pronounced sentence without trial , save one which was a mockerywhich insulted as well as wronged . . . . If this proceeding is approved by the Government , and sanctioned by the people , it is not merely a step towards revolution-it is revolution ; it will not only lead to military despotism , it establishes military despotism . . . . If it is upheld , our liberties are overthrown . . . . The action of the Administration will determine , in the minds of more than onehalf of the people of the loyal States , whether the war is waged to put down rebellion at the South , or destroy free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with most solemn solicitude . The meeting to which Governor Seymour sent this passionate address passed a series of resolutions insisting upon their loyalty and the services they had rendered the country , but demanding that the " Administration shall be true to the Constitution , shall recognize and maintain the rights of the States and the liberties of the citizen , shall everywhere outside the lines of military occupation and the scenes of insurrection exert all its powers to maintain the supremacy of the civil over military law " ; and in view of these principles they denounced " the recent assumption of a military commander to seize and try a citizen of Ohio , Clement L. Vallandigham , for no other reason than words addressed to a public meeting in criticism of the military orders of that general . " The resolutions further set forth that such an assumption of military power strikes a fatal blow at the supremacy of law . They enumerated the provisions of the Constitution defining the crime of treason and the defenses to which those accused of that crime are entitled , and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the pretensions of arbitrary power were intended more especially for his protection in times of civil commotion . " They further re-solved : That in the election of Governor Seymour the people of this State , by an emphatic majority , declared their condemnation of the system of arbitrary arrests , and their determination to stand by the Constitution . And that , regarding the blow struck at a citizen of Ohio as aimed at the rights of every citizen of the North , they denounce it as against the spirit of our laws and Constitution , and most earnestly call upon the President of the United States to reverse the action of the military tribunal which has passed a cruel and unusual punishment upon the party arrested , prohibited in terms by the Constitution , and to restore him to the liberty of which he has been deprived . A copy of these resolutions was sent to the President and received his most careful consideration . He answered on the i 2th of June , in a letter which demands the close perusal of every student of our history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meeting for , the resolutions expressing the purpose of sustaining the cause of the Union despite the folly and wickedness of any administration . He referred to the safeguards of the Constitution for the defense of persons accused of treason , and contended that these provisions of the Constitution had no application to the case in hand . The arrests complained of were not made for the technical crime of treason . He then proceeded , in language so terse and vigorous that it is difficult to abridge a paragraph without positive mutilation , to describe the circumstances under which this rebellion began , and the hopes of the insurgents , which were founded upon the inveterate respect of the American people for the forms of law . Prior to my installation here he said it had been inculcated that any State had a lawful right to secede from the National Union , and that it would be expedient to exercise the right whenever the devotees of the doctrine should fail to elect a President to their own liking . I was elected contrary to their liking ; and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had taken seven States out of the Union , had seized many of the United States forts , and had fired upon the United States flag , all before I was inaugurated , and , of course , before I had done any official act whatever . The rebellion thus begun soon ran into the present civil war ; and , in certain respects , it began on very unequal terms between the parties . The insurgents had been preparing for it for more than thirty years , while the Government had taken no steps to resist them . The former had carefully considered all the means which could be turned to their account . It undoubtedly was a wellpondered reliance with them that in their own unrestricted efforts to destroy Union , Constitution , and law all together the Government would , in a great degree , be restrained by the same Constitution and law from arresting their progress . Their sympathizers pervaded all departments of the Government and nearly all communities of the people . From this material , under cover of " liberty of speech , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus , " they hoped to keep on foot amongst us a most efficient corps of spies , informers , suppliers , and aiders and abettors of their cause in a thousand ways . They knew that in times such as they were inaugurating , by the Constitution itself , the " habeas corpus " might be suspended ; but they also knew they had friends who would make a question as to who was to suspend it ; meanwhile their spies and others might remain at large to help on their cause . Or if , as has happened , the Executive should suspend the writ , without ruinous waste of time , instances of arresting innocent persons might occur , as are always likely to occur in such cases , and then a clamoid could be raised in regard to this , which might be at least of some service to the insurgent cause . It needed no very keen perception to discover that part of the enemy 's programme , so soon as , by open hostilities , their machinery was fairly put in motion . Yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals , I was slow to adopt the strong measures which by degrees I have been forced to regard as being within the exceptions of the Constitution , and as indispensable to the public safety . Nothing is better known to history than that courts of justice are utterly incompetent to such cases . Civil courts are organized chiefly for trials of individuals , or , at most , a few individuals acting in concert , and this in quiet times and on charges of crimes well defined in the law . Even in times of peace bands of horse-thieves and robbers frequently grow too numerous and powerful for the ordinary courts of justice . But what comparison in numbers have such bands ever borne to the insurgent sympathizers , even in many of the loyal States ? Again , a jury too frequently has at least one member more ready to hang the panel than to hang the traitor . And yet again , he who dissuades one man from volunteering , or induces one soldier to desert , weakens the Union cause as much as he who kills a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be so conducted as to be no defined crime of which any civil court would take cognizance . He then applied to the case in hand the clear provision of the Constitution that " the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended unless , when in case of rebellion or invasion , the public safety may require it , " and went on to say : This is precisely our present case - a case of rebellion wherein the public safety does require the suspension . Indeed , arrests by process of courts and arrests in cases of rebellion do not proceed altogether upon the same basis . The former is directed at the small percentage of ordinary and continuous perpetration of crime , while the latter is directed at sudden and extensive uprisings against the Government , which , at most , will succeed or fail in no great length of time . In the latter case arrests are made , not so much for what has been done as for what probably would be done . The latter is more for the preventive and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases the purposes of men are much more easily understood than in cases of ordinary crime . The man who stands by and says nothing when the peril of his Government is discussed can not be misunderstood . If not hindered , he is sure to help the enemy ; much more if he talks ambiguously - talks for his country with " buts " and " ifs " and " ands . " Of how little value the constitutional provisions I have quoted will be rendered , if arrests shall never be made until defined crimes shall have been committed , may be illustrated by a few notable examples . General John C. Breckinridge , General Robert E. Lee , General Joseph E. Johnston , General John B. Magruder , General William B. Preston , General Simon B. Buckner , and Commodore Franklin Buchanan , now occupying the very highest places in the rebel war service , were all within the power of the Government since the rebellion began , and were nearly as well known to be traitorsthen as now . Unquestionably , if we had seized and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But no one of them had then committed any crime defined in the law . Every one of them , if arrested , would have been discharged on habeas corpus were the writ allowed to operate . In view of these and similar cases , I think the time not // unlikely to come when I shall be blamed for having made too few arrests rather than too many . Referring to the charge made in the resolutions that Mr. Vallandigham was arrested for no other reason than words addressed to public meetings in criticism of the course of the Administration , Mr. Lincoln said : If this assertion is the truth and the whole truth ,  --  if there was no other reason for the arrest ,  - -  then I concede that the arrest was wrong . But he went on Mr. Vallandigham was not arrested because he was damaging the political prospects of the Administration , or the personal interests of the commanding general , but because he was damaging the army , upon the existence and vigor of which the life of the nation depends . He was warring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jurisdiction to lay hands upon him . If it could be shown that his arrest was made on mistake of fact , the President would be glad to correct it . But , he said : Long experience has shown that armies can not be maintained unless desertion shall be punished by the severe penalty of death . The case requires , and the law and the Constitution sanction , this punishment . Must I shoot a simple-minded soldier boy who deserts , while I must not touch a hair of a wily agitator who induces him to desert ? This is none the less injurious when effected by getting a father , or brother , or friend into a public meeting , and there working upon his feelings until he is persuaded to write the soldier boy that he is fighting in a bad cause , for a wicked Administration of a contemptible Government , too weak to arrest and punish him if he shall desert . I think that in such a case to silence the agitator and to save the boy is not only constitutional , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his belief that certain proceedings are constitutional when , in case of rebellion or invasion , the public safety requires them , which would not be constitutional when , in absence of rebellion or invasion , the public safety does not require them . The Constitution itself he said makes the distinction , and I can no more be persuaded that the Government can constitutionally take no strong measure in time of rebellion , because it can be shown that the same could not be lawfully taken in time of peace , than I can be persuaded that a particular drug is not good medicine for a sick man , because it can be shown to not be good food for a well one . Nor am I able to appreciate the danger apprehended by the meeting that the American people will , by means of military arrests during the Rebellion , lose the right of public discussion , the liberty of speech and the press , the law of evidence , trial by jury , and habeas corpus , throughout the indefinite peaceful future , which I trust lies before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a man could contract so strong an appetite for emetics , during temporary illness , as to persist in feeding upon them during the remainder of his healthful life . The President parried the political thrust in the resolutions by reminding the gentlemen of Albany that although they addressed him as " Democrats , " not all Democrats were of their way of thinking . He on whose discretionary judgment Mr. Vallandigham was arrested and tried is a Democrat , having no old party affinity with me ; and the judge who rejected the constitutiona.l view expressed in these resolutions by refusing to discharge Mr. Vallandigham on habeas corpus is a Democrat of better days than these , having received his judicial mantle at the hands of President Jackson . And still more , of all those Democrats who are nobly exposing their lives and shedding their blood on the battlefield , I have learned that many approve the course taken with Mr. Vallandigham , while I have not heard of a single one condemning it . The President fortified his argument by an incident of pertinent history especially adapted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made by General Jackson at New Orleans ; his defiance of the writ of habeas corpus , and his imprisonment of the judge who had issued it . Near the close of this strong and adroit defense of the action of Burnside the President made a remarkable admission in these words : And yet let me say that in my own discretion I do not know whether I would have ordered the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham . While I can not shift the responsibility from myself , I hold that , as a general rule , the commander in the field is the better judge of the necessity in any particular case . . It gave me pain when I learned that Mr. Vallandigham had been arrested ,  --  that is , I was pained that there should have seemed to be a necessity for arresting him ,  --  and it will afford me great pleasure to discharge him so soon as I can , by any means , believe the public safety will not suffer by it . I further say that as the war progresses it appears to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first , take shape and fall into more regular channels , so that the necessity for strong dealing with them gradually decreases . have every reason to desire that it should cease altogether , and far from the least is my regard for the opinions and wishes of those who , like the meeting at Albany , declare their purpose to sustain the Government in every constitutional and lawful measure to suppress the rebellion . Still I must continue to do so much as may seem to be required by the public safety . There are few of the President 's state papers which produced a stronger impression upon the public mind than this . Its tone of candor and courtesy , which did not conceal his stern and resolute purpose ; his clear statement of the needs of the country ; his terse argument of his authority under the Constitution to suspend the writ of habeas corpus when , in case of rebellion , the public safety required it ; his contrast of the venial crime of the simpleminded soldier boy , which was punished by // death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claimed immunity through the Constitution he was endeavoring to destroy ; the strong , yet humorous , common sense of his doubt whether a permanent taste for emetics could be contracted during a fit of sicknessmet with an immediate and eager appreciation among the citizens of the country , and rendered this letter remarkable in the long series of iVir Lincoln 's political writings . It is needless to say that it did not meet with equal apl ) robation in all quarters . It was received by the politicians of New York , to whom it was addressed , with the gravest displeasure . They answered in an angry yet forcible paper , claiming that the original act of tyranny by which Mr. Vallandigham was arrested had been aggravated by the claim of despotic power which they assumed to find in the President 's letter . They wrote with so much heat and feeling that they hardly paused to measure their epithets ; otherwise they would scarcely have been guilty of the impertinence of speaking to the President of his " pretensions to more than legal authority , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloudy forms of expression " in which these pretensions are set forth . But it is not worth while to rescue either of these letters from the oblivion which soon overtook them . In the words of Mr. Lincoln on another occasion , " the world little noted nor long remembered them . " Their first letter had no function nor result but to call into being the President 's admirable reply , and the second was little more than a cry under punishment . In the State of Ohio the arrest of Mr. Vallandigham had precipitated an issue which was in its solution greatly to the advantage of the cause of the Union . XVhen , on the **th of June , the Democratic convention of the State met at Columbus , it was found to be completely under the control of those opposed to the war , and the excitement consequent upon Vallandigham 's arrest and banishment designated him as the only serious candidate for the office of governor . Nominating him by acclamation was the readiest and most practical way of signifying their disapproval of the proceedings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their devotion to the Union , denouncing the arrest and banishment of Vallandigham as a forcible violation of the Constitution and a direct insult offered to the sovereignty of the people of Ohio , saying that the Democratic party was fully competent to decide whether Mr. Vallandigham was a fit man to be nominated for governor , and that the attempt to deprive them of that right by his arrest and banishment was an unmerited imputation upon their intelligence and loyalty . They therefore called upon the President to restore Mr. Vallandigham to his home in Ohio . The committee appointed to present these resolutions accompanied them with a long letter signed by the most prominent Democrats of Ohio , arguing , upon lines similar to those followed in the Albany letter , that the action of the Government towards Vallandigham was illegal and unconstitutional ; that it had created widespread and alarming disaffection among the people of the State ; that it was not an offense against any law to contend that the war could not be used as a means of restoring the Union , or that a war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both the Constitution and the Union . They took up the President 's letter to the Albany committee and insisted that Mr. Vallandigham was not warring upon the military ; they disagreed entirely with the President on the subject of the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus ; they represented the President as claiming that the Constitution is different in time of insurrection or invasion from what it is in time of peace or public security , and that he had the right to engraft limitations or exceptions upon these constitutional guarantees whenever , in his judgment , the public safety required it . Having attributed to him these absurd pretensions , they proceeded solemnly to deny them , and ask : If an indefinable kind of constructive treason is to be introduced and engrafted upon the Constitution unknown to the laws of the land and subject to the will of the President whenever an insurrection or invasion shall occur in any part of this vast country , what safety or security will be left for the liberties of the people ? The President sent a reply to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albany , and not so full in its discussion of the constitutional question at issue . For his views in this regard he referred the Ohio committee to his Albany letter . He simply repudiated the opinions and intentions which the Ohio committee had gratuitously imputed to him . But he assumed the full responsibility for the exercise of the enormous powers which he believed the Constitution , under the circumstances , conferred upon him . You ask , in substance , whether I really claim that I may override all the guaranteed rights ofindividuals on the plea of conserving the public safety-when I may choose to say the public safety requires it . This question , divested of the phraseology calculated to represent me as struggling for an arbitrary personal prerogative , is either simply a question who shall decide , or an affirmation that nobody shall decide , what the public safety does require in cases of rebellion or invasion . The Constitution contemplates the question as likely to occur for decision , // but it does not expressly declare who is to decide it . By necessary implication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be made , from time to time , and I think the man whom , for the time , the people have , under the Constitution , made the commander-in-chief of their army and navy , is the man who holds the power , and bears the responsibility of making it . If he uses the power justly , the same people will probably justify him ; if he abuses it , he is in their hands to be dealt with by all the modes they have reserved to themselves in the Constitution . He disclaimed , in courteous language , any purpose of insult to Ohio in Mr. Vallandigham 's case ; and referring to the peremptory request of the committee that Vallandigham should be released from his sentence , and to the further claim of the committee that the Democracy of Ohio are loyal to the Union , he proposed , on what he considered very easy conditions , to comply with their request . He offered them the following propositions : i . That there is now a rebellion in the United States , the object and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that , in your opinion , an army and navy are constitutional means for suppressing that rebellion . 2 . That no one of you will do anything which , in his own judgment , will tend to hinder the increase or favor the decrease or lessen the efficiency of the army and navy , while engaged in the effort to suppress that rebellion and 3 . That each of you will , in his sphere , do all he can to have the officers , soldiers , and seamen of the army and navy , while engaged in the effort to suppress the rebellion , fed , clad , and otherwise well provided for and supported . If the committee , or a majority of them , would write their names upon the back of the President 's letter , thus committing themselves to these propositions and to nothing else , he would then publish the letter and the names , which publication would be , within itself , a revocation of Vallandigham 's sentence . This would leave Mr. Vallandigham himself absolutely unpledged ; the President 's objectbeingto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral reinforcement from this clear definition of the attitude of the other gentlemen as to compensate for any damage that Mr. Vallandigham could possibly do on his return . The President concluded this letter with the same frankness 1 John B. Jones , a clerk in the rebel war office , made on the 22d of June , 1863 , the following entry in his diary : " To-day I saw the memorandum of Mr. Ould , of the conversation held with Mr. Vallandigham , for file in the archives . He says if we can only hold out this year that the peace party of the North would sweep the Lincoln dynasty out of political existence . He seems to have thought that our cause was sinking , and feared we , would submit , which would , of course , be ruinous to his party . But he advises strongly against any invasion of Pennsylvania , for that would unite all that he used in that to Albany . " Still , " he said , " in regard to Mr. Vallandigham and all others , I must hereafter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service may seem to require . " This overture of the President was promptly rejected by the committee . They treated it as an evasion on his part of the questions involved in the case , and as implying not only an imputation upon their own sincerity and fidelity as citizens of the United States , but also a concession of the l*gality of Mr. Vallandigham 's arrest and banishment . Evidently nothing could come from negotiations with parties whose points of view were so far apart as those of the President and the Democratic leaders in New York and Ohio . The case must be resolved by the people of the State whose sovereignty it was said had been violated , and the issue was made in the clearest possible manner by the nomination of Mr. Vallandigham for governor of Ohio . The convention which nominated him determined to leave no doubt of their position , not only denouncing the action of General Burnside and the President , but expressing their deep humiliation and regret at the failure of Governor Tod of Ohio to protect the citizens of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Union party , meeting at Columbus , nominated for governor John Brough , a war Democrat , and adopted a brief platform of unqualified devotion to the Union , in favor of a most vigorous prosecution of the war , and the laying aside of personal preferences and prejudices , and pledging hearty support to the President . Upon this issue the canvass proceeded to its close . Before it ended , Mr. Vallandigham himself intervened once more - not in person , indeed , but by letters from Canada . On entering the rebel lines he had gone at once to Richmond , where he was kindly and courteously received by the Confederate authorities , although both on his side and on theirs the forms appropriate to the fiction that he was a prisoner of war were carefully observed.1 After a conference with the leading men of the Confederate Government , he went southward and arrived on the 22d of June at Bermuda in a vessel called the Lady Davis , which had run the blockade at Wilmington . He made only a brief stay in Bermuda and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands that he would be able to crush all opposition and trample upon the constitutional rights of the people . Mr. V. said nothing to indicate that either he or the party had any other idea than that the Union would be reconstructed under Democratic rule . The President Davis indorsed with his own pen on this document that in regard to invasion of the North experience proved the contrary of what Mr. V. asserted . " Jones , " A Rebel War Clerk 's Diary , " Vol . I. , pp. 357 , 358. // passage for Halifax , Nova Scotia , where he arrived on the 5th of July . From the Canadian side of Niagara Falls he issued an address to the people of Ohio , 1 which began with this clever and striking exordium : Arrested and confined for three weeks in the United States a prisoner of state , banished thence to the Confederate States , and there held as an alien enemy and prisoner of war , though on parole , fairly and honorably dealt with , and given leave to depart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hazard of being fired upon by ships flying the flag of my own country , I found myself first a free man when on British soil .

Six weeks ago , when just going into banishment because an audacious but most cowardly despotism caused it , I addressed you as a fellow-citizen . To-day , and from the very place then selected by me , but after wearisome and most perilous journeyings for more than four thousand miles by land and upon sea , still . in exile , though almost within sight of my native State , I greet you as your representative .

Traveling a thousand miles or more , through nearly one-half of the Confederate States , and sojourning for a time at widely different points , I met not one man , woman , or child who was not resolved to perish rather than to yield to the pressure of arms , even in the most desperate extremity . He announced , therefore , that he returned with his opinion in favor of peace not only unchanged , but confirmed and strengthened . 1 " Rebellion Records , " Vol . VII .

After the result of the Ohio election had convinced Vallandigham that little was to be expected in the way of peace from the efforts of the Democratic party , he wrote Jewett a letter strongly favoring an immediate acceptance of the mediation of France in the controversy between the States . He said : " The South and the North are both But nothing availed . Mr. Vallandigham was defeated by the unprecedented majority of 101,000 votes , 62,000 of which were cast in the State and 39,000 by the soldiers in the field , to whom a State statute had given the privilege of voting . In view of this overwhelming defeat , Mr. Vallandigham thought it prudent to remain during the winter beyond the jurisdiction of the United States . He was in constant correspondence , however , with his associates and adherents , 2 and demonstrations were made from time to time against the Government for its treatment of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pendleton of Ohio offered a resolution in the House of Representatives that the arrest and banishment of Mr. Vallandigham were " acts of mere arbitrary power in palpable violation of the Constitution and laws of the United States , " which was rejected by a strict party vote , 47 Democrats voting in favor of it , and 77 Union members voting against it , only two Democrats voting with the majonty . Vallandigham 's course in opposition to the war had been so exasperating to the Union sentiment of the country , his speeches had been so full of vehement malice , that even those who thought his original arrest an unjustifiable stretch of military power felt no sympathy with the object of it and were inclined to acquiesce in the President 's disposition of the case . The situation was not without a humorous element also , to which the American mind is always hospitable .

The South has proved her ability to maintain herself by her own strength and resources , without foreign aid , moral or material ; and the North and West - the whole country , indeed - these great powers have served incalculably , by holding back a solemn proclamation to the world that the Union of these States was finally and formally dissolved .

But as the effect of them was clearly beneficial to the Union cause , no means were taken to silence him . He defied the Government and the army ; he made vague threats that in case he was arrested the persons and property of those instigating such a proceeding should be held as hostages.2 He was not molested , and in August was allowed to take a prominent part in the National Democratic Convention at Chicago , where he rendered valuable service to the Union party3 as chairman of the Committee on Resolutions , and offered the motion that the nomination of General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
