txt Mr. Belford , of Colorado , introduced in the House to-day a bill having for its object the retirement of one and two dollar notes and the substitution therefor of standard silver dollars . The bill provides that in place of the legal-tender notes of denominations less than $5 that may now be in the Treasury , or that may hereafter be presented for redemption , the Secretary of the Treasury shall substitute notes of higher denominations equal to the value of the smaller notes redeemed , and that hereafter notes of less denomination than $.5 shall not be printed . Under existing law , the denominations of United States notes to be issued , is left discretionary with the Secretary of the Treasury . The value of the one and two dol . Jar notes now outstanding is about $40,000,000 , that amount being nearly equally divided between the two denominations . The passage of Mr. Belford 's bill would substitute standard silver dollars for these notes and force that number of silver dollars into circulation . The bill was referred to the Committee on Banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a favorable recommendation . It is not probable , however , that the bill will be passed by the House , for the reason that there is decided opposition to any change in the direction proposed in consequence of the great convenience of one and two dollar notes in ismall transactions , and in forwarding small sums through the mails . The advocates of the silver dollar will be compelled to devise some method other than the sacrifice of the one and two dollar notes to force their favorite coins into general circulation . A better method would be to repeal so much of the silver dollar act as compels the Treasurer of the United States to exchange silver dollars for certificates upon theapplication of any holder of 10 of those coins or multiples of that number .
