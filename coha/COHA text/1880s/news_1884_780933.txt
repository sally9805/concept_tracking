txt The community was startled this morning by a report that Henry S. Church , the City Chamberlain , and one of Troy 's leading citizens , had absconded , and was a defaulter for a very large sum . The report was not credited at first , but when its truth was shown everybody was shocked , and in such great esteem was the missing man held that not an unkind word was said of him . Upon Mr. Fitzgerald 's accession to the Mayoralty many persons thought that Mr. Church would be suspended , as had been done in the case of the Controller . On Dec. 1 , 1882 , Mr. Church , acting under a provision of the charter which authorizes the Chamberlain to designate a person to fill his place in case of sickness or absence , appointed Samuel 0 . Gleason . This appointment was found in the vault yes-terday , and Mr. Gleason , being informed of its existence , assumed to take possession of the office the morning when it was known that Mr. Church had absconded . This action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kemp to act , but the trouble was amicably settled by an agreement that Messrs . Gleason and Kemp should remain in charge until Mr. Church 's successor qualified . Mr. Church left Troy on Monday night , ostensibly to go to Springfield , Mass. , and said he would return on Wednesday or Thursday . This information he gave to his brother , who had charge of the stove foundry owned by the missing man . But Mr. Church told a different story to his deputy , the Hon. W. V. Cleary , who on Tuesday received a note saying , " Shall hardly be able to get to the office before dinner . " An examination of the Chamberlain 's books to-day disclosed a defalcation of $77,600 , and it is feared the amount will reach $100,000 . Mr. Church obtained the funds by drawing upon the banks in which the city funds are deposited . He had sole access to the bank books and it was not a difficult matter for him to snake it appear on the books of the department that he had much larger deposits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last appearance at the office , Mr. Cleary , his deputy , snakes the following statement : " About 5 o'clock on Monday afternoon Mr. Church said to me that the Mayor was anxious for him to pay off the street-sweepers , the fund being exhausted , and Mr. Church sent the clerk , Kyran Cleary , to the Manufacturers ' Bank after the money . The clerk got $1,300 , but it only took about $3,010 to pay the street-sweepers . Mr. Church wanted the Controller to countersign the drafts . ' When I came to figure up the accounts the $4,300 was not to be found among the rest of the currency . I afterward found it in a little iron safe In the vault . I got through about 5 o'clock , and Mr. Church came in just before I left the office . He asked for the Mayor . He seemed to be anxious to pay off the men . At 6 o'clock I went to the vault , but I could not find two amounts , $1,800 and $2,500 , which should have been there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that was gone . I did not think anything about the matter , more than this : I supposed Mr. Church had either used the money to pay off or he had thought $8,500 was too much to have in the office and had put it in his pocket . The discrepancy became known this morning when the school-teachers came for their salaries . I had no money to pay them . I went to Mr. Church 's house and told his wife that I could not stand it any longer , and that if Mr. Church did not appear at the office at once I should have to inform Mr. Fitzgerald . Mrs. Church appeared to feel badly . and said if there was anything wrong it would have to come out some time . It is thought that the city will have to bear the whole loss . When Mr. Church was first appointed about six years ago he gave bonds for $50,000 , the following persons justifying for $5,000 each : S. 0 . Gleason , Edward Murphy , jr. , A. L. Hotchkiss . II @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IL Burton , Charles Eddy , . Tared L. Bacon , and Levi Williard . Of these Mr. Bacon is dead and Mr. Eddy is insolvent . Church gave no new bond when lie was reappointed . The Court of Appeals has decided that bonds do not lap over from one term to another , and unless there was a defalcation in Church 's first term the sureties on the first-bond are not liable for the amount of loss to the city . Recently Controller Spicer asked Church to renew his bond , and one was made out , but was never executed and delivered . It is thought that the entire defalcation was made during the present term , and that the old bondsmen are therefore not liable . Mr. Church was a heavy loser by the failure of the stove firm of Potter &; Co. , and it is thought he used the city 's money to speculate with the hope of making sufficient to retrieve his losses . At a meeting of the Common Council three weeks ago the Finance Committee was directed to investigate the finances of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was anything wrong in the department . The committee on Saturday informed Mr. Church that they would shortly make the examination , and , know . ing that an exposure was certain , he decided to flee . His whereabouts are not known , and while many believe he sailed for Europe yesterday , two Trojans claim to have seen him in Montreal last evening . A warrant for his arrest was issued this afternoon charging him with larceny in the first degree , and the Mayor this evening offered a reward of $2,000 for the arrest of the fugitive . Telegrams describing him have been sent to many places , and his photographs have been sent all over the country . The Common Council this evening confirmed Mr. B. H. Hall as Mr. Church 's successor . A suit to recover the amount due the city has been begun , and this evening the foundry property and the furniture , &c.,; in Mr. Church 's residence were attached . A bill of sale executed in 1871 covering the foundry property was produced , and Mrs. Church claims the property at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a woman accompanied Mr. Church in his flight . Mr. Church leaves a wife and four children here . The missing man was also a member of the Board of Water Commissioners , and was organist of St. John 's Church .
