THE CONTRIBUTORS ' CLUB . The Science WnITEns spend much time of Names , and thought in selecting a name for a play or novel , for they know that success is largely dependent on it . Parents , however , are strangely careless and unscientific in giving names to children . In the Harvard and Yale catalogues of last year I find but two or three really good combinations . Usually , when a new-coiner arrives , some old family name is taken ; or if the parents exercise an original choice , they are too much excited to be guided by any sound euphonic principles . They forget that not only from the social point of view it is very advantageous to have one 's name remembered , but that from the business point of view notoriety is capital , and must be obtained by persistent and ingenious advertising . But if a certain 134 July , // 135 amount of notoriety could be obtained for John Smith by an expenditure of time , money , and ingenuity represented by x , and spread over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the same amount could be obtained for Hans Arrowsmith by * in eighteen months . Nor is the saving of time and money on the part of the knocker at the gate of notoriety the only thing to be considered , for , from the altruistic point of view , the lessening of the effort of recollection on the part of the world is far more important . The economy of the public stock of energy wasted in innumerable unconscious efforts to remember a name without any corners for the memory to grasp , but persistently thrust before it , would result in an increase of available mental force applicable to settling the question of future probation , or to raising the ethical standard , or to reforming the tariff , or to disposing of the surplus . The importance of the subject leads me to suggest one or two of the chief fundamental principles of the science of naming children . The system is simple , and any provident parent can easily master and apply it . ( 1 . ) Avoid odd , or eccentric , or poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is true that an odd name may be remembered , but the associations with it will not be pleasing . The idea of oddity or affectation may attach to the shadowy personality built up in the mind of the public . Under this rule , hyphenated names , especially hyphenated Christian names , like FloydJones Robinson , are to be avoided . Writing the first given name with an initial and the second in full is also evidently opposed to correct scientific principles . ( 2 . ) The best form of name is a dactyl and a spondee , like " Jeremy Taylor . " Every one has heard of the " Shakespeare of divines , " and has a dim idea of an agreeable personallty attached to the name . Had his name been Charles Taylor , it is far within bounds to say that his reputation would be about one third of what it is now . ( 3 . ) If the surname is not one that can be treated according to the above rule , it should be fitted with a given name , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the above length and cadence , as , Sidney Dobell , Ellery Vane , Henry Ward Beecher , Dante Rossetti , rrheodore Watts , and the like ; or , otherwise , to two long syllables , like Mark Twain or Bret Harte . The subdivisions of this branch of the subject are too numerous to be given , but all rest on principle No. 2 . The phonic value of the surname is , under our custom , the controlling element in practically applying the science of names . The great value of names beginning with Mac or 0 is evident , because they so readily combine with the ordinary Christian names . Any one would be favorably disposed to Arthur O'Connor , for instance . A boy pervades our quiet neighborhood simply because his name is Johnny MacWhorter . He is not in any respect a remarkable boy , but his name forccs him into prominence by its phonic value . There are some ten or twelve boys who are comrades , but he and another dactyl-spondee boy , Emory Watson , are the only ones ever spoken of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mischief and make more noise , but these two reap all the fame . The nicknames given by children and base-ball players will be found to conform pretty closely to the true principles of the art . I have formed names for my three boys in accordance with these rules , which will give the youngsters - if they ever appear - a start in life equivalent to a cash capital of at least fifteen thousand dollars . As their appellations will probably constitute their entire patrimony , I can not be expected to mention them until they are securely attached to the inchoate personalities . I have indicated the outlines of the method , so // that any young parent can , with a little tiiought , construct as many names as he is likely to need . What Pes- - That pleasant little story simism * . which has been told so often , and never better than in the sixth chapter of My Novel , about the inexpediency of attacking those high in favor , received an unlooked-for illustration at my expense , when , awhile ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monthly that I thought Mr. Browning 's poetry was of the pessimistic order . I have learned since that if eternal vigilance be the price of freedom , eternal warfare is the portion of the heretic . Thrice have I been summoned to appear and make good my words before those mysterious tribunals called Browning Societies , whole roomfuls of hardened enthusiasts , more terrible to face , I should imagine , - for cowardice forbade the ordeal , - than the Vehmgerichte or the Holy Office . I have been guilelessly conversing with casual acquaintances upon the most trivial of topics , the weather or the insufficiency of the city railways , when suddenly my companion has turned upon me with an " intense " expression which Du Maurier might envy , and has asked in tones of chilling condemnation , " Will you please tell me what you meant by calling Browning a pessimist ? " And at last , when I trusted that my offense was well-nigh forgotten , a very able contributor to the Atlantic comes forward with a whip of scorpions , and tells me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , but also - and here , alas ! is the sting - that I have probably " missed the poet 's plain meaning through too little attention to the verse itself , and too much to the superabundance of comment upon it . " Now I am far from disparaging the good old conservative practice of reviewing an author before you read him . One wiser and wittier than we has recorded his conviction that it is the best and surest way to avoid prejudice . Neither do I censure those who follow the critics ' judgment rather than their own , for it is just possible that they may arrive at more correct conclusions . But in this case , at least , I am innocent of the charge . I have read Browning , and I have not read his reviewers , with the one exception of Mr. Birrell , whose very charming and amusing essay can hardly be held responsible for any portion of my guilt . I have listened with Elvire to her husband 's lengthy and pitiless self-analysis , and have wondered if her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over . I have followed comfortless lovers to whom love is seldom sweet , and unmasked rogues and hypocrites who contemplate their own inwardness with a zest which is all the more inexplicable when we consider what it is they see . I have watched Martin Reiph unpeeling his soul layer by layer , as if it were an onion , and would honestly rather see Count Guido Franceschini stretched quivering on the rack , pulled " hone from bone , To unhuak truth a-hiding in its hulls , " than witness the more terrible self-inflicted torture . And all for what ? It is as easy to build up a theory out of selected quotations from a poet as to build up a religion out of selected quotations from the Scriptures . I should be loath to put forward such lines as these : - " For I was true , at least -0 true enough ! And , dear , truth is not as good as it seems ! Commend me to conscience ! Idle stuff ! Much help is mine , as I mope and pine , And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even these : " We mortals cross the ocean of this worW , Each in his average cabin of a life . The best s not big , the worst yields elbow-room ; " and then say , " The whole stuff of Browning 's thought is indicated by such citations . " But I think that he strikes // the key-note of his work when he confesses the " Doubts at the very basis of my soul At the grand moments when she probes her-self ; and the eternal probing for what is meant to lie beyond our touch can never yield us anything save perplexity and pain . Ruskin 's dJbonnaire advice not to think enough about ourselves to be even sorry for our faults is more wholesome , after all , than this dispiriting and horrible self-scrutiny . " T is an awkward thing to play with souls , " says the author of Sordello and The Ring and the Book , while all the time his fingers fairly itch to handle these shrinking , suffering toys . " Well , now , there s nothing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cries in self-defense , and then acknowledges that if you fancy this coveted truth " May look for vindication from the world , Much will you have misread the signs , I say . " Nevertheless , to be perpetually searching for it by the analytic process has become a recognized j*astime and a religious duty . We grow sodden with speculation , while the great world rolls carelessly on its way , very little the better for our trouble . Browning , indeed , has unswervingly taught the existence of another and a higher life , and if the contributor be right in asserting that " religion and pessimism are incompatible , " then there is nothing further to be said . But to claim that our earthly happiness hinges necessarily on our immortal hopes is to cut off entirely that body of thinkers who believe that in this world alone they must find the fulfillment of their being . On the other hand , while scientific pessimists , as they choose to call themselves , may affirm that blind forces control the universe , the question for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which lies in the hands of God , but sim ply of the present , of life as life itself . If , in our journey to the tomb , we find more to suffer than to enjoy , then , whatever may be the compensations of the future , our earthly pilgrimage is a burden to be endured rather than a privilege to be relished , and he is happiest who escapes soonest from the struggle . When Bossuet said that man goes to his grave , " trainant Ut chaine de ses espe'rances bris6es , " he was as fully convinced of the immortality of his soul as ever Browning could be ; but none the less he felt the drag of the fetters , and knew that his brightest hour would be the dawn of his release . If there are those to whom the world and our enforced existence in it are rendered cheerful by Browning 's lancet point , I can only say that I am glad they have that consolation . For most of us the panacea lies in action rather than in thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's remedies . The contributor points out triumphantly that even Cleon , the pagan poet , " could imagine a state of being above the present , in which joy-hunger should be satisfied , if Zeus the All-Wise were the All-Loving too . " We hold our hopes on a somewhat surer ground than an imagined possibility , which does not sound particularly reassuring ; but we listen rather sadly while this same Cleon confesses that he too agrees iii sum , o king , with thy profound discouragement , Who seest the wider but to sigh the more . Most progress is most failure ! thou sayest well . " Mr. Steven- - Mr. Stevenson 's literary son and Mr. work is in itself a subject of James . such lively interest that any intelligent comment upon it partakes in some degree of that interest . In Mr. James 's discriminating eulogy lately published in the Century Magazine , I note a point or two on which to differ from , or at least to question , the critic 's judgment , though for the most part I heart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happily expressed . - // The first point on which I would like to contravene Mr. James is the alleged want of appreciation of so delightful a romancer by persons of my own sex . It is not women who most fall in love with him , says Mr. James . It may be true that Mr. Stevenson can not count among his admirers as many women as men ; but it may be asserted with confidence that no man can go beyond certain women in love for the author of Prince Otto and Kidnapped . I can speak for myself , who lost my heart to him at first sight , - reading , I mean , - on taking up the New Arabian Nights , and every fresh revelation of his gifts and graces has endeared him the more . I have a woman friend , already bound to me by many ties , between whom and myself a new bond has been forged by our common delight in Mr. Stevenson . We are agreed in differing from Mr. Jafries , when he characterizes Prince Otto as " inhuman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and glitter is apt to be " hard ; " yet after all , what is this little story if not a love tale , - a tale in which hero and heroine are brought , through trial , to accept love as the sufficient compensation for a lost self-complacency , a lost ambition , and a throne ? On a first reading , Prince Otto disappointed and puzzled me , but I have since discovered it to be a grown folks ' fairy-tale , as full of truth and poetry as of wit and cleverness . And if it had no definite meaning , I should still find each page fascinating for its own sake . I can not think with Mr. James that what Mr. Stevenson most cares for is youth , or that " the direct expression of the love of youth is the beginning and end of his message . " If we can say that he has one message , it does not seem to me to be this . A thought to which the author of An Inland Voyage and Familiar Studies of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom lies in following his nature and its instincts , rather than the conventions of the world ; that a free life , in which a man chooses his own friends , pursuits , and pleasures , is the healthy and happy life . Another idea he constantly presents is the supreme worth of love and friendship . No author has written fiction with less of the passion of love in it , but in the short essays above referred to the reader finds Mr. Stevenson making confession of faith in the infinite value of these sentiments , the love of woman and of friend . He cares most , " I think , not precisely for youth , but for life , and for youth as the embodiment of the fullness of fresh , vigorous , and unconventionalized life . This partly accounts for his delight in adventure , heroism , and personal gallantry , which are manifestations of life raised to the highest pitch of activity and vivid interest . To an invalid it is not strange that the ideal of happiness should appear a life full of out-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts . A Child 's Garden of Verse is dedicated to the nurse who tended the author through the years of a delicate childhood ; and one feels sure that the verses are all autobiographical , memory 's record of the fancies and feelings of an imaginative child much shut up to his own lonely thoughts . In the volume called Underwoods there is a little poem , written in the quaint style of George Herbert , which in a few lines contains a special philosophy of life . It is entitled The Celestial Surgeon , and begins thus : - " If I have faltered more or less In my great task of happiness . " That is what the pursuit of happiness becomes to some of us , - a task , to be persevered in with resolute courage ; and not on every one is bestowed , in aid of that task , the gift of imagination , in virtue of which , though the body be bound to one spot , and that a sick-bed , one yet inhabits the universe and ranges it at will . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in calling the feeling which constitutes one half of our author 's literary character merely or chiefly the " feeling of one 's teens . " It is true that we have to do with an artist accomplished even to sophistication , whose theme is very often the unsophisticated , yet not " constantly . " Mr. Stevenson has a kindness for vagabonds and Bohemians , persons sophisticated enough generally , but tinctured with the philosophy he approves , of living one 's own life , going one 's own way , and choosing one 's own pleasures . The critic described Mr. Stevenson 's writings , Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde and Prince Otto , apart , as a rhapsody on boyhood . Do the two series of New Arabian Nights or The Merry Men come under this head ? Apropos of the last mentioned volume , I have noticed that critics beside Mr. James have picked out Thrawn Janet for commendation . It is an admirably told tale , of course , but the subject was made to Mr. Stevenson 's hand , so to speak , and has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Mill , or Markheim , the pendant of Dr. Jekyll . The Treasure of Tranchard pleased me for the engaging lightness with which its moral is set forth . The Average It may be rather late in Man 's Ver- the day to open once more dict. the vexed question of the in fallibility of editors ' judgments , but I do so with serene confidence , because I am the one person who ought to be heard from . I am , in fact , the court of appeals who sits in banc to sustain or reverse the editors ' rulings . Do not confound me with the " regular subscriber , " who has all the volumes of the magazine bound and ranged on his shelves , nor with the " omnivorous reader , " who buys all the magazines and throws them away , little the worse , as he is none the better , for the reading . Those people are of little consequence . I am the average man , and editors know that my tastes must be consulted . Literature is written for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many years ago , when I was abroad , I found that an intelligent official had filled in the blanks in my passport with the one descriptive adjective ordinctire , which stood at the top of a long column of dittos . Thus , I was declared to be of " taille ordinaire , bouche ordinaire , nez ordinaire , menton ordinaire , yeux ordinaire , cheveux ordinaire , " and so on , through a minute catalogue of my physical parts and qualities . I was young then , and , with my average knowledge of French , was deeply hurt to find that , to the *fficial eye , there was nothing to distinguish me from my fellow mortals ; but I have since reflected that this very fact proves me to be " myself alone , " and that my position as a typical man was a proud one , and now I glory in it . I am of average intelligence , average culture , average income , average prejudices . I hit the jusie milieu . What prompts me to buy a magazine ? I approach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ministers say nowadays , when they approach the discussion of the use of a ritual , " my position on this point is , on the whole , a meliorating one . " I buy on impulse . No doubt the craving for good literature influences me in the long run , and no doubt I am influenced by persistent advertising in a particular purchase ; but neither of these motives counts for much in swaying my average mind . I open the magazine on the counter of some book-store , or as it alights in my lap with a whirl from the deft hand of the train-boy . I take it up because I have some pleasant associations with the color of the cover , or with the name . If in the list of writers I see some name which awakens in me reminiscences of a pleasant quarter of an hour , I give my money . T is a little matter decides me . Do not say that I buy for the sake of // amusement , and must be guaranteed beforehand . I enjoy the flavor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor can anybody predict that a new dish will please me . Therefore , angry writer , blame no longer the patient editor who rejects your story , which you are sure I would like and buy . I am iuscrutable . One can judge of extremes , but not of the average man . Consider well that if any one could predict my likings , such an one would not long remain an editor , nor even a publisher . He who could read a novel in manuscript and say , " The average man will buy this . Print thirty thousand ; " he who could accurately cast the horoscope of a book , would be possessed of the " potentiality of wealth beyond the dreams of avarice . " He would be daily more valuable than all writers , for he could fore-July , cast the literary future . Such a man is not possible , for he would be able to predict my action , which is more than I can do myself . Perhaps his coming would disturb the intellectual economy of the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me wrathfully that an editor told you that he would readily give Browning five dollars a line for a copy of verses which he would not print if he were forced to withhold the poet 's name at the bottom , and were certain that the secret of the authorship would not leak out . Blame the editor no longer as " purblind , and sordid , and commercial , " but recognize that he frankly admits his human fallibility , and say , " Brother , I too am fallible ; " for I myself , the arbiter of literary reputation , I the average man , say boldly that I should not read the verses unless the name were appended . BOOKS OF THE MONTH . History and Biography . Governor Chamberlain 's Administration in South Carolina : a Chapter of Reconstruction in the Southern States . By Walter Allen . ( Putnams . ) Mr. Allen had a most interesting task before him . No one has yet really discussed , in a historical method , the question of reconstruction , - a question which we venture to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another generation . Chamberlain made a gallant fight , and the history of his career in South Carolina is full of incident and dramatic action . But Mr. Allen makes a fatal mistake in his method of treatment . Under the conviction that he will strengthen his position by the citation of contemporary documents , he loads the book down not*only with Governor Chamberlain 's addresses , inaugurals , and letters , but with long reports of interviews , long editorials , and an astonishing number of newspaper " notices . " All this entails great labor on the reader , who is compelled to pick out the story from a mass of material ; it leads to repetition and to the incorporation of a deal of unnecessary comment by ignorant and un important writers , so that the real narrative is buried out of sight . Mr. Allen 's book is as wordy as one of Chamberlain 's long-winded harangues . He might have done a real service to the governor . If he had worked over all this raw material and made a compact story , and then bundled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a public library for any one who desired to verify particulars , he would have found readers . As it is , instead of setting the governor on a pedestal , he buries him under a monument . - J. R. Green 's A Short History of the English People has been reissued in a new edition , thoroughly revised by his widow . ( Harpers . ) Mrs. Green supplies also an interesting introduction , in which she allows herself to give a free sketch of Mr. Green 's training as a historian . We trust we are to have by and by a full biography of so interesting a man . One is tempted to draw comparisons between him and Buckle . Certainly Green struck a deeper chord of life in his brief historical work . Both men were in a degree pioneers , but Buckle was applying an intellectual formula Books of the Month . // to history . Green made history a graphic picture of life , taken not superficially , but profoundly . - History of the Civil War in America , by the Comte de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The four books of this volume are Eastern Tennessee , Siege of Chattanooga , The Third Winter , and The War in the Southwest . The count is above all a military historian , and sees his subject in the light of military science . He is evidently eager to get upon that period of the war when the American people had at last learned their lesson , and put the business of the war into the hands of men trained to conduct it , leaving them untrammeled by civil cousideratious . It is to be hoped that nothing will prevent the completion of this important work . - Life of Walter Harriman , with selections from his speeches and writings , by Amos Hadley . ( Houghton . ) Mr. Harriman was a New Hampshire man , a war Democrat , who entered the army , where he commanded a regiment of volunteers . He did not follow his party in the second election , but spoke vigorously for Lincoln , and after that was identified with the Republicans . He was twice governor of New Hampshire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life were spent in honorable retirement and in travel . The narrative is a detailed one , and interest in it will largely be confined to his friends and neighbors. - Four Oxford Lectures , by E. A. Freeman ( Macmillan ) , is divided by the two subjects , Fifty Years of European History , and Teutonic Conquest in Gaul and Britain . The former is a rapid summary ; the latter , an out . look upon a field which Mr. Freeman hopes to occupy some day with more full and comprehensive treatment . The minute , critical , not to say captious , method of this historian appears more in the second portion than in the first . - The Causes of the French Revolution , by Richard Heath Dabney . ( Holt . ) Mr. Dabney makes a rapid and lively survey of society and politics in France in the years preceding 1789 , and seeks to trace in a great mass of detailed incident the movements which finally issued in the Revolution . He writes as one who has accumulated his material with industry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ topics is orderly . At the same time we hesitate to say that he has himself clearly formulated in his own mind a full and satisfactory philosophy of French history . - William of Germany , a Succinct Biography of William I. , German Emperor and King of Prussia , by Archibald Forbes . ( Cassell . ) The book is not quite so hasty a performance as at first appears . Mr. Forbes wrote most of the book while the Emperor was living ; the filial chapters , which are of slight consequence , 141 except as bringing the narrative to its natural conclusion , were supplied , after the death of William , by another hand . Mr. Forbes is a bright writer , but he has the journalistic stamp upon him , as when he says , " The millennium , whether for Prussia or as a general thing , was rather at a discount in Bohemia in the summer of 1866 . " The book is a convenient summary . - Gouverneur Morris , by Theodore Roosevelt . ( Houghton . ) A volume in the American Statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and should take up this with predisposition to like it , but the preface arouses antipathy . What if Mr. Sparks , a pioneer in work of the sort which Mr. Morse is doing so well , failed to come up to Mr. Roosevelt 's notion of a biographer and editor ? Why should this later writer be so bumptious ? There is such a thing as good manners in literature , and Mr. Roosevelt offends against it . - Martin Luther and Other Essays , by F. II . Hedge . ( Roberts . ) The first of these essays is fresh in the minds of readers of The Atlantic , and another of the collection , Classic and Romantic , also appeared in these pages . Dr. Hedge has the ruggedness in his thought which results from a long , uncompromising course of study of great themes in a spirit of individual independence . Whether the reader agrees with him or not , he can not fail to respect the integrity of mind which he confronts . The subjects of the essays are partly historical , especially in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ philosophical . - In the series English History , by Contemporary Writers ( Putnams ) , W. H. Hutton edits a volume , Simon de Montfort and his Cause . The passages are taken largely from Matthew Paris . In the same series , F. P. Barnard takes up Strongbow 's Conquest of Ireland . These little books are capital aids to teachers and students . They give the cream of books which such readers would take down from the shelves if they were working at a particular period . Of course it is better to take down the books , but if one has not a large library , nor access to one , he need not be above resorting to this handy aid . - France and the Confederate Navy , 1862-1868 , an International Episode , by John Bigelow . ( Harpers . ) Mr. Bigelow , as is well known , was consul at Paris during the war , and held a responsible position . He now undertakes to relate from his own experience the adventures of the Confederates when they sought to make a bargain with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disposal of the Confederacy . He draws upon documents , written and printed , and though he does not foll*w , as we think he should have done , a strictly chronological order of events , he manages to disclose very dis Books of the Month . // tinctly the animus of the Imperial government . - The Puritan Age and Rule in the Colony of the Massachusetts Bay , by George E. Ellis . ( Houghton . ) Dr. Ellis writes out of a full mind upon a subject which has engaged him , in its different phases , throughout a long and studious life . He writes leisurely and without much attempt at compactness of statement . His temper is judicial , and he seeks to look impartially at the facts of history . In some instances , doubtless , his earlier conclusions have been modified , but on the whole the book may be taken as an excellent representation of a school of thought in New England history which is likely to give way before habits of study less ministerial , so to speak . - A Few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by his niece , Mrs. L. M. Morehead . ( Robert Clarke &amp; Co. , Cincinnati . ) A modest little volume concerning an eminent meteorologist , called out by some erroneous statements which had appeared in print . The narrative is really too brief for a satisfactory account of a man of strong character and large attainments , but it is long enough to set at rest the fables respecting his early illiteracy . - History of the People of Israel till the Time of King David , by Ernest Renan . ( Roberts . ) The interest which one takes in Renan 's books is in part due to the peculiar position which Renan holds . No one of distinction represents so well the attitude of residuary legatee to Christianity , and the cheerfulness of the heir when administering the estate is tempered by a graceful sentiment of esteem which does not interfere with an entirely calm judgment upon the character of the deceftsed , and the value of the property accumulated by him . With this clearly in mind , one can enjoy the imagbiative reading of history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conccption of Israclitish development . - In the series of Famous Women ( Roberts ) two interesting volumes have appeared , Hannah More , by Charlotte Yonge , and Adelaide Ristori , by herself . Miss Yonge really rehabilitates Hannah More , and has done good service in destroying the fiction which had been getting possession of readers . The evangelical blue - stocking was a far more human and lovable creature than has been supposed , and full of rare common sense . Ristori 's autobiography is admirable for its elucidation of a character of genius . - A Biography of Henry Ward Beecher , by William C. Beecher and Rev. Samuel Scoville , assisted by Mrs. Henry Ward Beecher . ( Charles L. Webster &amp; Co. , New York . ) In its plan and treatment this book addresses itself to those who are followers of Beecher . It is big , eulogistic , sploshy . It does not really show the man , and yet he was a most notable July , figure , and will one day , when the clouds disperse , be sculptured in vigorous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future times from this century , and we wish the future joy of him , - the future , we mean , of writers . - Cardinal Wolsey , by Mandell Creighton ( Macmillan ) , is an interesting study of Henry the Eighth 's great minister , and is one of the first of a series of twelve volumes dealing with English statesmanship. - In The Makers of Venice ( Macmillan ) Mrs. Oliphant has told her story in episodes rather than in a consecutive narrative . Venice was richer in doges and soldiers than in painters and poets , and , consequently , Mrs. Oliphant 's work lacks the kind of interest which attached itself to her Makers of Florence . Economics end Politics . Big Wages and How to Earn Them , by a Foreman . ( Harpers . ) A sensible little book by a man who occupies a position outside of labor unions , not necessarily antagonistic to them , but critical of them and of their temporary use . It is quite possible that the writer is a foreman only on paper , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Art of Investing , by a New York Broker . ( Appleton . ) A little volume of sound advice and prudent judgment . It is written by a man who clearly does not pin his faith upon any one class of securities , and who understands well the shifting character of the money market as well as the fundamental principles which underlie the growth of wealth . - The Study of Politics . By William P. Atkinson . ( Roberts . ) This is a little book and should not take long to read , but we have been spending most of our spare time over the note prefacing it . Mr. Atkinson is professor of English ; it is a pity he does not always practice it . But the book is interesting , candid , manly , somewhat general in its treatment of an important subject , but refreshing in its stout assertion of the permanent in the study of politics . - A History of Political Economy , by John Elells Ingram , with preface by B. J. James . ( Macmillan . ) A science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principles may well call for historical treatment , and the advantage of this book is that Dr. Ingram represents the latest school , that which seems most in accord with the prevalent methods in all scientific study , and thus makes his survey from the latest point of observation . - International Law , with materials for a code of International Law , by Leone Levi , is the sixtieth volume in the International Scientific series ( Appleton ) , a series which takes a wide sweep in its plan . The main part of the book is a direct contribution to a code . Under the head of the Political Condition of States there is also in compact form a considerable body of . &amp;01c8 of the Month . // information which makes the volume useful as a book of reference . - Constitutional History and Political Development of the United States , by Simon Sterne . ( Putnams . ) This is a new edition of a well known book , the addition taking into view legislative growth since 1882. - Taxation , its Principles and Methods ; translated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an introduction and note by Horace White . ( Putnams . ) The Italians are making important contributions to economic science , and this book , apart from its intrinsic value , is interesting as illustrative of the trend of political thought in a nationality which one at first sight might imagine to be the last to cut loose so completely from its historic past . The appendix contains the existing systems for the assessment and collection of state taxes in New York and Pennsylvania , and the rates of taxation therein . - The Present Condition of Economic Science and the demand for a radical change in its methods and aims , by Edward Clark Lunt . ( Putnams . ) A vigorous rather than lucid critique of the so-called Historical school . It may be taken with Dr. Ingram 's book , but will hardly give as much satisfaction to the ordinary reader .

Webster &amp; Co. ) which has long been under course of preparation by E. C. Stedman and Miss E. M. Hutchiuson . Ten volumes are promised , and these three cover the ground down to the United States period , that is , from 1607 to 1787 . " We term all literature American , " says the preface , " that was produced by the heroic pioneers , whose thought , learning , auc ) resolution shaped the colonial mind . " This refers to the early colonial literature , and accordingly Captain John Smith and William Strachey appear in the Virginia portion , but not Sandys . The editors are more discriminating and we think more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history , to which these volumes furnish an admirable commentary . Any one who is conversant with the early writers is likely to have his favorite passages , and to look for them . We regret , for instance , the omission from John Winthrop 's History of the strong account of a boatwreck in Massachusetts Bay , but Anthony Thacher 's narrative is given , and the selection is admirable throughout , since the editors have apparently not been so desirous of giving specimens of all writers as of giving passages of intrinsic interest and value . The result is that the general effect is stronger than that produced by Mr. Tyler 's rather florid account of the same period , which leaves one with the feeling that he must adopt the philosophy of the Marchioness and make believe very hard . The editorial work of brief head-notes is done with excellent judgment , and the work bids fair to be a most admirable encyclopiedia to accompany a biographical dictionary . It differs in this respect from Duyckinck 's , which undertook to combine the two functious. - Old Plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Marks , by J. H. Buck . ( The Gorham Manufacturing Co . ) Owners and collectors of old silver will find a great deal of valuable information and many useful hints in this volume , which is evidently the result of much careful and sympathetic research . The book is illustrated with numerous woodcuts and process plates . Books for Young People . The Story of the City of New York , by Charles Burr Todd . ( Putnams . ) Written evidently for young readers , this book is rather a running narrative of the growth of the city than a study of municipal development . It has bits of antiquarianism and sketches of events which have taken place within the limits of the city , but one can not read such a book without being struck by the absence of any strong civic independence or self-consciousness . The city seems to have had little really individual existence . - Derrick Sterling , a story of the mines , by Kirk Munroe . ( Harpers . ) A story of adventure , heroism , poetic justice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crusoe , by W. L. Alden . ( Harpers . ) The story purports to be the narrative of a young Irish seaman who was shipwrecked in the Pacific with a man who professed to be a grandson of Crusoe , but was really an escaped lunatic , and insists throughout the adventure upon enacting the part of Crusoe , while his young companion , who is totally ignorant of the real Robinson , is obliged to pose as Friday . The idea of the book is funny , and as brevity is a relative matter , we may say the book is short . Nevertheless it is a piece of fooling which we should think might have wearied the writer even before it does the reader , and he gets tired of it before the book is done . - In his series of The Lives of the Presidents ( Frederick A. Stokes &amp; Brother , New York ) , W. 0 . Stoddard has reached Harrison , Tyler , and 1888. 148 // Polk , all included in a single volume . The lives are plain , unadorned sketches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or clear explanation of the political questions with which their names were connected . Poetry and Fiction . Wallenstein , by Friedrich Schiller , done into English verse by J. A. W. Hunter . ( Kegan Paul , Trench &amp; Co . ) The notable thing in Mr. Hunter 's version of Schiller 's masterpiece is the fact that the translator has given us the prelude whose " lilting metre " frightened away Coleridge . Mr. Hunter has been very successful in catching the lively humor of this scene , which , however , has no connection with the main tragedy , and is valuable only as a study of camp life and character in the olden time . - Monsieur Motte , by Grace King ( Armstrong &amp; Son ) , is a collection of four stories illustrative of Louisiana life and character . Miss King 's Creole studies have a quality of fineness which is frequently lacking in Mr. Cable 's work in this sort . The " Marriage of Marie Modestc " strikes us as the most charming of these stories , though in this , as in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that destroys the illusion . She makes her characters speak a mixture of French and English . Their dialogue should be wholly in French or wholly in a correct English translation . - Macaulay 's Lays of Ancient Rome and The Vicar of Wakefield , with Mulready 's illustrations , are the two latest additions to Putnam 's series of tastefully selected and daintily printed little volumes called Knickerbocker Nuggets. 144 July .
