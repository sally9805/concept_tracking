The report itself comprises - about seventy printed pages of an octavo volume , and is followed by an appendiv of about four hundred and forty pages and accompanied by a valuable ' map , constructed on a scale of one inch to ten miles , showing all the railroad lines and connections of the State . There is also a special report on color-blindness by Dr. EDWIN HUTCHINSON . A supplementary report contains suggested amendments to the laws affecting railroads . The volume certainly furnishes evidence that the commission has found enough to do since its organization , and leaves no doubt that it has been productive already of great public benefit . - The details of its work are so numerous that it is impossible to discuss them with any degree of fullness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special rates , &c.,; because the whole subject of freight transportation and rates is reserved for a special report . The importance of a better system of keeping accounts and of rendering quarterly reports is discussed , and in the suggestions in regard to legislation there are provisions on these points . The commission is of the opinion that the maintenance of competition by means of the canals of the State is. very important , and refers to a practice of the railroads of making yearly contracts at low rates on condition that no goods are shipped by canal as a " serious danger . " The question involved is before the board in a case that has been recently submitted , and a full discussion of it is promised in the decision of that case . Much has been done in the way of inspecting the railroads of the State , but that heavy task has not been completed . Many general defects , however , are dealt with , such as those relating to ventilation , the consumption of smoke and cinders , switches , grade crossings , &c.; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , and system of safety provisions at those which exist be put in force as rapidly as practicable . During the eight months ending ? Sept. 30 last 22 persons were killed and 39 injured in this State at ' crossings , and the cost of defending and settling suits which resulted and of paying damages was $94 , - 548 23 .

The whole number of persons killed by railroad accidents ' during the eight months referred to was 322 , and the number injured was 660 . Of the former 34 were passengers , 110 employes , and 178 others , and of the latter 118 were passengers , 396 employes , and 146 others .

Attention is called to the fact that there is no general act regarding the construction of street railroads , and the commission promises to prepare and submit a bill for that purpose . We may anticipate a measure which , when submitted at least , will be free from the jobbery that has been fatal to several already .
