Hayne , Paul Hamilton , 1830-1886 : THE WILD FLEUR DE LIS . Footnote : 1Kb from The wild fleur de lis ( 1884 ) Through the bared forest , by its dreary ways , That glittered in the ruthless grasp of Frost , I wandered , where a million leaves were tossed , The fading trophies of dead , summer days . There in forlornest solitude , ablaze With wondrous color , like a fairy lost In some lone wild , few fairy feet have crossed , Bloomed a strange Flower amid the woodland maze Starred in the dimness of that desolate place , It smiled in dazzling beauty , its fair head Lifted with soft and yet imperial grace . Ah , magical Flower !  --  the blissful type thou art Of one last Hope , which o'er its brethren dead , Shines on the frost-bound stillness of the heart !
