txt The distribution of the State patronage resulting from the victory of the coalition in the State last November is giving Senator Mahone much trouble . The breach between Auditor Massey 's friends and the caucus has been widened by the action of Senator Iliddleberger last night In saying emphatically that he would resign his seat in the State Senate before he would vote for Massey if the latter were renominated . This announcement and the disposition manifested by the Mahone leaders to defeat Mr. Massey for the Auditorship caused enough of his friends in the Senate to renounce the caucus and continue the dead-lock . Next to the Auditorship , the State Supreme Court is giving senator Mahone the greatest trouble . This tribunal is composed of five members . It is the purpose of the Readjusters to replace all the present Bourbon incumbents by those in sympathy with their own financial and political views . As the Republicans gave two-thirds of the votes by which the dominant party came into power , they insist upon having an equitable share of the members of that tribunal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Legislature , insists that " tide-water " Virginia shall have at least one member of the Supreme Court from his party . The slate , as made up by Gen. Mahone , is said to be as follows : The Hon. R. W. Hughes , United States District Judge of this circuit ; L. L. Lewis , United States District Attorney , of this city ; Judge B. W. Lacy , of New Kent ; Mr. Richardson . of Roanoke , and Drury A. Hanton , of Petersburg . The two first named gentlemen are prominent and influential Republicans and lawyers of recognized ability . Heretofore it has been believed that Judge Hughes would not accept a place on the State bench , but leading Republicans who have seen Gen. Mahone say that gentleman is satisfied that he will . It is quite certain that , unless the present disturbance in the Readjuster party prevents it , two of the five members of the next Supreme Court of the State will be Republicans . Prominent members of that party in the Legislature express their determination to accept no arrangement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
