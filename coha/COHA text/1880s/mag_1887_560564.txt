To the question , Why am I a New Churchman ? my first and most general answer is , Because I believe in a system of religious doctrine which is to me the clear sign of a distinctly new phase of Christian faith and life  --  a system so broad and comprehensive , and so far in advance of the old creeds and standards , that it can be truthfully designated by no other name than that of New Church . This doctrinal system I find in the theological writings of Emanuel Swedenborg , who bases it on the Sacred Scriptures . I make no concealment of my indebtedness to this man , or of my conviction that , under Divine Providence , he was the instrument appointed to revolutionize the religious thought of the age . But I pay him no personal homage . I do not accept his teachings on account of any claim of personal authority which may be made in his behalf . Nor does he demand any such allegiance . On the contrary , he lays it down as a fundamental principle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise of his rational faculties , or , what is the same thing , because it is seen to be intrinsically worthy of belief . As far as is possible to a writer , he keeps himself out of view . It is a fact not generally known , that for more than twenty years after he began to write on religious subjects , his name did not appear on the title pages of his works . The reason for my acceptance of Swedenborg 's teachings , is that they shed a flood of new light on all vital questions of religion and theology ; they furnish an intelligible and rational solution of every vexed problem ; they make known the essential laws of spiritual life , and thus remove the ambiguities and inconsistencies which had gathered around Christian faith and worship . To state , as concisely as possible , the grounds on which this conclusion rests , will be the object of this paper . All that is essential in religious faith is attained by man when // he has , in the first place , a true idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the duties which he owes Him . This is a self-evident proposition . Unless these two conditions are fulfilled , there can be no mutual or reciprocal relationship between the human race and its Creator , no binding of the soul to a higher power , such as the word " religion , " by its etymology , implies . Moreover , as man has no innate or intuitive knowledge of God or of the relation which he rightly bears Him , and as God alone can give this knowledge , Divine revelation is necessary as a means of imparting it . This point need not here be argued . It is sufficient to say that Christianity without the Bible would be not only impossible , but well nigh inconceivable . If the foregoing premises are admitted , it follows that the Church , as the repository of Divine truth among men , successfully discharges its functions , just in the degree in which it is the medium of correct instruction on these vital matters . Conversely , in proportion as it is a false teacher in this regard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for usefulness departs from it . Derelict is it in still greater measure if it ceases to be a guide to pure and holy living . No extraordinary discernment is , indeed , needful in order to see that an evil life and false doctrines are the natural , if not the inevitable , concomitants of each other . Judged by this twofold standard , the Christian Church , at the time when Swedenborg lived and wrote was , as he affirms , in the last throes of its dissolution . The truth , which it first received from the lips of Saviour and Apostles , was utterly perrerted , and the moral and spiritual influence which it exerted had become altogether evil . Its decline had begun with the decrees of the Nicene Council , early in the fourth century , and had thenceforth continued , slowly but surely , for more than fourteen hundred years . The Reformation had , indeed , entered its protest against the ecclesiastical abuses and pretensions of the Roman Catholic hierarchy , but it did not dispel the mists by which the essential doctrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men permanently nearer to their Lord and God . By the month of Luther , it emphasized faith or belief as the means of salvation ; but the faith itself , already corrupted , remained practically unchanged , and the necessity of a good life according to the commandments was , to all intents and purposes , forgotten . // Swedenborg was born in 1688 , and died in 1772 . The son of a Lutheran Bishop of Sweden , a student at several universities , and an extensive traveler throughout all the principal countries of Europe , he had exceptional opportunities for testing the essential quality of contemporaneous Christianity . His writings contain abundant evidences of the manner in which he regarded it . But we are not dependent on his writings for a correct knowledge of its condition . History and literature alike bear witness to the prevailing corruption which came to its head in the early part of the eighteenth century . Extant and not yet discarded creeds tell the true story of the dominant belief . The idea of God was that of three Divine persons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in some mysterious manner , constitute one Deity . The first of these persons , or the Father , was supposed to be so incensed against the human race on account of Adam 's disobedience , that they rested under His eternal condemnation . Divine justice required that they should live after death in a state of everlasting torment . By the sufferings and death of Jesus Christ , or the second person in the Trinity , that justice was said to be satisfied , and the punishment removed from all who have faith in Him and His atoning sacrifice . Thus it was claimed that by faith alone they were justified , and that the heathen everywhere , and all who from any cause were not converted to the true belief , remained the hapless victims of the awful penalty . Paul 's declarations respecting the works of the law , in contradistinction to faith , were considered as teaching that a humble and sincere life according to the ten commandments would avail nothing towards a man 's salvation , unless he distinctly believed himself a participant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this conception of God , and inseparable from it , were the most baldly literal interpretations of Scripture . It was universally believed that the whole work of creation was accomplished in six days , of twenty-four hours each , by the arbitrary decree of the Almighty . No professing Christian doubted that in the days of Noah there was a flood which submerged the whole earth , and destroyed every living thing upon it except the little handful saved in the ark . From out the sacred pages the inference was also drawn that man 's corruptible body of flesh is at some future day to be raised from the dead and resume its functions . The sounding of trumpets , the visible reappearance of the // Saviour , a final judgment , by which the faithful are plentifully rewarded , and the unbelievers committed to eternal flames , were eagerly awaited as the only possible fulfillment of prophecy . This dogmatic literalness of interpretation Swedenborg condemns as a sign of the gross materialism and externalism of the age . In the prevailing doctrines with regard to God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he discovers proof that there was no longer any living or helpful relationship between the Church and the one true object of its worship . Let all who have any doubts in the matter candidly examine the state of things which he criticises , let them analyze the creeds which he opposes , let them read the works of Luther and Calvin , or the current theological literature of a hundred years ago ; and not a few will be filled with wonder at the former things which have passed away , and will ask whether there is not a very intelligible sense in which they too are New Churchmen . Over against the existing falsities and corruptions ,  --  the Protestant solifidianism , the Roman Catholic assumption of spiritual dominion , and the general moral turpitude ,  --  Swedenborg places no disjointed series of negations , but a complete new system of Christian doctrine . Of its more important features I shall presently attempt a synopsis . But before doing so , it seems necessary to touch briefly on the way in which it came to him , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although , as I have said , it courts the favor of no one except on the ground of its own intrinsic reasonableness and its harmony with Scripture , it is nevertheless so intimately connected with the life and experience of its reputed author , that the one can not be fully understood without some knowledge of the other . Until he was more than fifty years of age , Swedenborg had written nothing on religious subjects , and apparently given them no special attention . He was principally known , in his own country , as Assessor Extraordinary of the Board of Mines , and an influential member of the Swedish Diet ; and not only there , but throughout Europe , as a writer on many branches of science and philosophy . In this field he acquired great distinction ; and the number and variety of topics which he treated was remarkable . Geometry and algebra , metallurgy and magnetism , anatomy , physiology , and the relation of the soul to the body were among the subjects which received his attention . There is to be // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradual , but steady , progression from lower to higher themes ,  --  from a contemplation of the mere external phenomena of nature to a study of their deep and hidden causes . He was always full of devout spiritual aspirations . In all his scientific researches he steadfastly looked through nature up to nature 's God . Says one of his not too favorable contemporaries : * " He applied his whole strength in attempting to fathom the inmost recesses of things , and to connect together the various links into one universal chain , and show their derivation in a certain order from their first origin . " Maintaining this inflexible belief in God and revelation , and in the essential unity of truth , Swedenborg , in his upward course , at last reached the boundary line between matter and spirit . Then it was that he entered on those remarkable experiences by which , as he affirms , the secrets of the other world were revealed to him . He declares that the eyes of his spirit were opened , and that he had , from that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His general teaching on this subject is that the spiritual world is an inner sphere of being ,  --  not material , and in no wise discernible to natural senses , yet none the less real and substantial ,  --  and that it is the ever-present medium of life to man and nature . This point he illustrates by the distinction and relation between the human soul and body . These are as distiiict from each other as it is possible for any two things to be ; and yet , during the continuance of man 's life on earth , nothing could be more evident than their mutual dependence . The soul is the man himself : the body is but the material covering which brings him into contact with the outer or natural world . By no possibility can the soul be seen by natural eyes ; yet the body lives by virtue of its presence , and dies when it is withdrawn . The reason is , that the body is natural , but the soul or spirit is spiritual ; the latter belongs to another and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in itself , a completely organized form of life , having its own spiritual body within the natural one , and its own spiritual home and associations . The eyes of that body may be opened at any time , though this is not the normal or ordinary experience of men on earth . The effect of such opening is that man looks directly into the spiritual world , and has conscious * Samuel Sandels . See Worcester 's Life of Swedenborg , p. 407. // intercourse with its inhabitants . In this way the visions of patriarchs and prophets , as recorded in the Scriptures , are to be explained . They were but temporary foregleams of the state which death makes known as a permanent reality . To the clear perception of that inner realm Swedenborg claims to have been repeatedly admitted ; and his works abound in descriptions of things there seen and heard by him . In these accounts he exhibits none of the spirit commonly ascribed to the visionary and enthusiast , nor does he present them as matters of prime importance in themselves ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as evidences of great spiritual laws , which they illustrate , and to which the attention of the reader is mainly directed . So unusual a mode of illustration is this , that in the minds of many persons it has been permitted to obscure , and almost to obliterate , the thing illustrated ; but it is nevertheless an unquestionable fact that Swedenborg 's narrations of his own personal experience occupy but an inconsiderable portion of his writings , and are manifestly subordinated to the grand doctrines respecting God 's nature and Providence , Divine revelation , and the essential conditions of human happiness , which it is his chief object to inculcate as the basis of a new Christian faith . Those doctrines , he declares , came to him out of the Holy Scriptures . " Not from any angel , but from the Lord alone , while I read the Word , " * is his very language . To help others likewise read the Word intelligently and truly , is his great aim and effort . Simultaneously with the opening of his spiritual sight , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is in the Scriptures a wondrous wealth *f meaning previously unknown ,  --  an internal or spiritual sense within the sense of the letter , and constituting the very soul and essence of Divine revelation . To unfold these hidden treasures of truth he regards as the chief part of his mission . As he devoutly pondered the contents of the sacred volume , they seemed to shine with a new light , and he saw clearly that , although , in outward form , they were peculiarly adapted to the times and circumstances which produced them , they had within them the living and eternal spirit of wisdom . They were composed of parables not hitherto interpreted , " dark sayings of old , " which in the coming ages would be radiant with heavenly brightness . Complete possession of the key was made possi * True Christian Religion , No. 779. // ble to him by his intimate acquaintance with the spiritual world ; for , according to his philosophy , the relation of that world to the natural is similar to that which the spirit of revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature is a visible embodiment of spiritual life , so is every thought expressed in the literal sense of Scripture the outward form and analogue of some deeper and far-reaching principle . This relation between things internal and external is called correspondence . By virtue of it , whatever is outwardly seen becomes the fixed symbol and representative of something which is not seen . The phenomenal world by which man is surrounded images to his bodily sense the world of thought and affection within him . In a word , nature is the responsive and harmonious environment of mind . The Scriptures are written by means of correspondences . Their higher significance is brought forth when the symbols are interpreted . To the exposition of this internal sense of the Bible , Swedenborg , in his theological works , devotes by far the largest number of pages . It goes without saying that those to whom the explanations seem true , must find in them not only a deep spiritual satisfaction , but a new and powerful support of faith . If heavenly lessons can be drawn from passages which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earthly history , the strongest arguments are provided against those who would discredit Divine revelation , or detract from its authority . When , for example , it is seen that in the first chapter of Genesis no exact description of the creation of the world was intended to be given , but that the narrative , interiorly regarded , sets forth the successive processes by which man , in all ages , is re-created , or prepared for heaven , there is no longer any ground for affirming that the record is untrustworthy , or that God 's Word is contradicted by His works . So , likewise , when the story of Adam 's fall is divested of its literal improbabilities , and understood to be an allegorical account of the manner in which evil gradually gained a footing in the human heart , one favorite weapon of infidelity has lost its power . Or again , when the history of the Israelites , though resting on a basis of actual fact , is shown to portray , with the utmost minuteness of detail , the spiritual experiences of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and space , and excites a proportionately broader and more vital interest . No other claim is preferred on behalf of this interpretation of // Scripture than that it is true and reasonable in itself , and , therefore , worthy of acceptance . Closely connected with it are the doctrines comprised under the name New Church . These are presented by Swedenborg as plain deductions from Scripture ,  - -  truths which must be manifest to all who read their Bibles with open and unprejudiced minds ,  --  truths , moreover , which Christianity , in its languishing state , needs for its own resuscitation . In what remains of this paper I shall attempt a concise statement of those doctrines , so far as relates to the two points already specified as the very essentials of religion , namely , God , and man 's relationship to Him . First , respecting God . The foundation principle in our conception of Him should be His absolute and changeless unity . Not three persons , in some miraculous manner constituting one Deity , but a being , who is one in essence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our minds ; and every other thought which we have concerning Him should be dominated by it . He is Jehovah , the I am , the infinite and uncreated source of life . All other beings are but finite forms , receptive of life from Him . Not only did He create them in the beginning , but by the nnceasing communication of His own life and substance He holds them in existence . Thus preservation is perpetual creation ; and the universe both was , and is , created , not from nothing , but from God Himself . He is the sum of all perfections . Love and wisdom are His very essence . Creation itself is but the exercise of infinite love acting according to unerring wisdom . This is the same as saying that the reason why men live is that the Lord loves them , or , in other words , desires objects on which His love may be bestowed , and by which it may be reciprocated . His love , of necessity , finds expression in absolute goodness , His wisdom in absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and jealousy , or of any so-called justice save that which is the outfiowing of love . If the Scriptures seem to teach otherwise , we must remember that in their outward form , or the sense of the letter , they must needs be accommodated to the states of natural-minded men , and , therefore , to a certain extent , must speak according to the external appearance , rather than the internal reality . From the recognition of God 's love and wisdom , as being His essential nature , we arrive at a true conception of His Providence . // This can be naught else than the Divine oversight , or government which infinite love inspires , and infinite wisdom plans and directs . The ruling purpose which it has in view is the everlasting happiness of men , or ,  --  what is the same thing ,  --  the building up of a heaven of angels from them . But genuine happiness can be realized only in the exercise of freedom . Man was , therefore , created a free agent . He is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endowed with the power of using that life as if it were , in every sense , his own . This freedom renders possible a reciprocal relationship between him and his Heavenly Father ,  --  the relationship of mutual love and eternal conjunction . But it also involves possibilities of an opposite character . Liberty to do good necessarily implies the power to do evil . The constant aim of the Divine Providence is to lead us to choose good , rather than evil , because only thus can heavenly happiness be attained . God , who is goodness itself , can give birth to nothing evil . All pain and suffering are the direct , or indirect , result of man 's transgressions . But though they are not caused or sent by God , they are yet wondrously overruled by Him , and made , as far as possible , the instruments of improvement and correction . God can not be known or apprehended by finite men , except so far as He is revealed in a manner adapted to their finite condition . In order that His divine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they must be embodied in some outward form , by which their glory is veiled , at the same time that it is manifested . Such revelations have been made from time to time , and are found recorded in the Scriptures . But the greatest among them was accomplished in the birth of Jesus Christ . That event , according to the New Church theology , was simply God 's way of coming into nearer and more definite relations to His human family . No second person in the Deity made His appearance , but Jehovah Himself , clothed with the form and nature of men , became their Redeemer . Those who beheld Him saw one who was externally " a man of sorrows , and acquainted with grief , " but internally " the mighty God , the everlasting Father . " Thus the Lord Jesus Christ was , in very truth , EmmanuelGod with us . In Him the Divine and human natures co-existed , but not at first in perfect harmony ; for the external humanity , being derived from Mary , partook of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject to temptations . But , // though tempted in all things like as we are , Jesus was without sin . This was the Divine opportunity ; for by overcoming evil in its assaults against Himself , He overcame it for men likewise , and redeemed them from the thraldom by which they were bound . His whole life on earth , rightly viewed , was a succession of conflicts with infernal spirits , in which He gained the victory . This victorious warfare not only brought to mankind the help which it needed , but produced its permanent effect on His own human nature . That nature did not die in the sepulchre , but rose again , transformed , and glorified . Every tendency to evil , every vestige of self-hood , every trace of opposition to the perfect will of God , was gradually eliminated from it , and it was so permeated and transfigured by the indwelling spirit of the Father , that it became , itself , Divine . It was no longer the seat of two wills contending with each other ; but one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Humanity thus glorified in the person of our Lord Jesus Christ is the perfect embodiment and medium of infinite Divinity . He has , as He declares , all power in heaven and on earth . Seeing him , we see the Father . He is the one Divinely human , all-comprehensive object of our worship . There is in Him a Trinity , but not a Trinity of persons . As every man consists of soul and body , from which proceeds his vital sphere or energy , so is it , with the Lord . The essential Divine nature , which no one hath seen at any time , is within Him like a soul , and the Divine Humanity is as the body which makes it manifest , while there gobs forth , through that body , from that soul , an infinite sphere of life , which vivifies and sustains creation . These three are the same as Father , Son and Holy Spirit . They are all comprehended and revealed in our Lord Jesus Christ . He not only was , but is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I embrace this idea of God , because it seems to me both reasonable and scriptural . It satisfies alike my mind and heart . It is the fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy and the brief summary of New Testament teaching . It removes the doubt and mystery which have always enveloped the tn-personal theory , and have made the Christian conception of the Deity practically tritheistic . It presents for my adoration one personal God , infinite and indivisible , and yet it does not take away my Saviour , or relegate Him to a secondary or subordinate position . No // offended majesty , no fierce anger , no stern justice demands the dread alternative of universal human suffering , or the blood of a blameless victim ; but instead of this awful picture I see the perfect Love which is the fountain and the cause of being , giving itself utterly to men , coming to them visibly , borrowing their fallen nature to the end that it might be redeemed , and glorifying it with its own glory . In the Divine Humanity of Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must ever be the connecting link between the Creator and the creation . I maintain that this doctrine , in its entirety , is new in the Church , that , nevertheless , it is the consummate flowering of the simple faith of the early Christians , which their successors perverted , and that when it is seen to be the central teaching of Divine revelation from Genesis to the Apocalypse , it opens the way for a second coming of the Lord to all who are willing to receive Him ,  --  not a visible coming in the flesh , but a genuine spiritual presence in their hearts . It is the foremost vital truth of a new dispensation of Christianity , because it brings men into a new and living relationship with their God and Saviour . The nature of that relationship is , of necessity , the simplest possible . No longer complicated by the idea of a plurality of Divine persons , and of faith in one of them as the means of propitiating another , it is all summed up in the words duty and obedience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Regenerator , stands before us saying , " If thou wilt enter into life , keep the commandments . " We prove our trust in Him whom we worship , by doing as He teaches . All other professions of allegiance are a mere and mockery . The desire and effort to lead a crood pretense life are the essence of all faith . So far as they have place in any human heart , whether of Christian or Pagan , they lead on to salvation and happiness . The ten commandments are mostly in the form of prohibitions . They point out evils which must be shunned , not good acts which must be done . And here our duty to the Lord obviously begins . We must shun all evils as sins against Him ,  --  not because they are considered disreputable and entail unpleasant consequences , but because they are sinful in His sight , and He forbids them . Acting on this principle , we shall endeavor not only to avoid the outward appearance of evil , but to put away the very desire and thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ourselves merit in so doing , or claim a // reward of virtue . All that is good in us , and all our ability to contend with evil are of , and from , the Lord . They form part of the life which lie , who is Life , nnceasingly commnnicates . As well might the moon claim credit for her reflected light , as we for ours . Nor ought we to think of heaven as a reward arbitrarily bestowed at the end of earthly existence . It is , in its essence , a state of mind and heart . " Behold , " says our Lord , " the kingdom of God is within you . " That kingdom is the government of Divine truth and goodness in our souls . Its happiness consists in the delight which flows from conformity to the laws of Divine order , or , what is the same thing , from the active exercise of love to God and man . So far as any one is in that delight , he is in heaven . Though this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interiorly in the company of angels , and after the death of the body lives openly and consciously among them . Those , on the other hand , whose ruling love is love of self or the world , are in the exactly opposite condition . Their happiness consists , not in doing good to others and making them happy , but in selfish and sensual indulgences . To live in heaven would be no joy to them , but rather torment . Heaven is not in their hearts ; they spurn and reject it in their lives . Their state is described by the word hell . It is the state from which all are mercifully delivered , who , according to their knowledge and ability , give heed to the Divine admonitions . It is the state in which all eternally remain who refuse to submit themselves to the Divine guidance . These , then , are the fundamental principles of the new Christianity , which I , albeit feebly and unworthily , espouse : First , one God ,  --  Father , Son and Holy Spirit ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all His fullness , as the Lord Jesus Christ ; secondly , accountability to Him , as a living personal presence , in whose eyes all evil is sin , and who is the source of all goodness ; and , thirdly , the Sacred Scriptures , laid open as to their interior spiritual contents , and shown to be a book of infinite wisdom , the eternal expression of God 's truth to men . Many important , yet minor , doctrines are involved in these ; but these are the three essentials to which all the others are tributary . It remains simply to be said , that when I speak of the New Church , I do not refer to any mere organization of professed believers who call themselves by that name . To such an organiza // tion I belong , and it supplies for me a want which can not be met elsewhere . But the term New Church , in the broader sense in which Swedenborg teaches us to use it , is a new phase of religious thought and life , receiving its impulse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Few intelligent men of to-day are too blind to see that the wondrous changes amid which we live are having their marked effect on Christianity itself . The old dogmas of a hundred years ago are , as it were , melting away in the warmth of a new and milder atmosphere . The sons discard , sometimes quite unconsciously , the cherished opinions of their fathers . Not only the beliefs , but the asperities , of former generations are disappearing . And still the change goes on . In the middle of the last century these things were all foretold by the calm Swedish philosopher , who subscribed himself " Servant of the Lord Jesus Christ , " as he expounded the deeper meaning of Scripture , and recorded his marvelous visions , in the devout belief that he was commissioned to proclaim the truths of a new dispensation . Certain it is that the trend of modern Christian thought , so far as it has deviated from the old standards , and still maintains its Christian character , has been in the direction which he indicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , who imagines that the end of this new movement has yet been reached . Rather should we say that it has hardly begun . Fortunately , the ordering of events is not in our hands . The holy city , New Jerusalem , type of the church that is to be , is not built up by men upon the earth , but comes down from God out of heaven . It comes not with observation , but it surely comes ; and everywhere around us are the signs of its coming . JAMES REED .
