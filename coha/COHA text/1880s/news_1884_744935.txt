txt Gov . CLEVELAND 'S second message to the Legislature of this State is a very long and rather commonplace document . It presents a sn fficiently. ' clear and comprehensive summary of the present condition of the various interests of the State , and some of its recommendations are explicit and judicious , but it lacks incisiveness and slurs over in a vague manner some of the most important questions of the time . The subject of highest interest to the people of the great cities of the State , that of reform in the methods of municipal administration , is not even mentioned . Next to municipal reform the most important subject which should occupy the attention of the Legislature is that of revising the tax laws . The Governor speaks in a mild . way of the defects of the present system , but he seems to be quite at a loss when . dealing with the question of remedies . He is very much impressed by the fact that there is a wide disparity between the valuation of real and personal property , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same footing as the one object to be sought . It is a very common , but an extremely superficial , notion that this is necessary in order to secure an equitable distribution of the burden of taxation . No doubt if all property could be reached and assessed according to its value , the burden would be distributed with an approach to equity , but this is simply impracticable . The abolition of deductions for debt in the assessment of personal property would remove one cover for evasion , but it would by no means work a cure for the evils of inequality . The task before the Legislature is not so simple as the Governor seems to think . Mr. CLEVELAND regards the free canal policy as fully justified by the results ; but the fact that there was an increase in the diversion of traffic from the railroads to the canals does not prove all that he claims for it . So far as the future treatment of the waterways is concerned his suggestions are confined to a system of " constant and gradual repairs . " On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , considering the importance which attaches to it at the present time . His meaningless utterances on the subject of contract labor remind one of the vague outgivings of a party platform . " The opportunity of the working man should not be injuriously affected by the labor of convicts in the prisons ; nor , unless to avoid such a danger or Other serious abuses , should the self-supporting feature of the prisons be lost and the expense of their maintenance added to the burden of the tax-payers . " This is the sum and substance of what he has to say on one of the most important problems with which tha Legislature is called upon to deal . When he comes to . speak of the charitable institutions of the State he is somewhat more explicit , but his recommendations lack definiteness . He finds much evidence of lax management and inefficient supervision which result in extray. agance and a loss of benefits that might ' be secured . He argues in favor of concentrated responsibility , and his one specific deleted 3 lines salary should be ' paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The suggestion isa good one if we can make sure of an absolutely " fit person " to bear so great a responsibility . The Governor reverts more in sorrow than in anger to the failure of the last Senate to confirm-his nominee for Emigration . Commissioner under the new law , and hopes that the speedy execution of the law will , ' be provided for , but he is rather glad the new Harbor-master law did not go into effect , and recommends its repeal . ? He would have the whole Harbor-master system done away with , leaving the duties pertaining to it to the care of the City Dock Department . That is where they rightly belong . The old question of quarantine reform is judiciously treated , as well as that of mitigating the burden of the pilotage laws on shipping at this port . The Governor does not agree with his friend Senator JACOBS as to the necessity of the fees at present exacted under these laws . The Railroad Commission receives a deserved compliment , and the Governor 's mind has an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of corporations to the State . He touches upon a question of great importance , that of protecting minority stockholders against the selfish schemes of Directors and managers who secure a controlling interest in their affairs . The Governor is very complacent over the civil service reform law , and needs to be reminded that something more than a law is necessary to secure an ideal system of public administration . He attributes more virtue to the primary election act than in its present form it contains . So long as primary elections are conducted by political associations in a quasi-private fashion the limitations of such a law will be of little practical value . The Governor is in favor of preserving the Adirondack forests , but is unduly startled by the proposition to purchase the lands necessary for the purpose . Nobody proposes that the State shall rush in and buy up the wilderness from a gang of speculators at fancy prices , but it should acquire the lands speedily enough for the purpose it has to effect and in the way most consistent with economy in its widest sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Governor 's message to guide or stimulate them in the work they have to do .
