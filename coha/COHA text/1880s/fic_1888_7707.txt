Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : SENATOR GRANDILOW. from The lost earl 1888 If , I were Senator Grandilow , Mounting the marble portico , Going to speak where Sumner spoke , To waken the echoes Webster woke , While the anxious nation waits to hear Peals of warning or notes of cheer , Would n't my pulse tingle and my heart glow ,  --  If I were Senator Grandilow ? I say to myself , when Grandilow Looks smilingly down on friend and foe , Thumb in waistcoat , quite at home Under the flag-topped senate dome . Fearless of front and valiant of lung , With a nimble wit and a silvery tongue ,  --  " Ah , would some power on me bestow The glorious gifts of a Grandilow ! " I gaze in wonder at Grandilow ! His eloquence bursts , a bright jet d'eau . Diamond-crested , rainbow-spanned , A pillar of light over all the land . A beacon of hope to a people long Groping in shadows of doubt and wrong ; At least I fancy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For , if I were Senator Grandilow , A chosen chief , would I forego The privilege of the hour and place , To lead , enlighten , and lift my race ? To rise sublime above private ends , The clamors of faction , the claims of friends , And strike for the right one downright blow ,  --  If I were a leader like Grandilow ? Would I ( suppose I were Grandilow , Sachem of the mighty bow ! ) Envenom my shafts with spleen and pique , Make base alliance with ring and clique , And mix with solemn affairs of state Powwow of passion and party hate ? Well , yes , I might , but would I , though , If I were Senator Grandilow ? I am not skilled , like Grandilow , To graft my fortunes and make them grow On flourishing boughs of the nation 's tree ; I have n't the arts of such as he , Prosperous patriots who have made Their country 's service a thriving trade ; Her needs their steps to rise by ;  --  no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is it fitting ( pardon me , Grandilow , If the question seems malapropos ) That a favored son should bring to her A thrice-divided love ; prefer To the public good his party 's call , Clan before party , and self before all ? Are there no debts , but the debts you owe A certain Senator Grandilow ? For , let me say to you , Grandilow ,  --  Mounting the marble portico , With your fist gripped full of the bolts of fate , For a stand-up fight in the strifes of state ,  --  The horizon is larger than your hat , The world is wider than your cravat , A fact you possibly may not know ;  --  Think of it , will you , Grandilow ? No patent-reaper , O Grandilow , Will reap a harvest we do not sow ! Error is violent , truth is strong ; The present is brief , the future long ; And History writes with an iron pen ; Time wags his sifter of deeds and men , And into it straightway we must go ; Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dear Grandilow ! Do n't soar so high nor stoop so low ; Quit your trained horses of craft and pride : The world admires the way you ride , But the world has other things to do Than to watch the hoop while you jump through . The Senate is n't a circus show , Senator ! Senator Grandilow ! Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : " WHEN WE CAME FROM THE WAR . " SONG OF THE POORHOUSE VETERANS . from The lost earl 1888 Our people , when first we came home from the war , Before they forgot what the fighting was for , Came out with gay bands , and a wonderful noise Of cannon and shouting , to welcome us boys . Our riddled old regiment marched in its rags Under arches of triumph and billowy flags , That made the poor shred of our ensign ashamed ; And orators under an awning declaimed ; And loud were the plaudits ; and handkerchiefs waved When they talked of the Union our armies had saved , And vowed that our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never forget , When first we came home from the war . But the fervor of greeting died out with the sound Of the guns and the trumpets , and some of us found That with toil and exposure and wounds badly healed We had left the best part of ourselves on the field ; While at home younger men had stepped into our place , And put us old limpers quite out of the race . Our welcome wore off , and the often-told tale Of our services soon became hackneyed and stale . Kind souls , when we offered small wares at their doors , Would buy them in pity , but voted us bores , And could hardly believe that the blue-coated tramps Were ever acquainted with battles and camps , Or ever came home from the war . At length they decided to settle us down In the almshouse , with other poor wrecks of the town . No parade of gay bands and great crowds thronging near With flags and orations to welcome us here ! But the rosy-faced keeper received us , and said That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , troubled no more with our needles and soap , And the sight of gaunt men without health , without hope , Who sadly remind them of services past , Our kind-hearted people have leisure at last To forget all about what the fighting was for , And the promises made when we came from the war , When first we came home from the war .

Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : THE REASON WHY . from The lost earl 1888 Your thronged bright parlors are a paradise I too would enter ; but before my eyes The doubting angel waves his two-edged sword  --  The dread of boring and of being bored .

Trowbridge , J. T. ( John Townsend ) , 1827-1916 : ALCOTT . from The lost earl 1888 ( Inviting a Friend to one of the early " Conversations . " ) Do you care to meet Alcott ? His mind is a mirror , Reflecting the unspoken thought of his hearer : To the great he is great , to the fool he 's a fool : In the world 's dreary desert a crystalline pool . Where a lion looks in and a lion appears : But an ass will see only his own ass 's ears .
