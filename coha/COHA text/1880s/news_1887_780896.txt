txt It is impossible to exaggerate the universal character of the sensation  --  I had almost said stupefaction  --  created by the manifesto of the Comte do Paris . It is treated in a dozen different ways by a dozen various cliques and factious , but it is safe to say that each of them , since Friday , has been thinking of nothing else . The papers return to it day after day , and many columns are given over as well to interviews , a l ' America . with politicians , groat and small . Edmond Herve , of the Soleil , who has long been the journalistic high priest of Orleansism , is the only editor who unreservedly praises the utterances . This is not strange , since he unquestionably helped to write , or at least to revise , it , and for months has been preparing the public for its appearance by saying that everybody knew what the old French monarchy was , and it was high time that somebody in authority should tell what the new monarchy would be like . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , loads the radical onslaught , calling the royal author " Mister Philippe 7 , " and slashing him savagely . All the Radicals profess to believe that the manifesto not only destroys what is left of the monarchical party , but involves the overthrow of the Rouvier Cabinet . At the other extreme the Ultra-Legitimists make haste to declare that it puts the last nail in the Orleans coffin . Their organ , L'Univers , says that the Coulte 's manifesto means simply his abdication . Yesterday he was King ; now ho is merely a candidate . His , recognition of the plebiscite destroys the last vestige of his claim to inherit under the Capetian compact . He merely offers a republic , like the rest , and of the three forms of republic to which France now unhappily is doomed , the Royalist , Socialist , and Caesarian , the future assuredly is not to belong to the first . Between these extremes of condemnation are many varying shades of criticism .

The Catholic Church is promised only equally with others . Cassagnac , indeed , surprises Paris by praising the general tone of the manifesto as an adaptation of Bonapartism , and saying he does n't care which of the two Princes , Victor or Philippe , wins France . He concludes : " We will go in a body to the one which is first ready , for France is dying and can not wait . " What will come out of all this nobody has the calmness yet to inquire , much less to foresee . It is taken for granted now that the meeting of the Chambers will be hurried-forward , and that Rouvier will try to offset the manifesto by a Ministerial defense of some sort , but how he eau defend himself when he has not been attacked , or why ho is responsible for the vagaries of the Pretender at Twickenham because a small minority of his supporters in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far greater reason , if the Parisian politicians only knew it , to fear the outside results of this manifesto than the internal complications . There are many passages in the manifesto which obviously hinge upon the eventuality of war , In fact , the whole document seems to have the close of a war in view as the basis of its arguments . Uneasy minds begin to reflect that this document was admittedly prepared months ago , presumably has been seen by the Czar , King of Denmark , and other . Orleanist allies , and its publication at this particular time is most likely by their assent . The question arises , May it not be thrown in the air as a storm bird , heralding an approaching convulsionf May it not be that the Czar has resolved on war , and takes this way to let the French know that he will welcome their alliance and gladly help them to regain Alsace and Lorraine , if only they will come to him under a sovereign who is his friend ' ?

The present Philadelphia celebration is exciting much comment here , and the universal approval given is very enthusiastic . An army review of 30,000 men must cause a smile in a country where this number would be but a handful of men ; but the smile changes to instant regret at the apparently increasing necessity of bestowing so many millions for the maintenance of such a force . What astonishes the people most in the ceremony is the fact that a Protestant Bishop leads the opening prayers and a Catholic Cardinal gives the final blessing .

He has gone , as it now turns out , in order that his wife may endeavor , contrary to recent Russian law , to inherit the good sum of 7.000,000,000. left to her by the death of her brother , Prince Wittgenstein . The estates are situated iu Lithuania , and it is already surmised that the Czar will make RO exception in her case , and the immense inheritance will return to the Russian Crown . The famous Potoeka family are also losers to a very large amount . There is a new project for a metropolitan railway . A M. Berlier has offered to build ' within two years , and before the opening of the exhibition , a metallic tube , in which trains may be run from Porte Dauphine to the Bastile and all along the boulevards and Rue de Rivoll .

Besides this there are to be frequent wells made , and it Is estimated that the current of air produced alone by the passage of trains will maintain the temperature at about 600 during the entire year . Metallic bridges will span the sewers at Asnieres and the Saint Martin Canal . M. Berlier asks no subvention from the State or city , and in the construction of the tunnel he will not interfere with the usual street traffic . M.

Daudet , however , gives " his gracious permission to the writer of ' Theodora ' to produce his play if , as Daudet pro-supposes , Tosca is neither a conspirator , loved by a Republican , nor a Republican , placed between his duty and his passion , accused of being a traitor to his country .
