EDUCATIOINAL TOPICS . ARTICLE 1. - IN MEMORIAM . An Address delivered in the Chapel of Yale College , Sunday , Apr11 18 , 1886 . PROFESSOR THOMAS ANTHONY THACHER was born in Hartford , Conn. , Jan. 11th , 1815. * On his father 's side he was descended from Rev. Thomas Thacher , the first minister of the Old South Church in Boston , and on the side of his mother , from one of the founders of Yale College , the Rev. Thomas Bnckingham of Saybrook . His father had been disappointed in not receiving a college training himself and was the more bent on giving the advantages of a liberal education to each of his sons . He was fitted for college at the Hopkins Grammar School in his native city , which was then in the hands of three very able men and distinguished scholars , viz : Rev. Professor E. P. Barrows , now of Oberlin , Rev. F. A. P. Barnard , now President of Columbia College , New York , and Rev. William Carter , who died some years ago after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1831 and graduated in 1835 with high honors and an excellent reputation . He filled a vacant post as teacher in New Canaan , Conn. , till December of that year , when he made an engagement in Oglethorpe county , Georgia , and subsequently another , involving a residence in that State of some three years . Dec. 1st , 1838 , he entered upon his duties as a tutor in Yale College , and since that time has been an officer of the same . What he was as a student and a tutor may be learned most satisfactorily from the testimony of one of his instructors at Hartford , Professor Barrows , and his classmate and associate Tutor , Professor Brocklesby , now of Trinity College , Hartford , and his associate instructor , Professor Nathan P. Seymour . Professor Barrows writes : " It will be sixty years next autumn since my acquaintance with him began . At that date I * Died April 6 , 1886. // took charge of the Hartford Grammar School , of which he was a member and where he prepared himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his history with the liveliest interest and with an ever-increasing admiration for his many excellencies as a ripe scholar , a skillful instructor , and a man of sterling integrity in all the relations of life . " Professor Brocklesby writes : " I became acquainted with Professor Thacher at the very beginning of our college life and formed with him a close friendship , which was only broken by his death . You ask What sort of a man he was in college ? ' The boy was father to the man ; ' and , all those fine qualities that distinguished his manhood were discovered in his yonth . As a student he was faithful and earnest , and above all , honest . No tricks or contrivances to outrank others ever entered his mind . Whatever rewards he gained he earned . Throughout his college course he never came under censure , being always amenable to the constituted authority . Thacher was quite popular in his class , for he was eminently sociable and joyous in his disposition and full of exuberant spirits , which made our college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and generous , and his many qualities won for him many life-long friends ; I esteem it one of God 's gifts to me that he gave me so dear a friend . . . . Above all he was a consistent Christian , pure-minded , and white-hearted ; nothing low and debasing had any attractions for him . He was a good youth and a good man . He has done a good work , and ripe in years , honors , and labors , he has gone to his reward . " Professor Seymour writes as follows : " My acquaintanee with my very dear and life-long friend , Professor Thacher , began very early . We were schoolmates for four years before I entered college , at the old Hartford Grammar School . His school life gave promise of all he became and all he accomplished afterwards . As a school boy he was always a noble , manly fellow , faithful and successful in all his studies . His mind like his character was wellbalanced and symmetrical . His sound judgment , strong common sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the whole a more pure , a more faithful , more thoughtful , more unselfish boy than he was I do not think I have ever known . The same traits of character went with him through college , and gave him the love and respect of his classmates . In his tutorship we always set a high value on his judgment , for he seemed by // intuition to see the strong points of any case , to look at any subject in its most important bearings . " His success in his tutorship was due not only to the kindliness of his nature and the deep personal interest he felt in the young men of his charge , but to a keen discernment of character which always seemed to me one of his rarest gifts . " It will be forty-eight years next autumn since Professor Thacher was elected tutor and began his career of useful and efficient service in this college . The time when he first became a member of the Faculty was an interesting and in some respects a criticalcertainly it was a transition period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1831 , seven years before , the first vigorous and concerted effort had been begun to raise a considerable sum of money from the graduates and friends of the college , to meet its many pressing wants and to serve as an endowment for several special uses . It was so far successful as to bring a hundred thousand dollars into the treasury . The same year brought the election of our beloved and honored President Woolsey as Professor of Greek , opening the way for whatever of blessing has come to the college through his accession . In that year , 31 , the traditional practice had been abandoned , according to which in the three earlier years of the course the students with a few exceptions had been shut up to the instructions of a single officer . In the time of President Dwight , there were only three Professors , viz : of Chemistry and Natural History ; of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy ; and of the Ancient Languages ; two of whom instructed chiefly by lectures , leaving to the President the instruction in Rhetoric , Intellectual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two weekly services on Sunday , in the college pulpit . Before the election of Mr. Woolsey as Professor , in 1831 , there were only five Professors , a Professor of Divinity and a Professor of Rhetoric having been added at the election of President Day , in 1817 . The next addition to this corps was that of President Woolsey to the chair of the Greek Language and Literature . Significant as was this event , it was scarcely more important than the limitation of each of the tutors to a single study . Under the old arrangement , which was derived from the English Universities , the student had been shut up with slight exceptions , during three years of his college course , to a single instructor . If this instructor was able and faithful , if he was successful as a teacher and winning and inspiring as a man , he would make a strong and // beneficial impression on all his pupils . If he was in any respect deficient , being strong in one department and weak in others , or more unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student would suffer , not only in his college course but for all his subsequent life . In any event the studies and activities of the teacher would necessarily be divided between three studies , one of which he would naturally prefer , and to the others would be more or less indifferent . Under the new arrangement , each instructor was still made specially responsible for a division of the class , and the inestimable and indispensable benefits which follow from special personal intercourse and supervision were still retained . The decade from 1830 to 1840 was memorable for other changes and events . It was a period of great religious activity and enterprise , of active political and theological controversy , of important ecclesiastical divisions and of abundant scientific enterprise . It was also a time of general interest in the subject of education both popular and university . In 1827 a proposition had been introduced to the Corporation of this college for a very radical reform , which attracted the attention of the public and brought before the Corporation and the public in 1830 two very elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Yale . The attention of the public was beginning to be directed to the systems of public education in Germany , both popular and higher , and information was earnestly sought for in respect to the methods of classical instruction in the Gymnasia and of lecturing in the University . There Was a general feeling that the students and the public would welcome important changes in the methods of instruction and discipline which had been accepted in our American colleges . The instruction in Greek by the new Professor at Yale had also , a little later , given a new impulse to classical study and had awakened a literary spirit among his pupils . What was especially noticeable is the circumstance that he began with confident enthusiasm on the theory that a larger freedom might be allowed the students if greater reliance were reposed on the interest which the instructor might awaken in the sub*ject matter of their studies , but he was soon obliged to fall back upon the old traditions that a stringent discipline in respect to attendance and preparation must be rigidly enforced . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the disposition to harmless or vicious mischief which still prevailed in this , as in other colleges , which needed constant repression and precaution , and which constantly threatened to bring more or fewer of the students into conflict with the college authorities and to involve at times the severest penalties . The comparative exemption from riotous disturbances and mischievous pranks which at present prevails , and the higher tone of both manners and morals which now controls our social atmosphere , makes it well nigh impossible for those of the present generation to understand how trying was the position of a college officer thirty years ago , in most , if not in all of the colleges of this country . This college had nothing to boast of in the way of exemption in those ruder times , but it may claim to have , with some success , attempted to enforce its own rules and to maintain necessary order at whatever cost . I have recalled these pictures of the past in order to enforce the position that the times when Professor Thacher began to serve this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we all may understand how important was the service which he was called to render and how eminently fitted he was to meet the exigencies which constantly required his services . It will be still more interesting as we proceed , for us all to observe how , amid the constantly changing needs of the college and the continued enlargement of its organization , he has ever been able and willing to render it the serviecs especially required . 1*t was in 1838 that he was elected Tutor of Latin . During his tutorship he very early attracted the attention of Professors Kingsley and Woolsey , for the enterprise and energy with which he devoted himself to his work , for the rare combination of courage and honesty , of kindness and tenacity , of sagacity and justice , which he manifested in the discipline of the college , under the many trials which its conduct involved . As the consequence of four years ' experience of his success and his promise , he was warmly commended by Professors Kingsley and Woolsey , and elected as assistant Professor of Latin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best to limit his sphere , and he was elected assistant Professor in Latin , with leave of absence for a year , which leave was extended by another year , giving him two years for continuous study and travel in Germany and Italy , the most of which time was spent in Berlin , in earnest study and close observation of the methods of instruction which were practiced in the Gymnasia and University . // During his residence in Berlin he was invited to give instruction for several weeks to the Crown Prince of Prussia , now the prospective Emperor , and to his cousin Prince Frederic Charles , who were then severally fifteen and sixteen years of age . His principal instructor and intimate friend in Berlin was Dr. August Zumpt , a very distinguished gentleman , with whom I myself subsequently became acquainted , and who expressed the highest esteem for his friend and pupil . During his residence abroad , he not only gave unremitting attention to the new grammar of the Latin language , but to the methods of instruction as used in the Gymnasia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instructor . He returned in 1845 to give himself to his life work , with characteristic ardor , industry , and devotion . The same year it deserves to be noticed Mr. James Iladley was elected tutor , whose influence was subsequently so important alike on the discipline and scholarship of the college . In 1846 , Professor Thacher was married to the saintly lady in whom a certain ideal unearthliness seemed to transfigure all other charms , whom he could and would never forget . In the same year President Woolsey began his work as President , when the entire regime of the Senior class was conformed to that of the lower classes . Morning recitations were exacted of them as rigidly as of the classes below . Previously their imagined dignities and privileges had been interpreted as exempting them from constant and oft-recurring and regularly returning obligations . But these were summarily set aside and the gospel of uniform and constantly pressing , work was put into vigorous operation in the entire undergraduate department . In January of the following year , i. e. , 1847 , my work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buildings was assigned me adjacent to that of Professor Thacher , and for nearly twenty years we were in constant personal contact , seeing and chatting with one another , often many times a day . From that time to the present I can speak of him from intimate knowledge , founded on the closest observation and the frankest expression of his purposes and feelings , of his judgments of men and of events , , of his theories of education and his estimates of measures and tendencies in this and other institutions . In regard to many points I can speak with the most positive confidence , which is attended with the assurance that the judgments of many who hear me can not but coincide with my own , simply because our // friend was so frank , so outspoken , so positive and yet so ready to give the reasons for his opinions and doings . Professor Thacher was an excellent teacher . From the first he had given special and persistent attention to teaching as an art . There are not a few eminent scholars , who seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are utterly unconscious that they outrun the capacity of their pupils to follow them , or from the absorption of their own minds with their own intellectual activities , or from some want of patience or ingenuity in adapting their instructions to the wants or capacities of their classes . There are others who only become successful by dint of patient and painful labor . Professor Thacher was , so to speak , a 6orn teacher . His scholarship was unquestioned . He was manifestly at home in his department and revelled in his conscious mastery of his theme , giving his pupils that confidence which such obvious mastery awakened , which is higher and surer than any unreplying acquiescence which is enforced by positive assertions or any timid assent which is frightened by dogmatism . He was patient in exposition , recognizing the truth that it was his privilege and his duty not merely to know for himself but chiefly to impart to others , and that he ought never to be content until he had succeeded in bringing his own knowledge within the possible reach and the actual possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth that it was his duty to hold his pupils to a constant responsibility in showing that they had mastered the task assigned ; whether this were the interpretation of a classic , the reproduction of a demonstration , the recital of facts , or the justification of an induction . Not a few competent teachers fail for lack of fidelity . Professor Thacher was no such man . Of him it would be eminently true " among the faithless , faithful only he . " Professor Thacher was eminently rigorous because he would be just to his own conscience and just to the interests of his pupils . At the same time he was eminently sympathizing . His pupils felt and knew that he was their friend and hence they accepted the searching questions with which he posed them , and the tenacious grasp within which he held them , as simply just . However severe these methods were in their operation , they were made loving by the loving spirit which beamed from his eye and was expressed by his tones . His methods of teaching were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them have not yet been outgrown . He had become personally cognizant of the methods which were practiced in the drill of the modern gymnasium , and the lecture of the modern university , after ample opportunities of conversation with the ablest classical teachers of his time . He brought home fresh impressions from the class- and lecture-rooms of Germany and England , with th' courage and ardor which were required to enforce them , and hence he was universally accepted as an invigorating and inspiring teacher . Something might be said of the desirableness that he had trained his pupils earlier and more abundantly to freer and more abundant reading in his college exercises , and very recently some confident criticisms have been given to the public by a sincere admirer and affectionate pupil , which had better have been spared , even if they were just , but which seem palpably unjust in the impressions which they would leave of such teachings as those of Professors Thacher and HadJey . It would seem that critics who are also teachers , would do well to remember that some eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelled by a sense of simple justice to their pupils to exact thorough work in grammatical analysis , as an essential condition of intellectual training , especially when for manifold reasons , this proper school work is not uniformly achieved in the schools and consequently must be carried over into the colleges . The conscientious instructor takes his pupils as he finds them , and exercises them , not in what would suit his own tastes and would gratify his own feelings , but in what will meet their necessities ,  --  often , very often , when impatiently repeating the familiar lessons and reiterating the monotonous drill , he is simply denying his own preferences and doing violence to his own tastes . It should also not be forgotten that by the common consent of most men who are competent to judge , there is no kind of intellectual athletics more useful and more necessary for the higher forms of culture than the reflective analysis of classic sentences ; nor again that the more obtuse is the apprehension of the indolent and the dull , and the more impatient the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more imperative is the occasion for the repetition of the process . If this repetition is sometimes tedious to the pupil , it is doubly so to the teacher . But Professor Thacher 's patience was never exhausted . If the patience of his ignorant or indolent or conceited or 13las* pupils were now and then also tried , he still held on his course and held the field ; he was never stupid and never dull . lie // uniformly gave to his work that unexhausted patience which Coleridge has so well described as the crowning grace of the ideal teacher . " When overtasked at Length Both love and hope beneath the task give way , Then with a statue 's smile , a statue 's strength , Stands the mute sister , Patience , nothing loth , And both supporting , does the work of both . " I may not leave the impression that Professor Thacher was not an intelligent and inspiring teacher . He was exactly the contrary . Whether he commented upon a favorite author or taught Latin composition , or discoursed on grammar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not hesitate to express and enforce . The atmosphere of his class-room was always breezy and quickening . Reading at sight had indeed not been introduced as a college exercise during his time of active service . It is a great mistake , however , to suppose that it is a modern device . It is more than fifty years since our own Professor Kingsley commended it with great interest and backed it by the best philological authority . Professor Thacher was an inspiring and eminent example of the truth that the teacher 's vocation is a vocation of service to the pupil , and that his success should be tested by skill and willingness in the discharge of his distinctive and appropriate function . Whether he is a member of a great university or a small college , his vocation is the same . It is not to study for the advancement of science , or the reputation of his college or himself . Nor does he discharge his proper functions if he simply examines his pupils , by a mechanical set of questions or the still less personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a living man , learned and thorough , and therefore confident in his department of knowledge ; ready to communicate , because of his generous and warm-hearted sympathy ; quick to understand and patient to remove the difficulties of his pupils ; while he is rigorous and frank in exposing their defects , bouyant with courage and hope , and therefore a spring of life to all whom he encounters . Professor Thacher was eminently a teacher of this spirit . He had no sympathy with the hirelings who value their office for its eminence of place , or leisure for research , or indolence of life , or who use their time , their reputation or their acquisitions for any except a supreme devotion to the well being of their pupils . // Professor Thacher was also eminently able and successful in the discipline and police of the college . Before he was elected assistant Professor , the Board of Tutors had been chiefly responsible for the duties of this sort , and at times this responsibility was such as to try their patience and their courage . During his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of special qualifications for success , in his courage and sagacity , in his skill and wisdom , and above all in that self.regardless enterprise which made him prompt and ever eager to meet the demands of public duty . It was natural that when he was advanced to the position of the sole assistant Professor , he should continue to be relied upon as the leader in every service of practical discipline . How nobly he answered to this expectation for a score of years can be known only by those who were associated with him . How ingenious were his devices to forestall and avoid evil , how skillful his plans to overcome it , how able in every form of activity to detect and punish , all will remember who acted and suffered with him . When punishment became necessary , no one was more able in justifying the decisions of the Faculty to the sufferers and their friends , who are often the hardest to be convinced . In all efforts of this kind his genius and his unselfishness were both conspicuous . He spared no pains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in laboring to justify the acts of the Faculty to all concerned ; never resting content till the explanation was complete and the decision was accepted as just . His confidencc of probable or actual success was not infrequently a wonder to his less sanguine associates . In such a case his ardor and perseverance and ingenuity knew no limits . Strange as it may seem to some , his activity in repressing and detecting evil gave him strength and influence with the body of students . It brought him into intimate associations with many beyond his own classes , and in circumstances which forced the high-minded and generous to discern his sturdy manliness and his self-forgetting unselfishness , and so it happened in the most natural way , that he was personally known to a very large number of students , of all classes , and at an earlier period of their college life than was true of any other permanent member of the Faculty . Knowing the sons , he would naturally and insensibly know their parents . Naturally frank , conversable , and hospitable , he not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but was all the while adding golden threads to the slender cord of casual interviews , turning strangers into personal friends throughout the whole country . // 451 What contributed greatly to these results was the special guardianship which he exercised over a very considerable number of students from families of wealth and position . Offices of this sort fell more actually into his hands than into those of any of his associates , and there were many reasons why he should be ready to undertake them . The satisfactory and zealous discharge of these duties necessarily widened the circle of his personal friendships with parents who were won to feelings of confidence and gratitude and were thus made the warm friends of Professor Thacher and of Yale College . Probably the name of no one of its officers within the last forty years has been familiar in so many families and held in higher affectionate regard than the name of Professor Thacher . For similar reasons he very naturally began to be looked to as fitted to act with efficiency and success in raising money for the college . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now almost forty years , this subject has been upon his mind and heart . For many months and years , when we lived in adjacent rooms and saw each other many times in the day , the subject was one of constant interest and discussion . During much of this time he was in a sense the commissioned agent of the college . In urging the second great movement for this object , which was begun in 1854 , he was prominent and most efficient . Knowing as I did every minute detail of the effort , I can confidently aver that he was indefatigable in the counsels and measures which were finally crowned with success . In very many of the very liberal pecuniary contributions that have been made to Yale College , since the war , he has also been . most efficient , and the last solicitude of his earthly life concerned the economical completion of an enterprise involving a gift of 4*75 , OOO , which gift was suggested and secured by his instrumentality . No one can know who has not had this experience , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every single large contribution to this college . No stranger to the experience can begin to compute at what cost of thought and labor to Professor Thacher , the treasury of Yale College has been enriched for the last forty years . The golden gifts , the reports of which now and then surprise and delight its friends , represent days and weeks , and sometimes months and years of labor and activity that can never be reported . The ruling motive of his heart , I need not say , has been his passionate interest in the prosperity and usefulness of the college // of his love ; his single-hearted and tireless devotion to its honor and usefulness . This interest has been singularly unselfish . Though he has not hesitated to avow that he loved Yale College because it was his own college , yet that interest has been justified to his unshaken convictions of its importance to the country and the world . I ought to add in this place that his interest and activity were by no means limited to the Academical Department or the college proper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the reconstruction of the Theological Department during the years in which it maintained its struggling existence before its complete re*istablishment in 1 8 ' 71 . The School of Fine Arts owes very much to his patient and persistent good offices with Mr. and Mrs. Street , its sole and its munificent founders . No one save those who shared in these efforts can appreciate how manifold and longcontinued they were , and what a triumph of gratitude and joy went up from our hearts as the costly walls of its noble building went up in troublous and expensive times . With similar interest he labored and consulted for the establishment of the Department of Philosophy and the Arts , out of which the Sheffield Scientific School was developed , as also for the formal arrangements for graduate instruction . He cooperated most heartily in the attempts to bring the Observatory into actual life and was sympathetically alive to every measure of its managers . Whatever might have been his opinions in respect to the relations of these Schools to the college proper , he rejoiced most sincerely in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers . His interest in- whatever concerned the good name of the University was at times alniost painful in its intensity . He was acutely alive to every criticism of its constitution or its policy . His distress was at times painfully acute at what he was confident were misconceptions of the facts and principles involved in the current discussions of the theory and operation of the system which we hold in common with the majority of American colleges . And yet he was no blind or obstinate conservative , but was as ready to look forwards as backwards . Certainly he was the farthest possible from being an obstinate obstructionist ; believing most cordially in the possibility and duty of development and of growth . Hence in all his plans and labors for buildings and expenditures , he was most sanguine even to excess of liberality . Almost the last words which he said to me were in the emphatic declaration : " I believe Yale College has a great future and to this // future we must adjust . our present plans of building and expenditure . " Notwithstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catholic and just in his appreciation of other institutions and their officers , and was singularly courteous in his personal relations with them on all public and private occasions . I ought not to omit his ardent interest and his active services in the cause of general education . He served for nearly all his University career as Trustee of the Hopkins Grammar School in this city , and gave to its affairs his constant attention . Under his advice and hopefuluess it has been greatly enlarged and made more effective . Whatever was its condition , it was constantly cared for by his never-failing sympathy . At one time he gave lessons in Latin in the New Haven High School , more for the significance of the service than for the emolument . For several years he was an active and efficient member of the State Board of Education , traveling extensively to lecture and never withholding his sympathy from scholars and teachers , and resigning only on account of disability from disease . Indeed Professor Thacher was essentially what an old English divine calls a p*d3lic soul , blending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-forgetfulness of Christian consecration . He cared intensely for the welfare of his family , his neighbors , his classmates , his college , his city , his church , and his country . How much he cared for his country they can estimate who remember him in the war for its salvation and deliverance . How intense was his sympathy in every disaster and every victory , how impatient of any coldness in his cause , and how triumphant at the consummation so long delayed and so welcomed at the last , But in no one form was this unselfish devotion to public interest so conspicuous as in his passionate personal devotion to Yale College . This devotion was always manifest but never so prominently as during the last two or three years of his life , in which the wisdom of its policy and the permanency of its constitution have been openly called in question . It was not always easy to decide what form of emotion predominated in his heart , but it was easy to discern that he was honestly distressed at whatever he feared might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had spared no strength and to which he had sacrificed his life . Whatever may be thought of the reasonableness of his fears , no man can doubt that they sprang from the purest and most unselfish impulses. // Here let me name his liberal and cordial hospitality . Nothing rejoiced him more than to welcome to his table the casual guest or the long-time acquaintance . Many a visitor in New Haven came to him a stranger and left him as a friend . In offices of courtesy no man was more sincere , and in thoughtful ministrations to the sick and afflicted he was never remiss or indifferent . It was difficult to say whether the man , the gentleman , or the Christian had more to do with these kindly courtesies . And yet with all this courtesy there was a certain outrightness or downrightness of manner which bespoke the independence and positiveness of the man , or rather the strength and ardor of his convictions , and the unconscious reliance upon his own capacity to maintain them . The stranger would sometimes discern that while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were positive and strong . But at the same time he could not fail to discover that whether they seemed well or illfounded , they contemplated a noble ideal for himself , and that from the depths of his soul he scorned meanness , self-seeking , and dishonor . Words can not describe the intensity of his antagonism against baseness and untruth , against selfishness and self-seeking . It would not be strange if he sometimes seemed distrustful of men who had forfeited his confidence or had defended untruth , but even the casual acquaintance could see at a glance that the animating spirit of the man was generosity and nobleness . Consequently wherever he went or whomever he encountered , he made friends for himself and for the college by his manly frankness , his sturdy self-reliance , his cordial sympathy , and his noble aspirations . But whatever he was in character as a man , whatever he achieved by his industrious studies , his faithful teaching , his private kindness , and his public enterprise , all these were lavishly expended for the college of his love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devoted public life . I find that in recounting Professor Thacher 's public services I have almost unconsciously referred to his character as a conspicuous element of his usefulness and power . That this was eminently true in his own person no one who knew him will question . It deserves to be noticed that the importance of this personal element was most distinctly recognized in his theory of a teacher 's fitness for his vocation and as a potent element in college and university life . He utterly repudiated the doctrine that a teacher can be successful in the best sense of the word-however consummate are his mental processes or however rare their products // - who is a mere teaching machine , who does not exemplify and enforce his teachings by an elevated and warm-hearted personality , who does not enforce his by instructions noble scientific conceptions , elevated literary tastes , high ethical aims , and the fervor of an enlightened faith . He held that it was more true of scholars than of any other class of men , that they " live by admiration , faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need in these days that this spirit should pervade the common life of every institution of learning . It was no tradition or interested prejudice , but a conviction of his which was confirmed by the experiences of nearly half a century , that whatever changes should befal Yale College , it should never cease to be a Christian college in its theory and administration . Leaving altogether this consideration of his public services , let us attempt a brief estimate of the distinctive features of the man . Intellectually , he was clear and methodical , solid and practical , showing the results of an excellent training and a truth-loving and independent mind . Ardent in temperament , he held his convictions with a passionate earnestness . Social and sympathetic , he was impelled to assert and defend them . Skilled by practice in teaching and conversation ) he was often masterly and exhaustive in exposition and debate . In appeal and exhortation he occasionally rose to a high strain of effective eloquence . Had he been a lawyer he would have excelled as a sifter of evidence and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenacity and industry united would have added to his effectiveness . Had he been a clergyman he would have been eminent for spiritual earnestness , unaffected fervor , and Christian sympathy , while he would have been bold and impassioned as an expounder of private and public morality . As a scholar he suffered only from the diversity of his public occupations and the variety of the private and public duties which grew out of the narrowness of his own income and that of the college . Both in a sense compelled him to divide his attention and his time between a great variety of duties which were neither classical nor literary . But whatever he produced as a writer was open to no criticism and was recognized and esteemed as solid and finished work . His preparations for the class-room were conscientiously made . He was scrupulously exact in his knowledge and held it always in hand . His memory was tenacious and trustworthy and his judgment was admirable . His taste for literary excellence was severe yet // catholic and his delight in poetry and eloquence was fervent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his loves and dislikes were naturally strong . He was eminently social and sympathetic and was as eminently kind as a neighbor and friend . To his old friends he was faithful and true , and he made new friends to the end of his life . His warm friendship for the late Dr. Williams was interesting and characteristic as contracted late in life between two invalids , who being in a sense shut up to a mutual intimacy by the necessities of the invalid condition of both , were drawn to each other by an almost boyish love . Professor Thacher kept the freshness of his childhood and youth in his affection for the children and youth of his own family and of other households . I may not undertake to say what he was in his own family . It is not given to many men to have had eight sons on whom to expend an affection so faithful , tender , and just , all of whom were spared to surround his grave . It is not given to many sons to have had such a father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so loving and joyous , so hopeful and yet so faithful to duty and to God . I have already spoken of his generous hospitality . His doors were always open to the friends of his college life and to the casual visitor who had never crossed his threshold before , as also to the hundreds of graduates with whom he had held special relationships , and to the friendless and almost penniless student from a distant home , scores of whom have been aided by funds solicited in their behalf from unnamed benefactors . This varied and never ceasing kindness was the irrepressible outflow of a warm and loving heart . It made his a fountain of hope and courage to old and young . It enabled him to stand in the post of danger and of fear in times of trial and to give strength and influence to any cause which he espoused . His Christian fidelity and earnestness were known to all men . His faith was positive , uncompromising , and outspoken . Educated in a Christian home , surrounded by Christian influences at school and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith and maintained the fire of fervent love and worship . His prayers were simple , humble , and sincere , attesting the truth that he walked with God in the secret communings of a child-like love as well as in the busy activities of a crowded and responsible life . To his friends it was most obvious that as he passed the noon of life 's strenuous activities , there was a gentle abatement of life 's fervent heats and a sweeter and larger enjoyment of love to God and man . As his sons began to assume the responsibilities of life // - each one with his separate claim to his solicitude and love , and a daughter , the youngest of all , nestling at his side ,  --  he felt more completely their common dependence upon the providence and blessing of the Father of the spirits of all flesh . The death of her who seemed to be in the earth but not of it , with the angelic sweetness of her departure , could not fail to intensify this spirituality of his own always sensitive spirit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh discipline and incitement to new spiritual affections . The slow dismissal and final departure of the aged President Day , the patriarch of us all , from the house which he had so long blessed with his peace , could not but lift our friend nearer to God . Next the painful but blessed discipline by which his surviving sister was enabled to give a living testimony to the presence of Christ to the trusting soul , could not but lift his heart nearer still . Last of all , the lingering illness and the final removal of the brother whom he admired and loved , opened wide once more the eternal gates and compelled and inclined him to look within upon his own dwelling place . Last of all came first the suggestion , then the possibility , then the probability of his own near departure , made vivid and personal by the recent death of his brother and the removal of President Day , both by a mortal affection similar to his own . Jn the longer or shorter intervals between these significant spasms , there was activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand could readily be used and had been always sufficient , but the secret conviction could never be set aside , that any attack might be fatal . We can not doubt ,  --  we know , that under the discipline of pain and helplessness , the faith of our friend was continually tested and by responding to each trial was made more and more strong ; that his first peaceful acquiescence in the will of God passed over into a joyful anticipation of the summons to eternal peace and rest . These attacks came usually near the breaking of the day . Possibly ,  --  probably , our friend might have anticipated that with the dawn of some morning he should in a moment awake and be with God . Possibly he might have sought for such a release as he bowed in submissiveness to the divine will . We are all assured that he believed that this call would be sudden and might come soon . And yet he had no premonition that it should come when it did , for the evening previous he was unusually joyous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by lightning was an evidence of the favor of the gods . They had also other theories , many of them correct and sagacious , about what constituted a happy , a fortunate death . But their criteria of a happy or desirable death were all drawn from their backward looks into what precedes the final exit . A profounder Christian philosopher , whose words are very familiar , is just to every aspect of death which the thoughtful mind can possibly contemplate . He recognizes the natural dread of the process of dying in the words so true to our human feelings : " Not for that we would be unclothed but clothed upon , that mortality might 1w swallowed up of life . " This natural longing was fulfilled in the happy experience of our departed brother and our much loved friend , for which we have only to offer our thankful praise . We believe that he could also confidently say for himself : " We know that if our earthly house of this tabernacle were dissolved , we have a building of God , a house not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy will it be if each of us can say this of himself , and add : " We are always of good courage and willing rather to be absent from the body and present with the Lord . " More happy still if with our departed friend we do not forget to labor , " that whether present or absent we may be accepted of him . " This is certainly the Christian philosophy of life and its conquest over death . May each of us make this our own in the faith which anticipates and the fruition which shall enjoy the eternal life ! NOAH PORTER .
