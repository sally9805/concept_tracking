txt After seven years of unrestricted competition the fire underwriters of this City have thought it advisable to arrange a common basis for action and agree upon a tariff of rates . The contention which has been going on during the period named has been a severe one . The average premium receipts of the insurance companies on business done in this City have been about one-third less than they were during the years prior to ' 1875 , when the former tariff organization was broken down , this decline representing an annual aggregate loss of income to the companies of not less than $2,500,000 . That is to say , if the rates had been maintained at their old standard the companies would have taken in in premiums in the last seven years fully $17,500,000 more money than they have received for insuring risks in New-York City . The effect of this enormous falling off in receipts has made itself apparent in the forced retirement from business of a large number of companies . Ten years ago there were corporations to the number of thirty or forty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by them within the limits of this City . The local decline in rates has been a fatal blow to many of these . To the companies that have had agencies in other parts of the country the decrease in their Metropolitan income has been , as a rule , attended with less serious results , for in most instances they have been able to make up elsewhere the losses they have incurred here . Still , within the last seven years a number of these have also been compelled to abandon the struggle and retire from the field after reinsuring their outstanding risks in more successful companies . The effect of this contraction has been somewhat detrimental to the business interests of the City . There are large mercantile houses here that have found it a difficult task to procure the insurance they needed to adequately protect their property . After all of the companies represented hero had taken as large " lines " as they cared to , there has still been a deficiency , and merchants have been compelled to send to London and Paris to obtain the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of rate of premium has rarely been raised , for they have been willing to pay liberally for the protection they desired . In a less degree those whose warehouses have been situated in what is known as the " dry goods district " have been similarly troubled . Massed together in this limited territory is a vast amount of property , having a value of several hundred millions of dollars . It is obvious that the manager of an insurance company would have to restrict his risks in such a contracted area . Otherwise his company might be made insolvent by the burning up of a single block . It is the custom for companies to limit the amount they will insure on a single building and on a connecting block of buildings , and for some not very clear reason these restrictions do not vary , as might be supposed , with the financial strength of the companies . An insurance company having a capital of $200,000 may limit its risk on a single building to $10,000 ; but another company which has a capital ten times as large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the business is now carried on a reduction in the number of companies , even when no reduction in . insurance capital takes place , adds greatly to the difficulty of procuring insurance in districts where there is a great demand for it . For this reason it is somewhat to the advantage of business men that the competition which has been steadily reducing the number of companies should come to an end . It is to be hoped that the experience acquired by our New-York underwriters in the downfall of the former tariff association will serve them to some purpose on this occasion . In such a fluctuating and uncertain business as fire insurance it seems essential that a system of rates should be adopted , and even where there is no associated effort some such system is in use , though at a scale too low to be profitable . No one can tell what any given fire risk is worth . Men are certain to die , ships are certain to be lost or condemned ; these are facts which may be calculated upon ; but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra-hazardous risk , may stand untouched by fire for centuries , while a seemingly safe risk may be wholly destroyed within a week after it is insured . Some general scale of rates is therefore necessary , based , not upon the experience of one company , but upon the combined experience of all . Yet while this may be admitted , it must still be said that the tendency of tariff associations is to carry the principle of associated action to an extreme . The power that enables them to get a fair return for the protection they give may also be used to extort unwarrantable gains from the property-owning public . This was the defect in the former association and the cause of its disruption , for the scale of prices established by the underwriters ' board was so far above the real value of the equivalent given that the temptation to undersell their policies to underwriters who were seeking to build up a large business was irresistible . Those who are directing the course of this new association will do well to have constantly in mind the absolute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
