txt Senator Hill , of Georgia , has caused to be published a silly story , in which it is alleged that Senator Kellogg planned what Mr. Hill terms a conspiracy against him , and that Kellogg procured Miss Raymond to bring against him the charge of seduction recently instituted by that person 's counsel in the local courts . Of course there is no foundationor Mr. Hill 's foolish charge . A few days ago , Mr. Hill was making allegations to the effect that the correspondents of Republican newspapers , in collusion with Mr. Kellogg , had hatched the so-called conspiracy , and that the Raymond story was published at this time simply as a means of breaking the force of his opposition to Mr. /Kellogg in the contest of Spofford for a seat in the Senate . The fact is that Mr. Hill is so thoroughly imbued with hatred for Senator Kellogg that he is prepared to allege anything against that gentleman . This feeling is so deep-seated that during the progress of the investigation of the Kellogg case by the Committee on Privileges and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho frequently exhibited his feelings , and before any testimony whatever was taken he publicly declared that he believed Kellogg should be voted out of the Senate . Mr. Hill 's conspiracy story is the fruit of his diseased mind . To make his story more complete , he shoula have added that the infant brought here-. by Miss Raymond was procured from some foundling asylum by Kellogg and the correspondents of Republican newspapers . If Mr. Hill has any evidence of the existence of a conspiracy against him , he should resort to the courts , as he threatened to do when the affidavit of Miss Raymond was published .
