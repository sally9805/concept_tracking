txt Chief Detective Haggerty , of this city , is on the look-out for a party of sharpers who have been attempting to rob several of the banking-houses of Newark and some of the rural banks . The firm of Graham &; Co. , bankers , at No. 810 Broad-street , is among the victims of the game which is practiced . On Saturday last , about 1 o'clock , and while all the clerks were at lunch , John Graham being alone in the office , a small boy entered , and said there was a gentleman in a carriage outside who wished to see Mr. Graham . Without stopping to con= sider that the office would be left exposed , Mr. Graham went out to the sidewalk . A man , apparently 25 years old , well dressed and wearing a pair of green goggles , sat in the carriage alone . He entered into conversation with Mr. Graham , and said he desired a draft on a house in Ireland . as he wanted to send for a friend over there who was without sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk for some . moments , and finally completed negotiations , which were to be executed a few hours later . When Mr. Graham returned to the office , he found that a large amount of money , in bank-bills , had been stolen . He estimates the loss at about $500 , but it is impossible to determine the amount accurately . The game which had been played on him is an old one , and he can not understand how he happened to fall into the trap , as he had frequently heard of it . Mr. Graham remembers that about a week before the same man called at The office , and asked some questions . Chief Detective Haggerty says the same game was tried at the office of S. H. Wheeler , broker , at No. 774 Broad-street , a few weeks ago , but the clerk in charge at the time felt suspicious , and would not leave the room . It was not known how many were concerned in the Graham robbery , but probably only one confederate of the man ' in the carriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurriedly a number of bills , and then going into the hall of the building passed out through the rear door into an alley , and then met his companion on one of the side streets . The description of the man as given by Mr. Graham , tallies with that of a notorious swindler , and Chief Haggerty is in New.York to-night for the purpose of visiting the Rogaes ' Gallery and tracing the thieves .
