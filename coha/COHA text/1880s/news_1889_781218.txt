txt A hearing was had before Judge Over , in the Orphans ' Court to-day , in the case of the exceptions of the heirs of B. L. Falmestook of this city to the amount of commission claimed by B. S. Fahnestock executor of the will . The commission claimed by the executor is 5 per cent. , amounting to about $30,000 . The heirs contend that this fee is excessive for the amount of work performed . In the argument of the case some light was let into the affairs of the National White Lead Trust . It was stated that B. L. Fahnestock and the other members of the Fahnestock Lead Coinwhy entered tue trust . Their works were turned over at their own valuation , and in lieu thereof they received four times the valuation thus placed on the works in the stock of the trust . Mr. Fahnestook 's interest in the works was valued at $68,000 , and he received stock to the amount of about $250,000 . One of the conditions made when the Trust was formed was that none of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the date of the agreement . In the meantime Mr. Fahnestock died . When the year had expired and it was desired to sell the stock to settle up the estate , it was found that there was no market for it . The managers of the trust , when they found that this was the state of affairs , put the stook on the New-York Exchange . Several brokers were engaged to manipulate it , and they did so . Their plan was to put up the stock for sale and one of them would buy it . Another broker concerned in the scheme would then buy it off the last Purchaser at an advanced price . Thus the stock would go round the ring , being constantly boomed . While this scheme was being worked , B. S. Fahnestook , the executor of B. L. Fahnestook , engaged a broker to go in and sell short . He did so , and unloaded $250,000 worth of stock at $22 per share , the par value being $100 . The other brokers bought the stock as soon as offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that it was only a paper sale such as they had been making . They soon found out that it was a bona-fide sale , and . despite a big " kick " in the Exchange against its consummation , the money had to be paid over . It was for his clever business stroke in this affair that the executor claims he is fully entitled to all he asks , having unloaded such an amount of stock at more than its value , when there was really no market for it . The decision in the case was reserved .
