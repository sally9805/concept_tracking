txt From a passenger who arrived in Buffalo this morning , it is ascertained that the Pacific express , on the New-York Central Railroad , when just out of Syracuse , last night , met with an accident , and the passengers had a wonderfully narrow escape from becoming victims of a great disaster . The train was going along at the rate of 40 miles an hour . Isaac Josephs , the colored porter of the palace car Vanderbilt , look ? ing out of the door window , saw the truck of the next ear leave the track . He wheeled about and fastened the grate of the beating apparatus , so as to avoid fire if tho car went over . Then he pulled the bell cord vigorously , and the passengers in the car did likewise , but the speed of the train did not slacken . Josephs , running the entire length of the car , applied the automatic brakes , which the engineer had failed to do , notwithstanding the bell had been jerked fully a minute . The train was thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conductor Evans , Without going back to ascertain the cause of the trouble , signaled the engineer to go ahead . The train again started , with the disordered truck nearly crosswise the track . The passengers who got off to Fee what the trouble was yelled and shouted , but it made no difference . The bell-rope was again pulled , but no imnression could be made upon tho engineer until a good headway had been attained . The train was hardly brought to a stop a second time before the breaks were whistled up , and another attempt to start was made . Little headway was made this time before a passenger ran forward and told the engineer of the trouble . The train moved fully a mile in a disabled condition . Not a single train man appeared on the scene of the difficulty except Porter Josephs .
