txt Republican caucuses of both houses of the Legislature were hold this evening , and nominations were made for the officers , who will be elected tomorrow . In the Senate caucus , W. I. Newell , of Philadelnhia , was elected Speaker pro tem. , receiving 16 votes to 11 for his competitor and colleague , John E. Reyburn . The choice has no significance as to the United States Senatorship , the friends and opponents of Grow being divided nearly equally . in the House caucus , a test vote was made on the choice of Chairman of the caucus , and the Grow men polled 51 votes , to 69 for the candidate of the field . This is regarded as showing that while Grow 's strength is great , he can not win in the end . But while this is measurably indicated , it is stilt certain that he has 65 to 70 votes , counting the Senators , and some , also , on the choice of the Chairman of the caucus , who were held on the side of the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indicates his strength as large , though not quite sufficient . His opponents score an important victory by capturing the caucus , however , and being thus in position to distribute the offices of the House in such a way as to make votes . To-morrow , at noon , both the houses will organize , and the Message of Gov . Hoyt will be presented and read . There will probably be an adjournment Wednesday to enable the Speakers of the houses to select committees . The House caucus selected Mr. Hewitt , of ? Blair , for Speaker , as had been anticipated . An Associated Press dispatch says of the action to-night , that the contest for the United States Senatorship to fill the place of William A. Wallace is virtually closed . The result was generally received as an evidence of Grow 's weakness . The caucus was conducted without any dissension .
