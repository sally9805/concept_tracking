Sept. , The States General of France . ARTICLE VJ. - TIIE STATES GENERAL OF FRANCE . III . THE POWERS AND FUNCTIONS OF THE STATES GENERAL . No ordinance or enactment ever defined the powers or regulated the functions of the States General . Vague statements in the letters of convocation set forth the occasion and purpose of each meeting ; but in the law of the realm there was nothing to which the assembly could point as a charter of rights and privileges . Ideas about the place and mission of the great representative body of the nation , at all periods of its history , were in the highest degree confused and contradictory , differing according to different standpoints , varying with every new set of circumstances . Yet if a Frenchman of the time of Louis XI . or Marie de M6dici , for instance , had been asked whether the States General really possessed any authority or any recognized means of activity , he would probably have greeted the question with astonishment and indignation . Notwithstanding the uncertainty regarding the prerogatives of the assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influence ; and in the absence of any formulated statement of its powers and functions , a general view of these may be gained by considering , first , the authority of the States General , according to their own view and according to the view of the monarchy , and as manifested in their relations with the Royal Council and the Parliament of Paris ; and secondly , their office , as shown in the voting of supplies , the decision of questions of State , and the presentation of cahiers . The view of the States General themselves regarding the proper extent of their rights and privileges as a national assembly enlarged with time . During the first period of their history , that is , up to 1439 , they had no adequate conception of their reason of being or the possibility of a constitutional monarchy . True , indeed , during the captivity of King John they assumed control of the government and ruled the Dauphin . But why ? We must not project back into the fourteenth century the advanced political ideas of to-day . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and among the higher classes the thought of the sovereignty of the people , of the King as executive head of the nation , and kindred ideas , were as yet hardly comprehended . The States General of 1356-7 claimed no rights as rights . The deputies had no thought of establishing by intelligent and united effort a permanent guaranty of the nation 's authority . They were simply forced by stress of circumstances to take the supreme power into their own hands . The country was being overrun by the English , the finances were falling into irretrievable confusion , and the royal authority was represented by a corrupt and heedless court ; such was the emergency that compelled the assembly to take independent action . Nobly it did its duty ; but we seek in vain for any evidences of broad patriotism , or of a higher aim than to meet the crisis impending in the affairs of the nation . In the addresses of the deputies one hears no assertion of the rights of the people , no declaration of the sovereign authority of the States General as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sufferings brought on by continuous wars , against the disgraces heaped upon the nation , against the abuses of corrupt administration in the government . Similar protests , less vehement perhaps , characterized all the sessions of the States General during the first period . Courageous denunciations of wrongs and bold demands for reform were never lacking . But while the deputies in a vague way doubtless regarded themselves as responsible for the nation 's interests , they did not look upon themselves as possessing any authority to interfere in matters of state without the permission of the Court . The regulation of imposts indeed they regarded as their peculiar province , but of this right even they did not appreciate fully the significance , or it would not have been in part at least ceded to royalty in 1439 Being summoned by the Court , they remained for the most part ready to do its bidding . But the second period of the history of the States General reveals a clearer comprehension of the proper position of the assembly in the state . In the debates upon important issues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estates before the King , the thought of the sovereignty of the people often // found expression . In the writings of leading scholars the traditions of Greek liberty and Roman republicanism were revived . The division of Europe into two hostile camps by differences in religious opinions caused each party to inquire into the other 's right to rule , and thus a more searching examination into the basis of sovereign authority was made than ever before . Occasional pamphlets attacked vehemently the arbitrary power of Kings . Gradually among the intelligent the thought gained currency that the State is for man , not man for the State . iMlen of breadth of view began to see that the States General ought to be like the English Parliament , a fixed institution , mandatory of the rights of the nation and able to bring influence to bear directly on the conduct of public affairs . In illustration of the changed attitude of the States General toward the crown , witness the earnest plea of Philip Pot , a deputy of the third estate at the meeting of 1483 , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Council : " Royalty , " he declared , " is a dignity , and not the property of the King . History relates that at the beginning the people , being sovereign , created kings by its suffrage , and that it preferred in particular the men who stood preeminent above the rest in virtue and ability . It is in its own interest that each nation has given itself a master . Princes have not been clothed with vast powers in order to enrich themselves at the expense of the people , but in order to enrich the State and to conduct it to better destinies . If they do anything to the contrary they are tyrants , and they are shepherds who , far from defending the sheep , like cruel masters , devour them . Then it is a matter of the highest importance to the people what head and what law direct them . If the King is good , the nation grows great ; if he is bad , it becomes poor and enfeebled . Who does not know , and who will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people ? If so it be , how can the people abandon the care of it ? How can vile flatterers attribute sovereignty to the prince , who himself exists only by the people ? " Then , dealing no longer in generalities , the orator exclaimed : " Hence , what is the power in France that has the right to direct the course of affairs when the King is incapable of governing ? Obviously this function ought to return neither to a prince nor // to a council of princes , but to the people , who gave the power . For two reasons the people has the right to direct its affairs ; first because it is the master , then because , in last analysis , in the case of bad government it is always the victim . . . . It has not the right to reign , but it has the right to administer the government through those whom it has chosen . I call people ' not only the plebeian and lower classes , but also all the men of each order , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States General I include even the princes . . . . Thus , deputies of the three estates , you are the repositories of the will of all . Then why do you fear to organize the government ? What is the significance of these letters of convocation ? . . . What meaning do you attach to the discourse of the chancellor , who in the first line traces this duty for you ? " The address of Philip Pot is only one of many that show the same spirit . Bold demands were made for the recognition and exercise of the nation 's rights . From time to time there were speeches full of sentiments of freedom and loyalty to the interests of the people ; some of them have never been surpassed in earnestness and power . And outside the number of deputies were men like Commines , who declared that the States General ought to be an essential and regularly constituted branch of government . Even after the States General had become a thing of the past , F*n6lon , in sketching the outline of an ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in authority , making them the most prominent feature of his system . He would have them meet every three years , independently of the royal convocation , and maintain a general supervision over the administration , of affairs throughout the realm . Subject to their direction there should be in every province Provincial States , which should have in hand the regulation of the police , the apportionment of imposts among the dioceses , and the hearing of deputations from the aseiette8 or assemblies of the separate dioceses . In the assiettes the bishop would meet with the lords and the deputies of the third estate to make provisions for the raising of imposts and to formulate grievances . Thus the conception of the true place of the States General as a repository of the rights of the nation and a counterpoise to // the power of the crown , as the proper source of legislation with the general supervision over the affairs of the judiciary and of administration , found full expression at the later meetings , as well as in the political writings of the times . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by attempting to determine the make-up of the Royal Council and thus by choosing the King 's advisers to shape the policy of government , and by claiming the right to reform and direct the entire administrative system , the assembly at times showed a clear comprehension of what its powers ought to be . Yet these manifestations of enlightened statesmanship were accidental and short-lived , called forth by emergencies and never backed up by a united , persistent effort to maintain the position assumed . " France had no lack of statesmen , " says Guizot , " full of brilliancy and power , between 1356 and 1789 , from Charles V. to Louis XVI. ; but in most of the meetings of the States General , for all the ambitious soarings of liberty , it was at one time religious party spirit and at another the spirit of revolution that ruled and determined both acts and evehts . " There was no depth of national feeling , no intelligent , earnest public opinion behind the deputies to sustain them and urge them on . Then , too , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their constituents . At the elections they were formally assigned particular functions , the deliberating upon certain matters proposed in the letters of convocation , and the presenting of certain grievances . Whatever attitude they might desire to assume regarding other things , in taking action they did not feel authorized to go beyond the letter of their instructions . Yet had a wave of enthusiasm for liberty at any time swept over the nation , these restrictions would have been passed over without heed . Notwithstanding their fine theories about their position in the government , the States General never dared to break loose from the shackles of royal authority and assert their rights as representing the sovereignty of the people . Hence their actions were often inconsistent . Thus the States General of the League , though they had declared the throne vacant , did not dare to choose a king to fill it . They were much more ready to listen to overtures from the detested and outlawed heretic Henry IV. , than proceed on // their own authority to carry out the policy which they had laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natiou came to recognize its rightful sphere of activity . It had sold its birthright in 1439 . The trend of the government was more and more toward the centralization of all powers in the hands of the King . The dreams and ambitions of the deputies and statesmen faded away before the sombre realities of rising absolutism . The States General passed out of sight ; the monarchy remained supreme . However much the view of the States General themselves regarding the extent of their authority varied from period to period , there was no change in the opinion and attitude of the monarchy . No French king ever thought of the assembly of the three estates as anything else than a purely advisory body . In appealing to the nation royalty never dreamed of allowing its prerogatives to be curtailed , or in any way endangered . In its own theory the French monarchy was from the beginning absolute . It gathered about itself the traditions of Roman imperialism , whose fundamental maxim was The will of the monarch has the force of law . " These moreover came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the German Emperors , but through the Roman Law , the office of which in building up a central authority has already been noticed . The French monarchy never in good faith conceded a single right or privilege to the States General . It was careful to check and render fruitless all efforts on their part to perpetuate their own existence independently of itself . In its view their sole reason of being was to aid it in carrying out its plans , principally with money alone , sometimes with the moral support that accompanies an expression of national feeling . Yet it always considered itself independent of such assistance , never admitted directly its obligations to the nation , and never in theory reckoned an appeal to the three estates a necessity . Though this doctrine of the monarchy was never accepted by the French people , nevertheless it was never effectually combated or replaced by any other before the revolution . Constitutionally , that is , in accordance with its body of unwritten custom of the realm , the States General could have authority only so far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Strictly speaking they had but one right , that of imposing taxes ; this even was virtually ceded to the crown , as we have seen in 1439 . But though technically they did not possess authority , they had a prestige and influence which the monarchy for all its pretensions was forced from time to time to recognize . Stress of circumstances sometimes drew from the crown what seemed the fairest concessions , but it looked upon these as merely temporary measures , not in the least affecting its own rights , and ignored them at the earliest opportunity . Just the moment the deputies began to discuss with earnestness and independent spirit any question the decision of which would tend to increase their own powers and trench upon those of the Court , it considered them in the way , set them down as its enemies , who must be flattered or coerced into submission . The privilege of presenting cahiers , moreover , must not be looked upon as a recognitiou , by the monarchy , of the rights of the nation as the assembly of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IV. , ask for cahiers with the real design of ascertaining and satisfying the wants of the peopleb Usually the crown bade its subjects formulate their grievances and requests simply in order to win favor with them , that they might be made more generous in the contribution of grants and less disposed to resist the imposition of financial burdens . Kings thus found a clever way of seeming to do much for the people without actually doing anything , of appearing to make concessions without really conceding , and of thus getting money without its equivalent in reforms and grants of privileges . The cahiers therefore were generally makeshifts , received graciously enough in appearance , at heart with dislike . The provisions suggested by these were sanctioned by the Court only when it thought its interests would be furthered by such a course . They were simply a collection of complaints and requests , with no surety whatever that attention would be paid to them . All the French kings indeed were not like Charles V. or Louis XI . Some there were doubtless that had the good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prosperity and happiness of all classes . Yet in their plans of reform and methods of operation , even these looked upon themselves , not // the people , as the centre and source of authority . " The State -I am the State , " was the motto of them all , though only one of them had the courage openly to own it . Once , it is true , a broad-minded chancellor , l'll6pital , advocated the usefulness and importance of national assemblies . At the opening of the States General of Orleans in 1560 he gave utterance to striking sentiments for a representative of the king . He declared that " the regulation of the royal power is a guaranty of its continuance , " and cited as an example for the assembly the career of the parliaments of England and Scotland , the beneficial influence of which upon their respective governments none could gainsay . Yet circumstances showed that in this the chancellor was expressing his own views , not those of his Court , and that even he wonld not have cared to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a permanent deliberative body , a Parliament of France . From first to last , then , the monarchy looked upon all effort on the part of the States General to exercise independent authority as an encroachment on its own prerogatives . Notwithstanding occasional spasmodic attempts to assert their own rights , the assemblies for the most part did the bidding of the Crown . They thns became an important means of strengthening its position , especially in crushing out Feudalism and in repelling the claims of the Papacy for temporal supremacy . The voice of the deputies as a whole , was always for peace , for reg* nlar administration , for the protection of life and property , for the facilitating of commerce , for the maintainance of national interests as opposed to foreign pretensions , of whatever kind . In all this it is evident that while , they thonght themselves called upon to consider the general good and the welfare of the country at large , they were really by grants of means and by encouragement aiding the cause of the monarchy , making themselves the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as their protector . The subordination of the States General to the Crown and the unsettled state of their rights and privileges brought them into frequent collision with the Royal Council and the Parliament of Paris . An examination of their relations with these two institutions will throw light upon their place and influence . // No body of State was ever more fluctuating in its membership or uncertain in its functions than the French Royal Council , or Council of the King . Its origin must be sought in the old feudal court of the Duchy of France , the office of which was both advisory and judicial . As the Kingship increased in power and importance this council of great vassals was found useful in many ways . Finally its functions were divided . Part of it was made over into a high court , the Parliament of Paris ; and what was now left of the original Council accompanied the King everywhere as an advisory body . Its membership gradually passed to the more influential of the King 's male relatives and the chief officers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it came to be composed often , if not generally , of selfish and ambitious courtiers , whose statesmanship never looked further than the gratification of a desire to exert influence and be masters of intrigue , and the getting of enough public funds to meet the needs of a corrupt and extravagant life ; such men were apt to be lax enough regarding the administration of the realm . In theory the functions of this body remained purely advisory , yet in the frequent successions of weak princes , with cases of minority and regency by no means rare , it naturally came to have a vast influence . It was the power behind the throne . Often a single member of it made the prince simply a tool in his hands and shaped the whole policy of State . With the customary deference to royalty , the States General in their complaints and grievances always proceeded on the assumption that the King himself was faultless , having the best interests of his subjects ever at heart , and intentionally doing or suffering no wrong . They attached all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council in particular they directed their attention , as the prolific source of evils . Since 1317 the right of the States General to settle the succession to the throne had been tacitly , though not formally , recognized . Upon this naturally followed the right to determine the make-up of the Council of Regency ; hence an effort to determine the membership of the King 's body of advisors at any time did not appear , to the deputies at least , unwarrantable or out of place . On many occasions therefore the // States General assumed the authority to impeach the members of the Royal Council , aud made out a new list . The first and perhaps the most striking illustration of this was in 1356 , when the assembly forced the dismissal of the Council and appointed in its place a commission of thirty-six , twelve from each order , which during the brief period of the nation 's supremacy , in the intervals between the meetings of the States General was looked to as the centre of authority , and inaugurated many wide-reaching reforms . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will alone . The assembly could make out lists , offer suggestions and present petitions ; but that was alL To the King belonged the choice . In case the throne belonged to a minor the regency generally accepted the counselors recommended by the estates ; but no constitutional provision obliged them to do so in case it was not thought best . Nevertheless it is clear that the States Gen. eral considered the Royal Council as subordinate to themselves in authority and inferior in standing . The Council , however , by no means accepted the view of the assembly . Claiming no authority of its own , yet exerting great influence by moulding the King 's opinions , it of course held the view of the monarchy regarding the extent of the royal prerogatives . But as neither the Council nor the assembly had the power to make laws or control the administration , the one acting only through advice , the other through suggestions and petitions , in case of a disagreement between them neither could coerce the other . The monarchy therefore found and followed its own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placing suggestions of the States General above those of the Council , sometimes alleging the decisions of the Council as an excuse for not doing the will of the estates . Thus the balancing of two indefinite authorities against each other , either of which could be exalted or degraded according to the character of the emergency , gave the King an excellent opportunity to increase his own power at the expense of both bodies . The same uncertainty that characterized the relations of the States General to the Royal Council was manifested also in those of the assembly with the Parliament of Paris . This // institution , whose functions were intended to be purely judicial , and the Chamber of Accounts , whose functions were both judicial and financial , formed the only fixed bodies of State having a permanent organization *nd clearly defined powers . The Parliament of Paris , being composed of the best legal minds of the realm and devoted to a policy of centralization , gave to the monarchy great assistance in reducing the kingdom to unity , as well as in undermining Feudalism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became the great judicial centre , then the supreme court , of the realm . It tried cases of treason against majesty , and received appeals from all the other high courts , including the provincial parliaments . Since it thus gained a great prestige , the kings came to send to it important edicts and ordinances , that these might be enrolled upon its records . The process was called registration , and had for its object to assure prompt and faithful carrying out of the decrees ; for the formal acceptance of them by the highest judicial authority inspired confidence in them on the part of those who were to execute them . From this ceremony of registration the Parliament gradually gained a power of interference in matters of State , wholly outside its original sphere of activity . The lower courts came to look upon its approval as essential to the validity of every measure . In cases brought before them involving the violation of an ordinance without the parliamentary sanction they refused to take action , and thus the execution of such an ordinance was effectually blocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monarchy became finally a matter of necessity , and all enactments of the Crown having to do with the welfare of the realm were presented for registration . Taking advantage of its opportunity , the Parliament became accustomed to discuss all measures thus brought before it . If anything in them seemed inexpedient , unjust or from any other cause objectionable , it would defer registration until it could send remonstrances to the King . These at first were humble enough in tone , stating simply the reasons why it was thought that the proposed edict or ordinance ought not to be promulgated . Afterwards however objections were urged with great firmness ; suggestions as to the proper modifications // of measures proposed , or even regarding the formulating of new laws , were freely made , and sometimes grievances were presented . The King indeed could force the registration of anything he wished by holding a lit de justice , that is , by appearing in person at a session of the Parliament and formally commanding it ; but in such cases the remonstrances were always published along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest difficulty . For the inferior courts attempted in every way to sustain the action of the Parliament . This therefore came to have influence in political affairs , and served indeed in some degree as a check upon the power of royalty itself . As all public measures were submitted to it , those that had their origin in the suggestions of the States General were brought before it , Hence arose a conflict between the two bodies . Few matters of government are more difficult to regulate than the administration of justice . In France , especially before the Revolution , the judicial class was so large and influential that it had matters relating to itself pretty much its own way . At times it became so corrupt that the trial of cases in which money was at stake could not in any way be made prompt , cheap , or impartial . As the deputies of the third estate always comprised a good number of lawyers , through their influence the matter of the judiciary always received at the meetings of the States General a full share of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sought to expedite the course of justice . Occasionally they proposed the remodelling of the judicial system throughout , pointing out abuses and corruptions , suggesting better methods of appointment , and fixing compensations . During the reign of King John the Parliament of Paris even was several times reorganized on the demand of the States General . But with its increasing political prestige and growing ambition to exert even greater influence on the actions of the Crown , this resented the interference of the assembly in matters pertaining to itself and took an attitude of envious hostility toward the estates . At first it merely objected to measures emanating from the deputies which did not meet its approval . But finally with a jealousy that grew more and more bitter with each meeting of the // States General it habitually objected to all measures suggested by them without regard to value or merit , presenting remonstrances and in every way trying to neutralize their influence . This hindrance became so effectual and so galling that the States General of 1561 , at Pontoise , made an attempt to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded of the King that for the future all ordinances and edicts originating in the expression of their wishes become law on their authority and the sanction of the Crown , without being brought before the Parliament for registration and verification . As the Crown took no notice of this request , the first States General of Blois renewed it and urged it in the strongest terms . " His Majesty ought to ordain that the decisions ( of the States General ) have full force and virtue by the single *publication that shall have been made in the general assembly of the said States General , just the same as if they were published and registered by all the courts of parliament of the kingdom , " said the cahier of the clergy ( art . 434 ) . The third estate aimed to reach the same end in a slightly different way . " As that which shall be ordained following the opinion of the said estates ought to be inviolably observed without being subject to any retrenchments or limitations whatever , may it please you to ordain that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts these shall be able in no respect to affect , amplify , reduce , or modify them , either by power of enlargement , restriction , correction , declaration , interpretation , or detention in evemtu curiw . " ( Third Estate cahier , 9 . ) The protest was fruitless , and passed nnheeded by the Crown ; but after this time not a session passed without an earnest remonstrance against the meddling of the Parliament . As no action was taken in the matter the Parliament to the end continued to subject the ordinances emanating from the estates to the most minute examination and searching criticism , raising objections to every point , and generally registering them only at a lit dejustice . Even the great ordinance of 1629 , embodying the grievances of the States General of 1614 as modified by the work of two assemblies of notables and recast by Richelien , was thus forced upon the acceptance of the Parliament . But the Parliament , not yet content , spent six months in discussing // it article by article . The King ordered the Parliament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the provisions of the ordinance , on the plea of forced registration , and thus for a time was victorious over royalty itself ; the cases of such persistency were of course rare , but the influence of the States General was greatly lessened by the general course of the Parliament . But the Parliament of Paris did not content itself with merely blocking the way of the assembly 's legislation . Several times it took up questions that were being discussed by the estates and passed upon them from the legal and constitutional standpoint . The most striking instance of this was in 1593 , when a proposition from the King of Spain to put the infanta on the throne of France was under consideration in the States General The Parliament boldly came to the front , and published a decision to the effect that " all treaties made or to be made " with the design of placing the sovereign power in the hands of any foreign prince or princess , were " void and invalid , as being contrary to the fundamental law of the kingdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the realm , never failed to determine the action of the deputies without further discussion on the constitutional points involved . In theory without doubt the States General had a higher position in the State than the Parliament of Paris , which was not essentially , but only by sufferance and precedent , a political body . In theory , moreover , the Parliament , just as the other branches of the judiciary , was subject to reforms and changes proposed by the estates . How , then , did it so often gain the mastery ? For two reasons . In the first place , it was a permanent institution , always in session except for brief vacations , and watchful of its power . The States General , however , never became properly an institution , because of the irregularity of their meetings and of the indefiniteness regarding their prerogatives . The Parliament through its influence with the lower courts was able in no small degree to facilitate or clog the execution of any law it might choose to attack , and thus could bring pressure to bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of support outside the number of depu // ties , except in an uncertain and often ill-disposed public opinion . When the Parliament became possessed of political ambitions and began to vie with the States General for prestige there could be no shadow of doubt which in most cases would prevail . The continuous organization , comprising in its membership many of the best minds of the realm and able by its direct and indirect influence to affect the entire policy and administration of the State , would naturally in the course of time prevail over its irregular and inharmonious rivaL Again , the monarchy left the relations between the two bodies purposely indefinite and unsettled in order to offset one with the other , as in the case of the States General and the Royal Council . The Crown was never desirous of doing the will of the estates , and while it openly deprecated it secretly welcomed the interference of the Parliament . Thus in the case of conflict it expressed no definite opinion , but sometimes deferring to the one and sometimes to the other it cleverly strengthened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General , however , the Parliament of Paris to some extent redeemed its past and entered upon a glorious career . In reality it took the place of the States General as a counterpoise of the monarchy . The selfish , jealous , intriguing spirit that characterized so many of its former actions gradually died out . During the period of absolutism it nobly entered protest after protest against the encroachments of the Crown , the abuses of an irresponsible administration , the ill treatment of the much enduring nation . During the darkest hours it kept alive the idea of the people 's rights . Few despotic measures passed unchallenged . It did not indeed become wholly purged of corruptions . Sometimes moreover it showed a spirit of cringing subserviency toward the Crown . But generally its attitude was one of dignified independence . It looked upon itself as representing the rights and responsible for the welfare of the nation ; neither bribery nor coercion could make it betray its sacred trust . Its resistance to the Crown , although without initiative and solely by way of remonstrance , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even greater than its immediate influence , checking bold usurpations on the part of the Crown // and giving courage to the oppressed . The history of the Parliament of Paris for the two centuries preceding the Revolution is full of famous name* and brave actions . It merits a much fuller recognition and more thorough study than is usually given to it. * * For a fuller account of the Parliament of Paris , and its relation to the States General , consult M*rilhou , " Les Parlements de France ; " Desmage , " Le Parlement de Paris ; " Montesquieu , " Esprit des Lois ; " Le Bas , " Dict .
