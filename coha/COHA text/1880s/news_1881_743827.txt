txt It is aptly remarked by a writer on " The Fortunes of Literature Under the American Republic , " in the May Fortnightly Review , that " our fiction does not seem to be different because HAWTHORNE lived ; no poet has caught the music of LONGFELLOW ; no thinker carries forward the conclusions of EMERSON . " These men have not " called into being a body of literature with power to enter effectively into the Nation 's life , to shape the character and determine the expansion of its thought . " They are in America by the accident of birth , not by the right of having contributed something fresh and new to American life . Nearly all American writing , up to date , has presupposed either an English audience or an audience trained to admire what is peculiarly English in literature . The distinctly American audience has not yet been taken into account , except in that rougher sort of literature which was initiated with COOPER 'S novels and is articulated in WALT WHITMAN 'S realistic verse , in the coarse stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe the American girl . These later writings are rather ventures with an audience than the deliberate attempt to apply a proper criticism to American life or to give a sympathetic interpretation to its dominant idea . BRET HARTE excited , perhaps , even greater hopes than have been aroused by the widely diverse work of WHITMAN , HOWELLS , or JAMES , but his inability to do more than sketch character ranks him with the lesser lights of American literature . Whenever there has been a genuine and fresh interpretation of our nationality , it has found no lack of re . sponse in the popular heart . The public is hungry beyond measure for tha novelist the divine , the essayist , the political writer who can say what this western world is thinking ' about , who can gather up in the way which is employed by men of genius the unspoken thoughts of their fellow-men , who can do for our own country what GOETHE and SCHILLER did for Germany in the last quarter of the eighteenth century . We want to see our political , social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached that point of national experience where English writing , however significant for Englishmen , fails to express the American idea . In other words , there is something in our broad , progressive , national life which has not yet been said , and which awaits the man who can say it conformably to the laws of truth and of beauty . The writers now passing away have failed , with perhaps one single exception , that of EMERSON , to gather into glowing sentences the spiritual directions of our time , and even EMERSON has done it rather by his immense powers of perception than by any law of the understanding . He tells what he has seen ; he does not reduce it to an organ= of reasoned knowledge as BACON formulated what men knew in the sixteenth century . But while the public is waiting for its man of genius , it is daily more and more evident that men now between the ages of 35 and 45 are springing up all over the country , not as thick as leaves in Vallombrosa , but quite as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast off the shackles of European thought , and are thinking their way through the questions and problems of American life along the pathway of the eternal reason , and in keeping with the laws which guide men to correct conclusions . The raw element in American society will continue raw for a generation to come , and the democratic element in our common schools is giving us hosts of uneducated readers , but this is the necessary prelude to an educated literary taste , and to the development of the American Imagination . The public libraries are the sixth form in the public school system . They are training the literary public of the future . They are creating an American audience by . American methods . Then there are changes in society and religion which dominate everything , and are yet to come before American literature can be said to have touched bottom . Protestantism , pure and simple , raises questions , but fails to create literature . It ignores the ideal element which fosters the imagination . It sounds the note of discord . It produces antagonisms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was never Protestant on the side of his ; art . It is the synthetic interpretation of life , whether in the interests of art or society or religion , which creates literary power . The changes in regard to what the Fortnightly writer significantly calls the " social Ideal " are quite as important as the changes which are imminent in regard to the religious ideal . Tho American ideal in-either case is not hereafter to be controlled by European precedent , but it is not until American types of what is desirable in character and thought have gained the support of society that we can speak confidently for the future of American literature , and it will not be until the American people have reached a broader and more satisfactory basis for their religious life than now generally exists that our literature can be said to have struck down to what is permanent and real in the nature of things . From this point of view the growing dissatisfaction with ' our expression of religious truth is full of hope and promise , and one 's fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not usually a ' be people . Our literature needs to be as broad , as deep , as truthful in our experience of life . The new school in American letters has promise , but it lacks virility . Something more than just the beautiful , or just the grotesque , or just the crude things in American life must go to the making of our authors . They must have convictions . They must be true to their ideal , alike in society and in religion . They must learn to dwell with what EMERSON vaguely calls the " oversoul . " No man can touch men profoundly who is destitute of the religious sense . It is chiefly because our times are not ripe for the ideal in society and religion , because the reasonable basis of a truly national life has hardly yet been reached , that the literary performance of the day is meagre and unsatisfactory . We are at the point of the breaking in of a new day , and great possibilities are near at hand .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
