txt The failure of the Mechanics ' Bank of Newark can not but attract public attention to the manner in which the inspection of national banks by the Government is carried out . The Treasury Department has no duty to perform more important or more delicate end difficult . Its power under the banking act is practically unlimited , and its responsibility is necessarily proportioned to its power . Section 5,240 of the Revised Statutes says : " The Controller of the Currency , with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury , shall , as often as shall be deemed necessary or proper , appoint a suitable person or persons to make an examination of the affairs of every banking association , who shall have power to make a thorough examination into all the affairs of the association , and , in doing so , to examine any of the officers and agents thereof on oath , and shall make a full and detailed report of the condition of the association to the Controller . " Besides these discretionary or special reports from examiners , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which not less than five reports each year must be made to him , which " shall exhibit in detail and under appropriate heads the resources and liabilities of the associations at the close of business on any past day by him specified , " and he has further authority to " call for special reports from any particular association whenever in his judgment the same are necessary in order to a full and complete knowledge of its condition . " These provisions are very sweeping . They are expressly intended to furnish the Controller with all necessary means to obtain a full and complete knowledge of the condition of every banking association in the country . For this purpose he can not only ask his formal and periodical questionsof the officers , but he may send as many examiners as he wishes , at any time that lie thinks proper , to make a thorough examination , with a full and detailed report to him of any facts that he thinks fit to inquire into . With the merely formal condition of the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save by his own skill and capacity and the time at his disposal . In the case of Controller KNox , no one doubts his zeal and ability , but the failure of the Newark bank under circumstances so disgraceful is calculated to bring a certain amount of discredit upon the system he is called upon to administer . The plain undeniable fact is that for a number of years back , probably a dozen , the Bank Examiners have been deceived as to the real condition of the bank , and deceived by the misrepresentation of one or two assets , as to which the truth might have been ascertained at any moment quickly , easily , and accurately . The main point of deception appears to have been the amount of deposit with the correspondent bank in New-York . It has been stated recently , and probably frequently stated , to be as high as $1,400,000 ? e. , more than one-third of the resources of the bank , and nearly three-fifths of its deposits . Such a deposit in New-York with a single bank is an unusual one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have attracted the attention of a vigilant examiner . It could have been verified in an hour at any time by a telegram from the examiner , or by a personal inquiry at the New-York bank . No such inquiry has ever been made . Again it is stated by the defaulting Cashier that very large loans were made to a single firm  --  as high as $200,000 in a single month , and $1,000,000 or $2,000,000 in all . This statement is probably exaggerated , but it is likely that heavy loans were made . Now , section 5,200 of the statutes explicitly declares that the " total liabilities to any association of any person , or of any company , corporation , or firm , for money borrowed * * shdll at no time exceed one-tenth part of the capital stock of such ( bank ) association actually paid in . " If loans go beyond this amount they must be in " discount of bills of exchange drawn in good faith , or the discount of commercial or business paper , actually owned by the person negotiating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was $500,000 . The limit of money loaned to any one firm at one time was $50,000 . However deftly concealed , it would seem possible and even easy for an acute and skillful examiner to have detected loans if made , as asserted by the Cashier , to twenty or forty times the legal limit . Though this is not an item so readily verified as that of the deposit in the ltew-York bank , it is nevertheless one apparently capable of verification . If it be not so capable ; if , as a matter of fact , the law can thus be so grossly , continually , and dangerously violated with impunity , for years in succession , then Government inspection is not the source of security which it is generally supposed to have been . We shall not now recur to the negligence of the Directors . That has been lamentable , but it is very common . What wo wish to enforce on the attention of our readers is the immense responsibility assumed by the Government in the use of its substantially unlimited and discretionary powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as searching , and as perfect as possible or it is worse than useless . The existence of such inspection is , in any case , attended with grave inconvenience . It encourages over-confidence on the part of the public , and , what is worse , on the part of the Directors , the natural and special guardians , who are supposed to be on watch in the interest of shareholders and creditors . The more stringent the powers given to the Government , the greater the trust reposed in the results of their exercise and the greater the tendency to neglect other means of security . If the Government assume , as in theory it does assume , the guardianship of the bank , if it be armed , as it is , with absolute authority to acquaint itself with every detail of the bank 's condition , and if then its inspection prove a broken reed , the effect on the stability of the national bank system is necessarily deplorable .                  @ @ @
