IS OUR CIVILIZATION PERISHABLE ? THIS question might be answered summarily by saying that what has been may be again ; meaning , that as very advanced civilizations have perished , ours may perish . But the inference would hardly be authorized , because it could not be assumed that a civilization having the elements of vitality discernible in ours ever before existed , those involved in any previous one not being precisely known . If answered at all , then , it must be by reasoning upon what we know of the existing civilization ; determining its essential elements , and casting its horoscope by detecting and estimating the causes that threaten , or may threaten , its perpetuity . No attempt will be made to define with scientific accuracy what civilization is . It will be assumed generally to be the ensemble of achievement in knowledge , in wealth , in the arts , in culture and refinement , in morality and religion , among the leading peoples of our age . So that the question propounded , in substance , is , Are there causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Three orders of causes might be supposed capable of producing such a result : physical causes , moral causes , and moralphysical causes . To the first would belong those convulsions of nature of which traces are found in the history of mankind , // and still more clearly on and beneath the surface of the earth . A deluge or dduges , beyond question , at some epoch in the past , swept away a large part , if not all , of what then lived upon our planet . It is not agreed what were the causes or what the extent of such deluge or deluges , and it is therefore beyond the power of science to say that their destructive agency may not be again witnessed . So with other supposable cosmical influences . It is an accepted theory among astronomers thatnot to speak of the ultimate fate of the solar system , to fall into the sun , and even of that of the whole starry universe , to crash together into one vast volume of superheated gases - minor planets or fragments of planets are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed that the earth is destined to avoid such a catastrophe for many ages , it would be rash to say that it could not happen . Of one thing scientists are pretty certain ,  --  that but a short time ago , as stellar life is reckoned , a dreadful catastrophe did befall our earth . There came upon the parts of it now the smiling seats of civilization , a deposit of ice , covering them to the depth of hundreds of feet , and of course destroying all living things that could not escape to warmer climes , if such there were . Whether man existed previously to that calamity is not certainly known . If man did exist , there is no evidence that he had attained to any degree of civilization comparable to that which arose afterward . Whatever was the cause of the last ice period ,  --  for science teaches that there has been a succession of such , alternating with periods of warmth , like that in which we live ,  --  according to the current theories , that cause has been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the course of time the same terrible phenomenon will recur . This will be when the great cycle of changes in natural conditions , on which the ice production depends , has been completed . Estimating the cosmical influences which produce this change , astronomers have fixed upon twenty-one thousand years as the length of the period from ice age to ice age , and we are said to be now in the middle of one of those periods . If so , it is only ten thousand five hundred years since our temperate zone was one vast field of ice . Herodotus says that , according to the traditions of Egypt , its civilization was in his time ten thousand years old . He wrote something over two thousand years ago . It is not probable that this figure is correct . From the best data // now attainable , derived from monuments and other sources , the civilization of Egypt is believed to have existed six thousand years before Christ . This would give it an antiquity , now , of about eight thousand years . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the period of greatest probable cold during the age of ice , before the civilization of Egypt arose . If the same date be fixed for that of Chalda*a , the ancestors of the Egyptians and Chaldaans may have been the remnant that had escaped from the northern ice-fields ; and inasmuch as they preserved no traditions of the time previous to the catastrophe , their civilization must have been , when they began their migration southward , extremely meager . At a time of such distress , what learning had existed must have been mainly forgotten . When every energy of mind and body was exerted to meet the physical wants , the lapse into barbarism from a higher condition , had one existed , would be rapid . This reckoning would leave two thousand five hundred years , or even more , if the supposed migration began before the highest degree of cold was reached , in which to found the civilizations of Egypt and Chald*a , as history shows them to us six thousand years before Christ . But speculation in regard to what may have immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less important to us now than in regard to the consequences of a recurrence of such an age a few thousand years hence . Nature in her cold as in her hot moods has no respect for the works of man . As the temperature should go on falling , and philosophers should fill their ears with predictions of the woes to follow , despair would seize upon the minds of men , as it did about the year of our Lord One Thousand , when it was prophesied that the world was about to be destroyed ; or as it did a few years ago , when the prophecies of Miller led many to believe that the end of all things was at hand . Men abandoned their business , and betook themselves to fasting and prayer and the preparation of their ascension robes . If the conviction should become general , based on scientific reasoning , and justified apparently by the increase of cold and ice , the same temper of mind would show itself ; famines , pestilences , and wars would be likely to arise ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the resulting passions and destitution , would bring about conflicts which would soon reduce the migrating hordes to a fraction of their former numbers . What , in such a m*lJe , would be the fate of // schools and churches , of newspapers and books , and other similar means of illustrating and increasing civilization , it is easy to imagine . As the pressure of want , of war and pestilence , grew greater , the leisure for learning , even the love of it , would be lost ; the increasing cold would lead to the burning of books and papers , no longer valued or useful , except to give warmth to the freezing bodies of their owners ; or if not burned , they would be flung away ; and it is a peculiarity of our civilization that its written memorials are impressed mainly upon paper , which both fire and water will destroy . Mackintosh is , therefore , in error when he affirms that " the discovery of paper and printing rendered a second destruction of the repositories of knowledge impossible . " Whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon their wide diffusion , but upon the character of the material of which they are composed , and , as we shall see , upon the disposition of the men amongst whom they are placed . Had it depended only upon their material , the Greek and Roman classics would not now be , most of them , lacking or mutilated . The ancients had tablets of brass and stone . Even their papyrus was equal in durability to our paper , and their parchment was far superior . But most of their libraries were destroyed , some by vandal hordes , some by the Moslems , and still more by the Christians . Of those destroyed by the last , a few have been recovered by skillful manipulation of palimpsests , upon which the treasures of ancient literature had been obliterated and replaced by monkish legends . Far more , then , than the written memorials of the ancients , those of our existing civilization are dependent upon the estimate , in respect to sacredness or value , which men place upon them . This brings us to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten civilization . Uulike the physical , which would produce their effect by a complete destruction of all written memorials , as well , perhaps , as of all living things , moral causes would be such as should tend to paralyze or to poison one or more of the essential elements of civilization ; to destroy it by corrupting its life-blood . This result would follow from the prevalence in the current literature of principles hostile to the life of society . We say prevalence in the literature ; but if in that , then also in the life of the people , since the one is but the gauge and reflex of the other . // If railroads and steam-ships , accumulated wealth and material comfort and splendor , were all there is of civilization ,  - -  if they were not merely the husk enfolding the grain ,  --  it would not so much matter whether it were perishable or not . The moral and , as its highest efflorescence , the religious character created and fostered by the forces producing civilization , is that which gives to it its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character , fortifies ; and whatever perverts or weakens that character , tends directly to destroy civilization , whether as it exists in literature or in the hearts of men . And because this necessary moral element always rises or sinks to the same level both in literature and in men 's hearts , if it become perverted in either , it will perish from both . When this happens , there is danger that honest zeal for purity may destroy all literature , both good and bad , and thus hasten the ruin it would fain prevent . History confirms this view . Much of the classical literature of Rome was so foul that the Christian Church diligently sought to extirpate the whole . The infected part ought to have perished , as did the empire whose vital juices it had poisoned . There are Latin books in our libraries which it is a disgrace to Christian civilization that it permits to exist . Nothing but the prevailing ignorance of the Latin tongue saves them from criminal censure as obscene literature . The moral causes threatening civilization , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its permanence . What are those principles 0 ? First in importance rank , as has been already hinted , the principles of morality . Does this seem to be a mere truism 0 ? Mr. Matthew Arnold has raised , none too early or too loudly , a warning voice against the prevailing tendency of French imaginative literature ; he charges it with impurity . Whether the malign product known as the French novel be the growth of the " lower empire ' of the thir4 Napoleon , or the proper fruit of the third republic , it is of fatal augury to the French people , and to any other whose taste it adapts to itself . No nation not struck with moral blindness or moral paralysis can produce or circulate novels like M. Zola 's . Not that his are the worst ; their very grossness prevents them from working the evil wrought by others whose immorality is more carefully veiled ; as complete nndity is less hurtful to the public morals than the half nude , which , leaving room for the // imagination , excites it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French society is answerable for the collapse of the empire and the fatuous politics of the existing republic , it would be rash to prononnce with certainty . As a similar infection subdued the hardy virtues of the Roman commonwealth , making possible the immense ruin which befell it , so it may have rendered inevitable the awful overthrow of Sedan ; and where it will end for France , or for those neighbors who eagerly feast upon the garbage of lier immoral literature , no prophet can tell . The vice in the French novel consists in its perverted views of the sexual relations . This shows a proclivity to sensual indnlgence , unconsciously treated as normal and harmless , which can coexist only with obtuseness of the moral sense . Bnt how disastrous soever such a vice may be , it is less so than another which might become prevalent . The apparatus of the mind , of the reasoning faculty , might be so disarranged that its verdicts would no longer correspond to the truth of things . What is said upon this head must be understood not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertain the effects of certain supposed causes upon the vitality of an existing civilization , if they were to come into operation . Suppose a philosophic sect were to flood the world with principles , cunningly devised to confound all moral distinctions , teaching that the end justifies the means ; that while homicide is under ordinary circumstances unjustifiable , yet to propagate the truth intrusted to their keeping , any act deemed necessary , even the taking of innocent life or the overthrow of beneficent political institutions , is justifiable ; and that if the native conscience of their instruments is too tender not to feel remorse after the commission of such necessary acts , some head or junto of the supposed philosophic sect had the power of expunging their guilt , and of quieting their disturbed moral sense ; one hazards little in saying that such principles would be a menace to the existing civilization . Civilization has been built upon theories of conduct directly the reverse : that the end does not justify the means ; that intentional homicide , save in lawful war or in necessary self-defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevent it by the dreadest sanctions would be to resolve society into its original barbarism . Imagine , further , not only that such principles were formulated and propagated by skillful teachers , subduing with a cunning logic the minds of the ignorant , but // that they were thundered forth from pulpits and from the chairs of theological professors , with the assumed sanction of divine inspiration , could it be deemed possible that a sound morality would long survive such a contagion , or that the civilization corrupted by it could or ought long to endure ? In estimating the destructive effects of the supposed prim . ciples , it ought to be remembered that the leaven of sexual immorality and , much more , of a perverted moral sense in the blood of a people , never ceases to work until interrupted by some terrible judgment of God , cutting down the diseased misgrowths of years , or sending the sinning peoples into a blessed servitude to some Gothic horde , uncultivated but morally unperverted . An American consul , sent by President Lincoln to Asia Minor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fallen from a high civilization could ever be built up into a great people again ; that in their ignorance they would still claim to be what they had once been , highly civilized , and that they would therefore , in their self-conceit , be unteachable . Applying this principle to Asia Minor , he said that the only remedy for its barbarism was to destroy its people root and branch , and begin with the soil anew . If ignorant self-conceit is thus fatal to recuperative power , what shall be said of principles which not merely stimulate the retrospective imagination , or rest upon a pardonable pride in ancestral glories , but which paralyze the moral perceptions and the moral energies of a people ? And if the civilized world should drink in the virus of such principles , could its civilization be permanent ? Must it not early perish ? As Macaulay has said , " The Goths and Vandals which would overpower our civilization would come upon us from within , and not from without , as in the old days . " They will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now left no foreign race which , as in the case of Rome , while it tramples our liberties and our institutions into the dust , would regenerate us by its homely but unsophisticated virtues . Another moral cause which may threaten our civilization is a mistaken view of the relations between capital and labor . This cause presents a double aspect , according as capital is found to be too grasping , or labor to be too exacting . It is not now for the first time that conflicts bringing grave dangers to society have arisen between those two great forces . From the // obscure hints which history gives us , it is evident that while the nature and extent of the respective rights of labor and capital were not well understood , and the weaker party , the ignorant , laboring poor , often bore long without seeking redress , a time was generally reached in which the limit of forbearance was passed , and terrible outbreaks , worse than any experienced in our day , occurred . The servile insurrections of classical antiquity , the peasant wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and England , are examples of this . It is noticeable , however , that these outbreaks of violence were limited in extent . The disease being local , recovery was possible , and it often came from voluntary concessions by the capitalists of the period . Labor rose in rebellion because it suffered , and , the oppression being removed , quiet and contentment were restored . If the causes were strictly local , the same phenomenon might again be witnessed . Such now , however , is the solidarity of all civilized peoples , that causes of discontent in the ranks of labor are likely to be universal , evenwhen they are material in theirnature ; so that the danger from that source is greater than in former times . But the causes are not all of that kind ; there are causes in the principles propounded by the parties to the conflict , as determining their respective rights , which , because they fly upon the wings of the wind over the whole earth , are all the more seriously menacing to civilization . One of these , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are no limits beyond which capital ought not to be allowed to accumulate ; or that corporations can not rightfully be controlled in the exercise of their charter powers ; or that while monopolies , strictly so-called , are illegal , virtual monopolies , entailing upon a people all the evils of real monopolies , ought not to be disturbed in gathering their colossal harvests of gain . It is not , however , from the ranks of capital that the danger which we wish now to emphasize is to be apprehended , but from those who possess the physical force to compel obedience to any behest they choose to formulate- the vast laboring majority . The dangers flowing from an abuse of capital are dangers from the few , which the physical superiority of the many may always avert . Not so with those which flow from the errors of labor , which nothing but its own better judgment , or Divine power itself , can counteract . And here , lest we be misunderstood , let us say that the danger we have in mind is not now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the // principles on which it rests not being generally accepted . An attempt will be made merely to determine the effect of those principles upon our civilization , on the supposition that they were accepted and enforced . One of these principles is that the evils which afflict society at the present day are so deep-rooted as to be irremediable , and that the only thing to do is to destroy the existing order of things . This principle of social despair is that of the Nihilists . Of course , as they believe that our present civilization ought to be destroyed ,  --  and they have organized their forces with a view to compass its destruction ,  --  for them the question we are discussing is answered , that civilization is destructible ; and , doubtless , the method proposed by them , the uprooting of all governments , all religions , the confiscation of all property , the abolition of the family , and the like , would produce the desired result . The principle of the Nihilists , in other words , is a direct and fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , which would destroy the present order of things , is that that is necessarily right which receives the vote of the majority . Properly understood , Mr. Arnold 's maxim , that it is a " remnant* ' only which ought to have the power of making laws or of determining what is right conduct , is just . If so , the converse of this , that the power to govern ought to be lodged with that which has the major physical force , is untrue , and might , if the principle were carried into effect , lead to a wrecking of existing institutions . For labor , therefore , to say to itself , " Because we outnumber those who would rule us by so many millions , we have the right to make such laws as will best suit our purposes , without regard to the rights of others , would be a great error , and , if reduced to practice , that principle would prove fatal to society . The wise are ever the few . Even the wild animals , moved by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most cunning and experience . Men will generally do this when those of all degrees congregate together . But when they separate into hostile groups , the laboring poor in one , those who can live without labor in another , the really wise may or may not be in that group which is the more numerous . The most fatal thing is that no matter how unwise a measure may be , or how unjust , the majority is likely to have the physical power to enforce it . Of the moral-physical causes , but a single one will be specified , and that of a nature so delicate that nothing but its well-known operation and its extremely dangerous character // would justify its introduction in a discussion of this nature . We refer to the widely prevalent and growing aversion of the higher ranks of society to marriage , or if marriage occur , to the having of offspring ; and to the use of means intended to prevent it . We shall only add that if advanced civilization is to bring with it the general prevalence of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to devise effectual means for preventing the growth of families , the doom of our civilization is irrevocably fixed . Its downfall must follow . If neither the moral nor the moral-physical causes described are thought sufficient , singly , to produce the supposed result , consider the effect of them all combined . Suppose , as might chance to be the case , that the greater number be both ignorant and morally depraved ; that they are filled not only with selfconceit , but with malice toward all that exists ; that their moral instincts have been so perverted that they believe wrong to be right and right wrong ; that the end justifies the means ; and with all this , that the world will never be well governed until its laws are dictated by the majority in numbers , rather than in wisdom ; and what might not be the fate of our institutions , of our entire civilization ? It is easy to sneer at such vaticinations of evil , and to say that , however bad the case may be at any one time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of society shall ultimately leaven the whole lump . That may be ; but no one of us can claim to be in the secret councils of the Almighty , and perhaps he intends to destroy , if the evil and not the good , the immoral and not the pure , come to prevail on the earth . God carries on his affairs in this world with no regard whatever to time or expense . Societies , empires , civilizations , have gone down , one after the other , because in certain respects , not fully understood by us , he found they did not answer his purposes . It would be very unwise to flatter ourselves that he esteems us or our civilization more highly than he did that of the Chalda*ans , the Assyrians , or their successors . To-morrow he may crash into ruin all that we see about us , if it transgress in one iota his established laws . This conclusion , then , seems justified by some solid reasons ,  --  that our civilization is perishable ; that it may owe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an ice age , which scientists pronounce to be inevitable , and to have probably already more than once occurred , or like that supposed by Mr. Donnelly , the collision // of our planet with a comet ; or that it may perish from moral or moral-physical causes , which are now actually at work in some countries ; which have brought destruction upon many civilizations , isolated and circumscribed in extent ; and which threaten , in this age of steam , the printing-press , and electricity , to become universally operative , and to work their destructive effect wherever the social conditions facilitate their malign influence .
