txt The Augusta E. Herrick arrived here late last night . This is the schooner which left New-York and stopped and bought cannon in Boston , as telegraphed to THE TIMES and afterward denied by the Associated Press . She is a stanch clipperbuilt schooner . She was the cause of much remark as she lay in the harbor to-day . She was easily distinguished by two large gilt horses on her topmasts . All the forenoon her two new and shining brass 6-pouuders belched forth smoke and fire , and the echoes reverberated through tho hills like constant thunder . " The boys wanted to fire a salute for the Gloucester fishermen , " said Capt . Herrick , " and I told them to go ahead . I did not know what might happen when I bought those guns . " said he , pointiug to the 6-pounder amidships , the mouth of which was just perceptible over the rail . " We are going to have the rail cut down so there will be room for action . I do n't believe in so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go down to the bay for Mackerel . I do n't intend to go inside of toe three-mile limit , but snail go after the mackerel . We may be prepared for war , as well as the cruisers . We can see the smoke of the Laosdowne miles off , and there Is no trouble to get away from the Perron and others like her . I would like to put the vessels out in good shape arid go down . If they troubled me outside they would have some fun taking us . I would like to capture one of them and tow her in . I would not care if they hanged me after I had come to a United States port . I think England has ordered them to stop seizing vessels now because there is such a step in the United States . " The schooner Nellie M. Davis , Capt . Melanson , has arrived from the Cape shore . One of the crew said : " The Davis started a week ago , but did not catch up with the fishing , being a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mackerel . We were off Halifax , but did not go ashore . We spoke an English coaster and learned that the Lansdowne had been seen . The Captain aboard the coaster said that he ( lid not believe that Scott was doing much . He had chances to take American vessels , but did not , and cited the case of a Gloucester Georee 's man carrying away her topmast and getting a new one . The topmast was being towed behind , when the Lansdowne steamed up.and the Yankee skipper put up the topmast . The Lansdowne went on and the Gloucester fishermen got bait afterward . The bait has been scarce down there . but they have sold to the Yankees , and would have sold more if they had had it . The trouble has been lobster pots have been set along the coast , lots of them , and their old bait has been used . You can smell the stench a Quarter of a mile off . As soon as the mackerel strike that dirty water off they go . The Yankee skippers are after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . There will be lively times when the fleet gots down there . When Yankee fishermen get after a school of mackerel they are going to get the fish . "
