THE SIEGE OF VICKSBURG . HE city of Vicksburg was important to T the Confederates on account of its railroad connections ; the Vicksburg and Jackson railroad connecting it with all the Southern Confederacy east of the Mississippi river , and the Vicksburg and Shreveport railroad connecting it with all their country west of that great stream . It was important to the North because it commanded the river itselg the natural outlet to the sea of the commerce of all the Northwest . The Mississippi flows through a low alluvial valley many miles in width , and is very tortuous in its course , running to all points of the compass sometimes within a few miles . Copyright , 8885 , by U. S. This valley is bounded on the east side by a range of high lands rising in some places more than two hundred feet above the general level of the valley . - Running from side to side of the valley , the river occasionally washes the base of the high land , or even cuts into it , forming elevated and precipitous bluffs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some four hundred miles distant by the windings of the river froni that city , stands the city of Vickshurg . On account of its importance to both North and South , Vicksburg became the objective point of the Army of the Tennessee in the fall of 1862 . It is generally regarded as an axiom Grant . All rights reserved . // in war that all great armies in an enemy 's country should start from a base of supplies , which should be fortified and guarded , and to which the army should fall back in case of disaster . The first movement looking to Vicksburg as an objective point was begun early in November , 1862 , and conformed to this axiom . It followed the line of the Mississippi Central railroad , with Columbus , Kentucky , as a base ; and soon after it started a coi5perating column was moved down the river in transports , with Memphis as its base . Both of these movements failing , the entire Army of the Tennessee was transferred to the neighborhood of Vicksburg and landed on the opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after spending about three months trying to get upon the high land , and also waiting for the waters of the Mississippi , which were very high this winter , to recede , I determined to march below Vicksburg , take Grand Gulf , hold it , and operate with the aid of Banks 's army against Port Hudson , using New Orleans as my base of supplies ; then to return against Vicksburg with the combined armies , retaining New Orleans as our base . In pursuance of this determination , the army was marched to a point below Vicksburg on the Louisiana side , and the batteries were run by the fleet and some of the transports . On the 29th of April the troops were at Hard Times , and the fleet , under Admiral Porter , made an attack upon Grand Gulf , while I reconnoitered the position of the enemy on a tug , to see if it was possible to make a landing . Finding that place too strong , I moved the army below Grand Gulf to De Shroon 's , running the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here from an old negro that there was a good road from Bruinsburg up to Port Gibson , I determined to cross and move upon Grand Gulf from the rear . April 3oth was spent in transporting troops across the river . These troops were moved out towards Port Gibson as fast as they were landed . On the ist of May the advance met the enemy under Bowen about four miles west of Port Gibson , where quite a severe battle was fought , resulting in the defeat of the enemy , who were driven from the field . On May 2d our troops moved into Port Gibson , and , finding that the bridges over Bayou Pierre were destroyed , spent the balance of the day in rebuilding and crossing them , and marching to the North Fork , where we encamped for the night . During the night we rebuilt the bridge across the North Fork , which had also been destroyed , and the next day ( the 3d ) pushed on , and , after considerable skirmishing , reached the Big Black , VOL .

On the 3d I went into Grand Gulf ? , and spent the afternoon and until late that night in writing letters to Washington and orders for the next movement of the army . Here I also received a letter from Banks stating that he could not be at Port Hudson for some days , and then with an army of only fifteen thousand men . As I did not regard this force of as much value as the time which would be lost in waiting for it , I determined to move on to Vicksburg . The 4th , 5th , and 6th of May were spent in reconnoitering towards Vicksburg , and also in crossing Sherman 's troops over to Grand Gulf . On the 7th , Sherman having joined the main body of the army , the troops across the Big Black were withdrawn , and the movement was commenced to get in position on the Vicksburg and Jackson railroad so as to attack Vicksburg from the rear . This occupied the army from the 7th to the 12th , when our position was near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our left resting on the Big Black . To obtain this position we fought the battle of Raymond , where Logan 's and Crocker 's divisions of McPherson 's corps defeated the Confederates under General Gregg , driving him back on Jackson ; Sherman and McClernand both having some skirmishing where they crossed Fourteen Mile creek . As the army under Pemberton was on my left flank , and that under General Joseph E. Johnston on my right at Jackson , I determined to move the army rapidly on Jackson , capturing and destroying that place as a military depot ; then turn west and destroy the army under Pemberton , or drive it back into Vicksburg . The *3th was spent in making the first of these moves . On the *4th Jackson was attacked with Sherman 's and McPherson s corps . The place was taken , and all supplies that could be of service to the enemy were destroyed , as well as the railroad bridge . On the * 5th the troops were faced to the west and marched towards Pemberton , who was near Edwards 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the enemy at Champion 's Hill , and , after a hard-fought battle , defeated and drove him back towards Vicksburg , capturing eighteen guns and nearly three thousand men . This was the hardest-fought battle of the campaign . On the 17th we reached the Big Black , where we found the enemy intrenched . After a battle of two or three hours ' duration we succeeded irn carrying their works by storm , capturing much artillery and about twelve hundred men . In their flight the enemy de- ' // U U H z U H z U // stroyed the bridge across the Big Black , so that the balance of the day and night was spent in building bridges across that stream . We crossed on the morning of the i8th , and the outworks of Vicksburg were reached before night , the army taking position in their front . On the *9th there was continuous skirmishing with the enemy while we were getting into better positions . The enemy 's troops had been much demoralized by their defeats at Champion 's Hill and the Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an effort to hold Vicksburg . Accordingly at two o'clock I ordered an assault . It resulted in securing more advanced positions for all our troops , where they were fully covered from the fire of the enemy , and the siege of Vicksburg began . The 20th and 2 ist were spent in strengthening our position , and in making roads in rear of the army , from Yazoo river or Chickasaw bayou . Most of the army had now been for three weeks with only five days ' rations issued by the commissary . They had had an abundance of food , however , but had begun to feel the want of bread . I remember that , in passing around to the left of the line on the 21st , a soldier , recognizing me , said in rather a low voice , but yet so that I heard him , " Hard-tack . " In a moment the cry was taken up all along the line , " Hard-tack ! hard-tack ! " I told the men nearest to me that we had been engaged ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which to supply them with everything they needed . The cry was instantly changed to cheers . By the night of the 21st full rations were issued to all the troops . The bread and coffee were highly appreciated . I now determined on a second assault . Johnston was in my rear , only fifty miles away , with an army not much inferior in numbers to the one I had with me , and I knew he was being reinforced . There was danger of his coming to the assistance of Pemberton , and after all he might defeat my anticipations of capturing the garrison , if , indeed , he did not prevent the capture of the city . The immediate capture of Vicksburg would save sending me the reinforcements which were so much wanted elsewhere , and would set free the army under me to drive Johnston from the State . But fhe first consideration of all was that the troops believed they could carry the works in their front , and would not have worked so patiently in the trenches if they had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all parts of the line at ten o'clock A. M. on the 22d with a furious cannonade from every battery in position . All the corps commanders set their time by mine , so that all might open the engagement at the same minute . The attack was gallant , and portions of each of the three corps succeeded in getting up to the very parapets of the enem ) T , and in planting their hattle-fiags upon them ; but at no place were we able to enter . General McClernand reported that he had gained the enemy 's intrenchments at several points , and wanted rei3nforcements . I occupied a position from which I believed I could see as well as he what took place in his front , and I did not see the success he reported . But his request for reinforcements being repeated , I could not ignore it , and sent him Quinby 's division of the Seventeenth Corps . Sherman and McPherson were both ordered to renew their assaults as a diversion in favor of McClernand . This last attack only served to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as it was dark our troops that had reached the enemy 's line and had been obliged to remain there for security all day were withdrawn , and thus ended the last assault on Vicksburg . A regular siege was now determined upon ,  - -  to " out-camp the enemy , " as it were , and to incur no more losses . The experience of the 22d convinced officers and men that this was best , and they went to work on the defenses and approaches with a will . With the navy holding the river , the investment of Vicksburg was complete . As long as we could hold our position , the enemy was limited in supplies of food , men , and munitions of war , to what he had on hand . These could not last always . The crossing of troops at Bruinsburg had commenced April 3oth . On the i8th of May the army was inrearofVicksburg . On the *9th , just twenty days after the movement began , the city was completely investedand an assault had been made . Five distinct battles-besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the capital of the State had fallen , and its arsenals , military manufactories , and everything useful for military purposes , had been destroyed ; an average of about one hundred and eighty miles had been marched by the troops engaged ; but five days ' rations had been issued , and no forage ; over 6ooo prisoners had been captured , and as many more of the enemy had been killed or wounded ; twenty-seven heavy cannon and sixty-one field-pieces had fallen into our hands ; and four hundred miles of the river , from Vicksburg to Port Hudson , had become ours . The Union force- that had crossed the Mississippi river up to this time was less than forty-three thousand men . One division of these , Blair 's , . only arrived in time to take part in the battle of Champion 's Hill , but was not engaged // ( At the reqoest of the Editor of THE CENTURY MAGAZINE . ) V* MAP OF THE SIEGE OF VICKSBU RG. // Killed .

The enemy 's line of defense followed the crest 3425 259 of a ridge , from the river north of the city , eastward , then southerly around to the Jackson road , full three miles back of the city . Deep ravines of the description given lay in front of these defenses . As there is a succession of gullies , cut out by rains , along the side of the ridge , the line was necessarily very irregular . To follow each of these spurs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , would have lengthened their line very much . Generally , therefore , or in many places , their line would run from near the head of one gully nearly straight to the head of another , and an outer work , triangular in shape , generally open in the rear , was thrown up on the point . With a few men in this outer work , they commanded the approaches to the main line completely . The work to be done to make our position as strong against the enemy as , his was against us , was very great . The problem was also complicated by our wanting oUr line as near that of the enemy as possible . We had but four engineer officers with us . Captain Prime , of the Engineer Corps , was the chief , and the work at the beginning was mainly directed by him . His health , however , soon gave out , when he was succeeded by Captain Comstock , also of the Engineer Corps .

Sherman occupied the right , starting from the river above Vicksburg ; McPherson the center ( McArthur 's division now with him ) ; and McClernand the left , holding the road south to Warrenton . Lauman 's division arrived at this time , and was placed on the extreme left of the line . In the interval between the assaults of the *9th and 22d , roads had been constructed from the XTazoo river and Chickasaw Bayou , around the rear of the army , to enable us to bring up supplies of food and ammunition ; ground had been selected and cleared on which the troops were to be encamped , and tents and cooking utensils were brought up . The troops had been without these from the time of crossing the Mississippi up to this time . All was now ready for the pick and spade . Prentiss and Hurlbut were ordered to send forward every man that could be spared . Cavalry especially was wanted to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnston . I knew that The official revised statements of losses soon to be published by Colonel Robert N.

The chief quartermaster and the chief commissary were graduates . The chief commissary , now the commissary-general of the army , begged oft ; however , saying that there was nothing in engmeenng that he was good for , unless he would do for a sap-roller .

We had no siege-guns except six thirty-two pounders , and there were none at the West to draw from . Admiral Porter , however , supplied us with a battery of navy-guns of large caliber , and with these , and the field-artillery used in the campaign , the siege began . The first thing to do was to get the artillery in batteries where they would occupy commanding positions ; then , to establish the camps , under cover from the fire of the enemy , but as near up as possible ; and then to construct rifle-pits and covered ways , to connect the entire command by the shortest route . The enemy did not harass us much while we were constructing our batteries . Probably their artillery ammunition was short , and their infantry was kept down by our sharp-shooters , who were always on the alert and ready to fire at a head whenever it showed itself above the rebel works . In no place were our lines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was necessary , therefore , to cover our men by something more than the ordinary parapet . To give additional protection , sand-bags , bullet-proof , were placed along the tops of the parapets , far enough apart to make loopholes for musketry . On top of these , logs were put . By these means the men were enabled to walk about erect when off duty , without fear of annoyance from sharp-shooters . The enemy used in their defense explosive musket-balls , thinking , no doubt , that , bursting over our men in the trenches , they would do some execution . I do not remember a single case where a man was injured by a piece of one of these shells . When they were hit , and the ball exploded , the wound was terrible . In these cases a solid ball would have hit as well . Their use is barbarous , because they produce increased suffering without any corresponding advantage to those using them . The enemy could not resort to our method to protect their men , because we had an inexhaustible supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freely . Splinters from the timber would have made havoc among their men behind . There were no mortars with the besiegers , except those that the navy had in front of the city ; but wooden ones were made by taking logs of the toughest wood that could be found , boring them out for six or twelve pounder shells , and binding them with strong iron bands . These answered as coehorns , and shells were successfully thrown from them into the trenches of the enemy . The labor of building the batteries and ofintrenching was largely done by the pioneers , assisted by negroes who came within our lines and who were paid for their work ; but details from the line had often to be made . The work was pushed forward as rapidly as possible , and when an advanced position was secured and covered from the fire of the enemy , the batteries were advanced . By the 3oth of June there were two hundred and twenty guns in position , mostly light fieldpieces , besides a battery of heavy guns belonging to , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now as strong for defense against the garrison of Vicksburg as they were against us ; but I knew that Johnston was in our rear , and was receiving constant reinforcements from the East . He had at this time a larger force than I had had at any time prior to the battle of Champion 's Hill . As soon as the news of the arrival of the Union army behind Vicksburg reached the North , floods of visitors began to pour in . Some came to gratify curiosity ; some to see sons or brothers who had passed through the terrible ordeal ; members of the Christian and Sanitary commissions came to minister to the wants of the sick and the wounded . Often those coming to see a son or brother would bring a dozen or two of poultry . They did not know how little the gift would be appreciated . The soldiers had lived so much on chickens , ducks , and turkeys , without bread , during the march , that the sight of poultry , if they could get bacon , almost took away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Illin6is , with most of the State officers . I naturally wanted to show them what there was of most interest . In Sherman 's front the ground was the most broken and most wooded , and more was to be seen without exposure . I therefore took them to Sherman 's headquarters and presented them . Before starting out to look at the lines-possibly while Sherman 's horse was being saddled - there were many questions asked about the late campaign , about which the North had been so imperfectly informed . There was a // qwq Pemberton shows that all expectation of holding Vicksburg had by this time passed from Johnston 's mind . I immediately ordered Sherman to the command of all the forces from Haines 's Bluff to the Big Black river . These amounted now to quite half the troops about Vicksburg . Besides these , Herron 's and A. J. Smith 's divisions were ordered to hold themselves in readiness to reinforce Sherman . Haines 's Bluff had been strongly fortified on the land side , and on all commanding points from there to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The work of connecting by rifle-pits , when this took in the situation , and wisely , I think , abstained from making an assault on us , because it would simply have inflicted loss on both sides without accomplishing any result . We were strong enough to have taken the offensive against him ; but I did not feel disposed to take any risk of loosing our hold upon Pemberton 's army , while I would have rejoiced at the opportunity of defending ourselves against an attack by Johnston . From the 23d of May the work of fortifying , and pushing forward our position nearer to the enemy , had been steadily progressing . At the point on the Jackson road in front of Ransom 's brigade a sap was run up to the enemy 's parapet , and by the 25th of June we had it undermined and the n*ine charged . The enemy had countermined , but did not succeed in reaching our mine . At this particular point the hill on which stood the rebel work rises abruptly . Our sap ran close up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this parapet was also our protection . The soldiers of the two sides occasionally conversed pleasantly across this barrier : sometimes they would exchange the hard bread of the Union soldiers for the tobacco of the Confederates , and at other times they threw over handgrenades , the rebels throwing them first , and our men often catching them in their hands and returning them . Our mine had been started some distance back down the hill ; consequently , when it had extended as far as the parapet , it was many feet below it . This caused the failure of the enemy in his search to find and destroy it . On the 25th of June , at 3 o'clock , all being ready , the mine was exploded . A heavy artillery fire all along the line had been ordered to open with the explosion . The effect was to blow the top of the hill off and make a crater where it stood . The breach was not sufficient to enable us to pass a column of attack through . In fact , the enemy , having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line farther back , where most of the men guarding that point were placed . There were a few men , however , left at the advance line , and others were working in the counter-mine , which was still being pushed to find ours . All that were there were thrown into the air , some of them coming down on our side , still alive . I remember one colored man who , having been under-ground at work when the explosion took place , was thrown to our side . He was not much hurt , but terribly frightened . Some one asked him how high he had gone up . " Dun no , massa , but t'ink bout t'ree mile , " was his reply . General Logan commanded at this point , and took this colored man to his quarters , where he did service to the end of the siege . As soon as the explosion took place the crater was seized by two regiments of our troops who were near by , under cover , where they had been placed for the express purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but failed , and soon retired behind his new line . From here , however , they threw hand-grenades , which did some execution . The compliment was returned by our men , but not with so much effect . The enemy could lay their grenades on the parapet , which alone divided the contestants , and roll them down upon us ; while from our side they had to be thrown over the parapet , which was at considerable elevation . During the night we made efforts to secure our position in the crater against the missiles of the enemy , so as to run trenches along the outer base of their parapet , right and left ; but the enemy continued throwing their grenades , and brought boxes of field ammunition ( shells ) , the fuses of which they would light with port-fires , and throw them by hand into our ranks . We found it impossible to continue this work . Another mine was consequently started , which was exploded on the ist of July , destroying an entire redan , killing and wounding a considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it stood . No attempt to charge was made this , time , the experience of the 25th admonishing us . Our loss in the first affair was about thirty killed and wounded . The enemy must have lost more in the two explosions than we did in the first . We lost none in the second . From this time forward the work of mining and pushing our positiort nearer to the enemy was prosecuted with vigor , and I determined to explode no more mines until we were ready to explode a number at different points and assault immediately after . We were up now at three different points , one in front of each corps , to where only the parapet of the enemy divided us . About this time an intercepted dispatch from Johnston to Pemberton informed me that // Johnston intended to make a determined attack upon us , in order to relieve the garrison of Vicksburg . I knew the garrison would make no formidable effort to relieve itself . The picket lines were so close to each other-where there was space enough between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converse . On the 21st of June I was informed , through this means , that Pemberton was preparing to escape by crossing to the Louisiana side under cover of night ; that he had employed workmen in making boats for that purpose ; that the men had been canvassed to ascertain if they would make an assault on the " Yankees " to cut their way out ; that they had refused , and had almost mutinied because their commander would not surrender and relieve their sufferings , and had only been pacified by the assurance that boats enough would be finished in a xveek to carry them all over . The rebel pickets also said that houses in the city had been pulled down to get material to build these boats with . Afterwards this story was verified . On entering the city we found a large number of very rudely constructed boats . All necessary steps were at once taken to render such an attempt abortive . Our pickets were doubled ; Admiral Porter was informed , so that the river might be more closely watched ; material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which to light it up if the attempt was made ; and batteries were established along the levee crossing the peninsula on the Louisiana side . Had the attempt been made , the garrison of Vicksburg would have been drowned , or made prisoners on the Louisiana side . General Richard Taylor was expected on the west bank to cooperate in this movement , I believe ; but he did not come , nor could he have done so with a force sufficient to be of service . The river was now in our possession , from its source to its mouth , except in the immediate front of Vicksburg and of Port Hudson . We had pretty nearly exhausted the country , from a line drawn from Lake Providence to opposite Bruinsburg . The roads west were not of a character to draw supplies over for any considerable force . By the ist of July our approaches had reached the enemy 's ditch at a number of places . At ten points we could move under cover to within from five to one hundred yards of the enemy . Orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 6th of July . The debouches were ordered widened , to afford easy egress , while the approaches were also to be widened to admit the troops to pass through four abreast . Plank , and bags filled with cotton packed in tightly , were ordered prepared , to enable the troops to cross the ditches . On the night of the ist of July Johnston was between Brownsville and the Big Black , and wrote Pemberton from there that about the 7th of the month an attempt would be made to create a diversion to enable him to cut his way out . Pemberton was a prisoner before this message reached him . On July ist Pemberton , seeing no hope of outside relief addressed the following letter to each of his four division commanders : " Unless the siege of Vicksburg is raised , or supplies are thrown in , it will become necessary very shortly to evacuate the place . I see no prospect of the former , and there are many great , if not insuperable , obstacles in the way of the latter . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delay as possible as to the condition of your troops , and their ability to make the marches and undergo the fatigues necessary to accomplish a successful evacuation . " Two of his generals suggested surrender , and the other two practically did the same . They expressed the opinion that an attempt to evacuate would fail . Pemberton had previously got a message to Johnston suggesting that he should try to negotiate with me for a release of the garrison with their arms . The latter replied that it would be a confession of weakness for him to do so ; but he authorized Pemberton to use his name in making such an arrangement . On the 3d , about ten o'clock A. M. , white flags appeared on a portion of the rebel works . Hostilities along that part of the line ceased at once . Soon two persons were seen coming towards our lines bearing a white flag . They proved to be General Bowen , a division commander , and Colonel Montgomery , aidede-camp to Pemberton , bearing the following letter to me : " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the view to arranging terms for the capitulation of Vickshurg . To this end , if agreeahle to you , I will appoint three commissioners , to meet a like number to he named by yourself , at such place and hour to-day as you may find convenient . I make this proposition to save the further effusion of blood , which must otherwise be shed to a frightful extent , feeling myself fully able to maintain my position for a yet indefinite period . This communication will be handed you , under a flag of truce , by Major-General John S. Bowen . " It was a glorious sight to officers and soldiers on the line where these white flags were visible , and the news soon spread to all parts of the command . The troops felt that their long and weary marches , hard fighting , ceaseless watching by night and day in a hot climate , exposure to all sorts of weather , to diseases , and worst of all , to the gibes of many Northern papers that came to them saying that all their suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at // last at an end , and the Union was sure to be saved . Bowen was received by General A. J. Smith , and asked to see me . I had been a neighbor of Bowen 's in Missouri , and knew him well and favorably , before the war ; but his request was refused . He then suggested that I should meet Pemberton . To this I sent a verbal message saying that , if Pemberton desired it , I would meet him in front of McPherson 's corps at three o'clock that afternoon . I also sent the following written reply to Pemberton 's letter : " Your note of this date is just received , proposing an armistice for several hours , for the purpose of arranging terms of capitulation through commissioners , to he appointed , etc . The useless effusion of blood you propose stopping by this course can be ended at any time you may choose , by the unconditional surrender of the city and garrison . Men who have shown so much endurance and courage as those now in Vicksburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can assure you will be treated with all the respect due to prisoners of war . I do not favor the proposition of appointing commissioners to arrange the terms of capitulation , because I have no terms other than those indicated above . " At three o'clock Pemberton appeared at the point suggested in my verbal message , accompanied by the same officers who had borne his letter of the morning . Generals Ord , McPherson , Logan , A. J. Smith , and several officers of my staff ; accompanied me . Our place of meeting was on a hillside within a few hundred feet of the rebel lines . Near by stood a stunted oak-tree , which was made historical by the event . It was but a short time before the last vestige of its body , root , and limbs had disappeared , the fragments being taken as trophies . Since then the same tree , like " the true cross , " has furnished many cords of wood in the shape of trophies . Pemberton and I had served in the same division in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , therefore , and greeted him as an old acquaintance . He soon asked what terms I proposed to give his army if it surrendered . My answer was , " The same as proposed in my reply to your letter . " Pemberton then said , rather snappishly , " The conference might as well end , " and turned abruptly as if to leave . I said , " Very well . " General Bowen , I saw , was very anxious that the surrender should be consummated . His manner and remarks while Pemberton and I were talking showed this . He now proposed that he and one of our generals should have a conference . I had no objection to this , as nothing could be made binding upon me that they might propose . Smith and Bowen accordingly had a conference , during which Pemberton and I were in conversation , moving a short distance away towards the enemy 's lines . After a while Bowen suggested that the Confederate army should be allowed to march out with the honors of war , carrying their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unceremoniously rejected . The interview then ended , I agreeing , however , to send a letter giving final terms by ten o'clock that night . Word was sent to Admiral Porter soon after the correspondence with Pemberton commenced , so that hostilities might be stopped on the part of both army and navy . It was agreed on my parting with Pemberton that they should not be renewed until our correspondence ceased . When I returned to my headquarters I sent for all the corps and division commanders who were with the army immediately confronting Vicksburg . Half the army was from eight to twelve miles off , waiting for Johnston . I informed these officers of the contents of pemberton 's ' letter , of my reply , and the substance of the interview , and told them I was ready to hear any suggestion , but would hold the power of deciding entirely in my own hands , even against a unanimous judgment . This was the nearest to a " council of war " I ever held . Against the general , almost unanimous , judgment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity with agreement this afternoon , I will submit the following proposition for the surren der of the city of Vicksburg , public stores , etc . On your accepting the terms proposed I will march in one division as a guard , and take possession at 8 A.M. to-morrow . As soon as rolls can be made out and paroles be signed by officers and men , you will be allowed to march out of our lines , the officers taking with them their side-arms and clothing , and the field , staff , and cavalry officers one horse each . The rank and file will be allowed all their clothing , but no other property . If these conditions are accepted , any amount of rations you may deem necessary can be taken from the stores you now have , and also the necessary cooking utensils for preparing them . Thirty wagons also , counting two two-horse or mule teams as one , will be allowed to transport such articles as can not be carried along . The same conditions will be allowed to all sick and wounded officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The paroles for these latter must be signed , however , whilst officers are present authorized to sign the roll of prisoners. ** By the terms of the cartel then in force prisoners captured by either army were required to be forwarded , as soon as possible , to either Aiken 's Landing below Dutch Gap , on the James river , or to Vicksburg , there to be exchanged , or paroled until they could be exchanged . There was a Confederate commissioner at Vicksburg , authorized to make the exchange . I did not propose to take him prisoner , but to leave him free to perform the functions of his office . Had I insisted upon an unconditional surrender , there would have been over thirty thousand men to trans // port up to Cairo , very much to the inconvenience of the army on the Mississippi ; thence the prisoners would have had to be transported by rail to Washington or Baltimore ; thence again by steamer to Aiken 's , at very great expense . At Aiken 's they would have had to be paroled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give in exchange . Then again Pemberton 's army was largely composed of men whose homes were in the south-west . I knew many of them were tired of the war , and would get home just as soon as they could . A large number of them had voluntarily come into our lines during the siege , and had requested to be sent north where they could get employment until the war was over and they could go to their homes . Late at night I received the following reply ' to my last letter : " I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this date , proposing terms of capitulation for this garrison and post . In the main , your terms are accepted ; but , in justice both to the honor and spirit of my troops , manifested in the defense of Vicksburg , I have to submit the following amendments , which , if acceded to by you , will perfect the agreement between us . At ten o'clock A.M. to-morrow , I propose to evacuate the works in and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my command , by marching out with my colors and arms , stacking them in front of my present lines , after which you will take possession . Officers to retain their side-arms and personal property , and the rights and property of citizens to be respected . " This was received after midnight ; my reply was as follows : " I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of 3d July . The amendment proposed by you can not be acceded to in full . It will be necessary to furnish every officer and man with a parole signed by himself , which , with the completion of the roll of prisoners , will necessarily take some time . Again , I can make no stipulations with regard to the treatment of citizens and their private property . While I do not propose to cause them any undue annoyance or loss , I can not consent to leave myself under any restraint by stipulations . The property which officers will be allowed to take with them will be as stated in my proposition of last evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baggage and side-arms , and mounted officers one horse each . If you mean by your proposition for each brigade to march to the front of the lines now occupied by it , and stack arms at ten o'clock A. M. , and then return to the inside and there remain as prisoners until properly paroled , I will make no objection to it . Should no notification be received of your acceptance of my terms by nine o'clock A. M. , I shall regard them as having been rejected , and shall act accordingly . Should these terms be accepted , white flags should be displayed along your lines to prevent such of my troops as may not have been notified , from firing upon your men . " These terms Pemberton promptly accepted . During the siege there had been a good deal of friendly sparring between the soldiers of the txo armies on picket and where the lines were close together . All rebels were known as " Johnnies , " all Union troops as " Yanks . " Often " Johnny " would call , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The reply was sometimes , " We propose to celebrate the 4th of July there . " Sometimes it would be , " We always treat our prisoners with kindness and do not want to hurt them " ; or " We are holding you as prisoners of war while you are feeding yourselves , " etc . The garrison , from the commanding general down , undoubtedly expected an assault onthe4th . They knew from the temper of their men that it would be successful when made , and that would be a greater humiliation than to surrender . Besides , it would be attended with severe loss to them . The Vicksburg paper ( which we received regularly through the courtesy of the rebel pickets ) said prior to the 4th , in speaking of the Yankee boast that they would take dinner in Vicksburg that day , that the best receipt for cooking a rabbit was , " First ketch your rabbit . " The paper at this time , and for some time prior , was printed on the plain side of wall paper . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we had " caught our rabbit . " I have no doubt that Pemberton commenced his correspondence on the 3d for a twofold purpose : first , to avoid an assault , which he knew would be successful ; and second , to prevent the capture taking place on the great national holiday . Holding out for better terms , as he did , defeated his aim in the latter particular . Pemberton says in his report : " If it should be asked why the 4th of July was selected as the day for surrender , the answer is obvious . I believed that upon that day I should obtain better terms . Well aware of the vanity of our foe , I knew they would attach vast importance to the entrance on the 4th of July into the stronghold of the great river , and that , to gratify their national vanity , they wouXX y*eXX tX*tert NVtat could ixot be extorted from them at any other time . " This does not support my view of his reasons for selecting the day he did for surrendering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was received about ten o'clock A. M. , July 3d . It then could hardly be expected that it would take twenty-four hours to effect a surrender . He knew that Johnston was in our rear for the purpose of raising the siege , and he naturally would want to hold out as long as he could . He knew his men would not resist an assault , and one was expected on the 4th . In our interview he told me he had rations enough to hold out for some **27;1014;TOOLONG weeks . It was this statement that induced me to insert in the terms that he was to draw rations for his men from his own supplies . On the 3d , as soon as negotiations were commenced , I notified Sherman , and directed him to be ready to take the offensive against John- // ston , drive him out of the State , and destroy his army if he could . Steele and Ord were directed at the same time to be in readiness to join Sherman as soon as the surrender should take place , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the appointed hour , the garrison of Vicksburg marched out of their works , formed line in front , stacked arms , and marched back in good order . Our whole army present witnessed this scene without cheering , and without a single offensive remark that I ever heard of . Logan 's division , which had approached nearest the rebel works , was the first to march in , and the flag of one of the regiments of his division was soon floating over the court-house . Our men were no sooner inside the lines than the two armies began to fraternize . We had had full rations from the time the siege commenced to the close . The enemy had been suffering , particularly towards the last . I myself saw our men taking bread from their haversacks and giving it to those whom they had so recently been engaged in starving out . It was accepted with avidity and with thanks . I rode into Vicksburg with the troops , and went to the river to exchange congratulations with the navy upon our joint victory . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been living under-ground . The ridges upon which Vicksburg is built , and those back to the Big Black , are composed of a deep-yellow clay , of great tenacity . When roads and streets are cut through , perpendicular banks are left , and stand as well as if composed of stone . The magazines of the enemy were made by mining passageways into this clay , at places where there were deep cuts . Many citizens secured places of safety for their families by carving out rooms in these embankments . A doorway , in these cases , would be cut in a high bank , starting from the level of the road or street , and after running it in a few feet , a room of the size required would be carved out ofthe clay , the dirt being removed by the doorway . In some instances I saw where two rooms were cut out for a single family , with a doorway in the clay wall separating them . Some of these were carpeted and furnished with considerable elaboration . In these the occupants were fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped into the city night and day , without intermission . In the afternoon I returned to my old headquarters outside , and did not move them into the town until the 6th . My dispatch announc. ing our victory to the Government was started for Cairo , by a dispatch boat ( to be telegraphed from there ) , on the evening of the 4th . It was as follows : " The enemy surrendered this morning . The only terms allowed is their parole as prisoners of war . This I regard as a great advantage to us at this moment . It saves , probably , several days in the capture . and leaves troops and transports ready for immediate service . Sherman , with a large force , moves immediately on Johnston , to drive him from the State . I will send troops to the relief of Banks , and return the Ninth Army Corps to Burnside . " At the same time I notified Banks , nowbefore Port Hudson , of the capture and terms , and offered to send him all the troops he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kind offices of the pickets got several copies into the rebel lines . A copy getting into the hands of the commanding officer , General Gardner , he asked to have it authenticated and its reliability substantiated ; this being done , he would deem it useless to hold out longer . Banks assured him that the surrender had taken place , and Gardner capitulated unconditionally . Pemberton and his army were kept in Vicksburg until the whole could be paroled . The paroles were in duplicate , by organization , one copy for each , Nationals and Confederates , signed by the commanding officers of the com-* panies or regiments . Duplicates were also made for each soldier , and signed by each individually , one to be retained by the soldier signing , and one to be retained by us . Several hundred refused to sign their paroles , preferring to be sent to the North as prisoners to being sent back to fight again . Others again kept out of the way , hoping to escape both alternatives . Pemberton appealed to me in person to compel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also leaked out that many of the men who had signed their paroles intended to desert and go to their homes as soon as they were out of our lines . Pemberton , hearing this , again appealed to me to assist him . He wanted arms for a battalion , to act as guards in keeping his men together while being marched to a camp of instruction , where he expected to keep them until exchanged . This request was also declined . It was precisely what I had expected and hoped that they would do . I told him , however , that I would see that they marched beyond our lines in good order . By the iith , just one week after the surrender , the paroles were completed , and the rebel garrison marched out . Many deserted , and fewer of them were ever returned to the ranks to fight again than would have been the case had the surrender been unconditional and had the prisoners been sent to the James river to be paroled . As soon as our troops took poss*ssion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of parapet , from the river above to // the river below . The prisoners were allowed to occupy their old camps behind the intrenchments . No restraint was put upon them , except by their own commanders . They were rationed about the same as our own men , and from our supplies . The men of the two armies fraternized as if they had been fighting for the same cause . When they passed out of the works they had so long and so gallantly defended , between lines of their late antagonists , not a cheer went up , not a retort was made that would give pain . Really , I believe there was a feeling of sadness just then in the breasts of most of the Union soldiers , at seeing the dejection of their late antagonists . The day before the departure the following order was issued : " Paroled prisoners will be sent out here to-morrow . They will be authorized to cross at the railroad-bridge and move from there to Edwards Ferry , and on by way of Raymond . Instruct the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to make no offensive remarks , and not to harbor any who fall out of ranks after they have passed . " On . the 8th a dispatch was sent from Washington by General Halleck , saying : " I fear your paroling the prisoners at Vicksburg without actual delivery to a proper agent , as required by the seventh article of the cartel , may be construed into an absolute release , and that the men will immediately be placed in the ranks of the enemy . Such has been the case elsewhere . If these prisoners have not been allowed to depart , you will detain them until further orders . " Halleck did not know that they had already been delivered into the hands of Major Watts , Confederate commissioner for the exchange of prisoners . At Vicksburg thirty-one thousand six hundred prisoners were surrendered , together with one hundred and seventy-two cannon , sixty thousand muskets , and a large amount of ammunition . The small arms of the enemy were far superior to the bulk of ours . Up to this time our troops at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flint-lock changed into percussion , the Belgian musket imported early in the war-almost as dangerous to the person firing it as to the one aimed at - and a few new and improved arms . These were of many different calibers , thus causing much trouble in distributing ammunition during an engagement . The enemy had generally new arms , which had run the blockade , and were of uniform caliber . After the surrender I authorized all colonels whose regiments were armed with inferior muskets to place them in the stack of captured arms , and to replace them with the latter . A large number of arms , turned in to the Ordnance Department as captured , were arms that had really been used by the Union army in the capture of Vicksburg . In this narration I have not made the mention I should of officers , dead and alive , whose services entitle them to special mention . Neither have I made that mention of the navy which its services deserve . I could not do justice to both in the limits of a magazine article . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ siege of Vicksburg found us with an army unsurpassed , in proportion to its numbers , taken as a whole , officers and men . A military education was acquired which no other school could have given . Men who thought a company was quite enough for them to command properly at the beginning , would have made good regimental or brigade commanders ; most of the brigade commanders were equal to the command of a division , and one , Ransom , would have been equal to the command of a corps at least . Logan and Crocker ended the campaign fitted for independent commands . General F. P. Blair , who commanded a division in the campaign , joined me at Milliken 's Bend a full-fledged general , without having served in a lower grade . I had known Blair in Missouri , where I had voted against him for Congress in 1858 . I knew him as a frank , positive , and generous man , true to his friends even to a fault , but always a leader . I dreaded his coming ; I knew from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desiring to be leaders than to command an army officered intelligently and with subordination . It affords me the greatest pleasure to record now my agreeable disappointment in his character . There was no man braver than he , nor was there any who obeyed all orders of his superior in rank with more unquestioning alacrity . He was one man as a soldier , another as a politician . The navy , under Porter , was all it could be during the entire campaign . Without its assistance the campaign could not have been successfully made with twice the number of men engaged . It could not have been made at all , in the way it was , with any number of men without such assistance . The most perfect harmony reigned between the two arms of the service . There never was a request made , that I am aware off , either of the flag-officer or any of his subordinates , that was not promptly complied with . The campaign of Vicksburg was suggested and developed by circumstances ; and it now looks as though Providence had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed the decree . U. S. Grant . // qwq JUST a quarter of a century ago a young lady of New Orleans found herself an alien and an enemy to the sentiments of the community about her . Surrounded by friends and social companions , she was nevertheless painfully alone . In her enforced silence she began a diary intended solely for her own eye . A betrothed lover came suddenly from a neighboring State , claimed her hand in haste , and bore her away , a happy bride . Happy , yet anxious . The war was now fairly upon the land , and her husband , like herself , cherished sympathies whose discovery would have brought jeopardy of life , ruin , and exile . In the South , those days , all life was romantic . Theirs was full of adventure . At length they were shut up in Vicksburg . I hope some day to publish the whole diary ; but the following portion is specially appropriate to the great panorama of battle in which a nation of readers is just now so interested . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came by the manuscript , but only to say that I have not molested its original text .
