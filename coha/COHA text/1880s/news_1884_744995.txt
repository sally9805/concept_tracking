txt There has for years been a complaint among fire underwriters in this city that their business is carried on at a loss or an altogether discouraging rate of profit . They claim to be subject to extra-hazardous risks on account of great values concentrated in certain quarters and the lack of adequate provision for the prevention and extinction of fires . As a consequence there has of late been a steady effort to increase rates , especially for the kind of property needing most insurance and said to be subject to the greatest risk . Advances in rates react upon the business of fire insurance and tend to restrict the business of the companies so as to defeat the object for which the advances are made . Insurers have complained much of the recent increase in the cost of insurance . It is claimed on their side that risks have been diminished rather than increased where great values are concentrated , for owners have taken great precautions in the construction of buildings , in extinguishing appliances of their own , and in careful watching . The consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies charging high rates , and resort to the mutual plan or the establishment of combinations known as " individual Lloyds " for their protection . Great encouragement has been given to the mutual plan of insurance by the high charges of stock companies , and yet the latter claim that they can not live and do business at lower rates . There must be something wrong in management when fire insurance companies can not make a profit without charging rates which destroy their business . If there is nothing wrong in management , then the business of fire insurance by stock companies has had its day . No business can be conducted without a profit , and no business can be conducted successfully on a plan which is to a material extent more costly to customers than another plan which is within easy reach . An examination of a table showing the percentage of losses paid and of expenses of management to the total receipts from premiums of a number of our old established companies suggests a possible explanation of the difficulty in fire insurance . Perhaps it costs too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are not all necessary . Out of twenty or more companies in the list before us there are about one-third whose total expenditures , including losses paid , for 1883 exceeded their receipts for premiums . In many cases the expense ratio exceeds that of losses and in several it is more than half the premium receipts . It ranges , in fact , all the way from 25 per cent . to nearly 85 , and the average is about 45 . This is certainly too much to be expended in conducting the business , and there is too much variation in the ratio of expense to be explained by legitimate causes . Although we have no classification of these expenses and can not say what they are for , it is evident that one cause of the trouble in fire insurance in this city is that the business is too expensively managed , and the cure is to be found rather in economy of management than increase of rates .                    @
