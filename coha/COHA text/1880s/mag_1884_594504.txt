THE KU KLUX KLAN. * ITS ORIGIN , GROWTH , AND DISBANDMENT . No CHAPTER in American history is more strange than the one which bears for a title : " Ku Klux Klan . " The secret history of the Invisible Empire , as the Klan was also called , has never been written . The Klan disappeared from Southern life as it came into it , shrouded in deepest mystery . Its members would not disclose its secrets ; others could not . Even the investigating committee appointed by Congress , after tedious and diligent inquiry , was baffled . The voluminous reports containing the results of the committee 's labors do not tell when and where and how the Ku Klux Klan originated . But the time has now arrived when the history of the origin , growth , and disbandment of " The Invisible Empire " may be given to the public . Circumstances , which need not be detailed here , have put it in the power of the writer to compile such a history . For obvious reasons the names of individuals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this narrative is drawn from sources which are accurate and authentic . The writer does not profess to be able to reveal the secret signs , grips , and pass-words of the order . These have never been disclosed , and probably never will be . But we claim to narrate those facts relating to the order which have a historic and philosophic value . It is due to the truth of history , to the student of human nature , and to the statesman , that such facts connected with this remarkable episode in our nation 's history be frankly and fairly told . A wave of excitement , spreading by contagion till the minds of a whole people are in a ferment , is an event of frequent occurrence . The Ku Klux movement was peculiar by reason of the causes which produced and fed the excitement . It illustrates the weird and irresist Copyright , 1884 , by D. L. Wilson and J. C. Lester . All rights reserved . // ible power of the unknown and mysterious over the minds of men of all classes and conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and conditions , in part of their own creation , may be carried away from their moorings and drifted along in a course against which reason and judgment protest . The popular idea supposes the Ku Klux movement to have been conceived in malice , and nursed by prejudice and hate , for lawlessness , rapine , and murder . The circumstances which brought the Klan into notice and notoriety were of a character to favor such a conclusion . No other seemed possible . The report of the Congressional investigating committee confirmed it . But granting the truthfulness of that report , it is fragmentary truth ; it does not tell the whole story ; and it leaves the impression that the Ku Klux Klan was conceived and carried out in pure and unmixed deviltry . Whether this conclusion is just and true , the reader who follows this narrative to its end will decide . The Ku Klux Klan was the outgrowth of peculiar conditions , social , civil , and political , which prevailed at the South from 1865 to i869i It was as much a product of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its birth-place was Pulaski , the capital of Giles , one of the southern tier of counties in Middle Tennessee . Pulaski is a town of two thousand five hundred to three thousand inhabitants . Previous to the war the people possessed wealth and culture . The first was lost in the general wreck . Now the most intimate association with them fails to disclose a trace of the diabolism which , according to the popular idea , one would expect to find characterizing the people among whom the Ku Klux Klan originated . A male college and a female seminary are located at Pulaski , and receive liberal patronage . It is a town of churches . There , in i866* the name Ku Klux first fell from human lips . There began a movement which in a short time spread as far north as Virginia and as far south as Texas , and which for a period convulsed the country . Proclamations were fulminated against the Klan by the President and by the Governors of States ; and hostile statutes were enacted both by State and national legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ku Klux Klan gross mistakes and lawless deeds of violence . During the entire period of the Klan 's organized existence Pulaski continued to be its central seat of authority , and some of its highest officers resided there . This narrative , therefore , will relate principally to the growth of the Klan and the measures taken to suppress it in Tennessee . It is necessary to a clear understanding of the movement to observe that the history of the Klan is marked by two distinct and well-defined periods . The first period covers the time from its organization in i866 to the summer of *867 . This period of its history , though less interesting , should be described somewhat minutely , because of its bearing on subsequent events . When the war ended in i86* the young men of Pulaski who escaped death on the battle-field returned home and passed through a period of enforced inactivity . In some respects it was more trying than the ordeal of war which lay behind them . The reaction which followed the excitement of army scenes and service was intense . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage in activ&amp;business or professional - pursuits . Their bj*isiness habits were broken up . None had capital with which to conduct agricultural pursuits or to engage in mercantile enterprises . And this restlessness was made more intense by the total lack of the amusements and social diversions which prevail wherever society is in a normal condition . One evening in JMne*18fi6 , a few of these young men met in the office of one of the most prominent members of the Pulaski bar . In the course of the conversation one of the number said : " Boys , let us get up a club or a society of some description . " The suggestion was discussed with enthusiasm . Before they separated , it was agreed to invite a few others whose names were mentioned to join them , and to meet again the next evening at the same place . At the appointed time eight or ten young men had assembled . The club was organized by the election of a chairman and a secretary . There was entire unanimity among the members in regard to the end in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was spent discussing the best means of attaining the object in view . Two committees were appointed , one to select a name , the other to prepare a set of rules for the government of the society , and a ritual for the initiation of new members . Then the club adjourned , to meet the following week to hear and act upon the reports of these committees . Before the arrival of the appointed time for the next meeting one of the wealthiest and most prominent citizens of Pulaski went on a business trip to Columbus Miss. , taking his family with him . Before leaving he invited one of the leading spirits of the new society to take charge of and sleep at his house in his absence . This young man invited his comrades to join him there ; so the place of meeting was changed from the law office // to this residence . The owner of the house outlived the Ku Klux Klan , and died ignorant of the fact that his house was the place where its organization was fully effected . This residence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of SpoffordKellogg fame . It was his home at the time of his death , and is still owned by his widow . The committee appointed to select a name reported that they had found the task difficult , and had not made a selection . They explained that they had been trying to discover or invent a name which would be in some degree suggestive of the character and objects of the society . They mentioned several names which they had been considering . In this number was the name " iQjkLoi , * ' from the Greek word * ( kuklos ) , meaning a band or cirde . At mention of this , some one cried out : " Call it Ku Klux ! " " Klan " at once suggested itself , and was added to complete the *alliteration . So , instead of adopting a name , as was the first intention , which had a definite meaning , they chose one which to the proposer and to every one else was absolutely meaningless . This trivial and apparently accidental incident had a most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Looking back over the history of the Klan , and at the causes under which it developed , it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the order would never have grown to the proportions which it afterward assumed , or wielded the power it did , had it not borne this name , or some other equally as meaningless and mysterious . Had they called themselves the " Jolly Jokers , " or the " Adelphi , " or by some similar appellation , the organization would doubtless have had no more than the mere local and ephemeral existence which those who organized it contemplated for it . Hundreds of societies have originated just as this one did , and , after a brief existence , have passed away . But in the case before us there was a weird potency in the very name Ku Klux Klan ! Let the reader pronounce it aloud . The sound of it is suggestive of bones rattling together ! The potency of the name was not wholly in the impression made by it on the general public . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first to feel its weird influence . They had adopted a mysterious name . Thereupon the original plan wa*ifiodified so as to make everything connected with the order harmonize with the name . Amusement was still the end in view ; but the methods by which they proposed to win it were now those of secrecy and - mystery . So when the report of the committee on rules and ritual came up for consideration , the rec ommendations were modified to adapt them to the new idea . The report , as finally adopted provided for the following officers : /A Grand Cyclops , or presiding officer . /A Grand Magi , or vice-president . A Grand Turk , or marshal . A Grand Exchequer , or treasurer . Two Lictors , who were the outer and inner guards of the " den , " as the place of meeting was designated . I The one obligation exacted from members was to maintain absolute and profound secrecy with reference to the order and everything pertaining to it . This obligation prohibited those who assumed it from disclosing the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other member , and from soliciting any one to become a member . The last requirement was a singular one . *Jt was exacted for two reasons . First , it was in keeping with their determination to appear as mysterious as possible , and thus play upon the curiosity of the public . Secondly , and mainly , it was designed to prevent unpleasantness following initiations . They wished to be able to say to novices : " You are here on your own solicitation , and not by invitation from us . " They desired accessions ; to have them was indispensable ; but they knew human nature well enough to know that if they made the impression that they wished to be exclusive and select , then applications for membership would be numerous . The result showed that they reasoned correctly . Each member was required to-provide himself with the following outfit : A white mask for the face with orifices for the eyes and nose . A tall , fantastic cardboard hat , so constructed as to increase the wearer 's apparent height . A gown or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No particular color or material was prescribed . These were left to the individual 's taste and fancy ; and each selected what in his judgment would be the most hideous and fantastic , with the aim of inspiring the greatest amount of awe in the novice . These robes of different colors - often of the most flashy patterns of " Dolly Varden " calicoes - added vastly to the grotesque appearance of the assembled Klan . Each member carried also a small whistle , with which , by means of a code of signals agreed upon , they held communications with one another . The only utility in this was toe awaken inquiry . And the object of all this was- amusement . " Only this , and nothing more . " A few young men , barred for the time by circumstances from entering any active business or professional pursuits , and deprived of the ordinary // diversions of social life , were seeking in this way to amuse and employ themselves . The organization of this Klan was to them both diversion and occupation . But where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity of the public and then in baffling it , but mainly in the initiation of new members . The ritual used in the initiation was elaborate , but not worthy of reproduction . It is enough to say that it was modeled on and embraced the leading features of the ritual of an order which has long been popular in colleges and universities under various names . In one place it is the " Sons of Confucius " ; in another , the " Guiasticutas " ; but everywhere the " ancient and the honorable , " and the mirth-provoking . The initiations were at first conducted in the law office where the suggestion for the formation of the Klan had been made ; but it was not a suitable place . The room was small ; it was near the business portion of the town , and while the members were in session there they never felt entirely free from apprehensions of interruption . On the brow of a ridge that runs along the western outskirt* of the town there used to stand a handsome and commodious residence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " L " of wood . In December , 1865 , the brick portion of this house was demolished by a cyclone ; the " L " remained standing . It consisted of three rooms . A stairway led from one of them to a large cellar beneath . No other houses stood near . Around these ruins were the storm-torn , limbless trunks of trees which had once formed a magnificent grove ; now they stood up grim and gaunt like specter sentinels . A dreary , desolate , uncanny place it was ; but in every way suitable for a " den , " and the Klan appropriated it . When a meeting was held , one Lictor was . stationed at the house , the other fifty yards from it on the road leading into town . These were dressed in the fantastic regalia of the order and bore tremendous spears as the badge of their office . As before stated , and for the reasons assigned , the Ku Klux did not solicit any one to join them ; yet they had applications for membership . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership , they were allowed to talk with others in regard to anything that was a matter of common report in regard to the order . A member might express to an outsider his desire or intention to join . If the person addressed expressed a similar desire , the Ku Klux would then say to him , if he were a desirable person : " Well , I think I know how to get in . Meet me at such a place , on such a night , at such an hour , and we will join together . " Usually , curiosity would predominate over every other consideration , and the candidate would be found waiting at the appointed place . As the Ku Klux and the candidate approached the sentinel Lictor , they were hailed and halted , and questioned . Having received the assurance that they desired to become Ku Klux , the Lictor blew the signal for his companion to come and take charge of the novices . The candidate , under the impression that his companion was similarly treated , was blindfolded and led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in leading the candidate around the rooms and down into the cellar , now and then placing before him obstructions , which added to his discomfort if not to his mystification . After some rough sport of this description he was led before the Grand Cyclops , who solemnly addressed to him numerous questions - some of them grave and serious , some of them absurd to the last degree . If the answers were satisfactory , the obligation to secrecy , which had already been administered in the beginning of the ceremony , was now exacted a second time . Then the Grand Cyclops commanded : " Place him before the royal altar and adorn his head with the regal crown . " The " royal altar " was a large.looking-glass . The " regal crown " was a huge hat bedecked with two enormous donkey ears . In this headgear the candidate was placed before a mirror and directed to repeat the couplet : " 0 wad some power the giftie gie us To see oursels as ithers see us . " As the last words were falling from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the candidate was his own image in the mirror . To increase the discomfiture and chagrin which any man in such a situation would naturally feel , the removal of the bandage was the signal to the Klan for indulgence in the most uproarious and boisterous mirth . The Grand Cyclops relaxed the rigor of his rule , and the decorum hitherto maintained disappeared , while the " den " rang with shouts and peals of laughter . And worse than all , as he looked about him , he saw that he was surrounded by men dressed in hideous garbs and masked so that he could not recognize one of them . The character of these initiatory proceedings explains why , from the very first , secrecy was so much insisted on . A single " tale out of school ' * would have spoiled the fun . For the same reason the Klan was , at first , very careful in regard to the character of the men admitted . Rash and imprudent men , such as could not be fully relied upon to keep their obligation to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received who were addicted to the use of intoxicants . Later on in the history they were not so careful ; but in the earlier period of its existence the Klan was composed of men of good character and good habits . In some instances persons of objectionable character were persistent , even to annoyance , in their efforts to gain admission to the order . Occasionally this persistence was rebuked in a manner more emphatic than tender . For example , one young man , who was personally very unpopular , made repeated attempts to join the Ku Klux . They arranged to have an initiation not provided for in the ritual . A meeting was appointed to be held on the top of a hill that rises by a gentle slope to a considerable height , on the northern limits of the town . The candidate , in the usual way ,  --  blindfold excepted ,  --  was led into the presence of the Grand Cyclops . This dignitary was standing on a stump . The tall hat , the flowing robe , and the elevated position made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the candidate a few unimportant and absurd questions , and then , turning to the Lictors , said : " Blindfold him and proceed . " The " procedure " was to place the would-be Ku Klux in an empty barrel , provided for the purpose , and to send him whirling down the hill ! To his credit be it said , he never revealed any of the secrets of the Ku Klux . These details have an important bearing on the subsequent history of the Ku Klux . They show that the originators of the Klan were not meditating treason.or lawlessness in any form . Yet the Klan 's later history grew naturally out of the methods and measures which characterized this period of it . Its projectors did not expect it to spread ; they thought it would " have its little day and die . " It lived ; more , it grew to vast proportions . II . THE SPREAD OF THE KLAN . THE devices for attracting attention were eminently successful . During the months of July and August , i866 , the Klan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mysteriousness was the sensation of the hour . Every issue of the local paper contained some notice of the strange order . These notices were copied into other papers , and in this manner the way was prepared for the rapid growth and spread of the Klan , which soon followed . Six weeks or less from the date of the organization , the sensation in Pulaski was waning . Curiosity in regard to it had abated to such a degree that the Klan would have certainly fallen to pieces but for the foJlow ing circumstances . By the time the eligible material in the town had been used up , young men from the country , whose curiosity had been inflamed by the notices in the papers , began to come in and apply for admission to the Klan . Some of these applications were accepted . In a little while the members so admitted asked permission to establish " dens " at various points in the county . No provision had been made for such a contingency , but the permission was granted ; had it not been , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . As the ritual followed by the Pulaski Klan could not be conveniently carried out in the country , various modifications and changes were permitted . But the strictest injunctions were laid on these new lodges , or " dens , " in regard to secrecy , mystery , and the character of the men admitted . The growth in the rural districts was more rapid than it had been in the town . Applications for permission to establish " dens " multiplied rapidly . The news that the Ku Klux were spreading to the country excited the attention of the country people as the existence of the Klan in town had not done . The same cause rekindled the waning interest of the town people . Every issue of the local papers in the " infected regions " bristled with highly mysterious and exciting accounts of the doings of the " fantastic gentry . " During the fall and winter of i866 the growth of the Klan was rapid . It spread over a wide extent of territory . Sometimes , by a sudden leap , it appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A stranger from West Tennessee , Mississippi , Alabama , or Texas , visiting in a neighborhood where the order prevailed , would be initiated , and on his departure carry with him permission to establish a " den " at home . In fact , it was done often without such permission . The connecting link between these " dens " was very fragile . By a sort of tacit agreement the Pulaski Klan was regarded as the source of power and authority . The Grand Cyclops of this " den " was virtually the ruler of the order ; but as he had no method of communication with subjects or subordinates , and no way in which to enforce his mandates , his authority was more fancy than fact . But so far there had appeared no need for rigid rules and close supervision . The leading spirits of the Ku Klux were still contemplating nothing more serious than aInusement . They enjoyed the baffled curiosity and wild speculations of a mystified public even more than the rude sport afforded by the ludicrous initiations . Such is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its history , from June , i866 , // to April , 1867 . Yet all this time it was gradually and in a very natural way taking on new features not at first remotely contemplated by the originators of the order ; features which finally transformed the Ku Klux Klan into a band of " Regulators . " The transformation was effected by the combined operation of three causes : ( i ) the impression made by the order upon the minds of those who united with it ; ( 2 ) the impression produced upon the public by its weird and mysterious ways ; ( 3 ) the anomalous and peculiar condition of affairs in the South at this time . The mystery and secrecy with which the Klan veiled itself made a singular impression on the minds of many who united with it . The most common conclusion reached by those whose attention was attracted to the Klan was that it contemplated some great and important mission ; its rapid extension was regarded as confirmatory of this conclusion ; and , when admitted to membership , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heard . There was not a word in the ritual , or in the obligation , or in any part of the ceremony , to favor it ; but the impression still remained that this mysteriousness and secrecy , the high-sounding titles of the officers , the grotesque dress of the members , and the formidable obligation to profound secrecy , all meant more than mere sport . This conviction was ineradicable , and the attitude of many of its members continued to be that of expecting great developments . Each had his own speculations as to what was to be the character of the serious work which the Klan was to do . It was an unhealthy and dangerous state of mind ; bad results very naturally followed from it . The impression made on the public was the second cause which contributed to the transformation of the Klan into regulators . When the Klan first began to hold its meetings in . the dilapidated house on the hill , passers-by were frequent . Most of them passed the grim and ghostly sentinel on the roadside in silence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and ask : " Who are you ? " In awfully sepulchral tones , the invariable answer was : " A spirit from the other world . I was killed at Chickamauga . " Such an answer , especially when given to a superstitious negro , was extremely terrifying ; and if , in addition , he heard the uproarious noises issuing from the " den " at the moment of a candidate 's investiture with the " regal crown , " he had the foundation for a most awe-inspiring story . There came from the country similar stories . The belated laborer , passing after nightfall some lonely and secluded spot , heard horrible noises and saw fearful sights . These stories were repeated with such embellishments as the imagination of the narrator suggested , till the feeling of the negroes and of many white people at mention of the Ku Klux was one of awe and terror . In a short time the Lictor of the Pulaski " den " reported that travel along the road on which he had his post had almost entirely stopped . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored population diminished or entirely ceased whereverthe Ku Klux appeared . In this way the Klan gradually realized that the most powerful devices ever constructed for controlling the ignorant and superstitious were in their hands . Even the most highly cultured were not able wholly to resist the weird and peculiar feeling which pervaded the whole community . Each week some new incident occurred to illustrate the amazing power of the Unknown over the minds of men of all classes . Circumstances made it evident that the measures and methods employed for sport might be effectually used to subserve the public welfare - to suppress lawlessness and protect property . When propositions to this effect began to be urged , there were many who hesitated , fearing danger . The majority regarded such fears as groundless . They pointed to the good results which had already been produced , and the question was decided without any formal action . The very force of circumstances had carried the Klan away from its original purpose ; so that in the beginning of th' year 1867 it was virtually , though not yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an injudicious and dangerous way , trying to protect property and preserve peace and order . After all , the most powerful agency in effecting this transformation- the agency which supplied the conditions under which the two causes just mentioned became operative - was the peculiar state of affairs existing in the South at that time . As every one knows , the condition of things was wholly anomalous ; but no one can fully appreciate the circumstances by which the people of the South were surrounded , or pronounce a just judgment on their behavior , except from personal observations . On this account , not only the Ku Klux , but the mass of the Southern people , have been tried , convicted , and condemned at the bar of public opinion , and have been denied the privilege of having the sentence modified by mitigating circumstances , which in justice they have a right to plead . At that time the throes of the great revolution were settling down to quiet . The almost universal disposition of the better class of the people was to accept the arbitrament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point there was practical unanimity . Those who had opportunity to do so engaged at once in agricultural , professional , or business pursuits . But there were two causes of vexation and exasperation which the people were in no good mood to bear . One of these causes related to that class of men who , like scum , were thrown to the surface in the great upheaval . Most of them had played traitor to both sides ; on that account they were despised . Had they been Union men from conviction , that would have been forgiven them . But they were now engaged in keeping alive discord and strife between the sections , as the only means of preventing themselves from sinking back into the obscurity from which they had been upheaved . They were doing this in a way not only malicious , but exceedingly exasperating . The second disturbing element was the negroes . Their transition from slavery to citizenship was sudden . They were not only not fitted for the cares of selfcontrol and maintenance so suddenly thrust upon them , but they entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant license . They regarded themselves as freed men , not only from bondage to former masters , but from the common and ordinary obligations of citizenship . Many of them looked upon obedience to the laws of the State - which had been framed by their former owners - as in some measure a compromise of the rights with which they had been invested . The administration of civil law was only partly reestablished . On that account , and for other reasons mentioned , there was an amount of disorder and violence prevailing over the country which has never been equaled at any period of its history . The depredations on property by theft , and by wanton destruction for the gratification of petty revenge , were to the last degree annoying . A large part of these depredations was the work of bad white men , who expected that their lawless deeds would be credited to the negroes . But perhaps the most potent of all causes in this transformation was the existence in the South of a spurious and perverted form of the " Union League . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as it existed at the North , to charge it with responsibility for the outrages committed in its name , as it is to charge upon the Ku Klux Klan much of the lawlessness and violence with which it is credited . But it is a part of the history of these times that there was a wide-spread organization called the " Union League . " It was composed of the disorderly elements of the negro population , and was led by white men of the basest and meanest type . They met frequently , went armed to the teeth , and literally " breathed out threatening and slaughter . " They uttered the most violent threats against the persons , families , and property of men whose sole crime was that they had been in the Confederate army , and in not a few instances these threats were executed . It was partly to resist this organization that the Ku Klux were transformed into a protective organization . Whatever may be the judgment of history , those who were acquainted with the facts will ever remain firm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immense service at this period . Without it life to decent people would not have been tolerable . It served a good purpose , for wherever the Ku Klux appeared the effect was salutary . It was a dangerous experiment , this transforming of the Klan into regulators ; on the whole it was no more successful than other experiments of a similar character have been . Yet , as we have said , the immediate results were good , and , for that reason , in their final issue the more disastrous . Permanent good was also effected ; but whether enough of it to counterbalance the attending evils , is doubtful . For a while the robberies ceased . The lawless class assumed the habits of good behavior . Under their fear of the dreaded Ku Klux the negroes made more progress in a few months in the needed lessons of self-control , industry , and respect for the rights of property and general good behavior , than they would have done in as many years but for this or some equally powerful impulse . The " Union League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But events soon occurred which showed that the fears of those who apprehended danger were not wholly groundless , and it became evident that unless the Klan should be brought under better control than its leaders at this time exercised , it would cause greater evils than it suppressed . III . THE TRANSFORMATION . UNTIL the beginning of 1867 the movements of the Klan had been characterized in the main by prudence and discretion , but * What is meant here is " The Union League of America , " a political organization having connections both north and south , and entirely distinct from the " Union League Club " of New York and from the club of the same name in Philadelphia . Viewed by the results of the Ku Klux conflict , and the reports of the time , what is here said of the dangerous character of the " Union League " at the South ( except as it acted in self-defense&gt; must be taken , we think , with a grain of allowance. - EDIToR. // there were exceptions . In some cases there had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been agreed not to pass had been overstepped . Attempts had been made to correct by positive means evils which menaces had not been sufficient to remove . Rash , imprudent , and bad men had gotten into the order . The danger which the more prudent and thoughtful had apprehended as possible was now a reality . Had it been possible to do so , the leaders would have been willing to disband the Klan . That could not be done . They had evoked a spirit from the " vasty deep " ; it would not down at their bidding . The only course which seemed to promise a satisfactory solution of the difficulty was this : to reorganize the Klan on a plan corresponding to its size and present purposes ; to bind the isolated " dens " together ; to secure unity of purpose and concert of action ; to hedge the members up by such limitations and regulations as were best adapted to restrain them within proper limits ; to distribute the authorit'T among prudent men at local centers , and ) exact from them a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way it was hoped the impending dangers would be effectually guarded against . With this object in view the Grand Cyclops of the Pulaski " den " sent out a request to all the " dens " of which he had knowledge to appoint delegates to meet in convention at Nashville , Tenn. , in the spring of 1867 . At the appointed time this convention was held . Delegates were present from Tennessee , Alabama , and a number of other States . A plan of reorganization , previously prepared , was submitted to this convention and adopted . After the transaction of some further business , the convention adjourned , and the delegates returned home without having attracted any attention . At this convention the territory covered by the Klan was designated as " The Invisible Empire . ' ' This was subdivided into realms , ' ' coterminous with the boundaries of States . The " realms " were divided into " dominions , " corresponding to congressional districts ; the " dominions " into " provinces , " coterminous with counties ; and the " provinces " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers were assigned . Except in the case of the supreme officer , the duties of each were minutely specified . These officers were : The Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire and his ten Genii . The powers of this officer were almost autocratic . The Grand Dragon of the Realm and his eight Hydras . The Grand Titan of the Dominion and his six Furies . The Grand Giant of the Province and his four Goblins . The Grand Cyclops of the Den and his two Night Hawks . A Grand Monk . A Grand Scribe . A Grand Exchequer . A Grand Turk . A Grand Sentinel . One of the most important things done by this Nashville convention was to make a positive and emphatic statement of the principles of the order . It was in the following terms : " We recognize our relation to the United States Government ; the supremacy of the Constitution ; the constitutional laws thereof ; and the union of States thereunder . " If these men were plotting treason , it puzzles one to know why they should make such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the order . This statement was not intended for public circulation . It is now given to the public for the first time . Every man who was a Ku Klux really took an oath to support the Constitution of the United States . This Nashville convention also set forth the peculiar objects of the order , as follows : ( I ) To protect the weak , the innocent , and the defenseless from the indignities , wrongs , and outrages of the lawless , the violent , and the brutal ; to relieve the injured and the oppressed ; to succor the suffering , and especially the widows and orphans of Confederate soldiers . ( 2 ) To protect and defend the Constitution of the United States , and nil laws passed in conformity thereto , and to protect the States and people thereof from all invasion from any source whatever . ( 3 ) To aid and assist in the execution of all constitutional laws , and to protect the people from unlawful seizure , and from trial except by their peers in conformity to the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence of what we know from other sources to be the truth . Those who were attempting to direct the movements of the Klan were now principally concerned about devising such measures as would control the Klan itself and keep it within what they conceived to be safe limits . The majority had up to this time shown a fair appreciation of the responsibilities of their self-imposed task of preserving social order . But excesses had been committed , and it was foreseen and feared that , if such things continued or increased , the hostility of State and Federal governments would be kindled against the Klan , and active measures taken to suppress it . The hope was entertained that the legislation taken by the convention and the reorganization would not only enable the Klan to enact its role as regulators with greater success , but would // keep its members within the prescribed limits , and so guard against the contingencies referred to . They desired on the one hand to restrain and control their own members ; on the other , to correct evils and promote order in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this purpose the means and methods originally employed for amusement . They failed in both directions . How and why will be told presently . By the reorganization no material change was made in the methods of the Klan 's operations . Some of the old methods were modified , some new features were added . The essential features of mystery , secrecy , and grotesqueness were retained , and steps were taken with a view to deepening and intensifying the impressions already made upon the public mind . They attempted to push to the extreme limits of illustration the power of the mysterious over the minds of men . Henceforth they courted publicity as assiduously as they had formerly seemed to shun it . They appeared at different points at the same time , and always when and where they were the least expected . Devices were multiplied to deceive people in regard to their numbers and everything else , and to play upon the fears of the superstitious . As it was now the policy of the Klan to appear in public , an order was issued by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grand Giants of the Provinces for a general parade , in the capital town of each province , on the night of the 4th of July , 1867 . It will be sufficient for this narrative to describe that parade as witnessed by the citizens of Pulaski . On the morning of that day the citizens found the sidewalks thickly strewn with slips of paper bearing the printed words : " The Ku Klux will parade the streets tonight . " This announcement created great excitement . The people supposed that their curiosity , so long baffled , would now be gratified . They were confident that this parade would at least afford them the opportunity of learning who belonged to the Ku Klux Klan . Soon after nightfall the streets were lined with an expectant and excited throng of people . Many came from the surrounding country . The members of the Klan in the county left their homes in the afternoon and traveled alone or in squads of two or three , with their paraphernalia carefully concealed . If questioned , they answered that they were going to Pulaski @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assembled at designated points near the four main roads leading into the town . Here they donned their robes and disguises , and put covers of gaudy materials on their horses . A sky-rocket sent up from some point in the town was the signal to mount and move . The different companies met and joined each other on the public square in perfect silence ; the discipline appeared to be admirable . Not a word was spoken . Necessary orders were given by means of the whistles . In single file , in deathlike stillness , with funeral slowness , they marched and countermarched throughout the town . While the column was headed north on one street it was going south on another . By crossing over in opposite directions the lines were kept up in almost unbroken continuity . The effect was to create the impression of vast numbers . This marching and countermarching was kept up for about two hours , and the Klan departed as noiselessly as they came . The public were more than ever mystified . The efforts of the most curious to find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country was confident that he could identify the riders by the horses . But , as we have said , the horses were disguised as well as the riders . Determined not to be baffled , during a halt of the column he lifted the cover of a horse that was near him , and recognized his own steed and saddle , on which he had ridden into town . The town people were on the alert to see who of the young men of the town would be with the Ku Klux . All of them , almost without exception , were marked mingling freely and conspicuously with the spectators . Perhaps the greatest illusion produced was in regard to the numbers taking part in the parade . Reputable citizens were confident that the number was not less than three thousand . Others , whose imaginations were more e*isily wrought upon , were quite certain there were ten thousand . The truth is that the number of Ku Klux in the parade did not exceed four hundred . This delusion in regard to numbers prevailed wherever the Ku Klux appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-witness is worth in regard to anything which makes a deep impression on him by reason of its mysteriousness . The Klan had a large membership ; it exerted a vast and terrifying power ; but its influence was never at any time dependent on , or proportioned to , its membership It was in the mystery in which the comparatively few enshrouded themselves . It is an error to suppose that the entire male population of the South were Ku Klux , or even a majority of the people were privy to its secrets and in sympathy with its extremest measures . To many of them , perhaps to a majority , the Ku Klux Klan was as vague , impersonal , and mysterious as to the people of the North or // of England ; they did - do to this dayattribute to it great good . One or two incidents will illustrate the methods resorted to to play upon the superstitious fears of the negroes and others . At the parade in Pulaski , while the procession was passing a corner on which a negro man was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line , dismounted , and stretched out his bridle-rein toward the negro , as if he desired him to hold his horse . Not daring to refuse , the frightened African extended his hand to grasp the rein . As he did so , the Ku Klux took his own head from his shoulders and offered to place that also in the outstretched hand . The negro stood not upon the order of his going , but departed with a yell of terror . To this day he will tell you ; " He done it , suah , boss . I seed him do it . " The gown was fastened by a drawstring over the top of the wearer 's head . Over this was worn an artificial skull made of a large gourd or of pasteboard . This , with the hat , could be readily removed , and the man would then appear to be headless- . Such tricks gave rise to the belief- still prevalent among the negroes-that the Ku Klux could take themselves all to pieces whenever they wanted to . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bone or wood , with a wrist or handle long enough to be held in the hand , which was concealed by the sleeve of the gown . The possessor of one of these was invariably of a friendly turn , and offered to shake hands with all he met , with what effect may be readily imagined . A trick of frequent perpetration in the country was for a horseman , spectral and ghostly-looking , to stop before the cabin of some negro needing a wholesome impression and call for a bucket of water . If a dipper or gourd was brought it was declined , and the bucketful of water demanded . As if consumed by raging thirst , the horseman grasped it and pressed it to his lips . He held it there till every drop of the water was poured into a gum or oiled sack concealed beneath the Ku Klux robe . Then the empty bucket was returned to the amazed negro with the remark : " That 's good . It is the first drink of water I have had since I was killed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to future behavior made an impression not easily forgotten or likely to be disregarded . iv . THE DEcLINE . FOR a while after the reorganization of the Klan , those concerned for its welfare and right conduct congratulated themselves that all was now well . Closer organization and stricter official supervision had a restraining influence upon the members . Many things seemed to indicate that the future work of the Klan would be wholly good . These hopes were rudely shattered . Before long official supervision grew less rigid , or was less regarded . The membership was steadily increasing . Among those who were added were bad men who could not be - at least , were not - controlled . In the winter and spring of 1867 and i868 many things were done by members or professed members of the Klan which were the subject of universal regret and condemnation . In many ways the grave censure of those who had hitherto been its friends was evoked against the Klan , and occasion was given its enemies to petition for the intervention of the Government to suppress it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We must now trace the causes which wrought the decay and downfall of the " Invisible Empire . " Men of the character of the majority of those who composed this Klan do not disregard their own professed principles and violate self-assumed obligations carelessly . To see men who were just now the advocates of law and order defying the one and destroying the other , is a sight singular enough to elicit inquiry as to the causes that wrought the change . The transformation of the Ku Klux Klan from a band of regulators , honestly , but in a mistaken way , trying to preserve peace and order , into the body of desperate men who in 1869 convulsed the country by deeds of violence , and set at defiance the mandates of both State and Federal governments , is greater than the transformation which we have already traced . In both cases there were ' causes adequate to the results produced ; causes from which these results followed naturally and almost necessarily , and which have never been fully and fairly followed out . They may be classed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 2 ) misapprehension of the nature and objects of the order by those not members of it ; ( . * ) unwise and over-severe legislation . As has already been pointed out , the order contained within itselfi , by reason of its purpose and methods , sources of weakness . The devices by which the Klan deceived outsiders enabled all who were so disposed , even its own members , to practice deception upon the Klan itself . It placed in the hands of its members facilities for doing deeds of violence for the gratification of innate deviltry or personal enmity , and for having them credited to the Klan . To evilly disposed men membership in the Klan was an inducement to wrong-doing ; in fact , it presented to all men a dangerous temptation . In // certain contingencies , at any time likely to arise , it required a considerable amount of moral robustness to withstand this temptation . Many did not withstand it , and deeds of violence were done by men who were Ku Klux , but who at the time were acting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not under its orders ; and , because these men were Ku Klux , the Klan had to bear the odium of their misdeeds . In addition to this , the very class which the Klan proposed to hold in check and awe into good behavior , after a while became wholly unmanageable . Those who had formerly committed depredations to be laid to the charge of the poor negroes now assumed the guise of Ku Klux , and returned to their old ways with renewed ardor . In some cases even the negroes played Ku Klux . Outrages were committed by masked men in regions far remote from any Ku Klux organization . The fact that these persons took pains to declare that they were Ku Klux was evidence that they were not . In this way it came about that all the disorder prevailing in the country was charged upon the Ku Klux . The Klan had no way in which to refute or disprove the charge . They felt that it was hard to be charged with violence of which they were innocent . At the same time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this should be the case . They had assumed the office of regulators . It was therefore due society , due the Government which so far had not molested them , that they should at least not afford the lawless class facilities for the commission of excesses greater than any they had hitherto indulged in ; and , above all , that they should restrain their own members from lawlessness . The Klan felt all this ; and in its efforts to relieve itself of the stigma thus incurred , it acted in some cases against the offending parties with a severity well merited no doubt , but unjustifiable . As is frequently the case , they were carried beyond the limits of prudence and right by a hot zeal for self-vindication against unjust aspersions . They thought the charge of wrong was unfairly brought against them . They did worse wrong than that charged to clear themselves of the charge . The Klan , from the first , shrouded itself in deepest mystery , and out of this grew trouble not at first apprehended . They wished people not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result was that the Klan and its objects were wholly misunderstood and misinterpreted . Many who joined the Klan , and many who Slid not , were certain that it contemplated some mission far more important than its overt acts gave evidence of . Some were sure it meant trea son and revolution . 1'he negroes , and the whites whose consciences made them the subjects of guilty fears , were sure it boded no good to them . When the first impressions of awe and terror to some extent wore oft ; a feeling of intense hostility toward the Ku Klux followed . This feeling was all the more bitter because founded , not on overt acts which the Ku Klux had done , but on vague fears and surmises as to what they intended to do . Those who entertained such fears were in some cases impelled by them to become the aggressors . They attacked the KuKlux before receiving from them any provocation . The negroes formed organizations of a military character , and drilled by night . These organizations had for their avowed purpose " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On several occasions the Klan was fired into . The effect of such attacks was to provoke counter hostility from the Klan ; and so there was irritation and counter-irritation , till the state of things became little short of open warfare . In some respects it was worse ; the parties wholly misunderstood each other . Each party felt that its cause was the just one ; each justified the deed hy the provocation . The Ku Klux , intending wrong , as they believed , to no one , were aggrieved that acts which they had not done should be charged to them ; and they felt outraged that they should be molested and assaulted . The other party , satisfied that they were acting in selfdefense , felt fully justified in assaulting them . And so each party goaded the other from one degree of lawlessness to another . The following extracts from a General Order of the Grand Dragon of the Realm of Tennessee will illustrate the operation of both these causes . It was issued in the fall of the year i868 . It shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still professed , and it also shows hoW it was being forced away from them : " HEAD-QUARTERS REALM No. i . " DREADFUL ERA , BLACK EPOCH , DREADFUL HOUR .. " GENERAL ORDER No. i . " Whereas , information of an RuthentiC character has . reached these head-quarters that the blacks in the counties of Marshall , Maury , Giles , and Lawrence are organized into military companies , with the avowed determination to make war upon and exterminate the Ku Klux Klan , said blacks are hereby solemnly warned and ordered to desist from further action in such organizations , if they exist . " The G. D. Grand Dragon regrets the necessity* of such an order . But this Klan shall not be outraged and interfered with by lawless negroes and meaner white men , who do not and never have understood our purposes . " In the first place this Klan is not an institution of violence , lawlessness , and cruelty ; it is not lawless ; . // / it is not aggressive ; it is not military ; it is not revolutionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a protective organization ; it proposes to execute law instead of resisting it , and to protect all good men , whether white or black , from the outrages and atrocities of bad men of both colors , who have been for the past three years a terror to society , and an injury to us all . " The blacks seem to be impressed with the belief that this Klan is especially their enemy . We are not the enemy of the blacks , as long as they behave themselves , make no threats upon us , and do not attack or interfere with us . " But if they make war upon us , they must abide the awful retributions that will follow . " This Klan , while in its peaceful movements and disturbing no one , has been fired into three times . This will not be endured any longer ; and if it occurs again , and the parties be discovered , a remorseless vengeance will be wreaked upon them . " We reiterate that we are for peace and law and order . No man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political sentiments . This Klan is not a political party ; it is not a military party ; it is a protective organization , and will never use violence except in resisting violence . " Outrages have been perpetrated by irresponsible parties in the name of this Klan . Should such parties be apprehended , they will be dealt with in a manner to insure us future exemption from such imposition . These impostors have , in some instances , whipped negroes . This is wrong ! Wrong ! It is denounced by this Klan as it must be by all good and humane men . " The Klan now , as in the past , is prohibited from doing such things . We are striving to protect all good , peaceful , well-disposed , and law-abiding men , whether white or black . " The G. D. deems this order due to the public , due to the Klan , and due to those who are misguided and misinformed . " We therefore request that all newspapers who are friendly to law , and peace , and the public welfare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the G. D. , Realm No . I. " By the Grand Scribe . " Granting that this order expressed the principles which the Klan was honestly trying to maintain , it also illustrates how it was driven to violate them by the very earnestness and vehemence with which they attempted to maintain them . If it is asked why , under these embarrassing circumstances , the Klan did not disband and close its operations , the answer is plain . The members persuaded themselves that there was now more reason than ever for the Klan 's existence . They felt that they ought not to abandon their important and needful work because they encountered unforeseen difficulties in accomplishing it . It is an illustration of the fatuity which sometimes marks the lives of men , that they did not perceive that these evils grew out of their own methods , and must continue and increase while the Klan existed . Men are not always wise . They frequently persist in a course which , to others differently situated , appears not less absurd than wicked . We can not apologize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But justice requires that a fair and truthful statement be made of the embarrassments and temptations which surrounded them . Matters grew worse and worse , till it was imperatively necessary for the State authorities to interfere . There was a general feeling that legislation on the subject was necessary . But few were prepared to expect such legislation as that enacted by the famous - or infamous , as the reader chooses - Legislature called together by Governor Brownlow in September , i868 . Tennessee was the first State to pass an anti-Ku Klux statute . In September , i868 , Governor Brownlow called the Legislature together in extra session to devise measures for the suppression of the order . A relentless and bloody statute was passed ; and to enforce it the Governor was authorized , if he deemed it necessary , to declare martial law on the infected counties and to call out troops . The law passed , and the method of enforcing it increased rather than quieted disorder . The statute is long , and , as a whole , not worth quoting . Its leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or connection with the Ku Klux a fine of five hundred dollars and imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than five years ; and " shall be rendered infamous . " ( 2 ) Persons impaneled for jury service were required to answer under oath whether they were obnoxious to the first section of the act . ( * ) Prosecuting attorneys and grand jurors were directed to summon persons whom they suspected " or had cause to suspect , " and to force them to testify what they knew of the Ku Klux . If those so summoned failed to appear or refused to testify , the penalty was a fine of five hundred dollars . ( 4 ) Every " inhabitant " of the State was constituted an officer extraordinary , with power " to arrest without process " any one known or suspected to be a Ku Klux. ( 5 ) To feed , lodge , entertain , or conceal a Ku Klux exposed the offender to infamy , a fine of five hundred dollars , and imprisonment for five years . ( 6 ) It was made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 7 ) There was but one clause in the law which bears the semblance of mercy . Its provisions are so odious as to be shocking . The one way by which a man could relieve himself of liability to this law was by turning informer . As additional inducement to do this a reward of half the fine was offered . ( 8 ) But , most remarkable of all , the statute was made penal against offenses committed previous to its passage . The last section of it reads : " Nothing herein contained shall be so construed as to prevent or exempt any person heretofore guilty of any of the offenses herein contained from prosecutions under the law as it now stands . " There were hundreds of men in the Klan who were not law-breakers . There had been no law against association with the Ku Klux . They had had no personal participation in the excesses in which some of the Klan had indulged . They were ready to admit that the movement had proven to be injudicious . Good had been done , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a legal command to sever their connection with the Ku Klux and desist from further operations . But when these men were declared infamous , made liable to fine and imprisonment , and exposed to arrest " without process " by any one who chose to inform against them , the effect was to drive them to absolute desperation . In some sections of the State a reign of terror followed the passage of this act . The Ku Klux were now almost in the attitude of men fighting for life and liberty . There was no hope in submission except on terms which to men of honor were more hateful than death . V. DISBANDMENT . ON the 20th of February , 1869 , Governor Brownlow resigned his position as Governor to take the seat in the United States Senate to which he had been elected . The last paper to which he affixed his signature as Governor of Tennessee proclaimed martial law in certain counties , and ordered troops to be sent thither . This proclamation was dated February 20 , 1869 . In a few days it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Invisible Empire " to his subjects . It recited the legislation directed against the Klan , and stated that the order had now in large measure accomplished the objects of its existence . At a time when the civil law afforded inadequate protection to life and property , when robbery and lawlessness of every description were unrebuked , when all the better elements of society were in constant dread for the safety of their property , persons , and families , the Klan had afforded protection and security to many firesides , and in many ways contributed to the public welfare . But , greatly to the regret of all good citizens , he further said , some members of the Klan had violated positive orders ; others , under the name and disguises of the organization , had assumed to do acts of violence , for which the Klan was held responsible . The Grand Wizard had been invested with the power to determine questions of paramount importance to the interests of the order . Therefore , in the exercise of that power , the Grand Wizard declared that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolved and disbanded . Members were directed to burn or destroy all regalia and paraphernalia of every description , and to desist from any further assemblies or acts as Ku Klux . They were told , further , that they would continue in the future , as heretofore , to assist all good people of the land in maintaining and upholding the civil laws , and in putting down lawlessness . This proclamation was directed to all Realms , Dominions , Provinces , and Dens in " the Empire . " It may be that there were portions of the Empire never reached by it . The Grand Wizard was a citizen of Tennessee ; and as no paper in that State could publish the order , because of the stringent law against such publication , there was no way in which the proclamation could be fully distributed . Where it was promulgated , obedience to it was prompt and implicit . But whether obeyed or not , this proclamation terminated the Klan 's organized existence as decisively as General Lee 's last general order , on the morning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northern Virginia . When the office of Grand Wizard was created and its duties defined , it was explicitly provided that he should have " the power to determine questions of paramount importance , and his decision shall be final . " To continue the organization or to disband it was such a question . He decided in favor of disbanding . Therefore , the Ku Klux Klan had no organized existence after March , 1869 . The report of the Congressional Investigating Committee contains a mass of very disreputable history , which belongs to a later date , and is attributed to the Klan , but not justly so . These persons were acting in the name of the Klan and under its disguises , but not by its authority . They were acting on their own responsibility . Thus lived , so died , this strange order . Its birth was an accident ; its growth was a comedy , its death a tragedy . It owed its existence wholly to the anomalous condition of social and civil affairs in the South during the years immediately succeeding the unfortunate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gray fell , martyrs to their convictions . There never was , before or since , a period of our history when such an order could have lived . May there never be again ! D. L. kfilson.
