MR . GLADSTONE . ON the 29th of December last Mr. Gladstone reached his seventieth year , immediately after performing , during a midwinter political tour of Scotland , a series of physical and intellectual feats-speeches which few men of forty could have attempted . The admiration of his friends has never been so fervent , the hostility.s-of his opponents never so bitter , the astonishment of all at his energy and vehemence never so profound , as they were during the general election which came three months later , and whose echoes are just dying away from us in England . Although not nominally the leader of his party in that great struggle , he was its real hero , and was called by the voice of the nation to resume his place as head of the new Liberal ministry . He is now again the practical ruler of England , exercising a personal influence even wider than that which the highest office carries with it , his zeal unabated , his faculties showing no trace of decay , his smallest deeds and words watched with eager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by those foreign countries also whose political relations to one another his action may so much affect . The moment is therefore a seasonable one for endeavoring to convey to American readers some more precise impressions than the newspapers have given them regarding the character and powers of one who has long been the foremost figure in En*lish public life , and is perhaps , taking him all in all , the most remarkable man that the English-speaking race has produced in this century . Although the object of this article is rather to sketch Mr. Gladstone 's character and position than to write his biography , still some notice of the facts of his life must be prefixed to explain how he has come to be what he is . His father was a Scotch merchant , a native of Leith , but settled at Liverpool , where he had established a great West Indian house ; his mother , a Miss Robertson from Din gwall , a pretty little town on the far north-east coast of Scotland . In 1809 , the year of his birth , England was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Toryism supreme at home , and confirmed its dominion down till 1832 . All his early years were spent in the midst of Tory influences . His father , though personally a follower of Canning , voted for nine years in Parliament on the Tory side . Of all the great towns of England , Liverpool was the one in which Toryism then was and has till now continued to be strongest . Eton , where young Gladstone was educated for five years , was of course a Tory school , whose traditions as well as the sentiments of its teachers hound it closely to the Church of England , the monarchy , and the aristocracy . At the age of eighteen , William Gladstone proceeded to the University of Oxford and became a member of Christ Church , the largest of the colleges , and the one then most frequented by young men of rank and wealth . A great university ought to be a home not only of learning and science but also of free thought and enlightenment ,  --  a place where the first principles of statesmanship as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of students are encouraged to think for themselves , and are stimulated by the speculations of their teachers . But the University of Oxford was in those days-for it has changed wonderfully in the fifty years that have since elapsed  --  the stronghold of bigotry and prejudice . Nearly all its tutors and professors were clergymen of the Established Church , who looked upon Dissent as a sin , and who repelled with the contempt that is born of ignorance the movements of theological and critical inquiry which had been going on in the continent of Europe , and were beginning to be felt even in England . They had opposed the admission of Roman Catholics and Non-conformists to political rights . They clung to the doctrine of the divine right of kings , and lamented the overthrow of the Bourbons in France . They had little sympathy even for the efforts which Wilberforce , Clarkson , Brougham and others were making for the emancipation of the negroes in the West Indies . They knew comparatively little of the world beyond their own cloisters , but whenever an opportunity arose , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy of oppression and the retention of those gross political inequalities and social abuses from which England was soon afterward delivered by a reformed Parliament . That there were good men , as well as learned and able men , among // them need hardly be said . But they were as ill-fitted as any learned men could be to train the youth of a country for the duties of public life . These , however , were the men who had the forming of Mr. Gladstone 's mind . He threw himself with characteristic eagerness into the studies of the place , and soon became famous , not only as the best speaker at the university debating society ( the Union ) , which has produced so many orators , but also as the most remarkable undergraduate of his generation . In the university examinations he gained the highest honors , both in classics ( including ancient philosophy and history ) and in mathematics . Some of his few surviving contemporaries still tell how , when he was examined viva voce for his degree , an immense throng gathered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions on the minutest details of Herodotus only brought out his knowledge more fully ; how the excitement reached its climax when the examiner , after testing his mastery of some point of theology , said : " We will now leave that part of the subject , " and was for passing on to something else , when the candidate , carried away by his interest in the subject , answered : " No , sir ; if you please , we will not leave it yet " ; and began to pour forth a fresh stream of learning and argument . From Oxford , Mr. Gladstone carried away not only a strong attachment ( which the changes of half a century have not weakened ) to the University and the Church of England , but also a passionate love of ancient literature , especially of the poetry of Greece , and a taste for the history of Christian theology , which was not so common among laymen in those days as it has since become , and which was , of course , deeply tinged by the Anglo-Catholic views @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tractarian school . Both by its external aspect and through the studies which it then exclusively cultivated , the University of Oxford was specially fitted to stimulate the imagination of a young and ardent mind , to dispose him to regard all questions from their imaginative and emotional side . This was a great service to render , especially to Englishmen , whose besetting fault it is to look at things too much in their practical aspect , losing sight of their larger historical relations . But against this service is to be set the narrow and unreal view of the modern world which Oxford strove to impress upon her children . So far appreciating the great intellectual forces which had produced the reformation , and had been at work in politics since the beginning of the American revolution , she repelled and denounced them , seeking to represent the aristocratic system of English society and the - haughty exclusiveness of the English Established Church , as the two citadels of England 's greatness . These were the influences under which Mr. Gladstone started on the voyage of life . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them contemporaries , and some of them intimate friends of his own . Among them may be named Sidney Herbert , Samuel Wilberforce ( afterward famous as Bishop of Oxford and of Winchester ) , Cardwell , Hamilton ( afterward Bishop of Salisbury ) , Milnes Gaskell , Lord Lincoln ( afterward Duke of Newcastle ) , R. Phillimore and George Anthony Denison . Their courses in after life have diverged widely , but for many years they kept together , and continued powerfully to affect one another 's conduct and ideas . In December , 1832 , when he was only twenty-three years of age , Mr. Gladstone entered the House of Commons as member for Newark , a borough in which the Duke of Newcastle , father of one of his college friends , exercised a predominant influence . He attached himself to the Conservative party , then led by Sir Robert Peel , who so quickly discovered his powers that within two years he was admitted to office as a Junior Lord of the Treasury . He lost this place when the ministry fdl , in 1835 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward as president , of the Board of Trade , when Sir Robert Peel returned to power , in 1841 . His reputation , high even when he left Oxford , had been steadily rising during these years . But the first great piece of work by which his capacities were tested was the revised tariff of customs duties scheme , which he prepared and carried through the House of Commons in 1842 , showing then , already , at thirtythree years of age , that mastery of finance and figures , that extraordinary fertility of resource in debate , which were to make him the greatest Chancellor of the Exchequer that England has yet seen . Led by the duties of his office to deal with commercial questions , it was natural that he should be one of the first of the Conservative party who was converted to the doctrines of free trade , and that he should have borne a considerable part in accelerating and confirming // // the conversion of his leader . This change of opinion , however , cost him his place in Parliament . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself bound in conscience to resign his seat at Newark ; and was left out of the House of Commons for more than a year , till returned as member for the University of Oxford . Having been separated from the Conservative party by his adoption of free trade , Mr. Gladstone , like the rest of Sir Robert Peel 's school , remained in opposition until , in 1852 , a coalition ministry was formed under Lord Aberdeen , which included some Liberals and some Peelites ; nor did he begin to be reckoned as a Liberal till , in 1859 , he joined Lord Palmerston 's second government . Two years before he had shown , by his strenuous opposition to the Divorce Bill , how strong a hold his original ecclesiastical views still retained on him . It would , of course , have been greatly to his own interest to have remained a Conservative , for in the dearth of administrative and oratorical power from which that party then suffered he must inevitably have become their leader in the House of Commons . However , the constant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always more and more away from the system of doctrines and prejudices with which he had started . His old views on the principles of commercial policy were the first to go ; then , but more slowly , he was led to modify his opinions on church questions . Finally , by the publication in i8*o of the letter on Neapolitan prisons , in which he attacked the government of King Ferdinand of Naples , he became known as a warm sympathizer with the efforts of the Italian patriotic party to expel domestic and foreign tyrants from the soil of Italy . It was this , more than anything else , which gained for him the confidence of English Radicals , and formed a tie between him and a statesman in many respects so unlike him as was Lord Palmerston . From 1859 to i866 , he produced , as Chancellor of the Exchequer , a series of budgets which eclipsed all the efforts of previous English financiers . Tax after tax was remitted ; the customs duties were greatly simplified ; the price of many of the necessaries of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and peace , when comparatively few great party struggles took place , the great oratorical sensation of the year was usually his financial statement , for he possessed the rare art of making figures pictorial . The large and luminous views which he presented VOL . XXI. - 9. of the movements of English commerce and the influence of legislation upon them , made these speeches not only fascinating to the listeners , but studies of permanent value in economic science . He had now risen to be confessedly the first debater in Parliament . Lord Palmerston was more skillful as a tactician ; Mr. Bright was perhaps more impressive and imaginative in his highest flights ; Mr. Disraeli could put a finer edge on his rankling epigrams ; but Mr. Gladstone was above them all in the amazing readiness , as well as power , with which he could handle every subject that came up ; he was quicker at understanding and mastering its difficulties , more ingenious in argument , more lucid in exposition . It was , therefore , a matter of course that when Lord Palmerston died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commons in LomA Russell 's ministry . After its defeat , in i866 , he led the opposition till , in i868 , he resumed office as Prime Minister . By this time his action on the two prominent questions of Parliamentarv reform and the disestablishment of the Episcopalian Church in Ireland had made him the favorite of the more advanced section of the Liberal party , while in the same measure they had gained for him the fear and hatred of the Tories and the scarcely concealed susl ) icion of a certain part of the more aristocratic , or ( as it is sometimes called ) the Whig division of the Liberals . The great general election of i868 , though nominally fought on the question of Irish disestablishment , was in reality a trial of personal popularity between him and Mr. Disraeli . it gave Mr. Gladstone an enormous majority , by whose aid he was able to carry several very sweeping measures , among them the disestablishment of the Established Church in Ireland , the resettlement of the Irish land laws , the creation of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform of a similar system in Scotland ; the abolition of purchase , with other concomitant reforms , in the army ; the reform and consolidation of the English superior courts of law and equity . A reaction , strengthened by the hostility of several important classes who had been affected by these changes , or thought themselves threatened by the reforming zeal of the ministry , was not long in following . At the election of 1874 a Conservative majority was returned , and Mr. Gladstone resigned office . A year later he retired from the leadership of the Liberal party , announcing his wish to take // but little share thenceforth in party struggles . This intention , however , yielded to the displeasure and alarm with which the conduct of Lord Beaconsfield 's government in the affairs of the East inspired him in 1876 . From that time on , though he steadily refused to resume the position of leader , he bore a foremost part in assailing the policy of Lord Heaconsfield 's government in Turkey an ( l Afghanistan , as well as their management of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greatest political force in England . Political feeling there ran higher ( luring the late general election than it had done for many years before . It was around his name chiefly that the fight raged . Most of the speeches delivered and articles written on the Tory side were onslaughts upon him . Now , and for a long time past , every political discussion at a dinner-table or in a club smoking-room ends by becoming , if it has not begun by being , a ( discussion of his motives and character . Among the rank and file of the Liberals , and especially among the Dissenters , the more advanced part of the High Church section of the Anglican clergy , and the working classes , he kindles such an enthusiasm as no English statesman has kindled before-an enthusiasm such as is generally reserved for conquering heroes like Nelson or Garibaldi . The hatred of the opl ) osite party is correspondingly bitter , and is often expressed with the ferocity that springs from fear . Nor is it confined to mere politicians ; it embraces the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land-owners , and in London ( though not equally in the rest of the country ) most of the professional and literary men . " Well , but , " some one may remark , " of course , whenever party spirit is hot , hard things are said about the party leaders on both sides . " True enough . But the peculiarity of the present case is that Mr. Gladstone 's personality is just what makes party feeling so hot . It is not because men are already excited that he is lauded and reviled ; it is because he rouses such feelings of antagonism and admiration that their excitement has risen so high . This sketch does not aim at discussing the burning questions of English politics , nor at criticising Mr. Gladstone as a politician . What it proposes is to convey to rea ( lers beyond the Atlantic some notion of him as a man , a famous man , of their own blood and speech . But as this blaze of passion which surrounds him is one of the most curious problems which his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second such problem is suggested by the remarkable change in his political position . He began life as a high Tory . He is now , though not himself what is called a Radical , yet certainly the favorite of the radical party . How has such a transformation been wrought ? It is not due to any selfish ambition , for even his worst enemies have never suggested that he has been governed by self-interest ; and he would indeed have found it far easier to rise to supremacy in the ranks of his old party than in those of his present one . Nor is it as though he were of a changeable temper . On the contrary , he has clung , and still clings with a singular fidelity , to some of his earliest ecclesiastical views , and occasionally finds them throw him out of harmony with the vast majority of his party . And a third problem which we must try to solve is this : How comes it that with such gifts he has made such mistakes ? - that with such wonderful oratorical power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assembly where he has sat for nearly fifty years ? - that with such administrative knowledge and skill he is so much distrusted by the very class in the midst of whom his life has been spent ? These are questions which can be answered only by getting a distinct iml ) ression of his character and nature as a whole . It is hard to separate them from his political position , it is still harder not to seem to be influenced by political bias . But American readers are more likely than Englishmen could be at this crisis to give a writer credit for honestly trying to be dispassionate , for seeking to discover and appreciate the true outlines of the human figure under the armor and plumes of the party leader . Mr. Gladstone 's mind is a very peculiar one , which must have made his career peculiar , in whatever country or under whatever conditions he had been started to run it . But that career has been rendered more peculiar by two accidents , as one may call them , whose importance has been seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been called to deal with and govern Englishmen . He began life with a set of political and religious opinions which did not suit his character . , Education had impressed them so deeply that they continue to affect him still . But his intellect has struggled to throw them off . Some have disappeared , some have been turned in new directions , // some stand unshaken side by side with opinions of a very different type . Despite affinity of blood , despite the influences of a common literature and longcontinued social intercourse , the Scottish mind remains , in many points , very unlike the English . The English are a Low-German people , modified , no doubt , by Celtic , Danish and Norman-French influences , but still in the main Low-German . The Scotch are sprung from a mixture of Teutonic ( chiefly Scandinavian ) with Celtic blood , and the Celtic element , which has largely tinged their intellect , shows itself even more strongly in the emotional part of their character . They are more logical than the English , more interested by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and more disposed to trust to them and carry them out consistently . Their minds are not only more active , but more active in a speculative direction , more ready to surrender themselves to a theory , whatever its consequences . And on the emotional side they are more eager , ardent , excitable , than their Southern neighbors , more liable to fits of enthusiasm , with a greater tendency to fanaticism , superstition , and all the influences which come from or look to an unseen world . The beauties or terrors of nature affect them more powerfully. * In mixed races , combinations of apparently opposite qualities are not uncommon . The Scotch are , at the same time , logical and imaginative . With their proverbial caution they unite ( those who deal with Scotch merchants know it ) a singular kind of audacity . To say this is not to say that they are superior either in intellectual  --  or moral force to the English . On the contrary , the Scottish mind , at its best , has never risen so high as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Bacon , or Locke , or Newton , or Darwin . And the Scotch are comparatively deficient in some of the most useful qualities of the English character-its moderation , its breadth , its balance , its firm grasp of facts in the concrete , its healthy worldliness . One need not stop to appraise the value of the two types ; it is enough to indicate their fundamental difference  --  a difference which can bestbe understood by those who have lived amongboth nations , but which may also be discerned by the students of their respective histories . Compare , for instance , the Reformation in England in the sixteenth century with the same movement in Scotland . The Roman Catholic Church was stronger in Scotland , yet her destruction was far more sudden , far more complete , accompanied by a far hotter fire of national enthusiasm . The compromises which were accepted in England , and have been maintained there till our own time , were rejected by the more thorough-going and passionate spirit of the Scottish reformers . So it was with the second outburst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since . Even at this day , the temper with which the two nations view political problems , and throw themselves into political contests , is widely different . Now , Mr. Gladstone is a Scotchman on both his father 's and mother 's side , and half a Highland ( that is to say , a Celtic ) Scotchman . He is ( with the insignificant exception of Lord Bute , who was a mere royal favorite ) , the first Prime Minister of England who has come from the northern half of the island . He is , indeed , the first Scotchman , except Brougham , who has ever played a leading part in English politics . Bolingbroke , Walpole , Pulteney , Chatham , Lord North , Charles James Fox , William Pitt , Lord Liverpool , Canning , Lord Grey , Lord Althorp , Lord Melbourne , Sir Robert Peel , Lord Derby , were all of them Englishmen by blood . The Duke of Wellington and Lord Palmerston , though nominally Irish , were really Englishmen . Burke was an Irishman , and Burke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Gladstone ) strikingly illustrates some of the features of the Celtic character . This Scottish strain in Mr. Gladstone has had two remarkable effects . It has kept him from ever quite understanding and being in full sympathy with the ordinary English character , and it has prevented the English from ever quite understanding him . It is not merely because Scotland is Liberal that he is welcomed there with such transports of enthusiasm . It is because , in spite of the contrast between his High Churchism and their Presbyterianism , the Scotch enter into and enjoy his modes of thinking and feeling in a way which Englishmen , and especially Englishmen of the upper class , do not and can not . He is not a typical , Scotchman ; but his intellect belongs so much more to the Scottish than to the English type that the average educated Englishman is perplexed , even frightened , by features he can not account for because * This has been acutely remarked of Scottish poets by Mr. Stopford Brooke , in his history of English literature . // he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how this comes out . The distinguishing note of Mr. Gladstone 's nature is the combination in it of extraordinary intellectual activity with extraordinary emotional warmth . For fifty years he has given himself no rest . When he is not studying , he is talking or writing , and that not merely upon public affairs , but upon theology , history , scholarship , art or social topics . His apprehension is wonderfully quick . Long training enables him to seize in a moment the salient points of a question ; his mind falls to work upon them , spins a web of argument , clothes the argument with words-words that come fast as the snow-flakes driven before a storm . While he is piercing to the heart of a subject he is also working all around it , discovering a multitude of reasons for and against each of the views which , in succession , presents itself-a string of limitations and qualifications under which each of the propositions he accepts must be stated . This ingenuity or fertility of mind gives his speeches and writings an air of complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtlety . But he is not unduly subtle ,  - -  that is to say , addicted to fine distinctions of thought . In one of his pieces of sustained argument each sentence or paragraph is sufficiently clear : it is the perspective of the whole which confuses the mind of a listener who can not recollect the relation which all these windings and turnings and by-paths bear to the main direction of the track along which he is being led . Together with this manifoldness of mind , he has , like most men whose intellectual interests are keen , a fondness for abstract principles and a passion for working them logically out . Where other men see only scattered facts he discerns a principle , enjoys it , follows it boldly . In a person with a less wide experience of the world and a less complete mastery of facts , this tendency would I ) e dangerous . Even he is sometimes led by it to discern a principle where none discernible by other eyes exists , to lay upon a minor principle more than it will bear , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his audience or his party are prepared to follow . Still it is a splendid faculty , the sure index of a penetrating intellect , a weapon with which , when wisely used , brilliant execution can be done in debate . Now let us seehow these powers of thought are wielded by his emotional nature . Active , marvelously active , as his intelligence is , it is not so remarkable as is the intensity of feeling which he throws into everything he does . He is all aglow , and always aglow . Any one meeting him in company , or hearing him speak for the first time , would think that the subject he might happen to be descanting on was one which had been uppermost in his thoughts for years , such is the earnestness of his manner . When the same person heard him again and again equally fervent upon other subjects , he would naturally take this fervor for a mere oratorical habit or device . At last our observer would perceive that it is neither , but the spontaneous expression of a nature which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has such a reservoir of force behind as never to suffer from this continual drain . It is this power of concentration , of being wholly absorbed by what is for the moment before him , that is perhaps the main source of his effectiveness . Nearly all great men have this gift ; it is not so much a sign as a cause of their greatness . Some , however , exercise it , so to speak , consciously and deliberately . Being blessed with cold hearts or blunt feelings , they turn on the full stream of their power as a mere matter of business . To do so is , as it was with Napoleon , merely an expression of their remorseless will , which controls their own intellectual resources no less completely than it does everything else . But with Mr. Gladstone , strenuous as his volitions are , it is rather emotion , and her sister , imagination , that intensify and spur the action of the intellect . To him principles do not remain abstractions ; they are realized in form ; they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he passes swiftly from thinking a proposition true or false to loving and hating it , embracing it as noble or condemning it as wicked . For his feelings are mated with a keen moral sensitiveness . Tyranny , cruelty , falsehood excite his indignation . Even those vainglorious vauntings of themselves and misrepresentations of their opponents which are the stock-in-trade of ordinary politicians , and which most people get accustomed to discount , seem to him nothing short of wicked . With all his love for Greek literature and admiration of the Greek religion , no one is less of a Greek in temperament . The strife of good and evil is always before his eyes . He is a Puritan in his sense of duty , in the scrupulousness of his own conscience , in his judgment of other men 's words and deeds . This moral seriousness gives immense weight // to his opinion , as well as a sustained eleyation to his thought and style . But some of its results are unfortunate . It has unduly repressed his natural flow of humor . Not that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his critics will not allow it to him . He can enjoy a joke , and often makes one in private . In public he rarely does , and then in rather too grave a fashion . Now , the humorous view of things is not only sometimes the truest view , but it relieves a man from that extreme tension in which Mr. Gladstone appears to live , and which , leading him to expect too high a standard of virtue from the men among whom he is cast , makes him somewhat over-strict in marking their faults and follies . Such activity as his needs great physical strength to support it ; and his physical powers , both of exertion and of endurance , would be remarkable even in a person who had nothing else to distinguish him . He can labor all day at his desk or speak for three hours at a stretch without exhaustion . He is a vigorous pedestrian , born before Alpine climbing came into fashion , but with legs approved by many a long day 's tramp over wild Scottish mountains . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting or racing , the favorite amusements of the English upper class-he is , or at least has in maturer life become , characteristically indifferent . Tree-felling , a laborious exercise in which he has made himself skillful , is almost his only outdoor recreation . His electoral campaign in Scotland last November gave extraordinary proof of the strength of his constitution , for it was conducted in bitter winter weather , and with scarcely an interval of rest between cold journeys and long speeches . Let us now see what these capacities and tendencies have made Mr. Gladstone as an orator , a writer , and a statesman . The man is more interesting than any of the parts he has been called to play ; but we come to understand the man better by seeing how he shapes and molds these parts . As an orator , his conspicuous merits , besides his striking countenance , dignified action , and a voice full , rich and admirably modulated , are fertility and readiness . He seems to have always at command an inexhaustible store of ideas , reasons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deal with . Of all great English speakers , probably no one , not even William Pitt , has been so independent of preparation . Even Fox , swift and rushing as he was , was great only in reply , when his feelings were heated by the atmosphere of battle , whereas Mr. Gladstone is just as animated and forcible in an opening , or in a purely ornamental and uncontentious harangue , as in the midst of parliamentary strife . Of the many anecdotes that are current illustrating his amazing power of rising to an occasion , one may be given which has the merit of being true . On the afternoon when he was to make an important motion in the House of Commons , a friend , happening to call on him between two and three oclock , found him just sitting down to make some notes of the coming speech . He laid aside his pen and talked for a while , then jotted down a few heads on paper , went down to the House before four o'clock , found himself drawn into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to repel so many questions and attacks that it was past six before he rose to make the great speech . He then ( liscovered that , as he had left his eye-glasses at home , his notes were practically useless , put them quietly back into his coat pocket , and delivered with no aid to his memory , and upon that one hour 's preparation , a powerful argument interspersed with passages of wonderful passion and pathos , which lasted for three hours , and will always rank among his finest efforts. * These qualities have made him by far the greatest parliamentary debater ( using the word in its strict sense ) of the present generation . No one can deal with complicated facts , can expound his own case , and refute his adversaries , with anything like the same ease , clearness , force . On the other hand , this very facility prevents him from often rising to the highest summits of eloquence . In speaking , as in everything else , time and pains are indispensable to the production of the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than three or four absolutely perfect sentences at a time . Hence , though his good work is far greater in quantity than that of Edmund Burke or Macaulay or John Bright , there are few among his speeches which can be put in comparison with their best performances . Even his fertility is a snare , for it makes abundance pass into super- * A very acute ( medical ) observer once remarked to the writer that nothing struck him so much in Mr. Gladstone 's oratory as his power of thinking ahead while he Was actually speaking . " When I look into his deep brown eye , " he said , " I seem to see going on in his brain the gathering of thoughts and polishing of sentences which will not descend to his lips for ten minutes to come . " // abundance . He often gives his hearers more than they want or the occasion requires , is too anxious to pour out his whole mind , to present his view under all its restrictions and qualifications , when two or three plain reasons leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is hardly less dangerous in oratory than in literature to appear to be exhaustive . Finally , he has made his eloquence too cheap , partly from the wide range of his interests , partly from a sort of noble simplicity which scorns the devices on which most men rely for success . He either has not perceived or has not condescended to act on the maxim , that things are more valued when they are scarce . The stream of his eloquence has flowed so full and steady for the last thirty years that men have come to look upon it as a sort of natural product , for which they have no more reason to be grateful than for the beauty of sunset skies . In Parliament , though of course much less in the country , familiarity has weakened the charm of his voice . Although he is delightful in society , with an endless flow of brilliant talk , full of literary knowledge ( he knows Dante , for instance , almost better than he knows Homer ) ; although he is constant in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his benevolence , or to interrupt his own wofR that he may write letters on behalf of others , he has been too busy , too much absorbed by his own ideas and pursuits , to have made many new friends . He has not , like Sir Robert Peel , formed a strong school of disciples and successors . Hence he has wanted the full benefit of having people around him who could both inform him of the fluctuations of opinion in political circles , and also defend his measures and himself with that added zeal which comes of personal attachment . It is pleasant to know that none of his former colleagues is more hearty in his admiration than the greatest of them all , and the one whose birth and training might have been expected to make him the least appreciative - John Bright . Disagreeing with Mr. Gladstone on many grave questions , seeing in him the only rival to his own oratorical pre-eminence , he is the most warm and generous in his praises . A story was lately told how Mr. Bright , hearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , " Has your son " ( the boy was standing beside them ) " ever seen Mr. Gladstone ? " " No , " was the surprised answer . " Then take him at once to see the greatest Englishman he is ever likely to look upon . " Mr. Gladstone 's literary work has been , with the exception of his hooks upon Homer and the treatise on Church and State which he wrote in early manhood , entirely of an occasional character-pamphlets and magazine articles . Such productions are not to be tried by the ordinary canons of criticism , for no one expects a polished style in what is written to be forgotten the week after it has been read . This work is considerable in amount , and unequal in merit . The historical articles show a wide learning , and occasionally so just and profound an insight as to make one believe that their author might have become a great historian . This is especially true of a study of the princil ) les of the Protestant Reformation , which appeared some two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have been a sufficient answer to those who think that he is a Roman Catholic at heart . The political articles are , practically , written speeches , and have just those defects into which a writer falls from using the tongue more frequently than the pen ,  --  a certain tendency to exaggeration , over-coloring , diffusiveness . But they are full of power . They have a rush and ring in them which would make them admired if they had appeared under any other name . It is the luster of his own oratorical reputation that obscures them . To appraise his Homeric writings would require more pages than I have lines to give . It is the fashion to depreciate them just because men like to believe that , as the pugilist says in the Iliad , " one man can not be skillful in all arts . " Their defects are due partly to an over-ingenuity , which builds theories on insufficient data , partly to the fact that in a busy life the author has been unable to keep pace with the rapid advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of much that is rather fanciful than solid , they contain also some observations and suggestions of great and permanent value . The picture they give of the politics and life of the Homeric age is the most vivid that has ever been drawn . The knowledge and mastery of the Homeric poems which they display is extraordinary . Nor has any one seen so clearly and enforced so effectively the truth that Homer is his own best interpreter , that the most minute examination of the text is the only way to arrive at trustworthy conclusions on Homeric questions . It is as a statesman that history will be // concerned to judge Mr. Gladstone , and indeed greatly concerned , since his personal qualities and tendencies have been a sensible factor , not only in England , but in the coinplex movements of European politics . Without attem* ) ting to anticipate her judgment , which can not come till the consequences of his career have had time to show themselves , it is interesting even now to inquire how , having been and being still such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much suspicion and alarm . For the government of a nation he has not merely great gifts , but an unusual accumulation of gifts : knowledge , industry , energy ; eloquence that sways assemblies ; conscientiousness that makes his probity accepted like a law of nature ; a swift and ample coml ) rehension not only of the details of administration , but of the great movements of thought in the world ; an imaginative power of sympathy with human feeling which gives him the power of warming men to enthusiasm by example as well as by words . These are the qualities that go to make a hero ; and with them he has also the truly heroic virtue of simplicity . Such qualities make a man fit to lead a nation in moments of exaltation , winning their devotion , stimulating them to splendid efforts . They have , in fact , enabled him to accomplish great things for England . He has been the author , either as himself devising or as carrying through the schemes of others by his own energy , of more legislative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved and their burdens lessened , whereby grounds of disaffection have been removed and men 's minds knitted together in loyalty and contentment , than any English statesman of his own generation , perhaps of this century . However , these are not the only qualities which a statesman needs for success . In the pursuits or professions of literature , or art , or science , one can not have too much of the highest gifts . But in the trade of governing men ,  --  an employment which , like commerce or forensic advocacy , brings us constantly into contact with our fellows ,  --  an excess in the finer gifts may be dangerous . Certainly , some of the more commonplace capacities are to the full as needful-shall we say more needful ? - than those which move admiration and enthusiasm ; and this is eminently true in the country where Mr. Gladstone 's lot has been cast . England is a country hard to be understood from outside . Under a despotism , a statesman who is sure of the confidence of the sovereign may disregard everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing his best for his country . Under a democracy like that of the United States , a statesman appealing by certain broad merits to an immense mass of electors who come into no personal contact with him is comparatively independent of persons , and need not so much care to study their peculiarities , win their help and protect himself against their enmity . But in a half-aristocratic , half-democratic country like England , ruled by a Parliament composed of a small number of men , of whom some fifty or sixty practically govern and influence the rest , the study of men ,  --  that is to say , of men 's weaknesses ,  --  becomes a very important branch of statesmanship . He who neglects it may possibly rise to power , but can not be sure of remaining there . Mr. Gladstone has , in a remarkable degree , what the French call " the defects of one 's qualities " - that is to say , the failings which flow from some faculty pushed to excess-present in so large a measure as to disturb the balance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other useful aptitu ( le . His eager activity makes him , as it was said of Julius C*sar , think that nothing has been done while aught remains undone . It passes into restlessness . It prevents him from realizing the presence in others of that weariness and indifference which he never feels himself . When he was at the head of affairs , he carried so many sweeping reforms that everybody who was interested in the maintenance of abuses took fright . Even among those who applauded , many looked at their neighbors and said , " What next ? " Absorbed in his own ideas , thinking only of the benefits which were being gained for the country , he did not perceive that he was outrunning the taste of the governing classes for reforms and using up the force which he had hitherto been able to direct . The intensity with which he bends his mind upon one thing at a time sometimes prevents him from observing other things . Small symptoms of changing popular opinion may escape his notice . lie does not give himself leisure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful . Men whose position , if not their ability , gives them a high conceit of their own opinion , may be heard to complain , that he does not listen to them with sufficient deference . His ingenuity , his power of finding principles everywhere and abun // dant reasons for every course , has in it something alarming for the or ( linary mind , especially as the conclusions he arrives at are not always those he expressed in earlier years . Thus , while every one admits his honesty , he incurs the charge of inconsistency , that bugbear of cowardly minds . The same warmth of feeling which supplies so tremendous a motive power makes him impulsive in manner and vehement , sometimes over-vehement , in speech . This is sometimes charged on him as a fault of temper , although quite unjustly , for no one keeps his temper better in debate , or has indulged in fewer personalities . Sometimes it is twisted into a sign of unsound judgment or deficient self-control . Even his moral earnestness has its dangerous side . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and advocate them too constantly from a point which fatigues the mass of mankind . Can a statesman , then , some one may ask , be really too much interested in his work , too serious and lofty in his aims ? The world being what it is-yes . In a country like England , the career of a successful statesman must be one long succession of compromises , half measures , humorings of popular prejudices , conciliations of selfish interests . A skillful man may keep his honesty through it all . But a scrupulous man will often find his conscience stand in his way . He will be stiff where it would be wiser to yield ; will speak out when he might have remained silent ; will disdain to flatter national vanity when he might win an easy and cheap popularity by doing so ; will have so decided a preference for what he thinks the right thing to be done that he may refuse to join in attaining almost the same end by some other road . Above all , he will tend to judge others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mass of his countrymen to whom he appeals , by himself . This , be it said with all respect , has been Mr. Gladstone 's chief mistake . He has taken the world for better than it is . He has imagined men to be generally anxious to discover the truth , to be ready to obey their highest motives . His calculations have made scant allowance for the great mass of mere dullness and indifference which exists in all countries . Men 's prejudices , their jealousies , their national as well as individual conceit , their selfishness and even such more amiable weaknesses as their preference of sport to work , their love of a little excitement and novelty , have been little regarded . He has addressed them in two strains only  --  the language of pure reason , which some can not understand and many will not listen to , and the language of moral exhortation , which after a time wearies the ordinary man , while it incenses the bad man , because it reproves him , and the cynical man , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of moral susceptibility below her European neighbors , England is on the whole above them . There is a larger section among her people than in probably any of the other old countries which responds to the sacred names of Justice and Humanity . But after all it is , except in moments of great excitement , only a section . This is one of the ways in which the difference between the typical English character and Mr. Gladstone 's , which is distinctively Scottish , expresses itself . It is , however , not the only way . His belief in logic , his fondness for carrying out principles to their results , are distasteful to the English mind . It scents danger in them . It is not willing to admit that everything is matter for argument . With a profound respect for the existing order of the world , it is impatient of theoretical reasons for changing anything which works passably well in practice . The sort of political leader whom it is really happy with is one of the type to which Lord Althorp , Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorous , outspoken , clear-headed man , with no more genius than is needed to rise to the level of a great debate , but entering joyously into the ordinary tastes and pursuits of English gentlemen . Thus there has always been ( as remarked already ) a certain want , not , perhaps , of moral sympathy , but of mutual intellectual comprehension between Mr. Gladstone and a large part of his countrymen . His early High Church friends have taken in his position . The Puritan Nonconformists admire him . The Scotch worship him . But the rest of the country , whether it votes him into office or votes him out , does n't quite understand him ; and perhaps he has never quite understood it . There is another reason for his unpopularity with the upper classes which it is not pleasant to dwell upon . It is the feeling which came out in the proverbial instance of the Athenian farmer , who ostracised Aristides because he was tired of always hearing him called the Just . If it is dangerous to be praised for your talents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your virtues . // Neither dignity nor humility protects from the sharp and watchful criticism which in a free state beats like hail upon a public man . Sensitiveness only stimulates it . Small errors are magnified . Careless words are twisted into the worst meaning . Even such a piece of pure good-nature and simplicity as the habit of answering everybody 's letters is set down to a morbid love of notoriety . As Mr. Gladstone has long been the most conspicuous figure in his own party , he draws all the enemy 's fire . It is less trouble to denounce him than to argue against the doctrines of his party ; and he has expressed himself on so many subjects , that there is always something to lay hold of . During the three years of fierce party strife that preceded the recent election , the hostile newspapers , some of which have their secret reasons , personal or theological ( for theological or anti-theological rancor plays no small part in these matters ) , did , by continued reiteration , succeed in persuading a part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a craven in foreign politics ,  --  childish as such a conception may seem to those who have followed his career . It is not so much these attacks , to which he had learnt to be indifferent , as the disappointment at the reaction which had swelled up around him , that has given a tinge of melancholy to Mr. Gladstone 's countenance and ideas . He sees a new generation springing up which ignores the great things that were done twenty years ago ; he perceives old fallacies stalking about like risen ghosts , and beguiling a large part of the people ; he hears doctrines savoring of Napoleonic imperialism , doctrines which seem to him to be profoundly immoral , l ) reached with confidence and received with applause . However , all this , instead of damping his ardor , has only kindled it the more . In one of the most vivacious of his later sallies , Mr. Disraeli compared the Liberal ministers of 1873 ( when a defeat in the House of Commons had checked their vigorous reforming policy ) to a row of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes and torrents of lava , stand grim , black , and silent ' in the wilderness their own fury has created around them . Whatever appropriateness the comparison may have had for some of his colleagues , Mr. Gladstone 's fires have certainly not burnt out . They blaze fiercely as ever , and send their light and heat over the whole country . Neither the seventy years that have passed VOL XXI. - xo. over him , nor the division of his mind between politics , scholarship , history , theology , nor the din of strife that is ringing always in his ears , seem to diminish his vigor and the vivid eagerness with which he throws himself into everything he touches . It is by this impression of force , more than by any one of his many gifts , that he chiefly seizes the imagination of his contemporaries , and that he will hold his place in the world 's annals , the impression of an intellectual passion and energy exhaustless as one of the forces of nature . There has arisen of late years a school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call an " exact science , " to explain all historical phenomena by the operation of general laws similar to the laws which govern the material universe . Such writers trace out without difficulty the action of these laws in the past ,  --  we can all do that ,  --  and have sometimes ventured to attempt prediction , though hitherto with but scant success . They insist that the growth of democracy makes such a scientific treatment of history easier and more certain now than it could have been in the days when kings and popes lorded it over nations . For since events are now determined by the opinions of large masses of men , individuals , whose peculiarities are no doubt still beyond the domain of science , may ( it is alleged ) be eliminated as being of little practical consequence . The course of European history during the last forty years does not seem , to the eye of a calm observer , to make for such a doctrine . Where would Italy have been without Mazzini , or even without Garibaldi and Cavour ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all appearance , would the course of events have been in England and in the East had either Mr. Gladstone or Lord Beaconsfield been off the scene ! We can see that the general tendencies of their age have influenced , and have been in a manner represented by , these conspicuous figures . But we see also that the special gifts of each have made all the difference as to the time when and the manner in which momentous changes have arrived , if , indeed , they have not made the difference as to their ever arriving . It would be more true to say that the lessenilig importance of material and the growing importance of spiritual forces are making the influence of individuals greater , and the study of individual characters more essential in the historian 's eyes , than was ever the case before . Now , when governments // are more popular , when education is more generally diffused , when communication has become easier , when intelligence is scattered more swiftly and widely by the press , so much the more abundant and efficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potent of all the forces that govern human affairs  --  the influence of a great character upon the thoughts , the imagination , the emotions of his fellow-men
