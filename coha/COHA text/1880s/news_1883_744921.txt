txt In his first prayer as Chaplain of the Senate , the Rev. Mr. Huntley , this morning , earnestly asked for divine blessings Upon his predecessor in office , who , in his daily walk and in his coming in and his going out , had pointed the Senators to the Lamb of God . After the morning nour ** Ingalls reported favorably from the District of Columbia Committee a bill establishing the new standard of time in this District , and at a later hour the bill was taken up and passed . When the desk was clear of routine business , the Senate took up the proposed new rules , beginning with Rule 2 , which provides that certain officers may be elected by the Senate . Mr. Garland , of Arkansas , pointed out that heretofore there had been no rule on the subject , and he opposed making any such rule . Senators might talk as much as they pleased about civil service reform , but at every ssion.of a new Senate , no matter which party was in power , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the time come again when officers would be removed only for ? cause . Mr. Bayard ar- gued that the proposed rule was superfluous and Mr. Frye urged that it simply made a rule that had been a custom . Mr. Bayard informed his brethren that when the Democrats secured control of the Senate they ' did not make a clean sweep of all the officers , but retained a large number of Republicans in office , and paid them more than one-half of the total of salaries . He spoke sarcastically of " the absolute indifference on the Republican side to civil Service reform , " and declared that the American people did intend to have civil service reform . The country was not to be run by a mere political machine , built on the spoils of office . Mr. Bayard asserted that no faithful . efficient office-holder had ever lost a place by his vote , and added that the good of the public service demanded that such holders of office should not be turned out . Mr. Garland remarked that the Senate did not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he therefore moved that the discussion of the rules be indefinitely post-. poned . Mr. Morrill declared that this was ungenerous , as the attendance was very thin , and he hoped Mr. Garland would post-wine his motion until more Senators were present . Mr. Morgan moved to adjourn , and Mr. Morrill called for the yeas and nays . Republicans came pouring out of the cloak rooms , and when the roll was finished the motion to adjourn had been defeated by a vote of 13 to 23 , 10 of the 13 yeas coming from Democrats . Then Mr. Garland withdrew his motion , and without further debate the Senate voted to disagree with Rule 2 . Rule 3 , regarding the taking of oaths by Senators , was adopted after a short debate , and rapid progress was made until.the rule governing the taking of votes was reached . Mr. Bayard wanted some provision made to compel a Senator to vote when his name was called , and Mr. Frye argued that it was an absolute impossibility to make a Senator say . yea " or " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decline to vote in order to prevent a quorum was as revolutionary as to fire a missile at the President of the United States . Debate ran along in this strain for a long time , until finally the rule was adopted , with the understanding that amendments would be offered hereafter .
