M* day 's work was done . I try to be one of that very small class of men who are wise enough to leave " shop " at the shop when they go home for the night , in order that , after mental excursions in other directions , they may come back to it with fresh vigor the next morning . So , when fortunate enough to have an evening all to myself , I sit in my easy-chair , with my newspaper in my lap , smoke a cigar - " to the glory of God , " of course , like Mr. Spurgeon - and dream . I reconstruct the history of the olden times ; and then , in the light of present tendencies , I forecast the possible future . Thus I picture the reforms that might be , and think out at length what other people ought to do in order to create an ideal world . I suppose no one ever yet objected to an ideal world , provided other people would bring it about ; for , in each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he always has everything he wishes . The only trouble about creating it is the fact that it requires present labor and sacrifice , and the aforesaid other people are not unselfish enough to undergo them on our behalf . Among the things I have always wanted in my ideal world - when it comes - is an ideal newspaper . I have long objected somewhat seriously to the real newspaper of the real world . I think that I have always appreciated , quite as fully as anybody , the wonder and glory of its past achievement and its presont position and power . And yet I have never been quite satisfied that it had , as at present conducted , earned the right to supersede the school and the church - all the old educational , moral , and religious institutions - as some of its more enthusiastic advocates have modestly hinted . I may as well here frankly acknowledge , for it is sure to come out incidentally if I do not , that my editorial experience is somewhat limited . It consists chiefly in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more or less inti // mate personal acquaintance with a good many editors , and have sometimes been obliged to note the limitations of the editorial mind as revealed by their dissent from my opinion as to the value of certain articles , both in prose and verse , which I have offered for publication . But this limited experience has not at all shaken my confidence in my editorial theories . It may even have had the opposite effect , and I am all the more comfortable in my opinion when I reflect that majorities rule in a democratic country , and that I am quite sure I shall have the majority on my side . Let me illustrate this point a little , and see how the same principle works in other directions . If any one imagines that my lack of experience , or even knowledge on the subject , diminishes the value or validity of my opinions as to the editorial function , I can easily silence him by pointing to a few facts . For example , I suppose it is an unquestioned fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If in these times when everybody is discussing the question as to why people do not go to church- though , curiously enough , the churches are increasing in number all the time a minister should be so fortunate as to have a thousand hearers , he knows perfectly well that at least a thousand people know better how to preach than he does . If he does not know this , he must be a dull man , even for a minister . One person knows that his sermons are too long , though the whole service be no more than an hour and a half . Another knows that he ought , or else ought not , to preach without notes ; still another , that he ought , or else ought not , to let politics alone in the pulpit . Somebody else is aware that lie furnishes too little of the sincere milk of the word , or else that he does not deal enough with the secular topics of the day . It is common talk that lie is too aristocratic , or else is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young , and so make himself a successful rival of the skating-rinks ; or , perhaps , that he is not grave enough to suit the old , who have outgrown their youthful follies . It is not at all necessary that a man should ever have preached , in order to be abundantly qualified to tell a minister what he ought to be and do to satisfy a thousand contradictory tastes and opinions . It will even be found generally true that a person who does not go to church at all is wiser in this matter than anybody else . This point might be further illustrated by noticing the wisdom // of unmarried people in the matter of training children . Having received a good deal of advice on this subject from unprejudiced old bachelors and old maids , I have learned thoroughly to appreciate its worth . And the same is true in business matters generally . What man ever yet failed , after a brave fight with circumstances that he could not control , that he did not find a host of friends about him ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of himself , and that , if he had taken their layman 's advice , in a matter in which they had had no experience , everything might have been all right ? So I think it must be plain , to every thoughtful person , that my ability to tell how a newspaper ought to be edited , is presumably beyond question . The always wise Mr. Hosca Biglow , in his last deliverance to the public , says , referring to the fact that he had never been in Congress : " I hai n't no chance to speak So's't all the country dreads me onet a week , But I 've considhie of that sort o ' head That sets to home an ' thinks wut might be said . " So , though I have never edited a newspaper , I have had the audacity to do a good deal of thinking as to how one might be edited . And , after all , I suppose all candid men will admit that a man need not be a French cook in order to have a well-grounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly in it . I sat , then , one evening in my easy-chair , with my feet elevated at the angle that every one of my gentleman readers will appreciate , looking across the paper lying in my lap at the glowing coals in my open grate , and seeing in the fire the growing outlines of the newspaper that is to be . At first , my thoughts wandered over the past and the present , and noted the really wondrous and grand things that the newspaper has become and is doing to-day . Four things I chiefly thought of , and it is only fair that I do them full justice , by way of suggestion at least , before I proceed to those things for the mention of which the whole editorial fraternity will think my presumption exceeds all bounds . In the first place , as I glance over my paper , I think of the scattered tribes of long ago . Then , of the isolated peoples , each one , like China to-day , fancying itself the center of the earth ; shut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of communication with the rest of mankind . Then , I see the // courier on horseback , on a laborious and dangerous journey , taking some message over a slow and little-traveled route . Picture after picture , phase after phase , of industrial development passes by my mental vision , until at last I see the seas turned into ferry-ways , and the continents into net-works of rail and wire . The earth has become a vast whispering-gallery . And the paper in my lap has caught up and stereotyped all that the great world said and did yesterday , and thus has tossed the globe upon my breakfast-table . Two or three cents now bring more information to every door than even the learned of mankind could know a hundred years ago . Wisdom is a gift of nature , and is not to be found even in books . But to-day even the poorest man may be intelligent if he will . If he can not be well educated , he can at least be " well smattered , " which Gail Hamilton says is the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In its accomplishment of this work the newspaper has done something grander still , of which perhaps neither editors nor others have taken sufficient account . Not even all the preachers have done so much as the newspapers in developing a practical sense of human brotherhood , and so helping on that kingdom of man which is the real kingdom of God . Isolation means misconception , and , as a consequence , enmity . If he is a foreigner , fling a stone at him ,  --  that is the old impulse born of supposed selfinterest . Now no sensible man wishes even a foreign war , for he has learned the community of human interests . And nothing has done so much to spread this knowledge as the newspapers . They are helping " Peace on earth , good-will to man , " more than all the Christmas sermons . Another noble service of the newspaper is that of creating an arena for free debate on all debatable subjects in heaven and on earth . It constitutes a universal town-meeting for politics , a more than royal society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any one paper may be ever so narrow , ever so much of an " organ , " but it can not prevent some man 's starting another paper across the way , and it can not hinder the people 's reading both of them . So , first or last , all subjects have a chance for free and unbiased discussion . And from such a discussion the truth has everything to hope , and error everything to fear . Heretofore , timid opinions have had abundant opportunities for shunning the direct rays of investigation . But the day of universal reading has // dawned . Universal thinking will follow . Then wo to that which is afraid of thought ! All this was impossible a hundred years ago , or in any age preceding that . But now it advances in a geometrical progression . More than all other agencies , the newspaper is doing this . Henceforth , if any man holds a pet opinion , of the truth of which he is not quite sure , and yet that he is specially anxious to keep , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is light-proof . The atmosphere of the coming age will not be favorable to the preservation of perishable fruits , whether in politics , science , or religion . One other office the newspaper fills , that of public conscience and detective . The collective newspapers of the world form a sort of world-brain , through which mankind comes to a consciousness of itself . And in this mirror of world-consciousness , it sees and passes judgment on world-actions . Never before were the nations so amenable to the common conscience of mankind . No secrets can long be kept . " There is nothing covered that shall not be made known . " To-day there is no nation so mighty but it fears to be brought before the bar of public opinion . Wars are no longer undertaken lightly . Their methods are become more human , and the weakest and most struggling people knows it has an advocate in the universal sense of right , of which even the most conscienceless despot is afraid . American opinion influences the course of a war in China . And Russian diplomats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So hastens on " the parliament of man , the federation of the world . " Without the newspaper to bring public opinion to bear , and to serve as the medium for the public conscience , the old isolation would return again , and all this would be impossible . In a similar though less important way , the newspaper serves as a detective in individual cases . The time is rapidly approaching when there will be no last corner left on earth in which a criminal can securely hide . Even now , there are few places where he is not in danger of reading a description of himself in the first pap*r he picks up , as he looks for the time of departure of the next train . All these things in favor of the newspaper flitted through my mind as I sat musing and looking into the grate . And I said to myself : " If an editor is not particularly hard-hearted , how can he possibly be angry with a critic that begins to find fault only after making such grand concessions ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Lowell says , to " git the good-will of the orjunce . " I have done it because it is just . And if I criticise , it is only as one might criticise a picture that was being finished by a favorite artist , for the sake of having it as nearly perfect as possible . For it does seem a pity that so grand a possibility should be marred by such grave defects . Let ns then proceed to note what some of these defects are . Suppose we make a visit to the editorial rooms of the " National Palladium . " This is one of a vast number of papers , each of which has the largest circulation , the largest advertising patronage , the largest number of foreign correspondents , the largest corps of home reporters , and the largest everything in general in the whole country . The first thing that attracts attention is the sort of mystic authority and air of supernal wisdom that seems to enshroud , and , at the same time , illumine all editorial utterances . The dogma of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief of all intelligent readers of the newspapers ; but I sometimes find myself wondering as to whether editorial infallibility aspires to be the new prophet and wear the old mantle . For now and then some editor , in a confidential mood , will let drop the opinion that the newspapers are already doing more good than all the churches , and will hint his expectation that the press is gradually to supersede most of the religious and educational institutions of the world . Upon careful inquiry you will find that this editor is by no means distinguished for either education , piety , or morality . But one snspects that this kind of writer is taking on something of the priestly function , and that the editorial virtue is supposed to reside in the office , whatever the man may be . Two or three slight indications of the " Palladium 's " mystic wisdom it is worth while to notice a little in detail . In the first place , however insignificant-physically , mentally , or morally - a writer may be , he swells to the proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the editorial pen . And , by the way , I believe that nobody but newspaper writers ever " wield " a pen nowadays . When in the presence of this " we , " I always think of the plural Elohim - " gods , " translated " God " - in the first chapter of Genesis ; and of how the commentators get over the polytheistic implication by declaring it to be similar to this editorial usage . Here again is a curious suggestion of a higher than individual authority , that hints a parallelism between the sanctum // and the sanctuary . I am aware that this usage was once supposed to be a modest device to avoid the repetition of the egotistic L But , nevertheless , the effect is the opposite of modest . And , after all , why should it not be made apparent that any particular newspaper utterance is only the opinion of some one not very uncommon individual , and not the outpouring of some collective fountain of wisdom , having a source higher than the ordinary human level ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , superstitious authority has not altogether died out . Many people appear to have an extraordinary veneration for the printed alphabet , though they treat the very same letters , spoken or written , with supercilious contempt . For instance , John Smith , on the street , may be held in no very high esteem . His opinions are simply those of John Smitb , and every one feels at liberty to disregard or contradict what he may say by word of mouth or in private correspondence . But , besides being a general Bohemian about town , engaged in all sorts of haphazard occupations for a living , he has the entr6e of several newspaper sanctums , and now and then appears anonymously in the editorial columns . On these occasions , although he utters the same trite or nonsensical things that are disregarded on the street , he becomes surrounded with the superstitious halo that seems to envelop the whole mystery of the printing-press . He speaks out of the clouds ; and people read , ponder , and even think it worth while to reply to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ever known , under any circumstances whatever , to confess ignorance on any subject , or to admit that he has ever been in the wrong . To do so seems to be regarded as a sort of infidelity to the press . The people look to it for light and guidance ; and light and guidance they shall have . Though any particular editorial writer has not mastered any one field of research , still it is his office , as an editor , to be equally at home in all fields . And if some member of the opposition proves him to be palpably and grossly ignorant , several resources are always open to him . It may be too hard work to study up the subject ; but he can always rely on the partisan bias of most of his readers , and also on their being as ignorant as himself . So , if a still stronger assertion of his position is not enough , he can always accuse his opponent of being bribed to undermine the prosperity of the laboring classes ; or , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfather . It not infrequently happens that an editor makes some false or injurious statement about the personal character or business relations of a citizen ; but his infallibility will rarely allow him to apologize . He may possibly admit that some new employe in the office has been mistaken ; or , more boldly , he may allege that appearances fairly justify the inference drawn . In any case , he can always have the last word . And , in the end , individuals find it more prudent to sit down quietly , even under the grossest injury , than to attempt to secure justice in a case where the opposing counsel is at the same time jury and judge and executioner . There is one development of journalism concerning which the people are not over thoughtful , and into which the newspapers themselves should put a little more conscience and care . The great body of correspondents at the national capital have come to wield almost a despotic power . Each day they hold in their hands the distribution of political news for the whole country . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done in a spirit of judicial fairness , especially when dealing with the " other party . " There should be also a sense of proportion , a comprehension of the relative importance of news . But too often the correspondents of the " Palladium* ' are not so anxious to furnish a fair and balanced account of what has really taken place as they are to " make a point** against the Administration , or in favor of " our paper . " And not infrequently it comes to pass that a news-gatherer takes rank , not according to the accuracy of his reports , or because of sending home such news as is most important , or that the Government wishes to have known , but is rated high if he gets something for his paper that none of the others get , or if he can be two hours ahead of any other paper . And he is sometimes regarded as particularly " smart " if he can scent out some government secret , and publish it before the authorities want it known . No matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least " enterprising , " and if it turns out not to be true , no matter . The issue that contradicts and explains affairs will sell as many copies as that containing the original statement . So , whatever else happens , papers are sold and the circulation increased . And as a paper is great by as much as it sells , the grand end of journalism is accomplished . Owing to this unique power , and to the fact that all news from the capital must go through them , it naturally follows that the corre // spondents can practically make or unmake any public man 's reputation . A man can be returned by his constituents only on the strength of his reputation . And as these makers of reputation are somewhat lofty in their estimation of themselves , and naturally work for a consideration , of course most public men-all but the very strongest - will be their very humble servants . The one that is polite and deferential to them , the one that flatters their power , the one that uses his position to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he will be their favorite . In all their reports , he and his family will be handsome , he will be eloquent , he will be wise . While if anybody pursues an independent course , or if , for any reason , they do not like him , they can either bury him under a fatal silence , or " write him down . " It is not strange , then , if the newspaper correspondent comes to regard himself as " a bigger man than " - almost anybody else . Hence it is that the " great " man of one year sinks out of sight the next , and is never heard of afterward . The newspaper made him . He lived and moved and had his being in " puffs . " And when the puffs cease he vanishes . It is vastly amusing to see how ordinary dresses become " elegant , " how plain ladies become " distingu6 , " and dull ones grow " brilliant , " at a congressman 's reception , when Jenkins is invited and given a prominent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumption that what the average newspaper reader wants is peppery gossip . The scent is particularly keen for a juicy morsel that smacks of the innermost privacy of some prominent man or woman . If the great public would only stop and look at itself as the newspaper sees it , the portrait would not be specially flattering . Its style of catering does not imply a very delicate sense of either smell or taste on the part of those it is supposed to feed . I picked up a daily only a day or two ago , and nearly half of its headings on the first page were either of such a nature , or were treated in such a way , as to suggest the " Police Gazette . " It is not altogether uplifting to note how the recent illness of our great war leader and ex-chief magistrate has been dished up for public consumption . We have had spread before us the most curious , not to say repulsive , details . Of course the country has been anxious to know his real condition from hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nauseous descriptions of all the happenings of the sick-room , accompanied by ghastly illustrations // of him in all sorts of attitudes , they have even gone so far as to publish all his private , personal habits , as to neatness or the lack of it , capping the whole business with a minute description of the state of his teeth , the accumulations of tartar upon them , and his neglect of the tooth-brush . And if the worshipers of Emerson were shocked to have the unsympathetic public informed of the commonplace fact that their " god " actually liked pie , what shall one say of having a great hero laid out for this sort of vulgar dissection ? And when a rumor gets abroad concerning the domestic infelicity of any well-known man or woman , the privacy of his home , as - ell as those of all his friends , is liable to be fairly besieged by an army of reporters . They will sometimes openly demand all the particulars , under the threat that , if their request ( ? ) be not complied with , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the facts . And it is often hinted that perhaps the real facts would look better in print than the version already in their possession . It never seems to occur to them that it is none of their business , anyway . And the sturdy old British saying that " An Englishman 's house is his castle " seems to be regarded as a relic of the " effete despotisms " of the old world that has no place in a free and glorious republic like ours . To that phase of newspaper development which is represented by the work of the reporter it is difficult to do any sort of justice , either in portraying its goodness or its badness . One is tempted to extravagance both in praising and cursing . Of course no fault is to be found with the thing itself ; for reporting is the newspaper 's breath of life . Without the reporter we may have essays and editorials , but no newspaper . And it is the reporter , home or foreign , that furnishes the editor with his themes . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of resources , the tireless devotion rising even to heroism , of the average reporter , one 's admiration is inspired almost to the pitch of writing an epic in his praise . When , on the other hand , one remembers some horrible experience , when , having fallen into the hands of the reporters , he envied Daniel in the lions ' den , because the mouths of the lions were " stopped " ; when he reflects that a reporter can not only be an ass , but , as Sothern used to say , " so many kinds of an ass " ; then even the mildest man begins to understand what it might mean to commit a crime , for there is murder in his heart . // in justification of this somewhat forcible language , I wish to hint at a few experiences with the " Palladium . " This paper does not seem to select its reporters on the ground of either knowledge or judgment , but rather because they can write with sufficient rapidity , and are supposed to be enterprising . Enterprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covers a multitude of sins . Let me give one or two illustrations of their way of doing things . As I sat one day talking over this matter with one of the editorial staff , a somewhat excited and depressedlooking clergyman came in . Said he : " Mr. Editor , your reporter has got me into what promises to be a serious difficulty . " " Ah , " replied the editor , " sorry for that . What is it ? " Then he went on to explain . It seems that some of his soundest hearers were a little drowsy a Sunday or two before , and only waked up to what their minister had said when some one called their attention to it as reported in the " Palladium . " The reporter had made a fairly straightforward report , but it was longer than there was convenient room for that morning . Instead of taking the trouble to condense it , they had chosen the easier course of cutting it in two in the middle . This left the minister in the position of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as his reply was omitted , these opinions appeared as his own . So some of the more zealous of his flock had actually made a move to have him brought before the Synod . And , since it is well known that " corrections " rarely reach the people that have read the original error , our good Doctor of Divinity was in a fair way to find his orthodoxy impeached all over the land . I found it was a common practice to send one reporter to take down six or even a dozen sermons in one morning . The natural result was , that he got the introduction of one , snatches of the middle of most , and the end of the conclusion of another ; and this made nonsense of them all . The ministers had got tired of protesting , and were obliged to hope that the people would not think them quite so idiotic as the papers made them out to be . And instances are not infrequent of very imaginative reporters not getting to the church at all until the whole service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a column or so of their own , replete with arguments that the minister never thought of , and brilliant with metaphors he never heard of , and then they modestly feel that the clergyman ought to be obliged to them for making him preach a better sermon // than usual . This inventive genius frequently displays itself in elaborate reports of people that were not present at a public meeting , but had been advertised to be . Though , like the reporter himself , they were not able to be present , they find that this little incident has not interfered with their receiving most generous applause , any more than it has stood in the way of the reporter 's telling what he did not know . And when-as is sometimes popularly supposed to be the case , even with sermons  --  the good preacher is a little tame , the reporter will kindly volunteer to put in some startling thing he did not say , for the worthy purpose of heightening the dish 's flavor to suit the reader 's taste . I had a case of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with consummate ability , getting every single point I had made wrong end to , the reporter 's genius fairly took him off his feet . He remarked that , at the close of my sermon , I created quite a sensation ( ! ) in the audience by a reference to Guitean . As a matter of fact , I had never mentioned his name in the pulpit on that or any other occasion . And I have a friend whose sermon-reported by some imaginative person who , not being present , did not hear a word of it-was quoted by an English review as an illustration of the depths to which the American pulpit had fallen . But the crowning feat of the " Palladium 's " reporting is what is called the " interview . " Let it be clearly understood that no fault is found with the thing itself . When properly done it may be made not only interesting , but profitable , instructive , and helpful for all concerned . It is only the " Palladium 's " methods to which I take exceptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody 's opinion on a certain subject . So a reporter calls on him . That he has no opinion on the subject , or that he wishes to keep what he has to himself , is a matter of no moment . An interview is wanted , and an interview must be forthcoming ; otherwise , the reporter 's reputation for enterprise is gone . The victim is suspected of holding such or such views , and he is informed that he had better speak to set himself right . Some other journal has already said so or so , and he had better correct it . No matter that the reporter does not write shorthand , and so can only take down fragmentary notes . No matter that he does not know anything about the subject , and so is sure to misinterpret anything that is said . The next day the poor man finds himself driveling on through a column or two , the most of it in quotation marks , headed by his name // and all his titles . He has been " written down an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all his political antagonists will pick him up , and sneer at him , on the basis of what he did not say . I came across one poor fellow that had been rendered insane by this process . He was now actually as crazy as the reporters had made him out to be . He was really quite harmless , but he took me one side and , in a mysterious voice , assured me that if he could only once kill a reporter , he felt that he could then die happy . Is it not true also that many of the newspapers , instead of being firm and unbiased seekers after and teachers of the truth , are rather interested advocates of some special party or cause ? They are generally all fighting for some position with rewards of some kind attached to it . They therefore see only one side of any question ; or , if they do see another , they seem to feel it to be a duty to suppress it . They talk chiefly of the success of their cause , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the man of one newspaper " will be only another name for a blind and narrow-minded partisan . I find also that it does not at all necessarily follow that an editorial writer is expected to believe himself what he is trying to make his readers believe . No matter what his personal convictions may be , a man will often take a lucrative position on any paper , and advocate any set of opinions to which the paper may be committed , or which the " market " at that particular juncture seems to call for . I have heard of one very " smart " writer who , during a great moral controversy between two leading organs , by private arrangement and all unknown to the public , actually wrote the leaders on both sides . It appears therefore that , in reading an editorial , one can rarely be sure that he is getting the 6ona fide opinion of anybody . If a paper is on a paying basis as the organ of any special party or clique , a man of quite the opposite belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as a man will " run " a cotton-mill , for the sake of the money he can make . It is somewhat difficult , therefore , to discover whether these leaders of public opinion themselves possess any opinions at all . Once on a time , when Mr. Moody was carrying on a great revival in a certain city , I happened to know of a paper that , as one of its managers expressed it , was undertaking to " do the heavy religious , " in order to extend its country circulation . And it happened that hardly a single person thus engaged had any belief whatever in the work . // The " Palladium 's " advertising columns , and its methods of dealing with cases of crime , are somewhat puzzling to one that attempts to reconcile them with the great moral and religious claims of the press in general . For instance , the editorials often grieve over the alleged decline of family morals , and the frequency of divorce ; while , in the same issue , the reporters are left free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the juiciest kind of jest . Marital infidelities , brutal husbands , and heart-broken wives become the material for filling up the " funny " column . They seem to have improved on the beatitude , and made it read , " Blessed are they that weep , for others shall laugh . " And the advertising columns , under the thinnest of all disguises - as mediums , or fortune-tellers , or personals - are full of all covert invitations to the very things over which the editors shed their regretful tears . And when some brutal , bloody , or filthy crime is committed , it will be spread through whole columns . Diagrams lead everybody 's imagination to the spot , and the most disgusting details are given in full . The editors admit that such things tend to increase the volume of crime . They denounce a class of papers that go into the business a little more frankly and fully than they do . They encourage a society for the suppression of vice . They try to put down a class of juvenile publications the effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And still they lend their own papers to a similar business . I have been much interested in one editor 's defense . The gist of it was , that the people wanted it , and for the sake of it bought large numbers of copies of the paper . I ventured to suggest that that line of defense would be equally good on behalf of the lowest groggenes , or of houses of prostitution , or of gambling dens . Another editor took up another plea . He said : " My theory of a newspaper is , that it is the history of the world for a day . And as this , alas , is not yet an expurgated world , we must take things as we find them . " I ventured to reply : " The newspaper is not a complete history of a day . Were it to attempt to be , it would enter into such minute and secret details of life as would disgust everybody . It is only a question , then , as to precisely where the line is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limits as will make it healthy for family reading . " And again I ventured a suggestion . I argued that , since such details were not necessary to the // ml statement of the fact of a crime , since they were no aid to the police , and were not in the interest of public morality , it fo-lowed that only one motive could lead to it  --  the desire to make money by any means that the public taste would endure . And this motive was equally good on behalf of any disreputable business whatever . At this point the editor 's infallibility seemed to come to his rescue ; for , though he did not reply , still he would not confess himself in the wrong . And then the " Palladium , " in its apparent zeal to exterminate all evil , falls into such a habit of indiscriminate abuse of public men and public measures , and of other papers , that when it needs to attack some real evil it has no language left by which it can do any sort of justice to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " newspaper abuse " may only mean that its object is some great and good man who is trying to accomplish some noble end . The cry of " Stop thief ! " is heard so often that no attention is paid to it ; or it actually becomes a cover under the shade of which the real thief can make off with his plunder . The abuse , then , only helps the bad and does not injure the good . A clipping from a leading daily reveals a newspaper 's own confession as to the attitude they maintain toward each other : " The millennium has started . Its point of departure is Philadelphia , where one paper actually admits that a contemporary has actually rendered important public services . Judging from the example of the papers of New York , it will be a long time before the millennium strikes that city . " There is one point more that seems to demand notice . On the part of business men , club men , and men of the world in general , there seems to exist a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that newspaper methods have something to do with this . The fact is that never , in the whole history of the world , were there so many noble men , so many true women ; when socie* ty , when governments , when all departments of human life , were in so healthy and hopeful a condition as they are to-day . What is the reason for the pessimistic opinion ? Too largely , I believe , it is owing to the method that the newspapers take for reporting crimes . Ten thousand men in Cincinnati to-morrow will meet their checks and pay their honest debts , and nobody but the men to whom they are paid will know anything about it . Somebody will commit a forgery in Cincinnati to-morrow , and the next day it will be told of // in all the newspapers , in great head-lines , leaded so as to make as much display as possible ; and people will read it , and feel that everybody that has a chance is ready to commit a forgery . It is the theory in the modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wicked ; or that this pre-eminently is news . A million people behave themselves , but that is no news . Nobody thinks of reporting that , or saying anything about it . But if one contemptible man , any miserable tramp , anywhere in America , commits a meanness , they not only note the fact , but tell us all about it . If there is a drunken broil , a stabbing affray in South Boston or at the North End , not only have we the statement of the fact , but we are treated to a diagram as large perhaps as was devoted to the map showing the war in Egypt , telling us where the kitchen and sink were , where the coal-hole was , and everything else about the place ; just where the man stood , where he was when he fell down , where the body lay when it was discovered , how much blood there was on the floor . All these slaughter-house details must be spread through every home in the city . To say that all this is necessary in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noble papers have proved that a better way is practicable . To say that more papers are sold this way , is probably true . But this is a confession that making money is the chief end of a newspaper , and this places it on a level with the grog-shops and the houses of ill-fame . The best are always in a minority . The van-guard on the march is always less in number than the main army . It will always " pay 's to cater successfully to the crowd . When Miss Bertha Von ilillern was having her great walking-match , a certain editor said to me : " If I should publish in my next Sunday paper a new essay by Emerson , I should perhaps sell five hundred extra copies . A full report of the walking-match will sell twenty-five thousand . " But if merely making money is what a newspaper is for , let it be frankly stated and understood . We shall then hear somewhat less about the great moral and religious influence of the press . Now I would not for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to the criticisms I have made , or that any one is liable to them all . But I do say that some newspapers are guilty in these directions ; that most of them are sometimes guilty ; and that newspaper methods in general are capable of great improvement . The newspaper leaves ought to be , and can // be , like the leaves of the wonderful tree in Revelation , " for the healing of the nations . " It hurts one then to see them wormeaten and withered . I have taken the case of the " National Palladium , " as a wellknown illustration of the worst methods . Everybody has seen this paper , and knows that it is not mythical . It is because the old employees of this paper sometimes get on to the working staff of better journals that they also occasionally display its indefensible characteristics . When , by eliminating these faults , the press justifies its somewhat premature boast of being able to supersede the church , I know of one minister at least who will , without any jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful position in the sanctum , where he may still continue his work for truth and man . But he is not yet ready to write to order , and for pay , either in the pulpit or out , since he still cherishes a few articles of personal property labeled " opinions . " M. J.
