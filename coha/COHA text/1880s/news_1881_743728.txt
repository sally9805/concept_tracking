txt Ex-Gov . Fenton , of New-York , went down on the morning train from Cleveland , and was driven to Gen. Garfield 's . He passed the intervening time , until the noon train from the east was due , as the guest of the President-elect . His visit was a cordial one . At the station , while awaiting the train , a correspondent approached him and asked if there was anything concerning his visit which could be made public . " Nothing special , " said the ex-Governor . " I was coming West on some business matters . While at the hotel in Cleveland , I learned that all trains were stopping at this station , and came down this morning just for a short call . " " Have you any views upon the Cabinet question that you will allow me to publish ? " " Some of my talk with the General this morning was in relation to the Cabinet . But I have little to say that would give new light upon the matter . " " Judge Folger was hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conkling 's visit , the correspondents immediately decided that he would be the Secretary of the Treasury . " " Yes , " said the ex-Governor , smiling , " but I think both the talk about Judge Folger and Mr. Morton rather premature . Beyond the office of Secretary of State , whin most every one seems to feel assured that Mr. Blaine will be called upon to fill , there is very little known by any one but Gen. Garfield as to what will be done . He is not a person who communicates all his plans to others . " " Do you think the differences which have arisen in the party in your State will be protracted i " " There are no great differences among the Republicans of New-York . We worked together pretty well last Fall , did n't we ? " " Do you think the policy of Gen. Garfield 's Administration will tend to promote harmony within the party ? " " I have unbounded faith in his patriotism , his sagacity , and the broad views of statesmanship which he has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to unite the party where there are any breaches . Mind , I say where there are any breaches. for the differences , where they exist , are only slight , and , under the wise administration which I feel positive Gen. Garfield will give the country , I am very hopeful of the future . " When thenoon train from Cleveland arrived , Gov . Foster , in company with Capt . Henry , stepped off . The Governor , of course , met with the warm reception which has always been accorded him when visiting Mentor. and after dinner he was in conference with the Presidentelect . Later in the day the correspondent met the Governor in Gen. Garfield 's private office . " Well , you are here surely to-day , Governor , " said the reporter . " Yes . I see some of you newspaper folks had me here the other day . Correspondents are generally rather a smart lot of fellows . They have an excellent imagination . " " Have you anything to say about the CabMet which it would be well to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people who come here , I do n't know anything about it . " Then the Governor jocularly alluded to the talk about his going into the Oabinet , but revealed no secret . He left hero to-night for Columbus . The subject of the proposed New York , Chicago and St. Louis Railroad came up , and the Governor said the story about his selection for the Presidency of it was all fiction . He was interested in the line , and knew something of what would be done . The Governor has not gone to Mentor without an invitation from Gen. Garfield . His visit either means that he is to go into the Cabinet , or be told why Gen. Garfield can not put him there . The chances seem now about evenly divided . A gentleman who vibrates a great deal between Ohio and Washington said to-day : " President Hayes 's opinion as to what Gen. Garfield intends to do may be valuable as a guess from one who ought to be well posted from the situation he occupies , but he does not draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mentor . Gen. Garfield has nothing to thank Mr. Hayes for . Years ago , when Gen. Garfield did not command the support in Ohio that ho now has , hut when lie gave signs of coming into a commanding position in politics , the Cincinnati wing of the party in this State , led by the Republican newspapers of that city , made war on him in a small , spiteful way , that found expression in innuendo rather than by direct attack . Mr. Hayes rather sided with them , not so much from jealousy as because he lived in Cincinnati once , and was early brought under the influence of the Matthews clique , which influence he has never been able to shake off . He did not ask Gen. Garfield to step aside in the Senatorial fight so much to put Gen. Garfield in the Speakership of the House as to put Matthews into the Senate . When the State Convention was held in Cincinnati in 18 ' 79 , Gen. Garfield went there and , by pure intellectual power and personal magnetism , carried everything with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the two became friends . But Mr. Hayes has never had much to do with Gen. Garfield , and after he was in the White House a few months Gen. Garfield almost ceased his visits there , and concluded he would make no more recommendations that received no attention . He is too large a man to show any petty spite or feeling , but he has not taken Mr. Hayes into his confidence , and has had very little to do with him . He called at the White House when in Washington after the election . but it was not to discuss the future . The fact that Mr. Hayes and Gen. Garfield have had so little to do in common has largely helped to bring Senator Conkling and Gen. Garfield together , and to make them what it is sure they will be in future , good personal friends . It is declaredpersistently in several directions that Gen. Goff was appointed Secretary of the Navy on a distinct understanding between President Hayes and Coen . Garfield that he should continue in the new Administration . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . President Hayes picked Gen. Goff out because Gen. Goff had been a member of his regiment and because he wished to give him a morsel before going out of office . Gen. Garfield heard nothing of the matter until he saw the appointment in the dispatches , and then remarked : " I do not know the new Secretary and must confess that at present I am unable to describe or locate him . " The call of John Campbell , of Wheeling , yesterday , moans something . But it hardly means that Campbell is after a Cabinet position . He may have given Gen. Garfield a hint as to what he would like , but it is not thought here that his claims upon the party , which are great , or his claims upon Gen. Garfield , are such as to put him over the heads of older men who have pulled longer in the harness . If West Virginia should receive an appointment , however , it would probably be Campbell rather than Goff . The statement that Judge Folger is to be the Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of disfavor in this region . Gen. Garfield 's secretaries are preparing three large packing cases of letters to be taken to Washington . The President-elect has received 8,000 or 10,0 ) 0 letters since the Chicago convention , and takes with him only such as can be used in the future . All arrangements for the trip to Washington are in the hands of Judge-Advocate Swaim . A special train will be made up , consisting of four or five cars , one of which will be for Gen. Garfield and family , one for guests of the family , one for baggage , and possibly one for correspondents of the leading newspapers . The train will be run on a special card , stopping only at important Points . There are a great many friends in Ohio who would be pleased to make the trip with the General , but only such as will be of use to him on the way will be able to go . There has been a slight decrease of late in the number of unimportant visitors at Mentor , as the office-seekers have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance is to push it now . Gen. Garfield has put all applications aside , and given a gentle hint to most callers that the time for their applicdtion or his action has not yet come . ALBANY , Feb. ** Folger left here this afternoon for his home at Geneva , to return in time to consult with his associates of the Court of Appeals on Friday . He was as reticent to-day about his visit to Mentor as he was on Monday . Reference was made to the very flattering notices published in the newspapers in connection with the report that he was to be Secretary of the Treasury . He said that he had seen several of them , and was both surprised and gratified to find that he was treated with great kindness both by Democrats and Republicans . Whether I get the appointment or not , " said he , " these unsolicited and unexpected compliments go for something . " Ho referred to the possibility of his appointment in no other way , and an effort made to induce him to say more about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would not talk about Cabinet nominations . WASHINGTON , Feb. ** Star , of this even . ring , reports that Senator Blaine had intended to mail his resignation to the Governor of Maine last Saturday night , and that a friend of the Senator explained his change of plan as follows : " The Senator does not want to place himself in a position to be retired to pri ? vete life . Such a Cabinet may be formed by Gen. Garfield that Senator Blaine might not bt disposed to go into it . Therefore , - he has de . tided not to resign until after March 4. "
