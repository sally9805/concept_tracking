" The good archbishop might well have said the same of the New Amsterdam on Manhattan Island , if he could have visited it in the palmy days of our merchant marine , before the insensate folly of American legislators had well-nigh driven the American flag from the ocean . The geographical situation of New York marked it from the beginning as one of the chief centres of the world 's trade , and such it is ever likely to remain , in spite of the gross damage wrought on it by overlegislation . It was fitting that so noble a position should be seized and colonized by the nation which in the seventeenth century had taken the lead of all others in the commercial world . It was fitting that New York should be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the summer of 1609 the celebrated Henry Hudson  --  the next great arctic explorer after Frobisher-sailed along our coasts in his little eighty-ton yacht , the Half-Moon , looking for some inlet which might give promise of a watery pathway to China . Twice already under English patronage had the great sailor fruitlessly undertaken the search for a Northwest passage - a desperate enterprise , in the pursuit of which , some years later , a wild and tragic fate awaited him . Now he was sailing in the service of the Dutch East India Company , and , trying a different route from that which his friend Smith had pre-occupied , he passed by the Chesapeake , hesitated for a day at the mouth of the Delaware , and , keeping northward , at last entered the magnificent river which now bears his name , ascended it as far as the head of tide-water , at the site of Albany , and , convinced that no Northwest passage was to be found in this direction , set sail for Amsterdam , to carry the news of the wonderful country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair as man with feet may tread . " Curiously enough , while Hudson was thus exploring , first of Europeans , the mysterious " River of the Mountains , " the gallant Champlain was routing the terrible Mohawks by the forest-clad shores of the " Lake of the Iroquois , " better known now by the name of the victor in this wild fight , and at the very same time John Smith , on the upper waters of the Chesapeake , was holding parley with another band of these tawny lords of the wilderness . Thus at one and the same moment were the first founders of the Dutch , the French , and the English powers in America pursuing their adventurous work but a few hundred miles apart , yet knowing little of each other 's whereabouts ; and thus were quietly sowing the seeds of the tremendous struggle for commercial and maritime supremacy which one hundred and fifty years later was decided on the Heights of Abraham .

Whether from a commercial or a military point of view , this noble region occupied the most commanding position in North America . It is that.part of the continent which sends streams flowing in divergent courses into the Gulf of St. Lawrence , the Atlantic Ocean , and the Gulf of Mexico . Through deep chasms in the Alleghanies , which run irregularly across it , those superb rivers the Hudson , Delaware , and Susquehanna flow into the Atlantic ; while the Mohawk , coming from the west , serves to join the valley of the Hudson with the great lakes ; and in like manner the lovely Juniata , rushing down to join the Susquehanna , has its head-waters not far from the spot where the currents of the Alleghany and Monongahela unite to form the Ohio . With such pathways in every direction , whether for peace or for war , the New Netherlands ( curious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and could the Dutch settlement there have been adequately supported , it would have threatened or prevented the ascendency of England in the New World . It was no doubt largely owing to this advantage of position that the League of the Iroquois had been enabled to domineer over the greater part of the country between the Atlantic and the Mississippi ; and through the divergent river valleys and across the chain of mighty // lakes these ferocious but long-headed barbarians in their bark canoes established those lines of trade which modern civilization , with its steamboat and railway , has simply adopted and improved . For a century after its conquest by the English , New York , with Western Pennsylvania , served as a great military bulwark to New England and to the southern colonies . The hardest fighting done in the War of Independence was the struggle for the possession of this vantage-ground ; and in the second war with England the glorious victories of Perry and Macdonough maintained on Lakes Erie and Champlain the sanctity of the citadel of America . The colony thus founded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands for just fifty years , and at the end of this period the population had reached about eight thousand . The " city " on Manhattan Island , lying entirely to the south of the site of Canal Street , girt with an earthen wall some ten feet in height , and numbering at that time some fifteen hundred inhabitants , had already acquired the cosmopolitan character which has ever since distinguished it . In the New Netherlands the Dutch maintained their national policy of unlimited toleration , and consequently in that cruel age of religious turmoil they drew settlers from all parts of Europe . There were Huguenots from IRochelle , Waldenses from Piedmont , Catholic Walloons from French Flanders , Scotch Presbyterians , English Independents , Moravians , Quakers , Anabaptists , and Jews . It is said that in 1640 eighteen different languages were spoken in New Amsterdam and its environs . Though the settlers were grievously annoyed by the Algonquins in the neighborhood , they found it for this reason all the easier to conciliate the Mohawks , and so they soon began to compete with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch colony of New Netherlands was not self-governing , like all its English neighbors . The administration of the colony was entirely in the hands of the Dutch West India Company , though the appointment of the governor and other high officers was subject to the approval of the States-General of the United Provinces . The settlers could neither make their own laws nor assess their own taxes . Ordinarily the governor exercised dictatorial authority , but on certain extraordinary occasions he found it necessary to seek advice from the people . In 1641 the murder of a Dutch wheelwright byaWeckquaesgeek Indian aroused the wrath of the governor , William Kieft ; and as it would not be easy to carry on an Indian war without having first obtained at least the formal consent of the colony , an assembly of heads of families was convened at Fort Ams&amp;rdam to consider the question of peace or war . A board of twelve deputies , elected by this assembly , at first refused their consent to an expedition against the Indians ; but some six months afterward they agreed to support the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redress of grievances . Hitherto the governor had appointed his own council , and had been wont to call to it not the most able and upright men of the colony , in whom the settlers would be sure to have confidence , but only the inferior agents of the company- " common folk " who were dependent upon the governor for their salaries , and were accordingly afraid to oppose his wishes in any respect . Often , too , the council had consisted of only one member besides the governor himself , and as the governor had two votes in council , this neat arrangement secured his omnipotence beyond peradventure . The Twelve Men now demanded that the council should hereafter be composed of not less than five members , of whom four should be chosen by the people , and that the " common folk " of the company should no longer be admitted to seats in the council . In return for these and some other concessions of less importance , the Twelve Men gave their consent to an expedition against the Indians . With regard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor 's authority in future , Kieft 's behavior was just such as has always been characteristic of despots . He did justwhat Charles I. , forexample , would have done under like circumstances . He promised to grant the demands of this little parliament , and then dissolved it , and forgot all about his promise . He did not forget , however , to proclaim that no public meetings should be held without his express permission . Having thus carried his point , Kieft soon entered upon an Indian war that was rash and ill-judged , because it had to be conducted with very inadequate resources in men and money . In February , 1643 , eighty savages were surprised and massacred at Pavonia , and forty or fifty more // - were murdered in their sleep at Corlear 's Hook . And as if to begin the war by making as many enemies as possible , the friendly Marechkawiecks of Long Island were attacked by a foraging expedition , and robbed of their corn . Warfare of this sort , to be effective , should be done with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exterminated the whole tribe of Pequods in one huge fight . The petty massacres wrought by Kieft only goaded to madness all the Algonquin tribes in the neighborhood of Manhattan , and terrible was the vengeance that was taken upon the colonists . The war thus begun lasted until the summer of 1645 , and at times threatened even the extinction of the Dutch colony . Nearly all the settlements west of the lower Hudson were destroyed , and the Long Island colonists narrowly escaped extermination . The population of New Amsterdam itself , exclusive of transient traders , had numbered some four or five hundred at the beginning of the war ; at the close , it had fallen to little more than one hundred souls . In inflicting all this destruction , however , the savages were well-nigh destroyed themselves . More than 1600 warriors were slain . New England valor was called upon the scene , and the doughty Captain Underhill , of Pequod fame , marched , in February , 1644 , at the head of 150 Dutch troops against the great village of the Connecticut Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nearly 700 Indians were roasted alive or shot down as they sought to escape , while of Underhill 's men none were killed , and only fifteen wounded . In carrying on a war of such magnitude it soon became necessary for Kieft again to appeal to the people , and before the end of 1643 a board of Eight Men was elected to confer with the governor . In 1644 Kieft proposed to raise money for war expenses by an excise on beer , wines , spirits , and beaver-skins , and as the Eight Men objected to this , he issued , without their knowledge , an audacious proclamation , in which he stated that , by the advice of the Eight Men , it had been determined to lay a tax upon these articles , and forthwith he proceeded to fix the amount of the tax in each case , and to order it to be rigorously collected . A storm of popular indignation naturally followed . The brewers flatly refused to pay Their tax , or to make any statement of the quantities brewed by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize to the soldiers . The Eight Men now sent over to Holland a memorial reciting the details of Kieft 's misgovernment and the miseries of the Indian war , and asking that Kieft might be superseded by a better governor . Such was the roundabout and uncertain way in which alone , in the absence of local selfgovernment , could the wrongs of the people be set right . Kieft was removed , and Peter Stuyvesant appointed in his stead . But very little was gained by the change , so far as popular rights were concerned , though the new governor was an abler and better man than his predecessor . One of the first acts of Stuyvesant was to espouse the quarrel of Kieft with the people , and to mulct in heavy fines those of the Eight Men who had been most conspicuous in their opposition to the ex-governor . But Stuyvesant had more sense than Kieft . He gave way on the question of excise , and consented to the election of a board of Nine Men , to whom he allowed a considerable share in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his rule was unpopular , while the Indians , still revengeful and unsubdued , continued to make havoc in the less-protected parts of the colony . Despite all these troubles , however , the prosperity which characterized his administration is illustrated in such facts as the growth of the population of New Amsterdam , which , after twenty years from the time of his coming , had increased to fifteen hundred souls . With all these dangers from the hostility of the Indians and the misrule of the governors , there came the dangers from the rivalry of competing European colonies . In 1643 the great Swedish chancelbr Oxenstjern , in pursuance of the wishes of his late sovereign Gustavus Adolphus , had sent out a colony of Swedes to occupy the country about the mouth of the Delaware River , which fell within the territorial limits included in the charter by which the company of the New Netherlands was created . For a while the Dutch contented themselves with a polite protest ; but in 1655 , after the death of Oxenstjern , no longer dreading the military power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcame and annexed this little nascent colony . To browbeat Sweden was easy , but with regard to England the case was very different . The growth // of the New England colonies had enormously exceeded the growth of the New Netherlands . On the side of Connecticut the boundary line between the Dutch and the English was a matter of dispute , and quarrels frequently occurred , until the English colonists began to wish that they might oust the Dutch altogether from their possessions . In so far as any principles of international law could as yet be said to be recognized by the foremost nations of Europe , there were grave difficulties in the way of any such proceeding . The Dutch evidently held the New Netherlands by as good a title as that by which the English held New England . The first nation which laid claim to the New World , by the right of discovery , was Spain ; but in order to set aside this claim , and justify herself in the possession of the Atlantic coast of North America , which the Cabots had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the principle that " prescription without possession is of no avail . " According to this principle France would have a valid title to Canada , because she had actually taken possession of the country ; but Spain could not set up a valid claim to the Atlantic coast of North Ameri*a , because , except in the case of Florida , she had never taken possession of it . In the seventeenth century Spain was in no condition to dispute this principle with England ; and as it was England that first announced and maintained the principle , she was clearly in honor bound to abide by it . But without deserting this principle England could not call in question the Dutch title to the New Netherlands . Under the charter by which Virginia was founded no English sailor had so much as visited the shores between the Connecticut and the Delaware when Henry Hudson first ascended the " River of the Mountains . " In the charter of 1620 , providing for the colonization of New England , it was expressly declared that the king granted no land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or estate . " As the New Netherland colony had already been in existence since 1614 , it was very clearly covered by the terms of this proviso . In the following year the House of Commons distinctly re - affirmed Queen Elizabeth 's doctrine , and laid it down as a principle of international law by which the English government must be guided . But although England had thus , so far as it was possible to do so , implicitly renounced all title to the New Netherlands , the temptation to seize upon the province was at all times very great , and by the time of Charles II . it had become irresistible . At that time England and Hollandnow that their common enemy Spain had been disposed of-were eager rivals for the commercial leadership of the world . In population England was somewhat superior , but in commercial enterprise and maritime strength the two nations were about equally matched . The belief that the commercial prosperity of a people can best be secured by inflicting damage upon the trade of its neighbors  --  a belief which many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal and ' unquestioned . In order to cripple the foreign trade of the Dutch , England , in 1660 , began to enact a series of navigation laws almost equalling in their crass stupidity and self-defeating selfishness the ' laws by which the United States have nearly destroyed their own foreign commerce within the last quarter of a century . Among other things it was enacP ed that no European goods should be brought into the English colonies in America except in English ships sailing ' from England . Not so much as a Dutch cheese could be carried in a Dutch ship ' from Amsterdam to Boston without being ' subject to confiscation . But there was nothing to hinder the Dutch cheese from ' being carried to New Amsterdam , and there exchanged for a pound of tobacco grown in Virginia ; and as the Dutch commercial policy was very liberal , a brisk and thriving trade went on between the ' English colonies and the New Netherlands in spite of all the navigation laws ' it might please Parliament to enact . Obviously none of these restrictive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dutch retained control of the New Netherlands , and this alone would suf -- ficiently explain the desire of the English to wrest the province from their rivals . When we add that the Hudson River was the main pathway of the lucrative fur ' trade which England sorely coveted , and ' that the control of this region was absolutely necessary for the military command of the continent , it is quite clear that the doom of the Dutch colony was sooner or later inevitable . From so rich a prize the ' hands of England could not be kept off . Influenced by such considerations , // qwq he sold the district between the mouths of the Hudson and the Delaware to Sir George Carteret , who had won distinction for his gallant defense of the island of Jersey against the Parliamentary forces in the great rebellion . In honor of Carteret this new domain was called New Jersey , and it was speedily colonized with Quakers and Scotch Presbyterians . Eighteen years later the connection between North and South was*completed by the settlement of Pennsylvania . In its mode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far at least as it represented the efforts of one of the largest-minded and most enlightened Englishmen of the age to carry into practice a grand political and social idea . Among our early heroes William Penn , the " Quaker king , " must always rank with the highest ; among all founders of colonies none save Winthrop has ever been so brilliantly successful . A man of extraordinary and varied powers , uniting after a fashion all his own the wisdom of the serpent with the purity of the dove , he contrived at once to be leader of the most iconoclastic and unpopular of Christian sects , and to retain the admiring friendship of one of the most bigoted kings that ever sat upon the English throne . His father , the distinguished admiral Sir William Penn , had been a great favorite with Charles II. , and also with the Duke of York , to whose protection he solemnly committed his son when on his death-bed . The stubborn and cruel James was in one respect better than most of his worthless race-he sometimes kept his promises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amply redeemed by his zealous care for the welfare of the son . No doubt this was largely because James 's policy happened here to coincide with his personal inclination . It would be impossible for any two sects within the limits of the Christian Church to differ more profoundly than the Roman Catholics and the Quakers . Yet circumstances were such in Penn 's time that this radical hostility did not prevent the existence , for a moment , of something like a tacit alliance between the two ; and the same ferocious king who broke the legs and crushed the thumbs of his Scottish Presbyterian subjects with all the infernal zest of a Spanish inquisitor , was glad to seize an occasion for setting free the Quakers who crowded the jails of England . This was because Quakers and Catholics differed so far , though in opposite directions , from the opinions generally held by the English people that they were alike condemned by everybody . Even the warmest advocates of toleration were wont to make an exception in the case of Catholics and Quakers , who were regarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Catholics had , for the moment , an interest in common as opposed to the intermediate Christian sects , and hence , both as duke and afterward as king , the Catholic James found it worth his while to befriend the chief of the Quakers . It was a singular alliance that between the atrocious bigot for whom such words as pity and clemency were meaningless terms , and the man whose great-souled philanthropy won the admiration of Voltaire , and whose faith in the ethical teachings of Jesus was so genuine that he was eager to see them embodied in civil legislation and made the corner-stone of a new Christian state . It is strange to think of the champion of truthfulness and toleration as a Jacobite , leagued in political bonds of sympathy with a family whose very name has come to be almost a synonym for bigotry and falsehood . It is this unnatural alliance which so kindled the wrath of the honest and impetuous Macaulay as to lead him , on hardly adequate evidence , to bring serious charges against the integrity of the great Quaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained than they are , could not affect our estimate of the work of Penn in America . As Mr. Lodge well says : " Penn appears in American history simply as the wise founder of a state , the prudent and just magistrate , and liberal-minded lawgiver and ruler . " The colonization of New Jersey by Quakers drew Penn 's attention to American affairs . He became interested in the settlement of that colony , until presently his mind began to entertain a grander scheme . He would found a new colony for himself , and in the interest of the noble principles of the sect of which he was the most eminent leader . Circumstances combined to favor the scheme . He inherited the claim to a debt of ? 16,000 due from the crown to his father , and there was no way in which such a debt could more easily be paid than by a grant of unsettled territory in America . The Quakers , moreover , were industrious and thrifty people , affording excellent material for coloniza // tion ; and as they were despised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comfort in any of the older colonies on American soil , they were sure to flock in great numbers to a new colony founded expressly in their own behoof by their able and trusted leader . Accordingly , in 1681 , Penn obtained from the crown a grant of forty thousand square miles of territory comprised between the domain of the Duke of York and that of Lord Baltimore ; and this new domain the king named Pennsylvania , against the wish of Penn himself , who would have preferred to call it New Wales . Of the thirteen colonies this was the only one that had no sea-coast , and as Penn wanted free access to the ocean he secured in the following year the proprietorship of the little province of Delaware , which since its conquest by Stuyvesant had remained an appendage of New York . Throughout the colonial period Delaware and Pennsylvania , though distinct provinces , continued under the same government , and the history of the little community was lost in that of the great ong . The charter which made Penn lord proprietary of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but differed from it in two very important points . Laws passed by the Assembly of Maryland were valid as soon as confirmed by Lord Baltimore , and did not even need to be seen by the king or his Privy Council ; but the colonial enactments of Pennsylvania were required to be sent to England for the royal approval . It was moreover , expressly provided in the Maryland charter that the crown should never impose any taxes within the limits of the province ; and although nothing is said about the authority of Parliament in such matters , there is no doubt that the proviso was understood to mean that the right of taxing the colony was entirely disclaimed by the English government . But in the charter of Pennsylvania , drawn up fifty years later , the right of Parliament , not only to levy taxes , but even to make laws for the colony generally , was expressly maintained . The younger colony was therefore less independent of England than her older sister , and the position of Penn was somewhat less regal than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , he was allowed the widest latitude , and nothing could have been less like the principles of the Stuarts than the principles of civil government which Penn forthwith proclaimed . The colony was to be administered in accordance with Quaker ideas , but absolute freedom of conscience was guaranteed to every one . It was declared , in language which to the seventeenth century seemed arrant political heresy , that governments exist for the sake of the people , and not the people for the sake of governments ; and side by side with this came the equally novel doctrine that in legislating for the punishment of criminals , the reformation of the criminal is a worthier object than the wreaking of vengeance . The deathpenalty was to be inflicted only in cases of murder or treason . The Indians were not to be molested , but their good-will was to be won by deeds of kindness , while equal justice was to be meted to white man and red man alike . In such wise , with his humane and reasonable policy , did Penn seek to draw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already so great both in England and on the Continent that thousands were ready at once to follow his leadership . To all who should come'he offered land at forty shillings for a hundred acres , subject only to a perpetual quit-re.nt of one shilling a year . So great was the success of these proposals that within three years from its foundation Pennsylvania already contained 8000 inhabitants  --  a growth as great as that which New York , with its superior geographical position , had attained during the half-century of Dutch occupation . Having thus noted the circumstances of the first settlement of the middle group of colonies , it is by no means worth our while to narrate the petty details of the local history of these colonies before the Revolution . A brief survey of their social condition more nearly concerns us . But in such a survey we must not expect to find such striking topics for reflection as have been suggested to us by the study of New England and the southern colonies . When compared with the sharply contrasted social complexion of Massachusetts , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great middle colonies seems somewhat colorless ; and in political ideas , too , this middle region was less rich than either of the two extremes . Both in general social structure and in political ideas the middle colonies belonged completely to the northern group , of which , in colonial times , Massachusetts was the leader . // They had nothing in common with Virginia or with South Carolina , save the common inheritance of English political aptitudes . Yet between New England and the middle colonies the minor differences were many , and here and there were of great importance . In contemplating the social features of the three middle colonies , we have first to note the heterogeneity of race , which was greater than in any other part of the country . The population of New Jersey , indeed , was almost purely English , the only exception-if it can be called an exception - being the Scotch Presbyterians . In eastern New Jersey a very considerable part of the settlers came from New England , and strongly influenced the general character of the colony . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large . In 1776 the population of Pennsylvania , with its appendage , Delaware , was about four hundred thousand , of which one-fourth were negroes . Of the white population rather less than half was composed of English Quakers , taken almost entirely from the class of yeomen and small tradesmen and shopkeepers . About one-third were Germans , who began first to settle at Germantown , near Philadelphia , but afterward occupied the western districts in such numbers as to form a solid German colony , with even a dialect of its own , the so-called " Pennsylvania Dutch . " These were all small farmers of the peasant type . The rest of the settlers were chiefly Irish , who began to come over in 1719 , and were forthe most part an idle and turbulent set , prone to violence and sedition . The negroes , of whom there were so many , were at first held as slaves , and were occupied mostly in domestic service , but they were very mildly treated , and were from year to year manumitted , thus forming a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indentured white servants , consisting of convicts , kidnapped children , and redemptioners , were very numerous ; but on their release from servitude their career was different from that of their brethren in the southern colonies . They often succeeded in getting into trade or in setting up as small farmers in the interior . Nevertheless , they furnished a criminal class which was larger than in any other northern colony . In the back districts of Pennsylvania scenes of riot and murder now and then occurred , the most famous instance being the insurrection of the " Paxton boys , " which has been so graphically described by Mr. Parkman , in his History of the Conspiracy of Pontiac . On the whole , however , the small farmers , who made the strength of the colony , were quiet and prosperous . There was a great export of wheat and flour , as well as of timber , and the fur trade assumed large dimensions , though less than in New York . Paper , linen , and glass manufactures were begun before the colony was a score @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnaces were in operation . All these things favored the growth of town life . In 1776 Philadelphia was the largest city in the United States , with a population of thirtythousand , while Lancaster and York , each numbering some ten thousand , were the largest inland towns . Turning now to New York , we find at the time of the Revolution a white population of 150,000 , together with about 20,000 negroes . The great variety of nationalities in the metropolis I have already remarked . But taking the colony as a whole , the Dutch and English elements largely preponderated over all the rest taken together . The settlements began with the city of New York and the villages on Long Island that have since grown into Brooklyn . Thence a line of Dutch villages extended up the valley of the Hudson as far as Albany and Schenectady , where were the head-quarters of the fur trade ; and at that point the line turned westward , and pursued the valley of the Mohawk about as far as Utica . All the rest of what is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was still under the control of the dreaded League of the Iroquois . Since the Revolution the central and western parts of the State have been populated by settlers from New England , and this has given the English race an overwhelming preponderance throughout the interior , while the city of New York continues to present as remarkable a medley of races and tongues as ever . The supreme greatness of New York dates from a period subsequent to the Revolution , and in its origin was closely connected with the westward migration from New England , the settlement of the Northwestern States , and the opening of the Erie Canal . In the colonial period the agriculture of New York was considerable , and a good deal of wheat was exported ; but foreign trade was always the controlling interest , // THE MIDDLE COLONIES BEFORE THE REVOLUTION . and in 1776 it probably equalled the for*ign trade of Boston or Philadelphia . But as New York was pre-eminently the frontier colony against the French , and as it was made the scene of military operations to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always necessary to keep up an army . Besides the British regular forces which were always stationed on Manhattan Island , there was a colonial regular army of 2500 , and there were more than 15,000 trained militia . These circumstances , as well as the actual frequency of wars between 1690 and 1760 , entailed ruin*ous expense and oppressive taxation , and interfered greatly with the normal growth *f the colony . In the colonial society of New York there was one aristocratic element which was in some respects more distinctly mark*ed than the aristocratic elements in any of the other colonies . In 1629 , fifteen years after the organization of the New Netherlands Company , it was observed that while the trading posts about the mouth of the Hudson were doing a lively business , nevertheless but very few settlers came to the new colony , and little had been done to forward the interests of agriculture . Accordingly the company issued a charter providing that any of the members who should bring fifty permanent settlers into the colony should be invested with an estate of sixteen miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rear . The right of holding manorial courts and other feudal privileges were attached to these grants ; and thus was *created the class of patroons  --  the Schuylers , Van Rensselaers , Cortlandts , Livingstons , and others-whose position was very much like that of a European nobility , as it was based upon landlordship and upon the exercise of local territorial jurisdiction . The patroons brought many colonists with them , they acquired immense fortunes by trade , and their descendants have to this day continued to form a conspicuous and important element in New York society . In pre-Revolutionary times the life upon these manorial estates was curiously picturesque ; but their feudal privileges were all extinguished before the close of the eighteenth century . In New York , as in Pennsylvania , there was no aristocratic class based upon the *existence of slavery . There were a few slaves in New York , mostly employed in domestic service , but they were hardly numerous enough to affect the tone of society . On one occasion , nevertheless , a sudden alarm of negro insurrection gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bid fair to rival for a moment the horrors of San Domingo . In 1741 , during the Spanish war , when public indignation throughout all the colonies was aroused against the Catholics , a waitergirl or bar-maid in a low grog-shop gave information of an alleged plot to burn the city of New York . Her statements implicated one or two Roman Catholics and several negroes ; and forthwith a frightful panic ensued , in which four whites and eighteen negroes were hanged , and thirteen negroes were burned at the stake . In spite of this terrible outbreak , however , the negroes were usually well treated , and year by year were set free . In this very brief sketch of the middle colonies it only remains to add that in point of general education the people were better off than in the southern colonies , but were very far from reaching the high standard of New England . In New York the schools were few and poor , but the sons of wealthy people were educated in the New England colleges . In New Jerseythe case was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns where the New England influence was dominant , and in 1746 the college at Princeton , which has had a most useful career and still holds a foremost place among American colleges , was founded by Scotch Presbyterians . In Pennsylvania education was at a low ebb everywhere except at Philar delphia. , where great attention was paid to schools from the very beginning . The first school was opened in Philadelphia within two years from the foundation of the colony , and in 1755 , through the efforts of Franklin , the University of Pennsylvania was established , and within seven years numbered more than four hundred students . In literary activity and general culture Philadelphia was second only to Boston among the colonial towns . The names of the two Godfreys , the mathematician and the dramatist , of the botanist Bartram , and the astronomer Rittenhouse , are still well known to fame . But by far the greatest name in the history of Philadelphia is that of Benjamin Franklin , to whose immense personal influence , supported by gifts of the most brilliant and varied kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very largely due . Reli // gious toleration was more complete in Pennsylvania than in any of the other cob onies . It formed a part of the original policy of Penn , and was very consistently maintained , insomuch that the reputation of it was spread abroad throughout Europe , and in the works of Voltaire we find repeated references to Pennsylvania as the one favored country in the world where people can be devoutly religious and still refrain from tearing one another to pieces . In concluding this comparative survey of the thirteen English colonies in America , there are two or three points of general interest which it may be worth while to indicate briefly . We have seen that the race character of the population was much more completely English than one would infer from the careless statements that are often made about the mixture of races in the United States . Previous to the beginning of the nineteenth century the foreign infusion was much less considerable than it has since become , partly through the acquisition of French and Spanish territory in the West , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Germany , Scandinavia and other parts of Europe . We have observed how the social condition of the various colonies was very largely determined by their geographical position and economic circumstances , while in the instance of New England , and to a less extent in that of Pennsylvania , religious enthusiasm and political theories entered into the case as important factors . We have seen two opposing types of society growing up in New England on the one hand and in Virginia and South Carolina on the other , and developing antagonistic sets of political ideas that were by-and-by to struggle for the mastery ; while the middle colonies , holding the balance of power , were , until after the Revolution , comparatively colorless in their political complexion . In these characteristics we may detect the germs of the whole subsequent history of the United States . Another interesting point is the inevitableness with which we see the primitive Aryan type of government through the popular assembly-of which England alone , among the great nations of Europe , had distinctly preserved the living tradition , springing up spontaneously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgia and the Carolinas as well as in the villages of Massachusetts , in de spite of all studied attempts to force upon the community a more artificial type . It is also worth while to notice the wonderful rate of increase of the colonial population-a rate of increase quite unprecedented on so large a scale . In 1750 , after an average of a century from their settlement , there were 1,165,000 white inhabitants in the thirteen colonies . A quarter of a century later , at the outbreak of the Revolutionary war , this total had more than doubled , reaching nearly three millions . That marvellous rate of growth upon which we are wont to pride ourselves as characteristic of the United States was equally characteristic of the colonies before their separation from England ; but it was not so conspicuous , because in a geometrical progression the larger numbers appeal to our imagination more than the small ones , though the principle at work is the same . By the middle of the eighteenth century the colonies had indeed come to be a factor of immense importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is. afforded by the tremendous struggle between France and England for the possession of North America . But while our attention is thus directed to the immense development of civilized life in what had lately been the American wilderness , we must not forget to consider the equally immense reaction of this fact upon the development of the resources of the mother country . We are so accustomed to think of England as a dominant power in the modern world , and to see the record of her prowess shining so brilliantly for so many generations back , that we are apt to forget how subordinate her position was in the sixteenth century compared with what it had become in the eighteenth . The London of to-day  --  a city of four million inhabitants-is twice as large as Paris ; but in Sir Walter Raleigh 's time Paris .  --  a city of four hundred thousand inhabitants-was twice as large as London . And this fact serves to measure the change that has taken place in the relative weight* of the two nations . In the reign of Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century old , insured respect for England from a military point of view , she was distinctly rated as a second-class power when compared with France or Spain or the Empire . In Elizabeth 's reign the victory over the Spanish Armada greatly raised her prestige . During the // evil days of the Stuarts her power in- creased rapidly , though the foreign policy of these vile and detestable tyrants was such as to cover the name of England with shame before the world . But between the time of Cromwell and the time of the elder Pitt-between 1650 and 1750  --  the growth of the physical power of England was so prodigious as to make her indisputably the foremost of civilized nations . Now this prodigious growth of the power of England between 1650 and 1750 was largely due to her commercial intercourse with the colonies she had planted in America . Their influence on the " trade and manufactures of England had been enormous . The exports to the colonies in 1775 were equal to the whole export trade of England , including the colonies , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual settlements may be estimated by that of Pennsylvania , which in 1772 took in nearly fifty times the amount of British imports which it consumed in 1704. " k But the effects of this direct intercourse between England and the colonies , great as they were , were surpassed by the effects which the colonies wrought upon England through the plantations in the West Indies . " Sugar , Mr. Speaker , " cried William Pitt , one day , as he rose to address the House of Commons ; and as some frivolous members began to laugh at this commonplace exordium , the great orator , after waiting a moment , again cried , " Sugar I , , in such portentous tones that those who sat and listened felt their hearts knock against their ribs , and were convinced , without further parley , that sugar , rather than the sun , was the real centre of the solar system . The philosophic historian who has come too late into the world to have listened to the eloquence of the greatest of modern orators will nevertheless be quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar trade during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries . " How great the importance of the plantations was to Europe in general may be judged of from the fact that at the time of the French Revolution France drew as much wealth from the single island of San Domingo as England drew from India , or Spain from Mexico and Peru . , t It was estimated that every * Payne , European Golonies , 106. * Payne , op. cit. , 79 . Englishman employed in the plantations furnished work for four pairs of hands at home ; so that , early in the eighteenth century , one-seventh of the entire population of England were dependent upon the West India trade , which occupied very much such a place in those days as the cotton and iron manufactures occupy in our own time . But this immense development of the West India trade was rendered possible only by the agricultural development of the North American colonies . In the course of the year the English West Indies did not raise a single day 's dinner ; but the American colonies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnifying beyond precedent the lucrative commerce of England . So important did this commerce become in its effects upon English society that it raised . the commercial class to something like an equality with the great landed proprietors , gave support to the political doctrines of the Whigs , and during the long and beneficent ministry of Sir Robert Walpole quite transformed the general tone of English political thought . Through such a complicated network of circumstances did England , between the days of Crom-* well and the days of Pitt , acquire commercial and maritime supremacy in the world . But for the American colonies no such re-* sult could have been wrought . But for them England could not have dictated the glorious treaty of 1763 , or have become the mistress of the seas .
