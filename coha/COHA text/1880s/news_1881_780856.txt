txt Alvin 0 . Buck was recently arrested in this city for participation in the star route frauds , and was bound over by Commissioner Bundy . Buck became a failing contractor in 1880 and was allowed to settle with the department for a small sum . His case was mentioned is Mr. Gibson 's report . The papers which describe the transaction are few in number . The route from Gainesville to Tampa , Fla. , was awarded to him for a term of four years , beginning July 1 , 1880 , at the rate of $7,497 per annum . The length of the route was 156 miles , the service six trips per week , and the running time only three and one-half miles per hour . He failed on Sept. 19 , 1880 , and then the department employed temporary service at $16,450 per annum , and afterward let the route for the remainder of the term at the rate of $14,690 per annum . The department determined that Buck owed the Government $26,374 , But before any action was taken for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sixth Auditor McGrew a long letter , ha which he proposed a compromise . He deplored that the immediate cause of his failure had been a storm , " My route for a large part of its length , " said he , " was inunElated and covered with trees and logs so thickly that a man could walk upon them for miles instead of stepping on the ground . " He also declared that the county authorities would not clear the road of these obstructions , and that for this reason he was unable to perform the service . " To settle the Whole matter and be relieved from my bond , " said he , " I think I can raise the sum of $2,000 , and am willing to undertake it and pay the same over to the Government if I can be released . " One would naturally expect that the Government in a case like this would look to the contractor 's bondsmen , but there is no evidence in the papers that the existence of bondsmen was known to Sixth Auditor McGrew . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy man , who is largely interested in Colorado ? enterprises , and II . S. Barringer . The bond accompanying the bid was for $9,400 . No attempt seems to have been made to discover the financial condition of the bondsmen or of the sureties on the contract , nor does there seem to have been any investigation concerning Buck 's resources . On the contrary , the next step taken was the following recommendation : OFFICE OF THE AUDITOR OF THE TREASURY FOR THE POST OFFICE DEPARTMENT . WASHINGTON , Jan. 5 , 1880 . Sift : I have the honor to inclose herewith the application of A. 0 . Buck , failing contractor on route No. 16,158 , Florida , to pay the sum of $2,000 In compromise of the liability of himself and sureties under the bond accompanying his bid on said route . The facts relative to his failure are so fully sot forth in Mr. Buck 's application that it is unnecessary for me to repeat them . The amount offered , $2,000 , is a much larger MI than is usually offered In cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . viz .. 89.400 . The fast that dlr . Buck has been a contractor for many years . and has always performed satisfactory service , that his offer is made in advance of any demand upon him , and that he was dangerously ill at the time of failure , should be given due consideration . Under these circumstances , I have the honor to certify the case as coming within the provisions of section 409 of the Revised Statutes , and to recommend that on the payment of $2,000 Mr. Buck and his sureties be released from all responsibility accruing from his failure on said route No. 16,158 , Florida . I am , Sir , very respectfully . J. M. MeGREW , Auditor . To the Hon. HORACE MAYNARD , Postmaster-General . This remarkable letter , although formally signed by McGrew , was the work of Deputy Auditor Lilley , who has recently been indicted . This is shown by Liners initials in the corner . The statement concerning the amounts " usually offered " in compromise reveals to some extent the way of doing business in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter to A. H. Bissell , acting Assistant Attorney-General for the department , in which he stated the facts relating to Buck 's service , adding that Buck 's bid was a very low one : that he had sublet the route for $7,500 , and that the subcontractors would not do the work . He also asserted that there had been a severe storm on the date mentioned by Buck . Mr. Bissell agreed to the compromise . Mr. Tyner then , as acting Postmaster-General , on Jan. 18 , 1881 , put on the following : I consent to the compromise within suggested by the Auditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Department . JAMES N. TYNER , Acting Postmaster-General . On the following pay , Buck paid the money . tiot only was no effort made to collect the full amount due from Buck and his sureties , but another way in which the Government could have recovered the money was utterly Ignored . Buck was a contractor on several other routes , and out of the money then due him on these routes and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made good this loss . There were influences which prevented the officers from taking this course , and therefore the Government suffered in this ease a loss of $24,374 . The new Grand Jury was completed to-day by filling the last vacancy . It is expected that the star route evidence will be submitted to this jury within a few days .
