Persons Represented . ARTHUR HESTER CHILLINGWORTH WILSON BELLINGHAM BRACKETT A SHIPMASTER Introductory Note . When Mr. Walter Damrosch asked me to write a Dramatic Poem , suited for the music of a Grand Opera , on the theme of Hawthorne 's " Scarlet Letter , " two important artistic requirements had to be taken into view : First , it was necessary to make the movement of the piece quick and eminently dramatic . Secondly , the lines must be not only singable in rhythm and in succession of vowel sounds , but must have a quality that would promote or coperate with a rich and impassioned musical expression . It is but fair to say that the dramatic construction was the result of collaboration by the composer and the author , and was largely suggested by Mr. Damrosch . Obviously the character of Little Pearl was impossible in opera , and she was therefore omitted . The great elemental story of Hester 's and Arthur 's love , sin , suffering and partial expiation is what we wished to treat . This is presented with the utmost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Incidents are changed , remodelled or transposed at will , and new incidents and moods are introduced . No attempt has been made to reproduce or to follow exactly the great prose romance from which the story is drawn . I do not suppose either , that I have adapted from Hawthorne 's pages more than two dozen sentences , if so many , in the whole work . My text is an original Dramatic Poem on the old theme . It stands , therefore , as a new work , which may be read for itself . But it is also designed , in every line , for music and song . I used an entire freedom in the form and the varying measures employed . To write verse suited to musical conceptions , and to interpretation by the orchestra and voice , however , is almost a distinctive branch of the poetic art . The poem must have abrupt changes of time and character , not always conforming to the traditions of verse meant only for reading , but obeying a large artistic law . In this poem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , measures and stanzas is brought into play . The form was moulded by the sentiment , passion or situation at each moment . Besides the metre and rhythm of each line , regarded separately , there is often a complicated word melody , or a scheme of emphases and pauses , running through several lines . These three , as a simple instance , while having each its own " time , " belong to one continuous rhythm , and must be taken together to complete it : " For thee I would rule By thy shattered heart And truth forsworn . " Such " over-rhythms , " as they might be called , correspond frequently to continuing strains in the music . It will be seen , then , that rhyme is in many places not essential . Although I have used it freely , I drop it the instant it might interfere with finer effects . In other places , where there may be an appearance of partial rhyme , rhyme has not been sought for , but only that kinship of vowel-sounds called assonance . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or irregularities , are intentional , where regularity or smooth and rounded verse forms would have failed to convey the mood or emotion needing to be expressed .

No refuge , now , for my soul 's distress , Save the tangle deep of the wilderness Wherein to hide . Pause . Or else  --  ah , see ! Takes out a phial from within his vestments . Hester , herein I hold a key To the prisoning earth . Wide it would open the gate To a life beyond : For cunningly Chillingworth This poison distilled From herbs that give death . Who knows if God willed ,  --  Or hell-born hate  --  That I the potion found ? ' T is mine ; and be it a foe or friend , If its lips touch mine , my woe will end . Hester Hester ( aside ) . No , no . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from my lips ,  --  Not those of death , that strike thee dumb . Why here abide ? Is the world not wide ? Nay ; bend thy steps to the path of the sea ! It bore thee hither , and so again May carry thee hence , to make thee free . Arthur . Arthur . I can not go ! No strength have I To battle longer ; Far , far from thee To toil and strive new life to find . The endless pain Of sin unspoken my steps would track And fling me prone . Ah , think !  --  in distant lands to wander ; Exiled , unknown To die ! Hester Hester ( aside ) . Thou shalt not go alone ! Arthur . Arthur . Hester ! Hester . Hester . With thee I go ! We look not back , But forth with brave endeavor . To thee my strength I lend : My arm will shelter , my love enfold thee . No siren of death from me can withhold thee . Let our hearts take wing  --  As here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Tearing off the Scarlet Letter , she throws it far from her . The white hood , dropping from her head , lets her hair fall loose . Strong are we and young : Ay ; thou art so , my friend . And dost thou not still find in me The beauty once to thee so dear ? Arthur . Arthur . O Hester ! the glow Of thy love my love of life renews . Thy blood beats warm : With thee I brave the storm ! At last we are free : The cloud of sorrow fades far behind us , And never the mist of the future shall blind us . Hester . Hester . Ay ; the past is gone ! We look to the coming years ; Since grief is done with , and dawn Makes joy of our midnight fears . Arthur . Arthur . Thro ' the forest the sunshine breaks , In a flood of radiance rolled ; And within us the splendor awakes Of happiness yet untold . Ah , Hester , the golden ray Of hope shines bright in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wings of a ship in the bay Wait but for the winds to arise , And waft us , with blessing divine , Far from this land of death . Arthur . Arthur . O love ! each tone of thine To me is heaven 's breath ! Hester and Arthur . Hester and Arthur . Quick , let us haste From the desert waste And lingering shadows of olden sorrow , To follow the star of a golden morrow ! The white sail gleams With a light of dreams ; It beckons us on with gladdening hope , No more in anguish dark to grope . To a land of new life The ship 's prow speeds ; Nor omens drear in its flight it heeds : For grief is but foam in the sharp keel 's furrow  --  Quick , then , escape ! Nor cast One glance at the stormy past ! Curtain . ACT III . The Market-Place , as in Act I , with view of harbor at back .

Those of the people who are nearest her , shrink away . CHORUS . Puritans . Puritans . The sign of thy sin A magic circle has drawn around thee ; Scorn ever shall hound thee : Away ; away ! They leave the stage . Hester . Hester . Alone ? ay , gladly ; For not , as once , an outcast prone I lie at your feet . My freedom I greet , And move apart  --  no longer sadly !

Soon , soon beyond your reach , Harsh people merciless , I fly to the whispering tide And the loved one 's caress . Yon dark mysterious sea will hide My wrong and my happiness From your evil speech ! To the Shipmaster , who has come near her . God greet thee ! All is well ? Shipmaster . Shipmaster . Ay , mistress ; if I dare say so ! I have it on truth of a witch 's word ; And witches , I 've heard , Know darkness from light .

Is it truly so ? Then darkly I grope . Didst thou not say he flies in fear Of hurt from the Puritan Fathers here ? If wrong he has wrought , How can his presence with blessing be fraught ? Still  --  the better , say I , if saint he be ! Since thou spokest , last night , Of passage flight , Yon old leech came to seek a berth . He , too , it seems , would cross the earth . If saint and doctor together go , Fair winds indeed must blow . Hester Hester ( aside ) . Ah , worse than death those words presage ! To Shipmaster Yon leech ! What mean you ? Shipmaster . Shipmaster . Why , he  --  the old chirurgeon mage : Know you not ?  --  Chillingworth . Hester . Hester . Then he , too , has seen you ? Dost tell me now , that he will sail With us on your ship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And gladsome weather , To these bitter folk we 'll give the slip . Is it not well done ? He ,  --  the hump-shouldered one  --  Long has he known your friend : They 've dwelt together . The leech will cling to him unto the end . He leaves her and mingles with the crowd . Hester . Hester . Lost , lost , then . All is lost ! Nor in this New World solitude , Or amid-sea tossed , Can we the black enchantment elude ! She perceives Chillingworth at the opposite side of the market-place , smiling at her with vindictive meaning . O devil-face and mocking smile ! Where watchful malice ever lurks !  --  What serpent in that heart of guile So sombre dwells and slyly works ,  --  Sharp gleaming on me from his eyes ? Our plot he unriddles ; our hope forestalls , With craft unknown . Closer he holds us than prison-walls : Hate is harder than stone . Ah , if unto Arthur One word of warning I might but speak !

( crouching in despair on the Pillory steps ) . In vain the wile Of flight or turning ; And wasted all her woeful cries ! For unto my hate , like incense burning , Her flame of agony still doth rise . The last word is spoken ; Her last hope broken ; Her with her lover henceforth I hold In the mesh of my net . They shall render me yet A heavier price of their wrong , than gold . And what can their anguish weigh ' Gainst the hurt to my hidden pride ? Or go they or stay , My vengeance they still must abide , And in torture burn ;  --  For all entreating of pity I spurn . Chorus Chorus ( behind the scenes ) . How gayly they play !

Bellingham , Endicott and the others arrange themselves near Church , at back . Chorus . Chorus . Behold our pastor  --  Dear Master Arthur . And yet his face  --  how pale ! A shadow sable Draws round him as he advances . Nay : these are fancies ; For see how firm , erect He steps ,  --  as though some purpose high His weakness were sustaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his forces frail To bring us here His treasure of teaching , And bounteous preaching  --  Sweet thoughts upon us raining . Welcome , our pastor : hail  --  Our hope that can not fail ! Enter Arthur , with Wilson . Bellingham , Endicott and the others wait for Arthur to approach the Church , through the lane which they have formed . Arthur , standing erect , yet apparently weak physically , pauses . Then , instead of going towards the Church , he turns ; crosses the stage slowly , and beckons to Hester . Arthur . Arthur . Hester , come hither : My Hester  --  come ! Hester , who till now has remained where she was , half crouching in despair , draws herself up and moves towards him slowly , as if spell-bound . Chill . Chill.

Some phantasy strange , pursuing The blameless mind , his reason has shaken ! Arthur . Arthur . Come , Hester Prynne , Thou who knowest my sin ; Ay , Hester , come in His name , So terrible , yet in mercy so mild , Who has granted me grace At the final hour to proclaim My wickedness here , and face to face , The evil so long within bemoaned , But never owned , Aloud to speak . Thy offered strength around me twine ; But let it obey the will divine ! Ah , Hester , I need thee ; For stricken , weary and weak , Now at the end , Tho ' it be but with steps of a little child ,  --  Yon scaffold with thee will I ascend .

Arthur , Arthur , this magic forsake : To thy true self awake ! Arthur Arthur ( standing with Hester on Pillory ) . O people of New England ! Ye still who love me , And holy have deemed me ! Your pastor behold , Not as you long have dreamed me , But , as heaven shines high above me ,  --  So of all sinners the lowest . Thou shalt reap as thou sowest ! From falsehood 's seed I garner disgrace : But , lo , I uproot the shriveled weed , And the flower of truth blooms here , in its place ! The Scarlet Letter that Hester wears  --  Ye have shuddered at , long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that fierce fire Of smothered wrong That , night and day , With flaming despairs My breast has scarred , and branded my soul ! Her fellow in sin , I have won my desire And reached my goal ; For I stand now beside her , The debt of my guilt 's confession to pay , So long denied her . If any here still God 's judgment deny , Here now ere I die Let them witness his will In the blood-red mark revealed on my breast : The Scarlet Letter  --  behold ! Tears away the ministerial band from before his breast , and sinks backward , supported by Hester . Chorus . Chorus . O wonder ! Weird and awful sign ! Saw you the living token Baleful blazing , over his heart Tracing its fearful sanguine line ? If truth he has spoken  --  Ah , pity accord !

Hester . O Arthur , look not afar from me ! Here close am I , and my love replies To the light of thine eyes . Turn thou not away ! Ah , whither , then , does thy spirit stray ? Arthur . Arthur . To the land of the fountain unending Of peace my soul is wending . Where sorrow ne'er draws breath . Ay , far to wander we planned , Dear Hester  --  thou and I  --  To a foreign strand . But now I voyage beyond the sky  --  To that home I seek , the land Of death ! Hester . Hester . Wait , Arthur ! Wait ! For dost thou not remember , I told thee in the forest Thou shalt not go alone ? Arthur sighs , looks at her longingly , then dies . Ha ! Hast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dearest one  --  O soul beloved ? Takes out from her bosom the poison phial . Thee , then , I 'll follow ! The poignant draught Brewed by our enemy 's fateful craft , Will give me release . Thou , too , dear Arthur , Didst from it seek freedom ; And I sought to save thee . ' Twill save me from life : And sweet to my lips its coldness comes , As the cool winds that blow From mountains white forever with snow . Thou shalt not go alone ! She drinks the poison and dies . Chorus . Chorus . Hush , hush ! Their souls are fled . Peace unto the dead ! The flower of sacrifice Blooms in no earthly garden . Thou , Hester , over us triumph hast won ; Towards mercy turning our sullen hate . Thou , Arthur , though repenting late ,  --  May God thee pardon ! End of the Scarlet Letter.
