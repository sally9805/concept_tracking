A PARIS EXPOSITION IN DISHABILLE . I THINK I had come abroad a little Exposition - proof . I have established myself near this one , it is true , but that is rather for the thoroughly French quarter , the open space and good air , and especially for the noble gilded dome of the Invalides , which manages to shine into my windows with a perpetual hint of sunshine even when the weather is bad , - and Heaven knows Paris winter weather is bad enough . I was here at the Exposition of 1878 , and my printed impressions of it must still survive somewhere in the back file of The Atlantic . What with that and some other experiences , and having no more than the usual fondness for crowds , I assure the reader that if this very latest Paris Exposition // and I find ourselves together , it is pure coincidence , and through no collusion of ours . But it is impossible to keep one 's attention withdrawn from it . The great thing , in the first place , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is no affair of a clique , no mere ephemeral mammoth show got up by a few enterprising individuals apart , but it is the hobby of the people , the parties of all shades . They look upon it with veneration ; it is sacred ; it is an explosion of patriotism and the national pride in a direction in which France knows it can excel , though it has been so sorely humiliated elsewhere . Naturally , all the journals are full of it , and full too of everything connected with the centenary of the Revolution which its date commemorates . The eighteenth century is getting a very thorough revival . The Matin , for instance , a journal which adopts some of the best features of the American plan without adopting the worst also , gives every day a r6sam6 of events on the corresponding day in 1789 . I was amused to find there , lately , as a detail among others , the alleged origin of a familiar expression which has seen hard service , it appears , in more languages than ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , called the Memoirs of a Young Girl , contained the statement that the young girl was born of poor but honest parents : " Cette jeune fille , n6e de parents honn*tes mais pauvres , est 6lev&amp; , " etc . The Matin desired to salute the birth and the centennial of this time-honored form of description ; but I think it over-sanguine in being content to carry its researches no further back , just as I think M. de Goncourt and some others over-sanguine in the appeal they make , with their handsome illustrated books on the Revolution , to a public which seems more than half inclined to retrograde from republican institutions . Politics turn upon the Exposition , or rather turn around it ; for it is put forward between the combatants as the women and children sometimes used to be in old days , to keep them from falling upon each other at once . The most damaging statement against General Boulanger by his enemies is to say that he has designs upon the Exposition ; while his proudest reply is that the industrial interests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is peace , " and that nothing in the world would induce him to harm the enterprise . There are those who think , since the late overwhelming demonstration in his favor , that Boulanger himself , as President or mayhap as dictator , will open the Exposition , though President Carnot 's term does not expire till 1892 . There are even those who think it will not open at all , but that some ruthless bombshell will drop into it , and shatter its dainty array of the arts of peace to finders . Fancy , in that case , the exceptional position of one who has been almost the only witness of an international Exposition prepared for millions ! I by no means covet the distinction , nor indeed do I expect to have it . While there is little reluctance to considering the possibility of establishing a dictatorship , a monarchy , or what not , of plunging into domestic or foreign wars , and of sacrificing all that makes life dear , yet there is a general agreement that these calamities ought to be put off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till the Exposition is over . This is a trifle finical , to be sure , and somewhat like the qualms of the condemned who are particular about their breakfast just before being led out to execution ; but if the Exposition can serve as a bond for keeping the peace for even six months , its promoters will have builded better than they knew . In the interval calmer counsels will have time to prevail , and our French brethren may condude to put up with the ennui which is // so hard for tthem to bear , to recognize that all men and rulers are imperfect , and to jog along with a popular republic , - never the most brilliant form of government , - after the American fashion . Some of the heavy material for the Exposition , hauled by strong teams of Norman and Breton horses , was passing our way all the autumn and winter . The driver of one of the teams used to have a pet bull-dog standing upright on the back of his leading steed . There was a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to block a busy tramway line as if they had been operating in the narrowest street of New York or Boston . Down by Louis XV . ' s Military School , at the corner below us , where various tramways and omnibuses concentrate , are always to be seen some of the confused features of the great Vanity Fair , rising above the high palisade behind which it is being prepared ; especially an immense glass edifice , the Palais des Machines , which is to be its principal triumph . Paris gains something tangible from each of its Expositions , and has something to show for its money . Just as we find scattered about the country various boulders , which , since they have no connection with the ordinary strata of the place , we know to have been left there by former geological periods , so Paris has many very notable edifices which remain to her as the heritage from past Expositions . Thus the Palais de l'Industrie , where the annual Salon is held ; the Pavillon de Paris alongside it , convenient for such smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive palace , with sweeping wings , which crowns the slope of the Trocadero , all trace their origin to such a source . Now , finally , it is said that this Palace of Machines is to be left over by this one , to make the most magnificent of covered exercise grounds for the military insti tution across the way . My interest persists in attaching itself most to the long Military School , however , its serious facade now dingy with age . One day , as I looked , a stirring cavalcade came pouring out of its barrack-gates . There was reginient after regiment of heavy cuirassiers in their brass helmets , a costume not unlike that they wore at Waterloo ; the officers riding in their midst draped in their cloaks , and the colors nodding nonchalantly this way and that , like some baleful , sagacious sort of divinities . Behind them , in another dress , familiar since Sebastopol and Solferino , came drumming long regiments of infantry . All looked very deft and business-like , in this year of grace and the peaceful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School has something to do with its attraction . I am told - for I have not tried personally - that you have first to apply to your minister , he to the Secretary for Foreign Affairs , and he to the Minister of War , and then - you are refused . There is no telling , in these times , who may or may not be a German spy , and everything connected with military life is guarded with the most jealous care . There is going to be a special exhibition of the material of the art of war , among the thick settlement of buildings devoted to the French colonies , on the esplanade of the Invalides ; but one may judge , partly from the medieval gateway , with portcullis and drawbridge , set up before it , that it is likely to be largely retrospective , and neither the pattern of the Lebel rifle nor any other important state secret will be betrayed . I was coming home from a reception of the President of the republic , an occasion provocative of speculation as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulanger should he find himself installed in those comfortable parlors and the long , palm-bordered conservatory of the Palace of the Elysde. // It was late at night , and our street was quiet and deserted , when I saw suddenly loom up before me a procession of large trees , leafless , nodding , and moving onwards . They were going to adorn the grounds of the Exposition . " If Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane , " I was obliged to mutter , then indeed it is time to take an interest in this irrepressible Exposition , which will not be overlooked . I went into the sacred inclosure , therefore , in the latter days of January , and I can truthfully say that I had no cause to regret my change of heart , but that it proved the occasion of a very novel and enjoyable experience . There was something peculiarly attractive in witnessing it in its formative state , and in having it nearly all to myself . Few other visitors came , either because they did not care to , or that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to get in . It was peaceful there in spite of all the work in progress , and , as it chanced , the weather was mild . The ground was spaded up for the coming gardens , and dug deep for the fountains , lake , and costly drainage and water supply . Long lines of magnolias stood protected by tents of coarse bagging , open to the south . Much of the shrubbery had been planted a year before , and was in a flourishing condition . There was some of my Birnam wood . I gossiped with the gardeners about it and various other matters . A brighteyed , vivacious old man , with a skin like leather , confided to me that capable men on these government jobs were paid only the same wages as the quite incapable . It was something like seven cents an hour . The chiefs of gangs got more , say from eleven to fourteen cents an hour , but they were chiefs only in virtue of favoritism , and not of superior capacity . Further on , the inventor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it forward enough , because he had not bribed hini sufficiently . I chanced to have heard not a little of this kind iff discontent from persons who seemed glad of an opportunity to pour out their grievances to a stranger ; and though the fault in some cases was no doubt their own , it was evident that self-seeking and favoritism were not confined to any one side of the water . I could only assure my glittering-eyed old gardener that things are apt to go that way in the public service . If I had not heard of it at home , I could have been more severe with it here . He went on to say that he had learned his business from an author , a man who had run through three editions ; and then he stood off a little , to receive my admiration . But , further than that , he himself was an author . Yes , he had written a treatise on horticulture , and had taken it to a publisher . He had simply wished the publisher to pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sales , leaving to the publisher all the rest of the large profits that might accrue , no matter through how many editions the work should run . " But what do you think that publisher did ? " he asked . " Il ne voulait pas , " - He did not wish to . And he drew off again , affording ample time to receive my natural astonishment and disgust at such conduct . I could not give him any great comfort even here , for there are publishers in America who will act the same way . I had been looking over his shoulder , as we talked , for he stood in the forefront of the plaza . The first great difference , in the Champ de Mars , between this Exposition and the last is that whereas there was then one enormous rectangular edifice that contained almost everything in itself , and presented a long straight facade , now the central facade is less , but five wings sweep out from it and project far forward . On the centre is a fine dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fine Arts and the Liberal Arts , which form the grander portions // of the wings , is another . The whole is to do in a day ; and the system is not set upon a stately terrace , rqached by uniform , for you go from Italy to Switgrand flights of steps and bordered by a zerland or from Italy to the United balustrade . States by simply passing an ornamental Each successive universal Exposition wooden portal . qwq platform , their stopping - place , others will go on to the top , making the complete journey in fifteen minutes , and carrying up some four hundred persons in an hour . It was a captive balloon , held by a rope in the garden of the Tuileries , to which people who wanted to make such daring ascensions into the air had recourse during the last Exposition . Stairways , too , zigzag interminably along the beams , which at a little distance present no peculiarity distinguishable from the rest . When one sees the workmen , in their baggy corduroy trousers , red caps , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these men are by no means angels , as they showed in their repeated strikes in the air against Engineer Eiffel , one has perforce to recall that staircase in Jacob 's dream , upon which the angels were ascending and descending between heaven and earth . By no other work of man have heaven and earth been so closely connected . Along both the first and second platforms of the tower , the latter as high as the top of the dome of St. Peter 's at Rome , is a row of pavilions , each like a large hall in itself ; and each side even of the second platform has apparently a stretch as great as that of a long New York city block . The eye is continually baffled , and continually returns in renewed wonderment at these vast dimensions ; and I speak of the tower when it has yet two hundred feet to rise . Certain patterns interwoven among the trusses for ornament are pleasing ; and though , when it is painted and gilded , the structure may look from a distance more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at close quarters , from being a most dignified monuinent . They say the tower is to have valuable uses in a scientific way . Meteorologic experiments can be conducted there under much more favorable conditions than on any mountain slope . The lower strata of the atmosphere , the formation of rain , fog , mist , and dew , variations in humidity , and electric tension will be studied by many sets of registering instruments at various heights and capable of being consulted at the same moment . Even the astronomers expect to find their profit in the clearer air about the lantern that is to crown its top . When the electric light is placed there to shine like a new sun , and the electric fountain is playing below among the gardens , cafes , and promenading thousands , the republic will have given us an Exposition that the fabled brilliancy of that of the Third Empire could not equal . For the first time on record , the inclosure is to remain open in the evening , till eleven o'clock . This is a new departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How well I recall , at the last Exposition , the way the drummer and his assistants used to approach , towards sunset , and , forming a cordon , " shoo " us out of the place ! Only a military nation could give such an Exposition as this in the heart of its capital , immediately accessible from everywhere . Paris has a great parade ground , the Champ de Mars , with one end bordering on the Seine ; and a smaller one , the Esplanade des Invalides , at some distance , forming an angle with the first , and also bordering the river ; and then , connected with the Champ de Mars by the bridge of Jena , the small park of the Trocadero . These provide most convenient sites for the installations . And furthermore , if need be , these can be carried along the right bank from the Trocadero to the Champs Elys*es , just as the exhibition of Agriculture . on the left bank , already connects the Champ de Mars with the Esplanade des Invahides . The ground is dug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; nor is it restored to its normal condition for some years after the event . The nation plays there for its industrial purposes , just as the engineers whom I watched on their ex // ercise-ground at Versailles last summer played at making bastions and rifle-pits , and as children play with pail and shovel on the seashore . The military have to suffer in default of their parade ground . The regiments in the barracks near us , on the Rue de Babylone , for instance , have been drilling for months past on our boulevards instead of on the Champ de Mars . Civilians suffer , too , in having their right of way on certain streets and bridges cut off for long periods . There is always more or less sentiment , after each Exposition is over , in favor of keeping things in their reformed and beautified condition , and not restoring the parade-ground to its military uses . If the troops can get along without it for so considerable a time , why can they not altogether ? The general government ceded the city a strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site now occupied by M. Gamier 's historic exhibition of the habitations of men , - and as the Palace of Machines is to take another liberal strip off the upper end , this view , it is quite likely , may yet prevail . The Eiffel tower stands four-square across the main avenue that extends throughout the Exposition . Its grand arches , something like a hundred and thirty feet high , frame in , according to the way you look , either the hill of the Trocadero , beyond the river , or the whole nearer field of view . The arches in no way interfere with the vision ; they seem rather to belong to heaven itself . I had expected to have to construct the Exposition for myself , at this early stage , from fragments and indications , as certain scientists find a rib and tooth or so of a mastodon in a swamp , and put together the whole skeleton for us in the Smithsonian Institution . But in fact no great effort of the imagination was necessary to conceive it already under a pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over the little gardener 's shoul der , was a veritable domain of fairy palaces on a great scale . It was seeing an Exposition in dishabille , it is true , but it was like being privileged to assist at the petit lever of one of the grandes dames of the eighteenth century , who received a select few while still dressing , and who were only the more beautiful for not yet having put on the complete war-paint and feathers of the day . Plenty of scaffoldings were still up , but through them the buildings could be perfectly well seen . " The earth hath bubbles as the water hath , and these are of them . " Not that the shapes are especially bubble-like ; the prevailing lines are horizontal . The material is chiefly iron , glass , terra cotta , and glazed tiles . The iron is painted soft blue instead of the conventional ugly red ; the terra cotta is pink ; the tiles are richly colored or gilded ; the sky shows delicate azure through the glass ; and bold grandiose sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light and graceful , yet free from any air of ephemeralness , of pasteboard and trumpery makeshift . There is no need of bunting drapery or the arrival of commercial exhibits to cover up rude framing or unsightliness of any kind . Everything is beautifully finished , complete , perfect in itself . If the Exposition never went a step further than to give us these lovely buildings , even then it would have deserved no small measure of our gratitude . The three domes are the three leading features and salient points of departure for the eye . They are elaborately framed up in iron , and faced with colored encaustic tiles . I acquired a taste for domes colored in encaustic tiles in Mexico , where they are a fine old Spanish tradition , and hardly expect now to get over it . All round the front of the Palais des Groupes Divers , or , as we should say , the main building , runs a two-storied arcade , abutting against the two high transverse galleries , the Galerie // Rapp and the Galeri&amp; Dessaix , which form @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Palaces of the Fine Arts and the Liberal Arts respectively . Its upper story is formed into a frieze , some fifteen feet high , in the Renaissance manner , which is of the richest and most original description . It is fretted in very high relief with a tossing foam of leafage , scrolls , and cherubim supporting escutcheons . The figures are of more than life-size . The work is simply in plaster , to which a general tone of old ivory has been given , while portions , such as the borders and the shields , were being picked out with gold and colors . The part where this mingled sculpture and mosaic was already complete , serving as a specimen of the whole , was like a dashing , lovely sketch , which you would like to keep in its present condition . Plaster is naturally not the most durable of materials , but , treated as this is with something to harden its surface , it can easily last its six months ' exposure outof-doors during the pleasant season . It will be a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found for reproducing this remarkable frieze in stone or terra cotta . Like the bizarre details of a dream which begins to lose its vagueness , I saw here and there a monumental stork set upon the angles of the unfinished domes , indicating all the sculpture that is yet to follow . I went into a shop , standing temporarily in the lofty nave of the Palace of Fine Arts , and was amazed to see there the lightness of these figures which seemed so substantial , and the great ingenuity with which they were put together . The heads , claws , and the like were cast , but the chief portion of the huge bodies was built up simply on iron framework , joined together in sections . This was helped out by bits of wood and bent twigs , coming still closer to the modeling , and then wire netting was stretched over the whole . Upon this men with large bowls of plaster dashed handfuls of their material , and completed the work just about as a lath-and-plaster partition is made . The plaster being tinted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough treatment , at a little distance precisely the effect of boldly finished terra cotta was attained . The wings alone of the figures must have been eight or ten feet high . There is no cheapness in the design , at least , of this plaster sculpture ; it is the work of the very best talent of the day . It is to play a notable part in giving the facades their final grand appearance ; but meantime I kept running across portions of it in a very quaint incompleteness . A procession of colossal legs , for instance , all of the same pattern , were to be seen marching , as it were , in vigorous military lock-step ; a few carrying their loose heads and arms on top . Again , a sturdy young woman , with a camera under one arm , representing Photography ( as an amateur myself , I felt especially interested in her case ) , looked on , with a rather pert air , I thought , at some workmen who were completing the lower part of her figure at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Exposition remains the same as at the last one . There are nine groups , into which everything must be distributed . Beginning with the raw materials in the usual way , they go on up to the highest products of man 's intelligence , - a plan which , as I have elsewhere maintained , would be excellent as a basis for education . I may here mention in condensed form these nine groups in their order : I. the Fine Arts ; II . tbe Liberal Arts ; III . Furniture ; IV . Clothing ; V. Raw Materials ; VI . Machinery ; VII . Food ; VIII . Agriculture ; IX . Horticulture . They are subdivided , of course , into numerous minor classes . Thus , for an examples you have Group II . extending from // Class 6 ( Education of the Infant , Primary and Adult Instruction ) through Class 9 ( the Printing and Manufacture of Books ) and Class 14 ( Medicine and Surgery ) to Class 16 , which comprises maps , geographical , cosmographical , and topographical apparatus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and silk goods ; laces ; accessories for the toilet ; dress for both sexes ; arms ; articles for traveling and camping out ; and more , each with a class to itself . It was desirable to have a neat plan of everything contained in the heaven , the earth , and the sea all ready made to one 's hand , and easy to ask the nations to conform to it , but the difficulty of finding the best places for everything still remained . The problem has been settled in the present instance by giving Groups I. , II. , and VI . each a building to themselves ; placing Groups III. , IV. , and V. together in the Palais des Groupes Divers ; and making an entire department each of Groups VII. , VIII. , and IX . The former two are accommodated in a series of pavilions extending by the half mile , in a double row , along the winding Quai d'Orsay ( which the very framing of the buildings deftly follows ) , and connecting the Champ de Mars with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the important domain of forestry , will ornament and be ornamented by the pretty park of the Trocadero . The strongest feeling , on first entering the yet unfurnished buildings , was that of new admiration for the beauty of simplicity . Who will make that doctrine prevail , especially in America ? Who will convince us that the first condition of lasting , noble , and pleasant effect is rather large , plain shapes , smooth and temperate in the matter of ornament ? The multifarious undergrowth of lesser details had not yet sprung up , either outside or within . The plentiful breadth , the long vistas , the imposing height , still undisturbed by the " exhibits " of the coming human beehive , and the neatness of the untrodden flooring , were very grateful . In the main palace , the light dividing screens were being put up , each space opening into the next through a graceful portal , and the smell of the new pine filled the air . The British section had in progress an uncommonly good screen of Renaissance arches , with carved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general effect is intended ; it is simply a succession of long , glazed galleries , not very high , and to be cut up into booths , like a vast bazaar . The foreign nations , as I have said , are chiefly in the wings . One is gratified to find the United States entitled to a smooth strip in the right wing , which contains over three thousand square metres of space . At present it is a pure tabula rasa ; it might furnish the theatre for an exhibition of any sort ; and one can only hope we shall come out with as much credit as the last time , which was very well indeed . The strip terminates upon two of the characteristic long transverse galleries , where its decorative entrances will be arranged . We have more space allotted us here than any other exhibiting foreign nation except Great Britain and Belgium ; commensurate room also in the machinery department ; and when it comes to the fine arts , more room than any other foreign nation . I trust there is no error @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to fill it worthily ; for in 1878 we exhibited only 165 pictures as against 726 from England , 644 from Italy , and so on ; France herself showing 2071 . The appropriation of two hundred and fifty thousand dollars is not exorbitant , in view of the fact that Mexico , for instance , has contributed a million dollars . The republican countries are perhaps receiving especial consideration from this Exposition , given by so very republican a government , and intended to fete at the same time the fierce revolt against monarchy in 1789 . The South // and Central American republics have chosen the plan of erecting separate pavilions for themselves , and these are scattered about the Eiffel tower in a settlement which will rank , like that of the French colonies in Algeria , Tunis , and the Indies , as one of the most attractive features of the exhibit . Their pavilions are as white and tropicallooking as plenty of lime-wash can make them , and the architecture is coquettish and dainty , with a touch of that Byzantine feeling which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her vast American possessions . The enterprising Argentine Republic , which has lately made so much of a stir here in offering its loans at attractive interest , on all the dead-walls and bill-boards of the metropolis , will hardly fail to improve in good style such an occasion , to produce a further favorable impression on the French people . With characteristic thrift , its pavilion is so constructed as to be easily taken down and transported across the ocean , for use at home when the display is over . It was really a risky thing in the French to ask the monarchies of Europe to take part in an Exposition having so distinctly for its object a jubilee in honor of that famous French Revolution which did so much to overthrow them . M. Jules Ferry , the distinguished minister and statesman , who had not fallen to his present degree of unpopularity , thought of this at the time the proposition was submitted to him by its promoters . He saw nothing weighty in the scruple , however . For , said he , " there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and those of the wild period of 93 . During the century that has elapsed , the former have found general acceptance , and become the basis of the constitutional forms of government now actually prevailing in Europe . I do not see , therefore , where the monarchies can find any serious reason for declining . The more so , " he added , " because France by the Exposition offers the most sincere guarantee for the peace of Europe . " But it so happened , in fact , whether out of hostility to the principles of 89 or not , that the monarchies did decline . The Orient did not bother with fine scruples , but of all those in Europe only the comparatively small kingdoms of Norway , Greece , and Servia have agreed to take an official representation . In this condition of affairs , the republics might well be treated with the more favor . It need not be fancied , however , that the Exposition is going to suffer in its importance or dimensions from such apparent neglect . These are only sentimental questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rests , as usual , with the people of the respective countries , who find their commercial profit in making them as full as possible . Committees were therefore organized , and in most of the great states the governments , being perfectly willing to aid the cause , once the sentimental scruple was got rid of , have dealt liberally with these private committees , voting handsome subsidies , which will be used pretty much in the usual way . Even in Russia , Austria , Italy , the Low Countries , and Great Britain , where the government has aided neither directly nor indirectly , the private initiative has taken hold with plenty of vigor and efficiency , and the results are expected to be not less striking than on previous occasions . Most of the greater palaces , with their system of high and wide cross-galleries which serve as spacious lobbies for them , are built upon a general plan ; to wit , a central nave covered by a skylight , and flanked by aisles two stories in height . The upper story makes a fine gallery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded of the large nave , and the lower is often an open arcade . It is satisfactory here to speak of palaces : the name is no misnomer ; the // structures to which it is applied are worthy of the name . Yes , it is good to be here . At present I do not regret being converted back again from the view that Expositions are tame , crowded , stuffy , uncomfortable to a degree , and carefully to be avoided by all sensible persons . Over yonder is the department of the fine arts , a thing of delicious grace and color , a magnified piece of jewelry , as it were , in opal and gold , a lovely creation in itself ; and presently this is to be filled with the finest pictures and statues in the world . And then the ceramics , and then - But it would only be to repeat a good part of the groups , from I. to IX. , with their various classes , to enumerate all the possibilities that arise upon a little closer inspection of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really a grand and delightful thing , such a vast massing together of achievements of the arts of peace ; and these spike-helmeted Germans , these red-trousered Frenchmen , this all-pervading militarism of Europe , - how wretched and petty in comparison are all the interests about which they contend or stand ready to contend ! The Palais des Machines appears worthy of its name even beyond the rest . What an improvement upon our " Machinery Hall " ! And the name seems to give the contents a human interest , as if the machines were a kind of genii who were coming to inhabit it . It is a grand , bright hall , some fourteen hundred feet by three hundred and eighty , raised upon pivot trusses , which sustain the framed glass-work . That is a riding-school indeed for a military academy . Perhaps some fortunate people in future days will have railway stations like this . You seem to breathe almost freer within the inclosure than without , since the sensation of great space is the more enjoyed for being a little bounded . Science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pivot trusses . They meet in pairs overhead , making a curve of noble sweep . They weigh tons upon tons , and yet rest upon such a small point that only the most trifling space is occupied , and the palace is practically all in the air . The tall blocks of Paris houses round about it look in through its glass sides , and are much dwarfed in the process . Men of about the size of flies , suspended on swinging platforms , are painting its fardistant , interminable ridge-pole . Rows of stout iron supports are being set up to sustain all the array of shafts and belting . An elevated railway is to run along the top of one of these lines of support , to furnish visitors a favorable continuous view . The machines will soon be humming and clattering here , and their palace will have begun its best uses ; but then what will have become of the charm of simplicity ! I fear I am going to be perverse enough not to like it then half as well as I do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
