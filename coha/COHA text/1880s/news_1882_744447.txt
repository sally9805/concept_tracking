txt The wholesome practice of limiting the bets made on a game of poker prevails very generally in all reputable circles . Among the professional gamblers of the West , where money-making and not amusement is the object of the game , no limit is recognized , and the innocent cotton-planter who sits down at a poker-table on board a Mississippi steamer and bets $10 or $20 on what he believes to be a good hand may find himself " raised out of his boots " by an opponent who increases the bet to $1,000 . The advantages of a limit in poker are so universally conceded by all fair-minded men that it is strange that the limit has not been generally introduced into ecclesiastical games . That there is practically no limit recognized in such games is well known , but it is to be hoped that the recent action of the Baptist congregation of London , Ontario , will have its effect in calling the attention of zealous Baptists and members of other sects to the wisdom and propriety of a limit . The London Baptists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the schemes for bringing money into the treasury of the fair was that of presenting a bed-quilt to the young Baptist lady who should receive the largest number of votes . The " ante " required from each voter was 50 cents , and it was evident from the first that the " pot " ? that is to say , the bed-quilt -- would be won either by Miss Goodacre or Miss Porte . The voting proceeded quietly for some time until it became apparent that Miss Porte was decidedly ahead . Miss Goodacre was engaged to be married to a Mr. Fox , and the latter , having put all his available cash into votes at 50 cents each , was so determined that his betrothed should win the bed-quilt that he threw his watch on the table and demanded that , as it was worth $100 , it should be counted as an equivalent for two hundred votes . This would have secured the bed-quilt for Miss Goodacre had not Miss Porte also possessed a lover of great devotion and pluck in the person of Mr. Stanley , who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Fox 's one-hundred-dollar watch and " went $100 better . " The excitement had now become intense , for it was believed that Mr. Fox would not be " bluffed " by his opponent 's $200 . This belief was justified in a most striking way . Without a moment 's hesitation , Mr. Fox bet  --  that is to say , contributed  --  his house and lot , worth $1,000 , and Mr. Stanley , being utterly unable either to " raise " or " call " him , passed out , and the bed-quilt was adjudged to Miss Goodacre . The discussion which followed between the respective friends of the two bold players was so heated and so destructive of crockery and religious harmony that a painful scandal was created , and the Baptist congregation , after a full investigation , returned the watch and house to Mr. Fox and the $200 to Mr. Stanley , and directed the bed-quilt to be given to Miss Porte . The ostensible reason for this decision was that there had been a fifty-cent limit and that no player had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  more than one fifty-cent vote at a time . But it is not denied that , in spite of the so-called limit , every player was permitted to cast as many votes as he could pay for at the rate of 50 cents each . Now , the purpose of a limit in any game is to restrain the propensity of bold players to " freeze out " the more timid ones , and this can not be done unless the limit is strictly maintained . For example , when poker is played with a one-dollar limit , the limit would be a hollow mockery were a player to be permitted to bet $5 or $10 at a time . flow can the London Baptists maintain that there was a limit in their game when any man could stake as many votes at a time as he could pay for ? If there was no limit , as was evidently the case , on what ground was Mr. Fox compelled to resume his house and watch and Mr. Stanley compelled to take back his $200 ? There is no pretense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressed the least desire to have his money returned . It may be that the Baptists had doubts as to the exact value of Mr. Fox 's watch and house , but that would not explain their refusal to accept Mr. Stanley 's $200 . The truth of the matter seems to be that the watch and house and $200 were returned simply in order to put an end to the scandal which the affair had created , and the act must be considered a weak and cowardly one . The necessity of having a limit:and adhering strictly to it in ecclesiastical games is made clearer than ever by the great Baptist bed  --  quilt game . Let us hope that hereafter no such game will be played without a limit and that in no circumstances will the limit be set aside . Were a few veteran poker- players to be employea to take charge of church fairs , there is little danger that any game would be played in an unfair or scandalous manner , and all occasion for scandal would be avoided .
