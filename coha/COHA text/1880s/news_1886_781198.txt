txt Hampered and restrained by the fear of English opinion , and sadly deficient in even a decent organization , the League " kickers " have suffered a pretty bad defeat in the national convention which closed to-night , and the League swings into a new year of life with the Sullivan-Egan faction in control , and the Clan-na-Gael the power behind the throne . The administration has handled its slender majority with great adroitness and granted the conservatives nothing except a platform which is as meaningless as platforms usually are . If it means anything it means peaceful agitation , but the men in control of the League have never shown any marked devotion to that policy . Mr. Parnell 's lieutenants have fought the fight he ordered with great ability , and backed up by the unorganized but powerful strength of the conservatives have saved the convention from committing any grave errors . But even they were not strong enough to overthrow the machine , however much they may have wished to see it broken down . It is seldom determined upon certain things . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an organization , ready to fit into their places and work harmoniously together . The Palmer House committee , which had undertaken the preliminary arrangements for the opposition , undertook a deal more than it could , or at least did , perform . When the Eastern delegates arrived here they found that the committee had done a great deal of talking and very little work . There were headquarters opened and there was a big book in which to register names , and that was about all . Ali the caucusing and organizing had to be done in a few hours , and naturally it was very badly done . The conservatives were opposed to the administration , but they had no way of effectively showing their oppositiOn . But they had numbers . and aided by the effect of the ill-advised meet , lug which the Sullivan Egan people had held at Ogden 's Grove , they were able to accomplish something . They won the thought ! ful consideration of the administration people , and though the results are something in their favor , they can claim but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was well handled ' and compact . Its leaders saw that some of the things which they hoped to do were impossible , and they instantly accommodated themselves to the change in the situation . Every breath of wind which should have gone into the sails of the opposition boat was skillfully diverted to the administration craft . Every demand of the conservatives was anticipated , and the plans which had been laid out by the opposition , were adopted by the administration . Had they had spies inside of the vaguely defined lines of the opposition camp the Sullivan-Egan faction could not have been better posted as to the plans of their enemies . They initiated every movement , and forced the opposition to acquiesce or be inconsistent . In justice to the conservatives , who werethus outgeneraled , it must be said that they were between two fires , and unable to move either way . On the one hand . was their ardent desire to overthrow the administration . On the other was their equally ardent desire that the convention should be orderly and harmonious and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the conduct of the convention . They had to choose between the two , and , sacrificing the former , sat quietly by with their tongues between their teeth , when a. word froth them would have plunged the convention into disgraceful confusion . Mr. John Fitzgerald , the new President of the League , is a resident of Lincoln , Nob. , where Patrick Egan , the retiring President . lives . - Heis a man of great wealth , inter-. ested in many enterprises , and a close friend of Egan . He was the choice of the SullivanEgan people , and though he is believed to be in entire harmony with their policy , so little is known of his views that the anti-administration faction was unable to rally its men against him . Father O'Reilly , who was re-elected Treasurer , is handin-glove with the administration party . Since he has held the office very large sums of money , contributed in this country to the Irish cause , have been sent direct to Parnell , instead of pass ing through the official channel .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
