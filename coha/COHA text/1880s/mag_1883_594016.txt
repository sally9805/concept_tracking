SINCE THE WAR . THE war , as has already been said , * brought a change in the disposition of the intellectual forces of America-one that was to be looked for , and in many respects to be desired . Our emancipation from literary England had never been complete . Except in isolated instances , we had caught our inspiration from the mother country . While we had opened up national sources of incident , we had fashioned our treatment on the English models , and had directed our researches into material after English suggestion . We were neither , to any great extent , making an independent investigation in our new fields of character , nor perfectimg any novel methods of work . Perhaps it was not to be expected that we should find a new fortit . Authorship is old , and novelty in its forms is rare enough . Suggestion passes from race to race , from nation to nation . It flashes from Greece to Italy , from Italy to France , from France to England ; then from England to France and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neverending reciprocity : Chaucer , Milton , and Shakspere borrow from Italy ; Goethe and Voltaire borrow from England ; all writers resort to Greece and Rome for hint and method and material . Why should not America-even full-grown and haughty America-find an intellectual stimulus among the masters abroad ? The end of the Rebellion found us proud . Not vainglorious ; that quality had been knocked out of us . We had had our days of boasting-innumerable Fourth-of-Julys , with squib and cracker and cannon to reinforce the voice of the orators ; but we had been humbled in one of those bursts of providential discipline that whip a whole nation into humility . The end found us proud , but with the kind of pride which serves as the basis of character . We felt a new toughness of intellectual fiber that meant the possibility of hard work , and an exasperation with foreign indifference to the valuable element in our struggle that indicated the necessity of home work . But , meanwhile , in gaining strength , we had lost time which belonged to practical affairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renewed intellectual energies must for years be given to the accomplishment of them . As for the making of imaginative literature , it was a * See " The Native Element in American Fiction : Before the War , " by the same author , in THE CENTURY for June , 1883. good time to rest . Two fields of novelistic venture had been . effectually shut off-the Revolution and the Indian . The Red Man had " gone West , " scalp and tomahawk , never to return " in force " ; while the events of the Revolution were trifles compared with those of the Rebellion . Even Washington now failed to " draw , " and it would have required more than the genius of an Everett to interest the people , now blase ' with battles and diplomacy , either in the strategy of Bunker Hill or the heroism of Valley Forge . The War of Independence , it is true , was still as important an epoch as it had ever been , and patriotism was as sweet and holy . But our new epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new patriots were our brothers . How could we ever again see beyond them ? Their story we could tell over and over again , and never exhaust its grandeur and beauty . We began at once to recount it in adventure and novel and romance . But it was still too early to attempt to idealize the men whom we knew , or to enhance by the forms of art an interest which Nature was intensifying beyond the possibilities of art . The Puritan was still in the background - an inexhaustible source of romance and character-painting ; and the Virginia cavalier of the old times had never been adequately pictured . There was room in either field for a Hawthorne or a Cooper , as romancer or as novelist . But all the conditions of the times forced the romancer out of the field and pushed the novelist in . Even before the war , we had seen these conditions accumulating . In every department of thought , men were seeking facts ; and when the war was over , there had grown up a mania for facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts in science , facts in religion , facts in history . What we could not get at with the five senses , we doubted . It is not extravagant to say that Michael Angelo with his angels would have been asked to " explain " ; that Raphael would have been held to a strict accountability for any seraphic expression in the " Madonna " that survived the friction of the nursery . Hamlet , the Dane , would have been subjected to scrutiny from the club window , and the ghost would most certainly have been pinned upon the dissection table . For we were in no mood for accepting Hamlet 's conclusion that there were more things in heaven and earth than were dreamed of in our philosophy . // This was the spirit , already come in before the war , and which grew in the ten years following the guns of Sumter . Such a spirit must be left to justify itself . It has a fair field and able champions . We only record the fact of its existence , and note , as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American fiction . The strongest first attempt to show American life by its facts - an attempt lying among the beginnings of the new method-was that of Sylvester Judd , already described . Mrs. Stoddard and the Rev. R. T. S. Lowell , who followed , have also been touched upon . The success of the three lay in their accumulation of home material ; their failure , in their inability to fashion and form it properly . They all had imagination enough for stirring pictures , but all were xveak in constructive art , in compressed dramatic energy . Bayard Taylor , with his wide travel , had acquired the power of differentiating home material from foreign , and , with his genial humor , brought out the eccentricities of classes . Any one at all familiar with the internal management of the old reforms , will recognize the truth of the types in Hannah Thurston and Woodbury , among the better sort , and of Dyce , the spiritualist , and Abiram Stokes , the temperance reformer , among the worse ; of the Merryfields , of Bute and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taylor trusted too much to his inexhaustible store of oddities , and so made a broad picture of a passing phase of our life rather than a dramatic evolution of character . The value of " Hannah Thurston " as a bit of truthful local characterization has never been sufficiently acknowledged by the critics , while its defects as a work of art are plain . The life , at least , was distinctly American and local . With Theodore Winthrop came a magnificent burst of imagination and enthusiasm . John Brent and Don Fulano , man and beast , were full of spirit and fire . The fine atmosphere , the grandeur of mountain scenery , the intensity of lofty energies , and the delicacy of lofty sentiment , were the surprise of the book . Densdeth , Cecil Dreeme , Churm , and Towner , in the New York novel , were cosmopolitan types which might as easily have walked the banks of the Tha'mes or Seine as of the Hudson . They were full of passion , actual and terrible , and the reader has no doubt that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wonders continually if the author would have chosen precisely these persons if Dickens had never lived . Such suggestion is idle when we are judging of art as art , but not unnecessary when we are culling what belongs to the home production . Time would perhaps have pruned in Winthrop his excess of imagination . The personal heat which entered into his style would have worked into his heroes , and the vigor which now goes into his statement of villainy would have gone into the villains themselves and scowled from their faces . We do not want the painter to be enthusiastic , but to make us so . It is the art of the master to move the figures in this mimic show of life without exposing the hand that does it . Passing over the few survivors of the old school , or of no school , who published but little , and the few , like Holmes , Higginson , Beecher , Robert Dale Owen , who entered the field for a moment from the more serious walks of literature and labor , but made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essayists , Donald G. Mitchell , who , in " Dr. Johns , " took us into the atmosphere of New England theology , and , under cover of the old clergyman 's roof , brought the spirituelle French frivolity under the Puritan frown , touching the austerities of New England with the fine wit and gentle culture of the best English essayists ,  --  passing over all these , we come to the year 1870 , which may conveniently mark the commencement of the new era . Before this year two or three of the new writers had made a beginning , but no more . Mrs. Spofford had written " Sir Rohan 's Ghost , " " The Amber Gods , " and " Azanan " ; Bret Harte had produced obscurely the story of " M'liss , " but had not yet excited a flutter in the literary world . Neither writer was known outside of the most limited circle . To all appearances , the magazine editors were in despair for good serials , pressing hard on the lagging veterans , drumming up raw recruits in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a conquering hero Bret Harte came from California in the summer of 1871 . An enterprising firm in Boston had caught the gleam of a new light , a new Dickens in verse and story , and with the most magnificent offers they tempted him East . His coming was like a royal progress . Almost without a hint from these enterprising wise men of the East , all flocked to welcome the new star . And the star was wonderfully luminous , equally brilliant in prose and verse . It flashed from a region little known , and yet peculiarly fascinating to the sober people of the eastern sea-board . In " 49 , " and later , we had sent our restlessly energetic men to the Golden Coast , and they had come straggling home , some lamed , some wrecks , and yet some rich as the famous Lydian king . Some brought home stories as incredible as those of Eldorado and the Fountain of Youth , carried to Europe // in the sixteenth century . Some came back reticent , and we could extract their stories only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . The part of their lives spent in the mountains passed for a blank , and yet the remainder was not continuous with the earlier fragment . Something unaccountable had entered into their characters . A celebrated clergyman , a strict moralist , long since said he had found in traveling across the continent that one got a tendency to disrobe himself , metaphorically speaking , of those wrappings which civilization has folded about the coarser human instincts . It was this tendency which had flashed upon us as one of the possibilities of the golden atmosphere of the Sierra Nevadas ; and when Bret Harte , after a sojourn of many years in the mint and mines of the mountains , told us of M'Iiss and Miggles , of Jim and Kentuck , and Tennessee 's Partner , of Jack Hamlin and Culpepper Starbottle , of Poker Flat , Sandy Bar , Smith 's Pocket , and the Wingdam Turnpike , we began to see the elements of life in their coarser forms . Here was passion both of the angelic and the demonic sort in its original , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and subject only to the instinctive law of the heart . The material was absolutely new - a new phase of life , and every individual specialized by the novelty of the conditions . Power of contrast in characterization , skill in heightening effects , the perception of oddity , combined with a happy faculty of engrafting it upon the recognized human types , the keen sense of humor of a new sort  --  a kind of devil 's humor suited to the diabolism of the surroundings , a tender feeling for the essential goodness of the human heart , running over with the gospel of grace into the very mouth of the pit ,  --  these were the chief qualities of the new writer . They were all Dickensy ; yet original observation , impressibility , and a fine power of imitation , had given them an individuality that was helped out by the wholly new atmosphere of the mining slopes . For the first three years , it was evident that Bret Harte was reproducing what he had seen , and had seen what he reproduced-always , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equation . " The scenes and men stood out vividly , and made as distinct an impression on the mind as anything in the English novelist . The mind could trace the individual features of each person . There was in the writer the same deftness of hand which we to-day see in the Russian novelist Tourgu*neff ,  --  the power of painting a grim , strong scene in a few words . There was a kindly humor playing over the scenes , and the bright light of nature flashed upon the canvas . The author seldom missed the artistic center , as he seldom missed the happy climax of a humorous situation . However much he might lose the moralist 's point of view , he was unerring as to the artist 's . But he was not an analytic writer ; he was as far from Henry James 's methods as a man could well be . He never analyzed , or reflected , or differentiated nicely , but simply laid on color . He had seen his effects in nature , and a felicitous gift enabled him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fearless of consequences , told him when he had done enough for his purposes , and there he stopped . But alas ! the habit of bringing about a climax quickly soon became a trick , and something was it the necessity of frequent production , or intellectual indolence , or what ? - something soon left on the public the impression of an exhausted mine . Certain it is that the best things were done in these early years . As the author left California behind him , and the scenes of " 49 " grew less vivid in his mind , they became less valuable as novelistic material . Yet what was already produced will always remain a vigorous , brilliant , original contribution to American romance . The style is old , and yet ever new . The analytic method can not produce the same effect . Such productions bear analysis no more than a first-rate pun . You can show in logic and in morals that Jack Hamlin and M'liss and Miggles ought not to exist ; that the theory of mercy and good-will to men clearly outlined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among despairing fathers ; but all this will not do away with the conviction of the reader that such a lawless society has existed , and that this may easily be a true picture of its mongrel features . With Bret Harte came that burst of national romance to which allusion has already been made . One can see how sudden and diverse it was , from a mere catalogue of the new names . Mrs. Stowe and Mrs. Spofford , Mrs. Whitney and Mrs. Ann S. Stephens , Mrs. Terhune ( " Marion Harland " ) , J. W. DeForest , and the Warner sisters , held over from an old time . Tro*vbridge had given some vivid war-pictures , addressed mostly to the young . Taylor produced " Joseph and his Friend " and " Beauty and the Beast , " inferior to " Hannah Thurston . " Dr. Holland , also holding over , but taking a new impulse from the war period , produced those popular novels , " Arthur Bonnicastle " and " Sevenoaks , " the latter especially rich in material from our newly-developed vein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dillingham were , // in most respects , strongly drawn and typical of a certain corner of New York life . Belcher 's cold-hearted hardness with his wife , and his pursuit of that other very doubtful lady , were a home-study as good inessentialcharacter , perhaps , as the best of those ventures which have filled the magazines for two years past . Jim Fenton and the Little Tailoress were of the favorite homespun type in dialect and humor , with something of the Dickens pathos superinduced . There was much raciness , native humor , and just observation in these stories , even if the effort was too evidently didactic to be always artistically effective . All true work everywhere should play into the hands of honor and morality , should coöperate with the other forces of civilization ; but all good art resents the imposition of a too formal didacticism . Besides the above writers , Mrs. Rebecca Harding Davis contributed a decided local color in her Pennsylvania life , and a choice perception of higher elements in character . These writers all held over ; but Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Silent Partner , " and " The Story of Avis , " was virtually new . Eggleston , with " The Hoosier Schoolmaster , " " The End of the World , " " The Mystery of Metropolisville , " and " The Circuit Rider , " was entirely new , and from a new region . The Rev. William M. Baker , Frederick W. Loring ,  --  who made a handsome start in " The Two College Friends , " - James De Mille , Julian Hawthorne , General Lew Wallace , the Rev. Edward Everett Hale , Thomas Bailey Aldrich , were among the new men in fiction , each finding a more or less public welcome of various value . Of the seven writers who hold the front rank to-day in general estimation , five had their visible beginnings in the five years following 1870 . The other two did their best work within this period . The beginners were , in their order , William D. Howells , with " Their Wedding Journey , " " A Chance Acquaintance , " " A Foregone Conclusion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jr. , with various stories , obscure work , lying half-way between essay and fiction , but showing the dawning of his art- these followed by " Roderick Hudson " ; George W. Cable , with " Sieur George , " " Madame D*licieuse , " and several other character stories from the Southwest ; Mrs. Frances Hodgson Burnett ,  --  then Fannie E. Hodgson ,  --  with " Surly Tim " and many tenderly pathetic tales , showing her truest sentiment ; and , lastly , Miss Constance Fenimore Woolson , with some short stories from the Northern lakes . These writers were all fostered , and won their first laurels as novelists in the magazines . To the maga*zines they owe much of the shaping , whether for good or evil , which their genius got . Besides these five , the two writers whom for dramatic intensity and power of passion I should place high among the seven , were Miss Phelps , in " The Story of Avis , " and Mrs. Spofford , in " A Thief in the Night . " Hjalmar Hjorth Boyesen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastoral life from Scandinavia , continuing that delightful burrowing *imong the roots of old English customs which had such a charm for us in Miss Bremer . We have often had this form of romance with us , and although Boyesen 's can not be called native work , the home life in it is in spirit and quality so nearly akin to our own that it finds ready adoption among us . The author comes a little short of being finely artistic , or firm in the grasp of strong elements of character , or energetic in the expression of passion . He deals best with idyllic home scenes and the lighter play of the emotions . J. T. Trowbridge enters strongly into the same field in New England and New York life from the social and village point of view , attempting no high flights , but contented with average every-day life and manners ; he gets a cue also from the war in some of his best stories . The spirit is , however , throughout genially New England in its best poetic quality . The Rev. Edward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and from the spiritual emotional side , conceiving a fine and lofty passion with great pureness of vision , and possessing intense projective energy , which reached its highest point in " The Man Without a Country . " In this story , the loneliness engendered in a sensitive mind by the social isolation which comes from a neglected duty or a sin , is thrust upon us with a force akin to that with which Arthur Dimmesdale 's moral isolation is projected upon the reader of " The Scarlet Letter . " Aldrich is charming and spicy as a story-teller , with humor and with poetical sentiment . Fancy and humor back each other , and each holds the other from unnatural excesses . " Marjorie Daw , " " Prudence Palfrey , " and " The Queen of Sheba , " possess sparkle , fun , and the true New England flavor , with more abandon , and with more sympathy than Howells would have displayed . It is not my purpose in this brief essay to touch that large and important department of fiction which tempts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only too often attracts the graver boys and girls who studied the primers of life a generation ago . How often we wipe the gold-rimmed glasses afresh to welcome Miss Alcott , or Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge , or Frank R. Stockton , or Horace E. Scudder , or John Habberton . Humor , // too ,  --  which is not fiction , but a serious fact in American life ,  --  is a department by itself ; wide , deep , and rich , extending from Diedrich Knickerbocker 's Creation of the World as far , at least , as Mark Twain 's tearful lamentation over Adam 's lonely grave . We may look at the anonymous novel with wistful eye , but for obvious reasons , we must let that , too , alone . But of the other story-tellers of various merit who belong to the last twelve years , a few may be briefly mentioned , although nothing like justice can be done to the detail of their work . Some of them are voluminous writers - dear , moreover , to the popular heart , yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for artistic excellence or projective power , or novelty and originality in any form . Some show only a promise of which the fulfillment lies in the future . William M. Baker , who fails to strike deeply in character , plays vividly over the surface of many emotions . William H. Bishop works in the Howells vein , but lacks concentratiqn , and , in roaming about for the thread of his own story , is drawn into a thousand curiosity shops . In " The House of a Merchant Prince , " for instance , one feels that the author is presenting a variety show , where the spectator is called upon to note " everything by starts and nothing long " ; yet it is a suggestive picture of a certain phase of New York life , with its diverse interests , its whirl of excitement , its ambitions , social and political , its rude rush for money and position . Mary Clemmer Ames is earnest , and in " Eirene " touches with skill the new chord of women 's disabilities and duties . Caroline Cheseboro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to catch the fancy of the young . Mrs. Lizzie W. Champney shows a quick ear for dialect , a picturesque faculty , and the power of reproducing , with the effect of documentary exactness , the spirit and features of old Revolutionary life . The Marquise Lanza , in Mr. Perkins ' Daughter , " gives to Mr. Perkins some of the broad , kindly western humor to which we grew accustomed in Abraham Lincoln . General Lew Wallace , delving in the lurid passions of the South-west and beyond , makes a strong picture . De Mille is side-splitting in the sportive eccentricities of the American abroad , as Mr. Clemens is , at home as well as abroad . De Forest , in " Honest John Vane , " portrays the temptations of a congressman , but is hardly at home either among the rural simplicities or the Washington duplicities . Mrs. Whitney still continues satisfied if she tells a good story and portrays girl-life well , as she always does . George Parsons Lathrop , touched by both Hawthorne and Howells , has a more natural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A wayward poetic fancy , not at all mastered in the early novels , and only partly subdued in his best book , " An Echo of Passion , " interferes too often with the naturalness of his persons . The novel above named , however , which is in the Howells vein , both in choice of subject and general treatment , shows the beginnings of original observation and a growing mastery of the real experience of life . Mr. Julian Hawthorne has no lack either of fancy or imagination . He has the creative instinct and more than the average writer 's ability ; but his early tendency to work in the Nathaniel Hawthorne vein seemed almost willful . It was the most difficult vein novelist ever worked ; and to approach it without a tool sharpened presupposed a willingness to " square off " against the very Fates . The author puts together the elements of strong characters , invites the Destinies to take charge of them , but refuses to let go his own hold . The " Sisters Three " everywhere enter the field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hawthorne 's latest story  --  the novel called " Dust " - shows a marked improvement over his earlier work . There are in it some capital scenes , and two or three admirable studies ,  - -  notably that of Philip Lancaster- a character , however , which is far better in the conception , as it appears to be detailed in Chapter X. , than in the later execution . Good story-tellers are abundant among us , and the number of sharp eyes and clever pens engaged in developing the various phases of our life for the magazines is something extraordinary . Some , like Colonel George E. Waring , Jr. , and William Wallace Harney , burrow more or less among war memories , giving some of the romantic incident , with occasionally a vigorous war sketch . Some , like Sara 0 . Jewett , have touched out-of-the-way local scenery and customs with picturesque vigor . Some , like Joaquin Miller , Fitz-Hugh Ludlow , Charles Nordhoff , James T. Mackay , and Rose Terry Cooke , have given to local manners and customs a bit of humorous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spice of the chivalric , are as yet stronger in the presentment of passions than in the artistic working of them . Their promise lies in their vigor of imagination , their hope in the sterner subordination of this power which comes with experience . Mrs. Mary Hallock Foote presents in " Friend Barton 's Concern ' " a bit of lovely nature-painting and a touch of true Quaker girlhood , at once spicy and pure . In the opening chapters of " The Led-Horse Claim , " she draws with charming skill and picturesque // power the approaches to the mountain scenery , and in the closing chapters , the quiet beauty and pastoral grace of " Little Rest . " The presentation of Cecil , with her genuine girlish qualities , and the dialogue in the ballroom , are excellent , while the conception of the underground meeting is strong ; but the shading of character in the men needs deepening , and certain occult lines in the story should be brought out more clearly in order that the imagination may follow without reluctance the line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vigorous burst of righteous wrath . His first book , " A Fool 's Errand , " gave the pith of a new discovery , and it seemed to be the author 's one book , favored by time and circumstances . But it lacked breadth and subordination - having mainly intensity and the novelty of personal experience . It was a succession of vivid pictures of a single phase of society , with scenes of fiery passion that bore the stamp of reality . The night ride of the heroine in this story , and the river-flood and escape in " John Eax , " the haughty love of Louise de Jeunette and the family pride of the De Jeunettes-all edge- mark the keen perception and the height of appreciation of passionate character ; but the scenes are not well connected , and the reader cries non sequitur continually to the author 's presentation of sequences , while the whole political discussion is already dead matter . When we pass from this detail of the more recent writers to the authors of more national significance , we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the interest swept . The Rebellion had upheaved the social fabric in the South , and the bottom was coming to the top . Old states of society there got an airing from within which even Mrs. Stowe could not have given , and the South and South-west began again to develop their own novelists , or to attract novelists from without . J. W. De Forest , in his Southern stories , attempted the bloody side of society there ; Tourgee , the darkly passionate and political ; Baker , the social and transitional . Cable , with far more poetical insight and felicity than any other Southern novelist has yet reached , made , in the Creole element of Louisiana , an absolute discovery , as quaint and peculiar in atmosphere as anything in Bret Harte , and painted with far more delicacy . At the same time , Miss Woolson had found in the North-west , about the Lakes , and higher up among the old French settlements of western Canada , a field akin to that of Lowell in Newfoundland . It is a curious thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented in the original movement of that people up the St. Lawrence to the Lakes , and from the Lakes down the Mississippi to Louisiana , - older than the movement of the English settlers , and impinged upon most markedly at those points by the latter ,  --  should have its chroniclers in three such kindred spirits as the Rev. Mr. Lowell , Miss Woolson , and Cable . The mixture of elements in the three quarters was peculiar . The mingling of tongues and religions was similar in all . All were frontier , and represented the conflict of races . All are now old , and present in their results the interest of quaintness . All are obscure , lying in the suburbs of history , and yielding a rich harvest to the romancer . The novelty , indeed , adds so much to our interest in the beginnings of these writers , that it is hard at first to escape the fascination sufficiently to do justice to the artistic work . The same thing may be said of Eggleston , who broke shell for lower Indiana , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These writers , like Bret Harte , are entitled to the credit of discovery . The new fields were worked with considerable minuteness in every case , but with varying strength . Eggleston worked with great diligence and indomitable good humor . His themes took a clerical cast , like Judd 's , and , like Judd , he worked in the bottom layers of society , among the strong , coarse , and passionate people , where the motive of human improvement is religious and not social . His good people feel the need of being saved , and not of being civilized . Unlike Judd , who felt the Channing influence , which was spiritual , fine , and poetic , Eggleston felt the Beecher influence , which was sympathetic and strongly human . But he was no more a dramatist than was Judd . He could paint states of society with graphic power , could sketch character broadly with a vigorous hand ; but the desire for immediate effect repeatedly tempts him from the track of a well-ordered fiction . He throws his strength into his beginnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is always tumbling to pieces . He has reserves for spurts and a genius for strong episodes , but that is very nearly all his reserve . In " Roxy , " the heroine does not grow , as she should , from the start . Nancy Kirtley is repeatedly brought upon the scene , but with no added power . There is no accumulation of interest . in the characters . When they have once been introduced , they are brought in at regulation intervals to walk through their parts , which they do with a humorous show of life . We are delighted with the odd figures , with the strong human feeling , with the picturesque points , and we laugh and grow fat over the healthy sentiment and good common sense of the book ; but nearly // all that a nice art and a balancing faculty would contribute is lacking . What Eggleston was for the coarse , crude , but strong animal life of Indiana , Cable was for the proud , fast-lodged , diluvian drift of Louisiana . It was Cable 's merit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element . In a series of striking sketches , culminating in " The Grandissimes " and " Madame Delphine , " we find a most unique people , treated in a thoroughly unique manner . The treatment is worthy of the theme . It is delicate , poetical , imaginative in a high degree . In all those details of art that go to the creating of atmosphere , Cable was strong ; nor did Hawthorne succeed better in producing a Puritan aura for the setting of Hester Prynne and Dimmesdale than Cable succeeded in getting a Creole aura for the working out of the impotent pride of the Grandissimes . The confused intermingling of elements in the ball-room was the natural prelude to the confusion of family relations , of family passions , and of race peculiarities . The pride of Agricola , the implacable spirit of Palmyre , the animal passion of Bras Cou , are shown in fine relief . They are all human passions , but with a touch of the Grandissime impotency , which was not one of cold latitudes , like that in Lowell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The finest part of the artist 's work , however , is in the nice shading of character between Aurore and her daughter Clothilde . Both women are beautiful . The elements of similarity between mother and daughter are many , as they should be , but the differences are clear . Both are children in feeling and knowledge of the world . Both have a shy , natural coquetry , to which is added , in the mother , the innocent finesse born of widowhood . They have some pride and very considerable poverty , and while the latter has something to do in overcoming the former , the part played by innocent , shy love is so deftly managed that we do not miss any lady-like quality of refinement . The dialect is another excellence in Cable 's work . We find in it the piquant charm of a lapse from the French rather than the lazy drawl of deteriorated English . The vocabulary is small and well utilized ; a few dozen words do a good deal of service , and in the end we might tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author to hold back dialect conversation except when it can be made telling . To all these artistic gifts Cable adds a stronger grasp on the fate of the story than Eggleston gets . But his poetic and antiquarian spirit leads him too often to step aside to illustrate graces of manner and fantasticalness of customs ; he pauses sometimes too long to give fullness to his picture of a passing race . Like Eggleston , he lingers fondly over the novel features of his theme , perhaps with a view to their present value . This is a danger which all original discoverers must encounter . When their wealth becomes common property , they will be called to account for their management of the grand passions of human nature , which may get a hint of quaintness from deciduous fashions , but are , after all , essentially the same the world over . By their work in this enduring stuff they will be judged as novelists . " The Grandissimes " will always have the beauty of local color , the tint of a poetical conception ; but perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was made subordinate . This is not likely to be said of Miss Woolson , if we may judge by her most perfect work , " Anne . " Beginning , like Cable , in an unworked section of American life , still amid the diluvian drift , she advanced her action into better known regions , pursuing the beaten track of ambitious authors . The opening of her work , in various pithy and promising short stories , was full of novelties . It was a rich development of the new ore in the picturesque America . There was an antique flavor in the old mixed society of the upper lakes . As she delineates it , the life was complete , isolated , charmingly picturesque , having as much that was quaint and homespun , and yet variegated with the milder passions , as Scandinavian hilllife . All this is reproduced in the earlier chapters of " Anne , " so that we have these people painted evidently by an eye-witness - their manners , customs , dialect , their mixed habitsscenes of summer and winter  --  the latter as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's New England . The occasional glimpses we get of the rugged outdoor sports in snow and on the ice , the Christmas festivities , the church rivalries - all indispensable features of that northern latitude , and all within the range of the author 's sympathies-are good ; nor does the poverty in external conditions , which lies over the whole region , preclude a wealth of warm human feeling . But having interested us thoroughly in the village life , in the two kindly old clergymen , in the thriftless Douglass and his unruly Indian family ; in Aunt Lois , through whom she has her rather spicy fling at New England ; in Tita , whose half-breed coquetry and full-blooded selfishness promise startling results ,  --  having got us thoroughly interested in the drama of this unique and varied life , and in the charm of the setting of it , the writer gets her sudden ambition to take us into polite circles , and we are whisked off to New York . It must be confessed that we should go with reluctance , if we thought we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lakes . But the French boarding-school and // Miss Van Horn soon reconcile us , and the plunge which the novelist presently makes into a rather indefinite and loose society offers her a chance to compete with Howells and James in the analytic methods ; and here the superior tenderness of the woman 's heart and the superior logic of the male mind become at once apparent . The story grows intensely dramatic and powerful-more powerful in genuine passion-an unreasoning , woman 's passion , that finds a way where there is a will , than anything in the production of either of those two sober-minded gentlemen . Anne* s innocence and charm and growing strength win us completely . Her honest passion for Heathcote , and the burden of her anguish in a half-foiled love , take us from our moorings . The passion is so great and so pure , that we silence our prejudices at the bidding of a woman , and go searching up and down for evidence that shall release Heathcote from jail ,  --  where he fully deserves to pass a six months ' term @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose heart he has played with . This is a strong testimony to the dramatic power of the artist . She takes a man whom most of us would recognize as a heartless flirt , and almost persuades us , yielding to the woman 's logic , to regard his offense as venial . Almost - not quite . Heathcote 's cold impudence in carrying on two flirtations at once ; his lack of good faith to one doting , though weak woman ; and his lack of honor in trying to win another from her betrothed lover when the engagement has been announced to him ; his almost criminal selfishness in twice putting a young girl into a doubtful position by which her good name is risked ,  --  all under blind impulses which he does not himself call love , stamp his character so that it can not be forgotten . Only a woman , who forgives everything to love , could forget it . With such a character we can not , in calm judgment , accept what seems to be the author 's conclusion that J-Ieathcote goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or some lower motive than patriotism , and we accompany Anne to the wedding under mental protest , only resolved that the girl for whom we have learned to care so much , shall have the one chance left her to get that blind happiness which may come to a fond wife , even under cover of a selfish husband . The author gives us the materials for judging the man , but paints love so strongly that the argument of the heart almost overpowers that of the head . Miss Woolson , thus , to our thinking , has this double chance of becoming our best novelist-fresh material , got at first hand , and a power of passion in herself . She has , also , as has already been said , something of the analytic touch . Whether she is carried along with the drift of the times or not , she is clearly absorbing what is best in the art of the new school , without altogether sinking the old nobility of the virtues in the vulgar realities of the present day . Quite unlike Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor with the gayest of banners flying . Pathos , humor , sentiment , and all the sympathies came with her first work ; sprightliness , dash , vivacity , and all the coquetries followed ; then the analytic fever set in and left her astray in Washington society , without a guide . Her own natural heart had at first opened the door to our feelings in their widest range . We got a tenderness at once for Joan Lowrie 's proud , sensitive spirit , struggling against the brutality of its surroundings . But Joan with her drunken father , Liz with her hopeless weakness , Jud and his dog , Sammy Craddock - these types were all marked out in English fiction , especially in Dickens . The author 's most tearful sentiment , moreover , fell far short of the heart-breaking pathos of Little Nell . There was but little that was new in the mining life and its low democracy . And yet in small details , like the empty dignity of the Rev. Harold Barholm , and the helpless humility of Mr. Grace , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the startling smartness of all the women , there was an original way of looking at things . Mrs. Burnett is skillful in bringing together typical characters and balancing them against each other . She knows , too , what situations are dear to the popular heart ; and , in the closing chapters of her last story , is singularly felicitous in this respect . Indeed , the air of injured innocence which Bertha Amory takes to the ball , and the big , good-natured , manly-hearted . Senator Blundel 's protection of her , would draw tears from a piece of Canterbury flint . But having , in her first books , touched the chord of pity once or twice in a natural manner , it soon became evident that she was forcing a pathos . Joan Lowrie was , to a person of strong feeling , a character easy to conceive . But if Louisiana wins the heart , it must surely be at the expense of justice . The old father is decidedly the more touching of the two . Louisiana 's character would not bear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not doubt that Minerva sprang full-armed from the head of Jove , because we are sure of Jove 's head - it was strong . And we do not doubt that a Louisiana might have emerged from the wilds of North Carolina and made social conquests ; but we expect the author to show us the process , which , in this case , she hardly does . She gives her heroine a pretty face and a sweet heart : these often overturn a thick-witted or // a light-headed man , but do they , without other gifts , revolutionize the notions of society ? All Mrs. Burnett 's women , except , perhaps , Joan Lowrie and Anice Barholm , seem to be playing a part in which we should expect them to break down , did we not remember the tricks of the nerves . They are strong in excitements based on nerve force . They never forget themselves and how they look . They have a mania for dress effects , and resort frequently to the glass . In the height of our interest , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a robe , the adjustment of ribbons , the sweep of a train , the disposition of jewels - until the reader feels that if these are the secrets of female coquetry , he would rather not be initiated . He is willing to yield to the graces , but would rather continue , in his blindness , to assign them to the heart , than be enlightened , to find them made up at the toilette . The passions , under such conditions , can never be the grand passions ; they must always be petty . There is too much conscious or unconscious egotism and too little real nobility of sentiment . One at first likes the smartness of Octavia Bassett in her democratic tilt against an " effete civilization " ; but , in the end , one feels that , having a beltful of raw gold , she has gone to England to fling it in the faces of the nobility . The reader is delighted with the spiciness of this beautiful young woman , but the critic can scarcely give a high place in fiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a saucy tongue , a gold mine in the Rockies , and a trunkful of dresses fresh from Worth 's . Nor can the judicious find genuine nobility in Louisiana , who has little besides a good figure and an interesting ignorance . These amiable girls may pose in all sorts of attitudes , may lay their pretty faces on the rough bark of trees , or flatten their pink cheeks on railfences - this is giving them coquettish airs , but not strong character . We may be deluded into loving them , but the question still remains : Will they wear ? The element of analysis that is creeping into Mrs. Burnett 's later work is promising , because it shows a dissatisfaction with her former easy successes . But this method involves so great a change in her habits of thought and observation that success in it must , it would seem , be of exceedingly slow growth . To work out a train of cause and effect , to make a nice balance of relations among characters , to get into the hearts of deep men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the judicial faculty . With all her quick perceptions , her ready sympathy , and her direct movement on the fortress of tears ,  --  and her intuitions in these directions are wonderfully fine ,  --  Mrs. Burnett seems to hit but a popular and not the best ambition . She sympathizes with people in humble circumstances , not , it would seem , because they are misunderstood , or particularly unhappy in their lives , but because their surroundings are not what she herself would like . She seems to be looking for a person whom she may promote , whom she may reward for virtue or grace with money or a fine match ; and yet a chance to indulge in dress or the vanities is about all such a promotion would give . A sense of value in their own lives on what must be the plane of most people , her method does not supply ; and this is just what Dickens 's method does . Dickens appears to be proud of human nature for the goodness there is in it-too proud , perhaps , to minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not good , and ignorance is not good ; yet goodness and excellence may stay and find reward among plain people . We have in Mrs. Burnett 's later heroines none of that beautiful , contented simplicity seen , for instance , in Daudet 's M. Joyeuse , and in Dot and John Peerybingle in " The Cricket on the Hearth " ; but it is always the restless goodness that wants to be accentuated by methods more delightful to the unreflecting than to the judicious ; her ideal happiness lies not in " plain living and high thinking , " but in recognition by " society . " It may be well to contrast the ideal of character as we see it in Mrs. Burnett with that of the New England school , which is represented by Miss Phelps . The opposition in these two is at the strongest . Miss Phelps is a product , like Mrs. Stowe , of Calvinistic theology , and , in mental action , is of the most bracing intellectual and moral atmosphere . But she is bold and original , having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moods . In her first nQvel she startled the Puritan world by her refreshing notions of heavenly felicities . Otherwise , the picture had few striking features . It gave expression to a certain reaction within the Calvinistic circle against the hard lines of Puritan imagination . When , however , " The Story of Avis " came out , it was seen that we had an original thinker , and one who , as a novelist , was working almost wholly in the New England quarry . Avis Dobell was as fiercely characteristic of woman 's mode of mental action in that section of America as George Eliot 's Dorothea was of the English liberal thought of her time . The action was within the same limits sociologically ,  --  woman , with intense aspirations , at loggerheads , between love and the requirements of love , with the // accepted notions of her " sphere . " It was the woman of high ideals , with mental and moral intensity , beating against an impassive wall of cultivated selfishness  --  the woman scholar against the man scholar . New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ furnished a favorable arena for observing this struggle . Nowhere is the contest more marked ; and Miss Phelps seized the life from the highest point of view . Avis , in her purity , is white marble ; and in her passion she is white marble heated . The character is admirably drawn-beautiful in all moral qualities , weak in the presence of the housekeeper , capable of the best enthusiasms , the highest self-sacrifice , but equally capable of sour bread . In short , she has in her as much of the woman as is consistent with a good deal of the scholar . For such a person the background of professional aridities , and the social environment , with its thirst for culture subtly pervading , the other thirsts , were well chosen . But the author draws only this one character . Her men are sticks , showing well on the surface - delightfully carved , but having wooden inwards . Her one woman is firm , strong , passionate , intense , conscientious , beautiful in a narrow way  --  the intellectual and moral outcome of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phelps could not , by any possibility , draw Howells 's Marcia Hubbard . She could not get down to her , or out to her . She is , one would say , incapable of the analytic vein , and equally incapable of the realistic painting of the new school . She is , in fiction , an idealist par excellence ; but amidst the thin naturalism of to-day , her idealism is tonic . Of artistic faults , she is full . Her poetic intensity carries her away from all the realities . She has pet words and phrases , vague enthusiasms , romantic notions of life , imagery borrowed from the Old Testament , floated down through the age of the Troubadours , and tricked out with modern botanical and geological additions . Her grandeur is sublimated , and her passion sentimentalized . Yet , for her lofty standard of womanhood and the power of self-sacrificing love , we condone all her strained metaphor , her exorbitant fancy ; we forgive her such expressions as the " cool , clean-cut , conscious nails " of Avis , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the " bridal gladness " and " widowed pathos of a rock , " the " sentient nature of a thing adapted to its reticence , " the " full , prehensile force " of a " supple touch " ; and again we forgive her when she makes her heroine regard the " contour of a man 's face precisely as a physician regards a hectic flush or a bilious eyeball . " " I am afraid I am not like other women , ' said Avis simply , dipping her brush with deep absorption in the madder rose . " Thank Heaven , ' said Ostrander , in a low , delirious tone . " Avis lifted her eyes with a startled change of expression , holding the tube of brilliant color , like an arrested thought upon the air . " She is unlike other women ; but she is capable of enthusiasms and no meannesses , and we accept her , even while we smile at her extravagances . A rigid art is , after all , as much needed in fiction as in other branches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength of the two writers whose claims to the novelistic bays are now most discussed . Mr. Howells and Mr. James are artists . Their art seems almost perfect , as far as it goes , and in conscientiousness it goes as far as that of any other writer . It is through conscientious methods that the reality of such pictures as Tourgu*neff 's exist ; but the reality may exist only in essentials , or it may extend to the finger-points . Tourgu*neff and Hawthorne touched more nearly than most others the realities of the soul . Both are perfect artists , and equally conscientious , but unequally gifted . Hawthorne held the faculty of character-drawing subordinate to that of the tragic drama . His persons bum into our minds . They are not only real to the soul ,  --  they are terrible ; yet they are so drawn that we are possessed from the beginning with their destinies , and never trouble ourselves with building up false hopes , to find bitter disappointment in the end . We find ourselves reconciled from the beginning to tragedy , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hamlet . " This is , it may be , because , much as we are interested in the persons , we are more interested in the tremendous p.assions of which the very Fates seem to have taken charge . We are in the atmosphere of the profoundest moral forces , and the fortunes of petty personalities are of inferior importance . With Tourgu6neff it is not wholly so . He is essentially a delineator of powerful characters and the hold they have on meaner men . When he has turned them inside out , so that we understand them , he is satisfied , and drops his pen . But , as he says of himself , he is deficient in imagination . That is , he fails in cumulative interest and climax . His groups are introduced with some strong purpose which dominates their action . The purpose vanishes , and with it oiXr interest . We have no absorbing concern in the plot or the hero . The figures are great , gaunt , stalwart , powerful , thrust forth with enormous objectivity , and finished with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither warm us by their loves nor kindle us by their hates . They // are repulsive . There are passionate scenes in Tourgu6neff but there is no great action . It is plain to see that the author is absorbed in the personality and its history , as he says , * and will go out of these to paint his hero 's surroundings , solely with a view to illustrate him the better . This outside painting is marvelously effective ; but is it anything more than the painter 's imagination ? The imagination of the great dramatist has a different end . He says , in effect : " Here is a remarkable event . Let us see if we can trace the gathering passions that brought it about . Let us place ourselves at the beginning , and come up to it by every road , private and public , and see if we can gather into a selected number of persons the representative forces , showing how they acted on one another , as well as how they combined to bring about the event . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the men , and so make the reader an actor , and not alone a critical spectator . " When the dramatist comes who can do this , we live in his creation . We laugh and cry with him . We do not applaud or hiss or criticise . We simply flash into a new life with all the passions of which we are capable . Whatever antique fashion of dress , or quaint vocabulary these men choose to adopt , they are the true realists : for their realities are both the internal and external . They paint minutely , when it is useful to do so ; but they generally let one good finger-point , well touched , do for the ten . They are character painters , but they suffer the predominant traits to speak for all . They are the painters of events , for all their action converges on one point , and we are sure to see everywhere the purpose of their crusade . They are rich enough to endow their personages with all local charms . These , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary . They are idealists , where idealism is useful . But they are alive all over , and warm with the value of life . The one quality in them which overtops all others , though it can not do without the rest , is geniality , which , after all , comes from a healthy sense of the worth of human life in all its breadth , and implies a broad sympathy that permits no distinction of persons except by their worth . These men are not shut up in a corner of the race , have no inveterate likes and dislikes ; yet they are not passionless or colorless , but capable of all colors and all passions in a deep sense . If we judge our two cleverest writers by this standard , we find their limitations in all directions . The infinite humor of Scott , the volcanic passion of Hugo , the poetic spirit that blossoms out of the realism of Auerbach , * See THE CENTURY MAGAZINE for June , 1877. the rollicking fun and pathos of Dickens , the poise and mastery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignities of Europe ,  - -  the intensity of Hawthorne , who surpasses them all in spiritual power and perception of the demonic forces in man-what one of these elements of greatness shall we find in our analytic school ? Howells and James are alike in one respect . They both feel the effect of the scientific critical spirit . Both seem inclined to deny the existence of what can not meet the five senses . They are capable of passions only in a restricted way-grown-up passions , modified by culture , or business , or the club gossip - not the romantic passion of youth , not the steady , powerful currents which to-day float the light gondolas of love , and to-morrow carry navies of ambitious hopes . In intensity , James , perhaps , has the advantage of Howells . He can conceive a deeper character , and grasp its stronger individuality . Isabel Osmond , Madame Merle , have more of the grit of strong natures than any of Mr. Howells 's persons . Ralph Touchett shows more of the best quality of pathetic humor . It is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and essentially American . The subduing effect of humor over distress is most notable in the death-bed scene between Ralph and his father . Two such quaint and grim humorists could not " shuffle off this mortal coil " without somehow finding a joke in the process . When Ralph comes to slip off the golden chain , and Isabel is a witness , the pathos masters the humor , as it should . In both qualities , however , the work is still American . These two scenes indicate , to imy mind , the best of Mr. James 's achievement so far , and show what he may do in those shortly coming years when the harsh acids of a somewhat cynical mood become mellow . With James , humor is closely allied to wit , and wit grew up among the acids ; but with Howells , humor is evidently innate and good-natured , though not well connected . James is , in this respect , half a foreigner , or with a foreign taint , or-some would perhaps prefer to call it-tint , while Howells has the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intellectual atmosphere . Howells , one would say , is utterly without pathos . James , in spite of Ralph Touchett , shows but little* and that little he is half ashamed of . Neither has much original sentiment , and what there was has been largely reduced by their peculiar processes of education . Yet James is the most capable of projecting a sentiment , or the most willing to do it . When he has projected it , however , he seems to shrink from his work , and to pare it down so carefully that we recognize it , at last , only as an intel- // lectual , not a heart passion ; that is , it ceases to be another person 's passion , and is one modified by the author 's own feelings . The character of love , for instance , is firm enough and persistent ; but it is undemonstrative , cold , reserved , New Englandish . Who can imagine one of James 's heroines loving as Anne loved Heathcote ? Warburton 's love is brotherly ; Caspar Goodwood 's is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temper and granitic will ; Isabel 's is fascination and fate , always at odds with itself . There is no consuming quality anywhere in any of the lovers . James is not , to my thinking , objective ; he is essentially subjective ; that is , he imparts to every person a portion of himself and his own caution and causticity . The strongest evidence of this I find in the dialogue in " The Portrait of a Lady , " a novel which I choose as his culminating work , representing the outcome thus far of all his tendencies . There is in nearly every person an observable infusion of the author 's personality . The men and women are almost equally quick-witted , curt , and sharp . While each has a certain amount of individuality , the sharpness is one of the elements in common , preventing a complete differentiation . It is not wit alone and repartee , but a subacid quality which sets the persons to criticising . each other . One does not like to call it snarling . Mr. James is too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentlemen ; and yet every leading person in the book does , in a polite way , enter frequently into a form of personal criticism of somebody else . The poor heroine gets criticised-mildly and politely , but none the less surely , by every one : by Ralph Touchett , by Caspar Goodwood , by Lord Warburton , as well as by her husband , Osmond , and her friend Henrietta Stackpole . The minute analysis for which Mr. James is famous enters also into the dialogue , which , indeed , is invented apparently only to give variety to the form of analysis . The speakers are too obviously engaged in the business of helping the author develop his characters . They question mutually with a view to elucidating one another 's business or character . All conversation gets the personal element ; and when they are not personal , the individuals are introspective . They analyze themselves , until the reader acquires the feeling that they are all morbidly self-conscious . If the continuity of individuality is kept up through the dialogue , it is because of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author is never complete . It may be that Mr. James has not yet produced that one novel which is the largest outcome of an author 's experience ; but we can not escape the conviction that he has at least so far written himself into his books that a shrewd critic could reconstruct him from them . The person thus fashioned would be one of fine intellectual powers , incapable of meannesses ; of fastidious tastes , and of limited sympathies ; a man , in short , of passions refined away by the intellect . Howells , almost equally with James , is bound in by his limitations ; but they are of a different kind . He is more genial and less caustic ; has more tolerance , but not , perhaps , larger sympathies . He has the tolerance of the journalist , to whom the shows of life are a matter of curiosity , but not vital to himself . We can not imagine him hating or loving his drama/is 1/'crson*z . He would undoubtedly like a smoke with Judge Gaylord in his office , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a high respect for Atherton , and would certainly offer him a cigar ; but he neither loves nor hates with warmth the creatures of his fancy . Nor is it easy to assign this lack of sympathy , as perhaps some would be inclined to do , to any theory as to the novelist 's duty as a reporter of human life ; for there is more than enough of a subjective relation between the author and his persons in the minor qualities to prevent our classing him with the rare men like Shakspere , who can be *t once indifferent and yet searching observers of human life . It seems far more reasonable to suppose that his persons are almost wholly the creatures of his note-book . He has seen them walking up and down the stations , and perhaps set down their peculiarities . They are exteriorly life-like , finished with extreme minuteness ,  --  for it is a wonderful note-book , so full , so accurate , so genially playful , that we can not get away from it . The external and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize as both typical and individual . The persons are nevertheless constructions , and in no large sense creations . They do not come from the heart , but through the senses ; and we are so tied down by wbat they do visibly that we never find underlying strata-either because Mr. Howells can not discover deep natures for them , or because he is afraid to trust to his insight . His method is not that of Tourgu*neff , far less that of Hawthorne . He is of the analytic school , but analyzes by the externals ,  --  which in his case are generally petty ,  --  and argues back to motives , which are consequently thin . But his work grows deeper every year , and in the last novel , " A Modern Instance , " he begins to show some confidence in his powers of insight . As a strong character in underworking motive , Squire Gaylord seems // to be his best . For manly passion ,  --  real passion , that stirs us deeply ,  --  Halleck is the most consistent construction and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fretful . Marcia has a narrow faithfulness and persistency , but no heroic quality . Hubbard has weaknesses , but no villainy . He simply falls , without any Satanic propulsion to help his fall . If it is not Mr. Howells 's distrust of himself which restrains him from great attempts , it certainly can not be dearth of material in New England . There is iron in the blood of the race there if anywhere , - iron in their loves and iron in their hates . James has affiliations and aversions which we see at their strongest in Ralph Touchett and Gilbert Osmond . But he , too , like Mr. Howells , has no strong loves nor hates . Both writers , however , have attained a wonderful success in reproducing what they see and feel . The superficial aspect of American life each has , in his own line of observation , depicted with fascinating skill . The average American abroad-neither the highest nor the lowest , but with features which we must recognize , whether we like them or not , as the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life - has never been so well presented as in James 's list of characters , from Daisy Miller to Henrietta Stackpole , from Caspar Goodwood to Mr. Newman . This is a field by itself , and the author has shown himself a master in it ; still his mastery lies in his analysis of externals , not in sympathetic reproduction of heroic qualities . He never gets into the spirit of our American home-life . When , by some exertion , he seems to get home , it is only , as in the story of " The Europeans , " in the rank suburbs that we find him . The life of the American abroad is clearly one without community duties , and so too apt to be one without community sympathies . It has an income of enjoyment which implies the outgo of money merely , and not of heart , and the heart may fail at last to respond to the deeper human woes , or the finer human joys . Not to invest any feeling in community life is not to find the center of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which most readers perceive in James 's books . They are admirable studies of American manners as evolved in travel , that is , in contact with foreign manners , and of American limitations judged by a foreign standard ; but they fail , it seems to me , to reach the spirit of home life or of any settled life . The reader finds harsh lines where he knows soft ones exist . Felix , in Boston , in early spring , " kept looking at the violent blue of the sky , at the scintillating air , at the scattered and multiplied patches of color " - as if the clean and chaste blue of the April skies we know could be " violent , " except to one who was homesick , and so incapable of just judgment . Again , to the same sort of eyes , in the same season , " the coarse , vivid grass and the slender tree-boles were gilded by the level sunbeams - gilded as with gold that was fresh from the mines . " One feels that this is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , while seeming to be objective , it is in reality subjectively unsympathetic ; that is , it is the negative side of subjectivity which excludes what the mood can not appreciate . In literary form James is elegant and finished , but he is far more pleasing , it seems to me , in his essay style than in his dialogue , which is constructed on a dry- perhaps a French - pattern , where precision becomes bareness ,  - -  an almost wearisome staccato that has wit enough , but is slim in large action and devoid of warmth and life-like quality , as we may see if we compare it with almost any dialogue in Scott , Thackeray , Dickens , Cooper , or Mrs. Stowe . It is bare , even when compared with Mr. Howells 's dialogue , of everything except intellectual keenness . We miss the rich coloring which a man of vivid imagination and large sympathy would put in , and we get little besides the intellectual effort of the speakers . That this is bright no one will venture to deny . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " order of brightness , unsoftened , unwarmed , of which James is a master . So far , then , as the writers of the last decade have made progress , the progress has been in the direction of more precise observation and report , which is necessary work , and at the bottom of all growth . This report , as I have tried to show , has been of every sort of value . With some it has had for its aim the reproduction of eccentricities , oddities , peculiarities-external and trifling , which make us laugh , but otherwise do not impress us deeply . In others it is of traits which are local and deciduous . The reportorial method is affecting the younger writers . Some are content with reporting , without observing ; some observe , without discriminating , and report in mass . They have no rule in their work , no principles of judging , no artistic sense in grouping material . Some report with a bias toward the sentimental , or the cynical , or the humorous . But reporting is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have developed variety in manners and customs mainly , and to have been confined to those who have little more than the reportorial instinct . It is something , however , that this has brought about a greater desire for accuracy . Here the analytical school has come in , but thus far without the more serviceable results . It surely is // qwq
