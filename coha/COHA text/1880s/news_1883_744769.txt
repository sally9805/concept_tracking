txt There is a general , feeling that Capt . RHODES , the man who for the last three weeks has been threatening to swim the Niagara whirlpool , ought to go and drown himself without further delay . For three weeks the public has anxiously looked for the news that he had disappeared in the whirlpool , and during the same period people at Niagara Falls have been waiting for the hour when Capt . RHODES would give them the exciting spectacle of a drowning man in his death-agony . But Capt . RHODES has disappointed everybody . Three days ago he threatened that if he were not allowed to swim the rapids he would go through them on board an ancient canal-boat , and two days ago he announced that he would send a dog through the rapids , so that the animal could learn sufficient of the route to qualify him to act as pilot . Nevertheless , the Captain has kept . none of these promises , and indignation against a man who fails to drown either himself or his dog is rapidly rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a matter of small consequence - whether or not Capt . RHODES drowns ' himself in the Niagara whirlpool , but that he owes it to the public to drown himself somewhere and without delay . When Capt . RHODES first announced that he would swim the whirlpool , everybody professed to be shocked , and expressed the hope that he would not be permitted to risk his life in such a wicked way . Now that he evidently does not intend to enter the rapids , he is called a " fraud " and a " coward , " and bitterly denounced . Can it be that , after all , people were secretly anxious to see the man drown himself and are now angry because he , does not publicly commit suicide ? On hardly any other hypothesis can their indignation against him be explained .
