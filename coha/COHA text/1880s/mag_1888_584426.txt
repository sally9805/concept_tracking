By James Baldwin . SECOND PAPER . VII * other single infiu*I en ce has conduced more largely to the develo*mentofthe considering than the attention paid , both at the beginning and of late years , to the cause of popular education . Scarcely , indeed , were the ridgepoles securely fastened upon the roof of his cabin , before the pioneer from beyond the Alleghanies began to consider the means of providing for the education of his children . The desire uppermost in his mind , after he had secured a home and a reasonable assurance that food and clothingwould not fail , was that his posterity might be blessed by the possession of a broader and more liberal culture than had ever been within his own reach . Hence , prominent in the early State Constitutionswe find passages like the following : " Knowledge and learning generally diffused through a community being essential to the preservation of a free government , and spreading the opportunities and advantages of education through the various parts of the country being highly conducive to this end , it shall be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the improvement of such lands as are , or hereafter may be , granted by the lJnited States to this State for the use of schools , and to apply any funds which may be raised from such lands , or from any other quarter , to the accomplishment of the grand object for which they are or may be intended . " What lands were those thus referred to as having been granted to the State by the United States ? As early as the 20th of May , 1785 , Congress had passed an act providing for the disposal of certain portions of the public lands . By one of the most important provisions of that act it was ordered that one square mile of land in every township should be devoted to the maintenance of free schools and to the general diffusion of knowledge throughout the community . Thus , one thirty-sixth part of all the lands within the Northwest Territory , amounting in the aggregate to more than four million acres , was dedicated to the cause of popular education . This is the first instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provision for the maintenance of schools , long before the schools were needed . This magnificent endowment became the nucleus of a school-fund for each State  --  a fund which , under careful management and by additions from various sources , has grown to be a very important factor in the economy of the commonwealth . In 1876 the school-fund of Indiana , the smallest of the five States as regards area , amounted to nearly nine million dollars  --  a sum greater by two million dollars than the fund at that time possessed by any other State in the Union . And yet , such was the reputation of the Hoosier State for illiteracy , that at the Centeunial Exposition , when some of the school-work of Indiana children was placed on exhibition , there were many educated people who seriously inquired of the State agent whether the*re really were any good schools in that benighted land ! In 1884 the combined school-funds of Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin amounted to twenty-seven million two hundred and seventy-four thousand dollars-more than two-thirds as much as that of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , notwithstanding the early and wise provisions made for the advancement of popular education and the diffusion of knowledge , there were for many years no public free schools . It // was a long time before the school lands could be profitably sold and the funds accruing from their sale rightly utilized . In one or more of the States the law provided that no disposal of these lands should be made prior to the year 1820 ; and it was not until even thirty or forty years later that all were finally made produ*tive . During a period , therefore , of more than half a century they were of but little actual value to the publicschool system , and stood only as so many secured promises of a future endowment . It must not be supposed , however , that in the meantime there were no schools , or that the people were entirely indifferent about the education of their children . The truth of the matter was far otherwise , although it must be confessed that in many localities the diffusion of knowledge was attended with difficulties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due . If the State had not sufficient funds to support a system of free schools , it had at least , in some instances , the power to provide for the building of school-houses in which instruction could be given to such as were willing and able to pay for it . But how was this possible when there was no money in the treasury and the poverty of the people was such as to preclude the idea of raising it by direct taxation ? In some of the States this problem was solved by making every voting citizen a builder . It was directed by law that in each school district a school-house should be erected , large enough to accommodate all the children of school age residing within its limits . It was further ordered that in the construction of that building every male inhabitant over twenty-one years of age should labor one day in each week until its completion ; or , if he preferred , he might pay , " in lieu of such labor , any plank , nails , or glass " that might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused to pay the equivalent , he was to be fined " thirty-seven and one-half cents for every day he so failed . " These primitive school-houses were , of course , very rude affairs , built of round logs , and with as little expenditure of time and money as the law would allow . It was required that they should be eight feet high from floor to joists , and that they should be provided with such furniture as was absolutely necessary for use in the schools . The floors were of roughly hewn puncheons ; a great fireplace and chimney , built of sticks and clay , often extended entirely across one end of the room ; the seats were long slabs with legs driven into them ; there were no desks , but a narrow shelf against one of the walls afforded the larger pupils an opportunity to write ; and blackboards were inventions not yet introduced into the Western country . Close to the place where the master sat , there were usually two long pegs driven into the wall for the purpose of supporting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then regarded as the most effective and convenient means of securing obedience . Those were the days of the " Hoosier Schoolmaster , " happily known no more in either Indiana or her sister States . For years and years , the cause of education moved but slowly . Poverty and the daily struggle with adverse circumstances ; the constant demand for more laborers ; the necessity and difficulty of first providing sufficient food and clothing-these were the causes which tended to breed a lack of interest in book-knowledge . It was not so much disinclination as utter inability that prevented a more hearty support of educational measures . The schools , as I have already remarked , were not free schools . But in some localities , as in Michigan , a fund was raised by direct taxation , and provisions were made whereby the children of the very poor should receive instruction without cost ; by thus placing education within the reach of all , it was hoped that the public would eventually " be benefited by genius and talent which would otherwise have died in obscurity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their children were obliged to do so . The school terms were of brief duration-brief because of the many necessities and restrictions of frontier life ; usually there was a winter term of two or three months , and occasionally a short summer term for the benefit of the very small children . The boy or young man who was able to attend // school for a few weeks during three or four consecutive years was regarded as being fortunate ; great things were to be expected of one who had enjoyed such rare opportunities . The pioneer schoolmaster was not a professional teacher ; on the contrary , he was usually a man of small attainments who taught simply as a temporary convenience , and during a time in which he could be doing nothing else . He was frequently chosen not so much for his scholarship as for his physical strength and his ability to manage the big boys . And the school was no paradise of delights . " How scarcely endurable was the confinement ! " writes one who was a pupil in those schools half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benches all those long days , and we wishedanxiously wished-that recess or noon or night would come . Hours seemed like ages . May no generation be so punished again ! " The branches which were taught were , of course , only the most elementary and essential . To be able to read intelligibly in the New Testament , to spell words of four syllables in Webster 's Spelling Book , and to cipher to the " Double Rule of Three , " was proof of a very high grade of scholarship . Geography was for a long time a branch of instruction unknown to the schools ; and as the day of newspapers and railroads had not yet arrived , the ignorance which prevailed regarding the outside world was little short of astounding . It must be remembered that this was during the period which might well be termed the Dark Ages of the West  --  the period intervening between the earliest pioneer days of struggle and hopeful enterprise , and the later regime of railroads and free schools and substantial progress . It was during this transitional period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section became proverbial , and that the names Buckeye , Hoosier , and Sucker began to be applied derisively to the natives , respectively , of Ohio , Indiana , and mmois . Yet the cause of education was by no means dead . While the free-school system thus languished in a chrysalis state , and the great plans projected by our early legislators were still void of fin ition , there were , nevertheless , many strong currents of influence at work for the promotion of general intelligence and the redemption of the fair name of the West . The idea of free schools was not generally regarded with favor . But few men were so poor as to be willing to partake of the State 's charities even in the matter of the education of their children . There were many who looked upon any system of public schools with suspicion , fearing lest , in the absence of definite religious instruction , the minds of the pupils should be contaminated with a spirit of godlessness and unbelief . From these and other causes , the various Churches had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried it forward with zeal and great success . Among the French in Michigan , the Catholics had maintained parochial schools from a very early period . In 1804 , Father Richard , a zealous missionary , and afterward Territorial Delegate to Congress , established at Detroit a school for girls , and also a Latin school for young men . Four years later there were six schools in Michigan under his direction and patronage . In these schools , industrial training was made an importaut feature ; for the girls were instructed in sewing , knitting , spinning , and weaving  --  a knowledge of such things being regarded as of more value than mere book-learning . " Father Richard thought that his schools ought to receive public assistance , and he applied to the Legislature for the grant of a lottery franchise ; but though the evils of lotteries were not so well understood then as now , his application failed of effect , and his schools continued feeble and of low grade . " * The pioneer preachers of the Protestant Churches , convinced that illiteracy was incompatible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of education among their people . In the organization and maintenance of sectarian schools none were more active or more faithful than the Methodists and the Quakers . The former established schools and academies in almost every community , and the education of their children as an imperative Christian duty was urged upon the membership * Cooley : Michigan . // of the Church . For more than a third of a century these schools continued to do a noble work , being gradually and finally merged into the public schools or broadened and elevated to the rank of colleges and universities . The Quakers , whose settlements were chiefly in Indiana and Western Ohio and Southeastern Michigan , were for a long time very averse to the education of their youth by " persons not in membership with Friends . " Hence , wherever their number was sufficient to make it possible , they established and supported , by voluntary contributions , a system of " Monthly Meeting Schools " over which the Society exercised a judicious control , and in which a more careful and more thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average district school . In their " Quarterly Meeting Schools , " some of which are still in successful operation , a high grade of secondary instruction was given , and a large number of enthusiastic young men and young women were fitted for the profession of teaching  --  a profession in which many of them afterward became distinguished . Next to the Catholics , the Quakers were also among the first to attempt the education of the Indians ; and although their labors in this direction have been attended with many discouragements , they have not yet abandoned the work . The other Protestant Churches were by no means idle . Wherever there was a sufficient number of any sect to justify the necessary expenditure , there a denominational school or academy was established . The rivalry thus existing , and the general interest thus awakened in the cause of common-school education led to many earnest movements toward the establishment of colleges and universities . The result was a large number of institutions bearing imposing titles , yet too often possessed of nothing else save that Western type of faith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been expected , many of these institutions were short-lived , and even their pretentious names have long ago perished from remembrance . Others , more tenacious of life , and perhaps more deserving of it , struggled successfully against the ob stacles and sore besetments which surrounded them , and , being backed by earnest Christian men and philanthropists , emerged from the trial victorious . Of these older colleges , organized during the days of the pioneers or shortly afterward , at least thirty still survive to honor their country and to fulfil the design of their organization . Yet the Churches , not satisfied to concentrate their endeavors and their means upon a few institutions , which might thus be amply endowed , have continued to multiply their enterprises and divide their resources , until there are now in the five States nearly eighty colleges and universities under denominational control . The influence of these institutions can not well be estimated ; but its vastness may be in part comprehended when we learn that more than ten thousand young men and young women are to-day receiving instruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States themselves were also active in making endowments and providing for non-sectarian colleges , to be supported in part , if not altogether , from the funds in the public treasury . The Continental Congress had by the same Ordinance whereby lands were granted to the public schools ordered that " not more than two complete townships shall be given perpetually for the purposes of an university , to be laid off by the purchaser or purchasers , as near the centre as may be , so that the same shall be of good land , to be applied to the intended object by the Legislature of the State . " In accordance with this provision , Ohio University was established at Athens in 1809 , and the first movement toward giving due prominence to State universities was inaugurated . In Michigan , as early as 1816-twenty years before the admission of that State into the Union  --  the plan of a great university was formulated . This plan was the result of the joint labors of Father Richard , the Catholic priest already mentioned , and the Rev. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in the adoption by the Territorial Legislature of " An act to establish the Catholepistemiad , or University of Michigania . " This act was revised in 1821 , and the name of the institution // was changed to the University of Michigan . The other States , although somewhat more tardy in their action , did not fail to follow a similar course : Indiana University was founded at Bloomington in 1828 ; Illinois College was founded at Jacksonville in 1830 ; and the University of Wisconsin at Madison in 1849 . Other State institutions and some private non-sectarian colleges have been established at a later period , swelling the entire number of colleges and universities in this section to ninety-nearly one-fourth the entire number in the United States . The State universities are , as a rule , liberally patronized and supported , and take rank among the best educational institutions in America . For example , the University of Michigan has at the present time an enrolment of more than fifteen hundred students , and offers advantages for study and instruction scarcely equalled , and certainly not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern States . It must , of course , be acknowledged that among the ninety colleges and universities in this section of the Union there is to be found more or less of that which is crude and superficial , and in some instances a grade of instruction but little superior to that afforded in a well conducted high schooL Yet , whatever may be said in derision of these " fresh-water " colleges , they have been instruments of incalculable good in forwarding the intellectual development of the West . Aside from the fact that a large number of the most influential men of the nation have been directly benefited by their instruction , they have from their organization been centres of influence whence have emanated rays of intelligence enlightening entire communities and through them exerting no small influence upon the moral and social character of the people at large . Moreover , many of the Western colleges were from the beginning the advocates of new methods and the exponents of new ideas in education . Their very freedom from conservatism  --  the outgrowth of Western contempt for ancient ruts-created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which overflowed sectional boundaries and infected the more slowly plodding institutions of older States with new doctrines , and infused into them a new life . For example , at Oberlin College in Ohio , founded in 1833 , the theory of the coeducation of the sexes was for the first time in the world 's history practically demonstrated , and proved to be not only practicable but in many instances advantageous . It is unnecessary to comment upon the fact that , within little more than half a century , the experiment there inaugurated so successfully has overturned some of the cherished ideas of older institutions , and has in a measure revolutionized the educational systems of the world . It was in a Western college that the election of studies in the higher classes , and the multiplication of courses to meet the diverse wants and capabilities of different students , first found encouragement . It was there that the fact was first recognized and given due consideration that the same course of study would not prepare young men for all the occupations of life , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many instances , lost time and would better have been devoted to studies of a more practical value . It was in the West that the position of the State university as the head of a system of public instruction was first practically recognized . The dependence of the colleges upon the public high schools , and of the high schools upon the elementary schools , was emphasized and made more plainly apparent by a systematic gradation of studies whereby the work of one department merged naturally and easily into that of the next higher . Long before the East had begun to recognize the importance of manual training , there were Manual Labor Institutes and schemes for education in handicraft in operation in the West . These radical deviations from the old order of things were , of course , in many instances , mere crude experiments , imperfect and unsatisfactory in their immediate effects , but bearing rich fruits in the after-time . In studying the history of the people of this section , and in considering the indebtedness of the entire country to Western influences , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher education should not be underrated . But , as has been already observed , while the energies of both Church and State were thus directed to the establishment of colleges and universities , the system of common schools , so liberally provided for in the beginning , was permitted to languish undeveloped . This neglect was due partly to a misconception of the trae scope and objects of the free schools , partly to sectarian prejudice and narrowness , and partly to the rn-management of the officers to whom the control of the public funds had been intrusted . Moreover , that the colleges and other higher schools of learning should receive the first earnest attention and patronage of Church and State , was but following the common order of development . Strange though it may seem , educational institutions do not , at first , grow from below upward , but in the contrary manner . In every country the earliest public efforts for the advancement of education have been expended in the foundation of colleges and universities ; then , at a later period , as the necessity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the common schools are perfected , as the necessary basis of a complete system . In this respect , as well as in many others , the West has compressed within the limits of half a century the experiences and phenomena which in older countries extended through many ages and were the results of a slow and tedious process of alternate growth and repression . The public-school system in the West , when once the long dormant germ was fully matured , was a plant of rapid , though substantial , growth . But little more than a quarter of a century has elapsed since the awakening began and the true value and importance of the free school became generally recognized . In nothing else has there ever been a more wonderful or more noble progress . The log school-houses have vanished , to give place to handsome , often elegant , frame , brick , and stone edifices . Instead of the rudeness and discomfort which characterized the district school of the earlier day , every necessary convenience is at hand to give pleasure to the pupil and lend assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its school building and its efficient public school , in which every child may receive , free of cost , the best instruction that is anywhere afforded . There are to-day in the five States more than fifty thousand school-houses in which schools are maintained from three to ten months every year . The value of these buildings , with the grounds , is considerably over eighty millions of dollars , which is more than one-half that of all other public school property in the Union . Nearly three millions of children annually receive instruction in the public schools ; while more than eighty-five thousand teachers , a large number of whom have been trained especially for their work , are employed as instructors . The total amount expended each year for the support of these schools somewhat exceeds thirtytwo millions of dollars , or more than eight dollars for each child of school age within the States . As to the character of the instruction given , it is sufficient to say that it is nowhere excelled . Not New England with her school system two centuries old , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibit better methods of teaching , or better results , than can be found in the towns and cities of any of the five States under discussion . Quite recently , also , the country district schools have made wonderful advancement , and in some localities rival in thoroughness the more favored graded schools of the towns . The public high schools have long ago , by the very excellent quality of the instruction given in them , supplanted in most cases the private and sectarian academies , and rendered the support of such institutions unnecessary . In some of the States they are the authorized preparatory schools for the universities and other State institutions . The high school at Ann Arbor , Mich. , " annually , " it is said , " for the ten years preceding 1884 , graduated an average number of pupils , with full preparation to enter upon a regular university course , greater , it is believed , than is fitted for college in any other public school in the country. ** In no other section of the United States is so much attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Institutes for instruction in the most advanced methods of education are held annually in every county , and these are attended by all the teachers . In some of the States , township institutes are also required by law ; and attendance upon them is made obligatory . Besides these  --  and indeed of town or city corporations , and some by private individuals , which have been established for the thorough , systematic , and philosophic teaching of teachers . In Indiana alone there are twelve institutions of this kind , in which more than seven thousand five hundred men and women annually receive instruction and professional training . The teachers are also banded together in innumerable associations and reading circles-township , county , and State-for purposes of mutual aid and improvement . One result of all this activity is that the teachers of these States are always to be found in the van of progress . No new theory of education , no improved method of instruction , no valuable textbook on any of the common school branches , no foundation principles of pedagogics , that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It can not be denied that they are prone to the riding of hobbies , and that their enthusiasm sometimes carries them beyond the bounds of wise discretion , yet as a rule they constitute an element of progress in the State and community whose presence can not be ignored and the value of whose labors can not be overestimated . Their influence upon educational methods and movements throughout the country can be best illustrated by noting what the West has done in a general way toward revolutionizing or improving the system of public-school instruction . It was in the West that the idea of graded schools was first completely formulated and made practically successfuL It was in the West that the superintendency of schools-county and city-was first generally recognized as essential to the success of the system . It was in the West that the earliest and some of the ablest expounders of the " new education , " in this country , attempted the practical application of their theories . While yet the country was but half settled and the publicschool system little more than a promise , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the private schools of the lower Wabash Valley . Long before a " new departure " had been discovered in the schools of Quincy , and heralded to the world as the beginning of a great reformation , the self-same methods , there so highly eulogized , were being practically demonstrated in scores of cities and towns in the West . And it is to the progressive spirit of the West , which permeates and vivifies every department of public or private enterprise , that almost all other reforms and improvements during the past quarter of a century have been in some measure due . VIII . PRoGREss in literature and in the cultivation of literary tastes and habits is not to be expected in a newly settled country . The men who hew down forests or subdue the stubborn sod of the prairies have little time and few opportunities for improving their minds by reading or study . Their energies must be directed toward supplying the pressing needs of the hour ; and matters which seem to have but little immediate practical value must of necessity be postponed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leisure which that prosperity makes possible must be secured before any considerable attainments in literature , science , or art can be hoped for . There was little in the environments of the early settlers in the Ohio Valley to encourage a taste for the cultivation of letters-there was very much to discourage and repress . The pioneer 's library was usually limited to the Bible , a few religious tracts , and a medical almanac . He who had , in addition to these , a copy of the " Pilgrim 's Progress , " or some stray volume of poems , was indeed a fortunate man , with little else in the way of books to be desired . // As has been in all primitive communities , there was a tendency toward the cultivation of poetry . Old ballads , bits of rhyme , stray pieces of doggerel , when they could be had , were carefully preserved , or copied and passed from hand to hand . Verses of a mournful or semireligious cast were especially cherished by the hard-working farmers ' wives and young girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on weekdays sometimes amused themselves by expressing their favorite thoughts in the shape of rude rhymes . Some of these verses were occasionally deemed worthy of special preservation , and were long kept as mementos and keepsakes by the families or friends of the writers . At a later period an occasional volume of poetry found its way to the printer , and thence , bound in boards or cheap leather , to a limited but appreciative circle of readers . The poems of Mary Louisa Chitwood , of Indiana , which possessed not a little genuine merit , were read and admired in many Hoosier homes ; and the anti-slavery verses of the young Quakeress , Elizabeth Margaret Chandler , which breathed the true spirit of poetry aswell as of philanthropy , may be regarded as Michigan 's first contribution to the world of letters . It can hardly be doubted that there were " mute , inglorious Miltons " hidden forever from the world 's ken in the great Western clearings . In every neighborhood there were seers of visions and dreamers of dreams who with more f avorable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . As a matter of course , no book was read more than the Bible ; for the pioneers were pre-eminently religious . Their preachers were controversialists of the original stamp , never so happy as when demolishing the arguments of an opponent , or proving the falsity of every dogma not in harmony with their own teachings . Their popularity depended both upon their pugnacity and upon their ability to preach long sermons . A sermon requiring three hours for its delivery was proof positive not only of great scholarship , but of unimpeachable piety ; and such was the faith and resignation of the hearers that they would permit no criticisms upon this part of the preacher 's methods . Rival sects had little charity for one another . Each defended its own favorite practices and attacked those of others from every available rallying point ; and the press was early made the vehicle for the refutation of heresies or the confusion of an opponent . It is not a matter of surprise , therefore , that scraps of controversial literature obtained circulation and were highly prized by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who felt themselves moved to write religious books ; and the period of expectation which followed the first years of privation and trial gave rise to a feeble native literature of a peculiar theological cast . To this literature belong such works as " The Voice of One Crying in the Wilderness , " * and numerous pamphlets and tracts , single copies and fragments of which are still preserved as heirlooms and curiosities . These primitive volumes are of no intrinsic value ; yet , should we compare them with much that was written in New England during its theological period , we should find in them nothing which need cause their authors serious disquietude . Twenty years later , when the country had fairly entered upon its present career of progress , and when the privations of pioneer times had been almost forgotten , there sprung into existence a more vigorous class of controversial writings . But few peoples have ever attained to a high state of enlightenment without firsthaving passed through some such stage of religious disputation or of controversial literature . It seems to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases are peculiar to growing children . Rival preachers met at a country schoolhouse , or at a village church , and held long disputatious upon some question of faith or some matter of difference in church practice . Their arguments , which one must suspect were often intolerably dull to the hearers , being written down and separately edited , were afterward printed for circulation among * The Voice of One crying in the Wilderness-being an Essay to extend the Reformation .

Some dozens of volumes , having a very limited circulation , but still occasionally seen upon the shelves of certain ministers of the Gospel , were thus brought into existence . To the same period belong , also , a number of theological works bearing enigmatical titles similar to the following : Collectanea : a Collection and Exposition of Things Relating to the Two Adams . A Christadelphian Work . The Conflict of Ages Ended ; a Succedaneum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately preceding the war a surprising number of works like the above were written and published in the West . A few were honored by production from a city press , but the most were printed in country towns , and their existence was as brief as it was obscure . Such writ-. ings merit mention , not because of any literary merit , but as illustrating the phases of intellectual and moral growth through which the people of the West - much in the same way as those of older countries-have successively passed . But the early literature of this section was not exclusively theological . The Hon. Isaac Blackford , Judge of the Supreme Court of Indiana , compiled and published eight volumes of Reports , so carefully written , so comprehensive , and so practical , that they are now regarded by jurists the world over , not only as valuable works of reference , but as the most trustworthy authority on many matters of doubt or dispute . This was perhaps the only work of really permanent value produced daring the period of settlement . A few local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the list . When , at length , railroads came , and the telegraph , and a net-work of iron began to be spread all over the country , a new direction was given to the thoughts and aspirations of the people . Hitherto , communication with other States had been difficult , and little was known of what was transpiring in distant parts of the world . The mails had been by no means frequent in their visits , nor were they very heavily laden with the news of the day . A boy on horseback , riding over the road once a week with a small package of letters in a mail-bag , had been the limit of the mail-service at most of the post-offices . During the earlier days the rates of postage had been very high-being regulated according to the distance  --  and the expense of letter-carriage was always paid by the receiver , not by the sender ; hence there was not much correspondence between the settlers and their friends in the older States . But now , when the mails arrived daily and communication with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days , the life of the people was , in a manner , changed . The influence of the cities and larger towns began to be fell The weekly newspaper became a welcome visitor in many homes . An increasing curiosity was aroused concerning the doings of the rest of the world ; books of travel and adventure were eagerly sought and as eagerly read and discussed ; the itinerant book-agent with his stock of literary wares became a well-known and not always an unwelcome caller at the doors of the farmhouses . The period of the " renaissance " had indeed come to the Western people . The popular demand for reading matter and for the means of acquiring general information rapidly increased , and developed into a craving not more for knowledge than for the mere pleasurable excitement of becoming acquainted with books . The public schools , as we have already noted , had but lately begun to assume their proper place and functions ; and their influence but heightened the general awakening . As a consequence , in some of the States hundreds of small public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a part of the grand system of popular education placed books of the very best class within the reach of every person who wished to read . Most of these libraries have long ago disappeared-the prey of petty thievery and final neglect  --  but the good which they accomplished , just at the time when their aid was most needed , can never be overestimated . Many a young man who afterward attained success and perhaps achieved distinction in some of the higher walks of life was awakened to nobler aspirations and endeavors // through the reading of books thus made accessible to him . In Indiana , during this same period of literary awakening , if we may apply that term , nearly two hundred libraries , known as Workingmen 's Libraries , were founded in different parts of the State . The funds for the purchase of these libraries were provided by one William Maclure , a wealthy Scotch philanthropist , who bequeathed what was then considered a very large fortune for their support . It was Maclure who had endeavored to establish manual labor schools in the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter for inquiry and discussion in educational circles ; and through his influence the methods of Pestalozzi had been made known also in this country a quarter of a century previous to their general acceptance by the more progressive teachers . Through the influences and aids which have been enumerated , the people of the West became a reading people , and the diffusion of knowledge among the masses remained no longer an unsolved problem . The great political questions which about this time began to press forward for solution increased the general desire for knowledge . Newspapers representing every phase of political opinion found their way into the remotest country places , and if they did nothing more , they stirred up thought ; and when the crisis of war came , the people of the West were as a body able to act intelligently , and ready to act promptly . The war seemed not in the least to check the progress of intellectual growth , but rather to hasten it , by presenting new subjects for thought and by opening up wider fields for action . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other sections , were able to measure their own strength by comparing it with that of others ; they discovered by practical experiment what was the probable extent of the attainments within their reach , and their faith in the West grew stronger than ever before . With the return of peace , grand projects were set on foot and carried to successful realization . The idea of popular education received new encouragement ; the public schools and colleges , as we have already shown , at once advanced to the front , and took rank among the most efficient in the world ; and the taste for good reading , already awakened , was fostered and directed to the attainment of important results . There are now being published in this section more than three thousand newspapers and other periodicals , the aggregate circulation of which , per issue , is over seven million copies . In addition to these indigenous publications , the periodicals devoted to literature , art , and religion , the more famous political organs , and the great magazines of New York and Boston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we may safely place the aggregate circulation of all classes of periodicals at nearly fourteen million copies per issue , or one copy for every man , woman , and child in the five States . But , that the reading of a large proportion of the people is not confined to matter of an ephemeral kind , we have ample proof . There are now in this section more than twelve hundred public libraries , containing over three hundred volumes each , to say nothing of perhaps a triple number of smaller but valuable collections . Besides these , there are innumerable large private libraries , and libraries belonging to clubs and associations . All these can not fail to exercise an important influence in favor of mind and heart culture , and the advancement of liberal and enlightened ideas . In the cities and larger towns , societies for literary culture and enjoyment have for many years been maintained by persons of leisure and the younger class of professional men . Perhaps none of these are more famous or have done more valuable work than the Detroit Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its members some of the ablest and most famous statesmen and jurists of this country . Within a more recent period , the organization of literary clubs and reading circles has extended , not only into the towns , but into the smaller villages and numbers of country communities remote from any of the great educational centres . The character of the work accomplished by these associations varies , of // course , with the tastes , capabilities , and desires of their members ; but , as a rule , they eschew that which is simply frivolous or superficial , and devote their energies to the study of subjects requiring thought and patient investigation . I have before me the programmes for the current year of a large number of associations of this kind . I take them up hastily and at random . The first is that of a Woman 's Reading Club in a small town in the midst of a rich agricultural region ; and the subject to which its members devote the entire year 's study is United States history , with a series of readings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next is the programme of a certain Afternoon Club-also a society of ladies  --  and indicates subjects for the consideration of its members which are of a more ambitious cast , such as " Socrates and the Socratic Method , " * Philosophy , " " Goethe , " " Dante , ** " Sxvedenborg . " The third - still another woman 's club-contains a plan for a year 's work on the history of AngloSaxon England , including the reading of " King Lear , " " Cymbeline , " and Tennyson 's " Idylls of the King . " The fourth comes also from a country town remote from any college , and is the programme of the Spencer Class , a society of gentlemen and ladies who have devoted one evening of each fortnight to the study of the " Data of Ethics " and Schlegel 's " Philosophy of History . " Then follow the cards of numerous Shakespeare Clubs , some located in the cities , but more in country places , and all seeming to be deeply interested in the pursuit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Next I find the circulars of certain Browning Clubs and Browning Societies , some of which have devoted months and years to the enjoyable reading and study of their favorite author , and are still continuing the work with ever-increasing ardor . These are simply illustrations of the kind of study and the character of the reading which is being done in this year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and eightyeight all over that country which but a short time ago was an uncultivated wilderness . Nor is this all . There are numerous professional associations whose members are pursuing certain prescribed courses of reading for the purpose of intellectual improvement and culture . Prominent among these latter are the Teachers ' Reading Circles , organized under the auspices of State educational associations , and controlled by them through the agency of committees and boards of local managers . At the present time these circles have an aggregate membership of more than fifteen thousand persons , and these are engaged in the systematic study of such works as Green 's " History of the English People , " Tame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Psychology . " Examinations are held at stated times , and certificates or diplomas are awarded to such as complete the prescribed course of reading in a manner satisfactory to the board of managers . While these movements have been going on in the direction of mental improvement and literary culture , the West has produced not a few original thinkers and writers of its own , and has done much toward the upbuilding of our national literature . There are numbers of individuals who , either being natives of the West or writing under the influ .. ence of long residence there , have made valuable and permanent contributions to the literature of America . In the department of prose fiction , the number of Western writers is by no means small , and includes some of the most celebrated novelists of to-day . Of poets and versifiers , the name is legion ; nor is their work altogether confined to productions of an ephemeral character ; genuine poems of a sterling character , including two recent translations of Virgil , attest the character of Western taste in poetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the authors of works of every shade of scholarship from a history of American literature to a discussion of the claims of Columbus as the true discoverer of America . Of writers on philosophy and ethical subjects , a brilliant array of names might be presented . Of contributors to the literature of education , no other section of the Union can boast so many and so able . Of scientists , many of the most notable in America are or have been residents of these States , and have accomplished a // large part of their work while there . In the field of literary criticism , there is an increasing number of able writers . The mere mention of the names of men and women in the West who have enriched our national literature by their contributions would exceed the limits of this paper . Enough has been said to show that the trend of thought , even in rural communities , is in the direction of enlightenment , refinement , and mental culture . Should the present rate of progress continue for another quarter of a century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall occupy the first position as regards intellectual attainments , the triumphs of literature , and the graces of social life ? SEVERAL years ago , the Hon. William H. Seward , in a speech before a Western audience , ventured the prediction that power would not much longer linger on the narrow strip between the Atlantic and the slopes of the Aileghanies , but that the commanding field would soon be in the upper Mississippi Valley , where men and institutions would speak and communicate their will to the nation and the world . " The centennial anniversary of the passage of the Ordinance respecting the Northwestern Territory witnesses the fulfilment of that prediction . That section of our country which one hundred years ago was regarded as barely worth the attention of our national legislators , has become the most important element in the superstructure of our government . In respect not only of position , but of wealth , of natural fertility , of political influence , of intellectual strength , of literary promise , it may well assume the right to be regarded as the Centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
