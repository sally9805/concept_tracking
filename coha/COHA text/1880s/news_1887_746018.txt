txt From present indications the season of baseball which has now opened will surpass in popular interest all preceding ones . In the two leading professional associations the clubs are as evenly matched as could be reasonably hoped , and the League is especially fortunate in this respect . Some of the best managed of the clubs have made unusual provision for the comfort of spectators , the wisdom of such outlays being illustrated by Saturday 's opening game in Philadelphia on the new and finely equipped grounds , which drew a throng of eighteen thousand persons . But the best promise for the new season is derived from the new playing rules , designed to put an end to some of the chief causes of dissatisfaction in former years . It is a go  --  l. sign for the permanency of this game that its rules are settled slowly , and only after repeated modifications , the result of experience , as has been the case with popular sports whose origin goes back through centuries . The fundamental principle in the amended rules of the present season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ umpire and diminishing the chances of error in his decisions . To begin with , the old distinction between high and . low balls has been abolished , and . any ball , properly delivered , which passes over the home base , not lower than the batsman 's knee nor higher than his shoulder , is a fair one . A great part of the dissatisfaction over the decisions of umpires in former years has been due to the old rule allowing the batsman to call for a high or low ball at his option ; that is , above or below the belt , this being a matter often hard . to determine . But the new privilege for the pitcher is more than compensated by changes in two other rules . One requires him to face the batsman , in a carefully inthcated position , holding the ball in plain sight , and not to take more than one step forward in delivering the ball . His " box " is also reduced in size to insure this restricted delivery . In addition the batsman is allowed four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while five called balls send him to his base , instead of six , as last year . The first effect of these various changes will be to increase the batting scores and diminish the numbers of strikings out by the pitcher . This will make the play of the season more interesting , since spectators like good batting , which keeps the whole field very lively . As for the pitchers , those who have the best command of the ball will be the most effective . A strange rule , however , has been made in crediting the striker with a base hit for reaching first base on five called balls . This is really only a case of a pitcher 's error , and it confuses the record as to the comparative batting powers of the players . This new rule is all the more out of place during the present season when the batting averages are certain to be very high . It will very likely be abolished . Another reform is that of moving the position of first and third bases so as to bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now passing over either of them must be , of necessity , a fair ball , whereas last year it would be fair or foul according as it appeared to pass over one part or the other of the base . Still another excellent change is that which restricts the coaching of base runners to certain fixed spaces , preventing the old trick of the coacher 's running in order to confuse the fielders with the idea that the base runner is running home . The rules in regard to balking , to the protection of the umpire against the crowd , to the exclusion of all but players from the field , to the overunning of first base , and several other minor changes are in the direction of removing grounds of dispute . The adoption by the League of the Association 's old rule , giving the batsman his base when hit by a ball delivered by the pitcher , might in a very close contest lead to some dispute , since it is modified by the proviso that the umpire must judge whether the batsman tried to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ test of the year 's experience , and some may be rejected after the season 's test . But they are in the main prompted by the right spirit , and are likely to give the various contests for championship pennants enough uncertainty to make them very interesting throughout the Summer .
