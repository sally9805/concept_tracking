txt A Boston publisher of engravings and chromos having offered several liberal prizes for the best designs for Christmas cards , an exhibition of the competing drawings has been held in this City . The show has excited a surprising amount of interest . Indeed , it may be said that it was in many respects a unique exhibition . For it is not only the first of the kind ever attempted , but it is the only one which has given an opportunity to show how deeply the art idea has taken hold of our people . Naturally , the wide publicity given to the announcement that prizes varying in amount from $1,000 to $200 were to be distributed among the successful competitors , inspired hopes in a multitude of family circles throughout the country . Nearly 800 drawings were sent in response to the invitation of the promoters of the enterprise . This fact is significant of the great extent to which education in art has been diffused by various causes . This large number of drawings , good , bad , and indifferent , came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represent many persons , many homes in which some attention has been paid to education in the fundamental principles of art . To be sure , the collection was largely made up of the work of amateurs . But , then , in a certain sense , this is true of nearly all the art work of the country . We are only beginners in a difficult field . Then , again , much of the work sent was below mediocrity ; and some of it was so inferior , that it was not shown at all . But , for the most part , the careful observer of the collection could not fail to be impressed by the excellence of the best of the designs . Undoubtedly , many a skeptical loiterer who went into the gallery where these drawings were exposed for criticism found his surprise growing as he examined them . It is certain that the publication of the best fifty of these works will enable us to say with truth that the American printingpress will now furnish the most artistic and beautiful illuminated cards in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art can be put into Christmas cards ; but it may be said that as far as this peculiar art industry is deserving of encouragement , it has received a notable impetus. ; - The collection to which we have alluded was interesting because it exhibited at one glance the commonest faults , as well as the most desirable attainments , of a large class of people . Even the intrinsic and irredeemable badness of some of the designs had a lesson for the critical observer . They:were revelations of character , which , to a thoughtful and imaginative visitor , were curiously fascinating . Some of the designs were self-conceited , some were overambitious , and a few were clearly the offspring of vulgar minds . Many of the pictures were skillful , pleasing , and artistic in separate detail , but confused in general design . One of the commonest faults of the competitors was the piling of picture upon picture in the design , multiplying intricacies by multiplying ideas , to the utter disregard of singleness of purpose . The most successful designs were those which presented the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course , there were here and there among this large number of pictures a few designs in which was a single well-expressed thought , but which failed because the central motive of the picture was unworthy . It should be borne in mind by the decorative artist that elaboration in excess is fatal to all artistic excellence . In this competition many who might have succeeded failed because they attempted to crowd innumerable fancies into a little space . Another curious feature of the show was the utter ignorance of some of the competitors concerning the pm-pose of a Christmas card . Surely , these pxetty little reminders of a festal season are sufficiently common in the shops at Christmas-time to give every student of art a correct notion of their errand . Yet many exhibitors , while sticking closely to the Christmas idea , furnished something which could not be called a design for anything . They sent interesting and creditable pictures , which were pleasing as works of art , but which were utterly useless for the specific purpose for which they were invented ; as if a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present himcelf with a model for La gang-plow . Some of these were very clearly the work of , professional artists , who , possibly , have a contempt for the whole business . It is unfortunately true that not a few of our American artists regard decorative art as beneath their serious attention , if not an invasion of their own field of industry , which should be resisted . Exactly what constitutes a work of art will never be settled to the satisfaction of artists and critics . But it is evident that art education in this country has not yet become so liberalized as to teach the proficient in high art that he may be a decorator without being debased . Some of the greatest men of the modern English school have not thought it beneath them to paint stage scenery , decorate house interiors , or invent designs for wallhangings , illuminations , and fire-screens . In our free and independent country there are many artists who would sooner starve than design a Christmas card . However trifling this matter may appear to the high and mighty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the exhibition was a good thing for American artistic culture . If the competition is to be renewed , as it is intimated will be done , the general results will be still more satisfactory . The competitors in this last race were mostly women . They are probably women who would be glad to find a market for work like this , done in the safe and pleasant seclusion of their own homes . And anything which opens a new channel for the disposal of women 's work is hailed with satisfaction by every generous person . In some aspects of the case , what may be considered an over-stimulation of decorative art is to be deprecated . But there is no immediate danger of any such excess . Decorative art will not always be in fashion , as now , but we hope the time will never comp when our people will fail to . see the value of tree art in every form of creative human in- industry .
