txt A large proportion of the population of West Springfield were before United States Commissioner Hallett to-day . The citizens of that bailiwick were evidently uuwillbig witnesses against two of their fellow-towns men . Theodore Demond and Arthur Demand . The case was a very peculiar Post Office affair , growing out of the appointment of Frederick L. Leonard , a Democrat , in June last , to succeed Theodore Demond as Postmaster . Demand worked hard to keep his office , as the Post Office was run in connection with his store . After Leonard was appointed he had the Post Office removed to a private house . Then the residents began a syeteinatio boycott against the new official , which , according to the testimony offered , was aided in a great measure by the Demonde . It appears that the Demands induced the citizens to leave their mail matter at their store , and they carried it to Springfield and welled it there . As a result of the boycott the receipts of the West Springfield office fell off nearly 50 per cent . Several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , were forced to admit on the witness stand that they had regularly and systematically boycotted the new Postmaster . James W. Erwin , a Post Office Inspector , testified that several weeks ago complaint was made to the department at Vashington of irregularities at toe West Springfield Mlles ; that he went to the town and found that the receipts of the office had averaged for nine quarters about $94 a quarter ; that Demond was removed in June last , aun that the last quarter . ending in . September , showed receipts of but $57 ; that he learned that there was a boycott on the and that Demond was running a Post Office in his store in the " brick block , " where the Post , Office had formerly been situated ; that he ( witness ) learned also that Theodore Demend was collecting letters , and that he , or his son , Arthur Demand , was taking them to Springfield to be mailed . Witness then lett two letters at Demond 's store at 1:39 o'clock ou a certain day , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Springfield office at 2:30 o'clock on the same day . Theodore Demond testified that he did not realize that he was running a Post Office , hut admitted that he received letters at his store and forwarued them to Springfield . In the ease against the son , Arthur Demond , it appeared . from the evidence of the inspector that the defendant was seen on one day to mail 11 letters at Springfield , and on another day 13 letters , all of which were brought from West Springfield . The defendant did not deny taking letters to mail , but said that he did not make regalar trips for the purpose . Commissioner Hallett at the conclusion of the evidence decided to hold each of the plaintiffs in $500 hail for the present sitting of the District ; Court Grand Jury . It appeared from a conversation with several of toe citizens of the town present that the feeling against the Postmaster is decidedly bitter ; that letters are collected daily all over the town by expressinen , milkmen , and others and taken to Springfield , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes at the office , and the case against the De-monde seems to have resulted In making the oppewits of the present Postmaster more determined than ever that the latter shall get little ; or nothing out of the office .
