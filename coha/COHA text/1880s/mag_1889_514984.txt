THE STATE OF IOWA . BY MR . JUSTICE MILLER . T ' *e State of Iowa occupies a space on earth 's surface between the fortieth and forty-fourth parallels of north latitude , and between the ninetieth and ninety-seventh parallels of longitude west of Greenwich . It is surrounded by the State of Minnesota on the north , by the State of Missouri on the south , and by Illinois and Wisconsin on the east , and Nebraska and Dakota on the west . The Mississippi River washes its entire eastern border , and the Missouri River its western . Its area is about 55,000 square miles . It was organized as a Territory by an act of Congress on June 12 , 1838 , and it was admitted into the Union as a State under another act of Congress passed March 3 , 1845 . The political power and sovereignty of this region was acquired by the United States by virtue of a treaty with France in 1803 , called the " treaty for the purchase of Louisiana . " Although it afterward became attached , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Michigan , and subsequently constituted a part of the Territory of Wisconsin , it never belonged to that large part of the country known as the " Northwestern Territory , " or as the territory lying northwest of the Ohio River which had at one time belonged to Great Britain , and was ceded by Great Britain to the United States by the treaty of peace of 1783 . The State of Virginia , which claimed this sovereignty , afterward relinquished her right also to the United States . This " Northwestern Territory , " which was the subject of the ordinance of 1787 concerning slavery and other rights granted to the people of that Territory , and out of which were subsequently created the States of Ohio , Indiana , Illinois , Michigan , and Wisconsin , did not include any territory west of the Mississippi River , as was distinctly shown by treaties between Great Britain and France , and between the United States and Great Britain . So far as the title of the United States to this part of the country is concerned , it rests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made by Mr. Jefferson on behalf of the United States , and Napoleon , First Consul , on behalf of France . The whole of this region called Louisiana had been the subject of contest between France and Spain in an early day , when the French claimed it as part of that territory discovered by Marquette and Hennepin , French explorers from the Canadian country , and the Spaniards as appertaining to their conquest of Mexico . Spain had had undisputed possession and control of it for many years prior to 1803 , and about a year before the treaty between France and the United States she had ceded it to France . The city of New Orleans , about one hundred and five miles above the mouth of the Mississippi River , had become a place of much importance by reason of its control , in the hands of Spain , of the navigation of that river , and the interests of the people of the United States living east of the Mississippi in that navigation was very large . Meanwhile we purchased all that was called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control of both sides of the Mississippi River to its mouth . Of course at that early day there was very little settlement of white people west of the river . The only point of any note to which that phrase can be applied was St. Louis , situated about twenty miles below the confluence of the Mississippi and Missouri rivers . During all the period of this controversy and of the transfers of the country embraced in the Louisiana Purchase , that portion of it now constituting the State of Iowa was in the undis Copyright , 1889 , by Harper and Brothers . All right8 reserved . // turbed control of various bands of uncivilized Indians . The names of these tribes * are numerous , and they do not seem to have established among themselves any distinct geographical lines separating their various possessions , but to have roamed at will over the whole extent of the wild prairies of this region . The State derives its name from the tribe known now as the Iowa tribe . Much learning , or at least research , has been wasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this word among the Indians themselves . While Washington Irving , with the license allowable to an imaginative writer , states that the meaning of the word is " beautiful , " and recounts the incident by which that phrase was first applied to the country , saying that the tribe who in their wanderings arrived at the highest point in the Iowa prairies , looking over the vast expanse of country uninterrupted by hills or swamps , involuntarily uttei*ed the word " Iowa , " meaning " beautiful . " But probably a better authority for the meaning of the word was Mr. Antoine Le Claire , a halfbreed of the " Sac " and " Fox " nations , who always asserted humorously that he was the first white man born in Iowa , though his mother was an Indian . He was employed for many years by the United States as an interpreter in their dealings with the various Indian tribes . His definition of the word was , " Here is the spot-this is the place  --  to dwell in peace . " It is very certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of one of its secondary rivers , running through a large part of the centre of the State , is derived from the name of the tribe . The earliest settlements made by any white persons within the limits of this region were on the Mississippi River , one in the northern part , the other in the southern part . Julian Dubuque , who was a native of Canada , and who had followed a French emigration from Canada into the Northwestern Territory to Prairie dn Chien , where the United States had established a military post on the east hank of the river , obtained permission of the Fox Indians about 1788 to work mines of lead which had been discovered at a point where is now the city of Dubuque . On the opposite side of the river , in what is now the State of Illinois , valuable lead mines had been discovered about twelve miles east of Dubuque . And the city of Galena , deriving its name from the ore in which lead is found , has been built up by the mining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established by Dubuque after their discovery , became the nucleus of the first settlement in what is now the State of Iowa . The privilege granted him by the Indian tribe was confirmed by the Spanish Governor , Carondelet , and Dubuque spent his life in mining and trade at that point until his death in the year 1810 . At a point on the Mississippi River about twelve or fifteen miles north of the southern boundary of the State of Iowa , where is now the town of Montrose , in the county of Lee , Louis Honord Tesson established a trading post . It will be perceived that both of these points of early settlements within the boundaries of Iowa were by Frenchmen , and were on the Mississippi River some two hundred miles apart , and were in the latter part of the last century , before any organized civil government , such as Spain might have pretended to assert , was established . The country remained under the actual control of various tribes of Indians , mainly the Sacs and Foxes , until the period of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of controversies between the chiefs of the Sac and Fox nations , led by Black Hawk , and white people on the Illinois side of the river , about the construction and validity of a treaty made between the United States and these Indians for the occupation of lands by the settlers . As the white people began to settle up the country which it was supposed was obtained by that treaty ( of 1828 ) , they came in contact with the Indians , who refused to give up their lands . This resulted in a bloody war , carried on on the Illinois side of the river by the Indians , who mainly crossed over from the Iowa side at or near Rock Island to assist their brethren in Illinois . The result of that war was the utter subjugation of the tribes , and a new treaty , made in 1832 , by which they ceded to the United States the larger part of what is now the State of Iowa . Another result of this war was that Black Hawk , the great warrior and principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by order of the government of the United States , and Keokuk , a subordinate chief who had opposed the action of the Indians , was made principal chjef of the // tribes . At the place on the Mississippi River where Keokuk had his home , a city has risen of sixteen or eighteen thousand population , which bears his name , and in memory of his friendship and service to the United States the people of that city have recently erected a monument , which adorns one of the handsomest public parks in the State . With the ratification of this treaty of purchase the Western pioneers began to make settlements in the country , and a form of civilized government was established by attaching the few people that were first in the country west of the Mississippi River to the Territory of Michigan for judicial purposes . In 1837 the Territory of Wisconsin was organized by an act of Congress , and included the region west of the Mississippi River of which Iowa was a part ; and the first Legislature of this new Territory was held at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the southern part of what is now the State of Iowa . In the next year , 1838 , Iowa was constituted a separate Territory , and the seat of government established at Burlington . There were also , about this time land-offices established for the sale of public lands , and surveys were made of these lands preparatory to such sales . These sales were by law first made at public auction-any person having means to do so being at liberty to bid for any lands of the government subject to sale at that time . There did not exist then any of those statutes afterward passed by Congress by which the first settler upon the public lands was protected by priority of right in making this purchase . Nor was there any protection for the buildmo 's , fences , and other improvements made upon the soil by the labor of the actual settler . It was only in 1842 that Congress for the first time passed a law which was the beginning of that wise and salutary system sifice come to be known as the " pre-emption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man who settled upon and cultivated any land of the United States a priority of purchase , at a fixed price , under proper circumstances . It can not properly he omitted , in any attempt to give an account of the progress of the State of Iowa from the organized Territory of 40,000 people to a State with a population of 2,000,000 , to advert to the generosity displayed by the Congress of the United States in granting its lands to States for various purposes of public use - of charity , of education , and of internal improvements . One of the earliest of these magnificent gifts was the donation to the then Territory of Iowa of alternate sections of public lands for five miles on each side of the Des Moines River for the improvement of the navigation of that river by slackwater . Under this statute 322,392 acres of land have been certified to the State . It is true that , so far as regards locking and damming smaller streams is concerned , the suggestion seems to have proved a failure , after a vast expenditure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and while Iowa was in a state of Territorial organization , the Congress of the United States made the donation above referred to . When we consider that the Des Moines River runs through the entire length of the State of Iowa , froni its northwest to its southeast corner , and that the lands through which it runs were then , and are to this day , as fine a body of rich soil as any in the world , the generosity of the grant can not be questioned . Iowa has also shared largely in the grants of land made by Congress for railroad purposes . Not to consume our space by minute descriptions of these grants , it will suffice to say that four roads GEORGE w . JONES . // across the State of Iowa from east to west , from the Mississippi to the Missouri River , had each the same grant of every alternate sectionwithin five miles on each side of its line , to aid in its construction . And to these , with other railroads in the State , Congress has given an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be safely said that the rapid growth of the State in wealth and in population is largely due to the construction of these roads , and would otherwise have been delayed for a period of time which can only be conjectured . This control and conduct of the sales of the public lands introduced into the history of Iowa two of its earl/men of influence and distinction . One of these was the Hon. George W. Jones , who , while living in the State of Wisconsin , was for many years Surveyor - General of the district of public lands which included Iowa , and who supervised the government surveys of these lands . The other was Augustus Cmsar Dodge , who , it is believed , was the first land-officer appointed to conduct sales of these lands in the Iowa district ; and he and General Jones were the first Senators of the State in the Congress of the&gt; United States . General George Wallace Jones was born in Vincennes , Indiana , April 12 , 1804 . His earliest introduction to Iowa was in connection with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he erected the first reverberating furnace in the State , and where he was the first to open a store for mercantile business . He wa* an aide to General Dodge , and took an active part in the Black Hawk war . He was appointed by President Buchanan in 1860 as Minister to Bogota , in South America , from which place , after the breaking out of the recent civil war in the autumn of 1861 , he was recalled . He ha* since resided in Dubuque , where he now lives , at the advanced age of eighty-five years , held in honorable esteem by his neighbors and by the citizens of the State which he so long and so faithfully served . General Jones occupied a prominent position in the Senate of the United States during the twelve years of his service there . He was unwearied in his efforts at serving his State and promoting the in-&gt; terests of its citizens .. In obtaining appropriations for public buildings , in securing land grants which we have already mentioned , in establishing a general system of&gt; liberal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the navigation of&gt; the Mississippi River , and in ways too numerous , thou , h important , to be recited here , he proved himself a valuable and faithful public servant . He was secon&amp; to Mr. Cilley , of New Hampshire , in the unfortunate duel with Mr. Graves , of Kentucky , which resulted in the death upon the ground of the former . Augustus C*esar Dodge was born at St. Genevieve , Missouri , on January 2 , 1812 . He was the son of General Henry Dodge , a great Indian fighter of the Northwest , who took a most efficient part in the Black Hawk war , in which also his son Augustus served in a minor capacity . Mr. Dodge was raised in his father 's family in northern Illinois and Wisconsin , the family , like many others , being gathered around the lead mines found at Galena* and Dubuque . When the sale of public lands in Iowa required the establishment . of offices for that purpose , one was located at Dubuque and another at Burlington at the same time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register of the land-office at the latter place , and he then removed to that town , which became his home for the rest of his life . In the summer of 1840 he was elected Delegate to Congress from Iowa . On the 2d day of September Mr. Dodge&gt; AUGU5TU5 c . DOnGE. // took his seat in the Twenty - seventh Congress , then convened in an extra session , and on the 7th of December he welcomed his father to a seat by his side as the Delegate from the Territory of Wisconsin . It also occurred , very singularly , that the father and son afterward served together in the Congress of the United States as Senators , the one from the State of Wisconsin and the other from the State of Iowa . Augustus Dodge continued by re-elections to serve as Delegate for the Territory of Iowa from that period until its admission as a State into the Union , December 28 , 1846 . The service of General Dodge as Senator continued from the 26th of December , 1848 , until March 4 , 1855 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1850 concerning the admission of the States created out of the territory ceded to us by Mexico , and on this subject our Senator , though strong in his Democratic sentiments , followed generally the lead of Mr. Benton . And in the great Kansas-Nebraska struggle of 1854 lie sided with Mr. Douglas in the passage of what has been since known as the " Kansas-Nebraska Bill . " The effect in Iowa of the passage of this bill was the utter overthrow of the Democratic party , which had , since the organization of the Territory , been under the control and leadership of General Jones and General Dodge . General Dodge was , on the 8th of February , 1855 , appointed by President Pierce Minister to the court of Spain . He discharged faithfully and creditably the duties of that high position . He died at Burlington , November 20 , 1883 . It is proper also in this connection to revert to the first Delegate who represented the Territory of Iowa in the Congress of the United States . This was W. W. Chapman , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in August , 1808 , and who is now living , at the age of eighty years , in vigorous health , mental and bodily , in the State of Oregon . A distinguished Kentuckian , John Chambers , was made Governor of the Territory of Iowa by President Harrison in 1841 . He was born in the State of New Jersey in 1779 . While Governor of the Territory his success in managing the relations of the country with the Indians was very great . On his retirement from public service Governor Chambers returned to his home in Kentucky , where he died , beloved by every one , at an advanced age , on the 21st of September , 1852 . The growth of the State of Iowa in population , in wealth , and in all elements of high civilization and prosperity , from the period of its admission into the Union , or rather from its organization as a Territory , is almost unparalleled . For a period of twenty years , from 1840 to 1860 , probably no State ever exceeded that of Iowa in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period , from the census of 1850 to the census of 1870 , and consider that this included the time of the civil war , both the ratio of the growth and absolute increase is wonderful . The census of 1840 represents the Territory of Iowa as having 43,112 souls , and that of 1850 gave her 192,214 . At this latter period she was the twenty-seventh State in the scale of population ; and in 1860 , numben rig 674,913 , she was the twentieth . In 1870 , with a population of 1,194,020 , she was the eleventh . It only remains to add that by the census of 1880 she was tenth in the Union , with a population of 1,624,615 . And the State of Michigan , which was ninth , and Kentucky , which was eighth , had only eight or ten thousand more than the State of Iowa . w. w. cHArMAN. // There are IIQ means at hand of ascertainin* with precision the present population of the State , but taking such evidence as there is , it may safely be estimated that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1890 will show that over 2,000,000 of people inhabit the State of Iowa . This growth is the more remarkable because it was unaided by any adventitious circumstances . It was the regular overflow of the population from the States east and southeast of Iowa . Like all new Northern or *Free States bordering upon the Southern or Slave States , and especially like Indiana and Illinois , Iowa received lar* , e accessions to her population from these bordering States , and especially from Kentucky , Missouri , Virginia , and Tennessee . There were , in the early days of Iowa , very few men of wealth , and still fewer who had any surplus capital to aid themselves or their neighbors in the cultivation of the soil . And even to this day , though a very prosperous State in many respects , there are few if any individuals in the State entitled to be called rich or wealthy , and there are no great organizations of banks or other associations with large surplus means . There were , during this period of growth , no large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was attracted , and which swelled the aggregate census of the State . If it be a misfortune , which maybe doubted , to Iowa that she has no St. Louis nor Chicago , nor even cities to compare with Omaha , with Denver , with St. Paul and Minneapolis , in States much younger , it is one to which she must submit , as the largest city in the State , the seat of its official goveriifment , the city of Des Moines , does not perhaps at the present day number 40,000 population . At the periods of the rapid progress to which we have heretofore referred , some three or four towns on the Mississippi River struggled up in 1860 to populations varying from twelve to twenty thousand . These were Dvibnqne , Davemport , Burlington , and Keokuk ; but it must be conceded that while the growth of the interior of the State has displayed such wonderful rapidity , these towns seem to have attained almost a stationary position at about the beginning of the recent civil war . The State of Iowa is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are few manufacturing establishments within its boundaries , although struggles have been made to establish them ; and while in some instances a partial success has followed , it can not be said that these amounted to much . The rate of interest for the loan of money which could be had in Iowa up to the close of the civil war was largely in excess of that which could be profitably used by those engaged in manufacturing . The ease with which persons who were dependent upon their own labor for the support of themselves and families could secure in Iowa land sufficient to support that family in comfort , with prospects of increasing wealth and happiness , created a source of competition for the labor necessary to carry on manufacturing establishments which almost forbade the attempt . These conditions are now rapidly changing , and it may be hoped that our infant manufactures will be more successful . Nor should it be a matter of surprise that the present population of Iowa should be mainly a population of farmers ; for no country exists upon the face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cheap , and the climate so favorable . We hazard nothing in saying that the 55,000 square miles , or the 35,000,000 of acres , of land constituting the area of this State has no equal in capacity for profitable cultivation , for salubrity of climate , for variety of productions , and for *oax cHAMBERs . // all that goes to make up a happy , a prosperous , and contented community , whose wealth and support grow out of the cultivation of the soil . In other words , it may well be doubted whether any civil or political subdivision of the globe , of a similar or nearly similar extent of surface , is capable of supporting a heavier population than the State of Iowa . It is destitute of deserts , of swamps , of mountains , which interfere with this purpose . The land , though almost exclusively prairie , by which we mean large bodies of it without trees , produces the richest kind of native grass , on which herds of cattle grow and fatten for the market . It is gently undulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undrained soil . There are several rivers which run through the State into the Mississippi and Missouri of such size as to . furnish ample drainage of the earth 's surface , and water for all needed purposes . Among these are the Des Moines , which runs from the northwestern corner of the State to the Mississippi River at the southeastern corner , a distance of more than 300 miles , which , until railroads superseded its use , was navigated by steamboats for 150 miles . The Iowa River and the Cedar are also very considerable streams in the interior of the State . At any point in the midst of the prairies farthest from a river a well dug down into the soil from ten to fifteen feet always supplies sufficient water of the purest quality . And though wood and timber were scarce , there was sufficient for the days of early settlement ; and beds of fine coal , underlying the surface of one-third and perhaps one-half of the State , render this scarcity of wood immaterial for purposes of fuel . The forty-second parallel north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa , and the climate of the State is very similar to that of Indiana and Illinois east of it . West , of it , if you go 150 miles from the Missouri River , the country where , for want of rain , the land is unprofitable for cultivation , begins . And as you go farther west it becomes altogether impossible to cultivate it without irrigation . The Iowa climate and the nature of the soil are propitious for as great variety of the fruits of the earth as any part of the world . The cereals which it produces in abundance are wheat and rye and oats and Indian-corn ; and in the reports of the census of 1880 it was found that Iowa produced in that year 31,154,205 bushels of wheat . Still later it has been reported to be the third State in the Union in regard to the quantity of wheat produced . Perhaps the most important crop , next to wheat , is that of Indian-corn . The animals to which the farmer turns his attention successfully are cattle and hogs and horses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa , owing to the want of mountam-sides , to the general level surface of the country , and to other circumstances . As in most new countries West , hog-raising was in the early days the most profitable business of the farmers . The animal which is fed , when it is to be fatted for market , on Indian-corn , is in fact the means of converting that article into bacon , lard , and pork . Gradually this business , originally predominant in Kentucky , Indiana , and the States near to Cincinnati , which for years was the great market where the hog was bought and slaughtered and converted into the products mentioned , has receded farther west . So also the raising of beef cattle , which until very recently was one of the most profitable pursuits in Iowa , by reason of the vast unoccupied meadows of natural prairie grass on which they were fed and fattened without much expense , has yieldJAMES W. GRIMES . // ed to the successful cultivation of the soil , by which these prairies have been converted into fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the production of potatoes and fruits , so that the cattle business has been largely transferred to the wild regions of the Territories bordering on the Rocky Mountains . These are not indications of decaying prosperity , but they are the necessary results of an increased population and the cultivation of the earth in the production of more profitable crops . This soil and climate are also very favorable to fruits , the apple , the cherry , the pear , the strawberry , the raspberry , all of which are successfully raised throughout the entire State . And the records of agricultural expositions show that Iowa rivals many of the best of the States in the production of the apple , both in regard to its quality and its quantity . In this growth of the State an element hard to be computed , but easily appreciated by one who has travelled through it at periods of twenty-five years apart , is the increased comfort , beauty , and salubrity of the homes of the people . Handsome houses , sometimes expensive , well painted , well ventilated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gardens in which the vegetables for the table and the flowers which decorate the homestead are cultivated with success , present themselves now where formerly the turf cabin or the slight effort to make a house which would pass with the land-office for a lawful settlement was only to be seen . The condition of these farmers has been very much improved financially by the cheapness of money growing out of its great increase in the United States since the termination of the civil war . The money which the farmer , fifteen or twenty years ago , for the purpose of improving his land , building his house , and stocking his farm , had to borrow at the rate of ten and twelve per cent . per annum , he has been enabled to obtain and pay off , if not wholly , in part , by the productions of his farm , and by the use of industry and economy . Or if not entirely free of this debt , he can now borrow the same money at six per cent. , with increased prospects of rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any equal number of farmers to those living in the State of Iowa a more prosperous , happy , and contented population . The system of education of Iowa , which has been a matter of earnest attention since the Territorial government was organized , may be considered under two asl ) ects-the common-school system and the collegiate system . The liberality of Congress in granting lands for the purposes of education in all Western States where the soil primarily belonged to the government can not be too highly commended . In addition to grants like 500,000 acres to aid in the establishing of a university , Congress granted later to each State in the Union a large amount for the establishinent of an agricultural college , and a provision in the act for the admission of the State of Iowa gave to her five per cent . of all sales by the United States of the public lands within the State , to aid the university . But there was the grandest gift of all in the provision in the same act that the sixteenth and thirty-sixth sections of every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purposes of common schools , under the supervision of the State . In some respects perhaps the State has not managed these various grants in the way to realize the highest amount of money and the greatest benefits for the cause of education . But the State herself has supplemented these gifts with contributions of her own , and with taxes levied on the people of each locality for the support of schools , so that these contributions and provisions have created a system by which every child in the State of Iowa , from the age of six to sixteen years , may pass six to eight months of each year of his life in attendance on school without charge . The rigid enforcement of this system has dotted the whole surface of the State with comfortable school - houses . And . while , perhaps , teachers are not paid very compensatory salaries , and therefore are not always the most capable for the business , yet as a system calculated to educate every human being in the State up to a certain degree of attainment , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of the incidents of this system is that most of the teachers are females , to whom the compensation is quite a blessing , who are generally better adapted to the education and training of children in their early youth than men , and who have , in the State of Iowa at least , done credit to the sex by their skill , their diligence , and good conduct . // The purpose of this school system was primarily to educate the youth in the elements of an English education-reading , writing , arithmetic , orthography , geography , grammar , history . In some of the ties-Iowa has suffered in common with nearly all the Western States , and perhaps some of the Eastern States , by the efforts to create a college in every town of any size , and for every religious de qwq of any Christian Church in the State , have thought it necessary to attempt the establishment of a college for each of its four Conferences . The result of this has been , in the State of Iowa , that the efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paralyzed . The colleges are unable to give salaries sufficient to command the services of competent professors ; none of them have the philosophical apparatus which should be provided ; all of them are struggling inefficiently , with one or two exceptions . The Congregationalists have in " Cornell University , " at Grinnell , a fairly successful college . " Iowa Sta , te University , " at Iowa City , has not been without reasonable endowments by the proceeds of lands given by the Federal government and by some contributions from the State treasury , but has not been very fortunate in the manner in which it has been conducted by the trustees appointed by the State . It is now , however , placed upon a footing which promises success , and with a new and efficient President ( Schaefer ) and with the confidence of the public , with an efficient medical department and a still more successful law department , it may be said to be fairly deserving the name of " university . " The agricultural college organized by the State five or six years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of land donated by the government , has not developed great capacity for instruction in agricultural labor and science , either because no sufficient system of instruction has been devised , or hecause the intestine controversies among the trustees , presidents , and professors have retarded its growth and obstructed its usefulness . The latter circumstance has been a source of regret to all who are interested in the institution . With regard to religion in the State of Iowa , we have already stated that the Methodists are quite numerous , having four separate Conferences in the State . The other forms of the Protestant religions , as the Baptists , the Presbyterians , the Congregationalists , and Episcopalians , have their numbers in about the order in which the denominations are here named . The Catholics , as might be inferred from the absence of a large city population , are not as numerous as in other States . The numbers of the church membership of each denomination , which can not be here given , make the State a marked one for its religious character . And as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came , and the advantages for education which it has had for now nearly fifty years , the population is a highly moral and educated one . With regard to its material prosperity , its wealth , and the extent of the cultivation of the soil and the profitable products of that soil , in place of any specific statistics in regard to the various classes into which the wealth of the State may be divided and its producing capacity estimated , we will give , as the best general indication of all this , a statement of the number of miles of railroad within the State completed and in profitable operation . This statement , with a comparison with other States , is taken from a statistical account for the year 1882 . In that year Iowa had 6113 miles of completed railroad . The four States which exceeded her in the number of miles within their bor JAMES HARLAN. // ders were Illinois , 8326 miles ; Pennsylvania , 6690 miles ; Ohio , 6664 miles ; and New York , 6279 miles . Of the five principal kingdoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of miles given for the same year in the same table was , for Germany , 22,563 ; Great Britain and Ireland , 18,186 ; France , 17,027 ; Russia , 14,067 ; Austria and Hungary , 11,738 . To make striking the wonderful progress of the State of Iowa , as shown by these figures , it may be stated that in 1850 , with a population of 192,000 , there was not a mile of railroad within the State . In 1880 , with a population of 1,624,615 , there were , two years later , 6113 miles of railroad in actual use . At this latter period she was the fifth in the Union in the number of miles of railroad in active use . And only five of the great kingdoms of Europe exceeded her in this respect . When we consider that these roads are all running now at a profit on the cost of construction , at a period when that construction cost nearly twice as much as it would now , and that the State itself produces but little for transportation which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made of the wealth of the State in that soil , and of the industry of her population . The situation of Iowa with regard to its finances is probably as favorable as that of any State in the Union . Her public debt as funded in bonds does not amount to $300,000 . And this would lon , since have been paid off but for the fact that it was created at a time when a high rate of interest was necessary to secure the loan . As all these bonds bear eight per cent . interest , payable in the city of New York , the holders refuse to accept the par value of the bonds not yet due , and the State has not felt inclined to purchase them at a premium , as the government of the United States is doing in regard to its bonds . Something of a drawback on this financial condition of the State exists in the amount of indebtedness of counties and cities , contracted mainly to aid in the construction of railroads . This sketch of the State would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ played in the civil war which we still call recent , though over twenty years have elapsed since its close . The State sent into the actual service of that war , from its beginning in April , 1861 , to its close in 1865 , 76,242 soldiers . Of these , all except the First Regiment were enlisted for three years or for the duration of the war , if that should be less than three years . This First Regiment was hastily called out for ninety days ' service by the Governor , and took part in the battle of Wilson 's Creek , at which the commander of the Federal force , General Lyon , was killed , while marching at the head of the Iowa regiment , whose colonel was too ill to be on the field of battle . At the time when the existence of the war was recognized by Congress , and the President made his first call for troops , Iowa had two Representatives in the Lower House of Congress , both of whom came home and were made colonels of Iowa regiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serving through to the end of the war . These were General Curtis , of Keokuk , and General Vandever , of Dubuque , the latter of whom is now , at the age of seventy-one years , a member of the same body , from the State of Cali JOHN A. KASSON. // fornia . Of the part which the State of Iowa and her gallant soldiers took in this bloody struggle it is impossible , within the limits of this article , to speak at any length . Their bodies were strewn upon every battle-field of the war , from Wilson 's Creek and Donelson and Shiloh to its close by the capture of General Johnston 's army in North Carolina . It would be impossible to select for special mention , without an invidious distinction , and within the narrow range of this article , those whose names are covered with glory , many of whom died upon the field of battle or while in service in the army . With regard to those who occupied positions in civil life during this eventful period , and indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , when the subject of controversy which led to the war was ripening to the issue which terniinated in that event , we can not omit to speak of several of the most distinguished . Mr. James W. Grimes , placing himself at the head of the party which made the issue in 1854 on the repeal of the Missouri Compromise by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of Congress , led it to a victory which included his own election as Governor . Governor Grimes came to Iowa from the State of New Hampshire . After the election of 1854 , and indeed during that election , he took the leadership of what afterward became the Republican party of the State . From 1854 to 1858 he was a wise and judicious Governor a careful conservator of all the best interests of the State ; and when , upon the expiration of General Jones 's term of service and his retirement from the Senate of the United States , Governor Grimes was elected by the Legislature to fill his place , it was recognized at once as the necessary result of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statesman . His service as chairman of the Committee on Naval Affairs was of the greatest value to the nation . Few men during the period of the war , and during the enactuient of what are called the " reconstruction measures " of Congress , including the amendments of the Constitution , exercised a more potent and favorable influence than Senator Grimes . Cool , clear-headed , sagacious , his opinion was often solicited and always listened to with great consideration . His independence of spirit and his profound statesmanship were strongly evidenced in his vote for the acquittal of President Johnson at the impeachment trial . Some two years after this trial was over , Governor Grimes , whose health had failed so as to render him unable to attend to his duties in the Senate , resigned , and left public life ; and after a short trip to Europe , returning to his home in Burlington , he died of the paralysis from which he had been suffering for three or four years . It may be doubted whether any man has ever possessed the confidence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grimes . The Legislature of the State which was elected at the time that Grimes was elected Governor , elected the Hon. James Harlan as Senator to succeed General Dodge . Mr. Harlan , a native of Indiana , migrated to Iowa during the Territorial stage of its existence . He served in the Senate of the United States until March 4,1873 , with the exception of a short period when he was Secretary of the Interior under President Johnson . Mr. Harlan 's services , like Mr. Grimes 's during this period of the war and of reconstruction , were by his colleagues and by the country appreciated very highly . Since his retirement from the Senate lie has held the office of president of the commission for distributing the award of the arbitration in regard to the Alabama claims , in which he has given universal 5AMUEL J. KiRKwOOD. // satisfaction . He is now living in retirement at Mount Pleasant , Iowa , in a lonely age , his wife and children , except one , being dead . Another distinguished man of civil life , mainly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the Hon. J. A. Kasson . Mr. Kasson was an active and efficient political worker in the canvass which led to the election of Mr. Lincoln in 1860 . He was made First Assistant Postmaster-General under the Hon. Montgomery Blair , and in that capacity , or by virtue of his experience in that position , he was appointed our representative to the European conference which established the system of international postage , where his services were invaluable . He was , during the war , elected to the Congress of the United States from the Congressional district of Iowa which includes the capital of the State . He served in that capacity during a large part of the war , and during the closing scenes of the " reconstruction measures , " and after a year or two of retirement was made Minister to Austria , which place he filled with distinction . He has since that time been a member of Congress . One of his more recent public services was two years ago , as chairman of the organization which bad charge of the celebration at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adoption of the Constitution of the United States . He has recently been appointed by President Harrison one of the commissioners to the Berlin Conference on the Samoan question . One other figure prominent during the war , but in civil life , is that of Governor Kirkwood , who migrated from the State of Ohio . Shortly after the formation of the State he settled in Iowa , and after several terum of service in the State Legislature was Governor when the war broke out in 1861 . His efficient services in raising and collecting troops , and devising means of clothing and equipment , secured for him the sobriquet of the " war Governor " of the State , having been reelected in the midst of the war to the same office with an overwhelming majority . He has since served in the Senate of the United States , and as Secretary of the Interior by the appointment of President Garfield . He has now retired from public life , and is enjoying a well - deserved rest , with a popularity not surpassed among the citizens of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who entered the public service about the beginning of the war was one of the present Senators , the Hon. James F. Wilson , a native of Ohio . He was a member of the Convention to amend the Constitution of Iowa in 1856 , and he succeeded General S. R. Curtis in 1861 as one of the two members of Congress to which the State was entitled . Afterward he was reelected , and served in the House of Representatives until March 3 , 1869 . As a member of the Judiciary Committee , and as chairman of that committee for several years preceding the end of his service , he took a prominent part in the legislation in support of the war , and in the enactment of the " reconstruction measures . " The country is indebted to him for the statutory provision which permitted negroes to testify as witnesses in the courts of the United States , and which did away with the rule of exclusion with regard to parties to the suit and persons interested in the event of the suit which had previously prevailed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in March , 1869 , he was offered by General Grant , on his inauguration as President , the place of Secretary of State in his cabinet . This he was compelled to decline on account of the condition of his private affairs , which imperatively demanded his personal attention . After remaining in JAME5 F. WILSON . // private life , except as one of the board of directors of the Union Pacific Railroad , he was elected to the Senate of the United States , Decer*iber , 1883 . He has since been re-elected , and has a full term of six years yet to serve . Mr. Wilson has always been and is to-day one of the strongest men presented by the State of Iowa to the public service , and has the unlimited confidence of the voters of that State . Another Senator who served as Representative , and who is now serving in the GEORGE W. MccRARY . Senate , is the Hon. William B. Allison , also a native of Ohio . He was elected Representative to the Thirty - eighth , Thirty-ninth , Fortieth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sagacious statesman he soon attained prominence , being for some years before he left that body chairman of the Committee on Appropriations . On March 4 , 1873 , he took his seat as Senator , and has been twice re-elected . In the Senate he has for many years held the position of chairman of the Appropriations Committee , which , from the responsibility it imposes and the power it gives , has long been considered as the highest post of honor in that body after that of President of the Senate . The estimate which the people of Iowa and the public generally place upon the services of Mr. Allison , and the confidence which he inspires amongst his friends and associates , can not be more strongly evinced than by the simple statement that at the recent Republican Convention for the nomination of a candidate for the approaching election of President Mr. Allison was presented by his own State with entire unanimity , and was supported by sufficient votes of the other States to make them amount to 99 at the beginning of the contest . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and has since been in the civil service of the nation in high position . This is the Hon. W. W. Belkuap , the son of Major-General Belknap , of the war with Mexico and the war of 1812 . Residing at Keokuk , Iowa , at the outbreak of the war in the spring of 1861 , he was appointed Major of the Fifteenth Regiment of Iowa Volunteers and took part , soon after the organization of the regiment , in the battle of Shiloh April 6 and 7 , 1862 . From that period to the end of the war his services were most valuable , attracting the attention of the country and , of his superior officers . He was rapidly promoted to Brigadier-General and Brevet Major-General of the volunteer army . An act of distinguished gallantry on his part during one of the battles around Atlanta can not be here omitted . The enemy , in attacking the barricades behind which General Belkuap and his troops were fi*hting , approached so close that General Belkuap reached over and caught a major of the rebel army by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoner . At the close of the war General Belkuap was made Collector of Internal Revenue for the first district of Iowa , and while holding that position he was invited by General Grant to take the place of Secretary of War in his cabinet upon the death of General Rawlins . This position he occupied four or five years , and in the administration of the affairs of the army , which presented many troublesome questions growing out of the dissolution of the army and the reconstruction of that which remained , General Belkuap was found most efficient . It is true that in the House of Representatives articles of impeachment were preferred against him , charging him with improper conduct in the disposal of a sutlership or post-tradership in the army . He was however , acquitted on trial before the Senate , and has ever since retained the // undiminished confidence of those who knew him well and were best qualified to judge of his character . organization . This was the Hon. George IAT . MeCrary , who after eight years of distinguished service in Congress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body , entered the cabinet of Mr. Hayes as Secretary of War , and remained there until he was appointed a Circuit Judge of the United States . Here , after four or five years of service , having a large family and struggling with comparative poverty , he accepted the offer of a railroad company in the West to serve as its attorney and counsellor , at a salary of $10,000 per annum in which he is now engaged . It is thus that by a niggardly policy and insufficient salaries the best offices of the country , especially its judicial offices , are abandoned for the pursuits of private life . Another very remarkable illustration of this truth is that of Hon. J. F. Dillon , who , after serving in the State of Iowa as judge of the local court , and then as judge of the Supreme Court of the State , and afterward as Circuit Judge for the same circuit afterward occupied by Judge McCrary , also resigned in the height of his usefulness and of his reputation as a great judge , and accepted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , and of counsel and attorney for the Union Pacific Railroad Company , in which two places alone his compensation was three times as large as that which he received from the government of the United States as Circuit Judge . There remains to be noticed one other remarkable figure in the history of Iowa , distinguished both in the military and civil service of the country . This was General Samuel R. Curtis , who was born in the State of Ohio , February 3 , 1807. and was educated at the Military Academy at West Point in 1827 . After serving as second lieutenant in the Seventh Infantry for a short time he resigned , and engaged in civil engineering in his native State . Upon the outbreak of the Mexican war , after assisting the Governor of Ohio to organize troops sent forward by that State , he was made Colonel of the Third Regiment . With this regiment he marched to the Rio Grande , where he was too late to take part in any of the distinguished battles fought by General Taylor . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left in command , and also to act as civil Governor in that region . In 1847 he accepted the office of chief engineer of the Des Moines River improvement in Iowa , and he removed to Keokuk in that year , where he established the home which he occupied from that time until his death . In 1850 he was made chief engineer of the city of St. Louis , and under his direction a general system of sewerage was established throughout the city , and the ponds which had been the sources of trouble were drained , and an invaluable service rendered to one of the finest cities of the United States . He was elected Mayor of Keokuk in 1855 . In 1856 he was elected to represent the first district of Iowa in the Thirty - fifth Congress , and was reelected to the same place in the Thirtysixth and Thirty-seventh Congresses . During this last Congress he was chairJOHN F. DILLON . // 0 man of the Committee on the Pacific Railroad , and while the honor of suggesting the practicability of that work and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is , by many persons , it is impossible to deny to him the honor , so well merited , that by his tact , his energy , and his familiarity with that class of subjects he did more than any one person to pass through Congress the law under which this great work was completed , and also that of the Central Pacific Railroad , the two making a complete connection of the Pacific coast with the rest of the country . Upon the outbreak of the late civil war , though one of the only two members to which the State was entitled in Congress , he at once returned to Iowa , assisted in organizing troops , and was elected Colonel of the Second Iowa Regiment , the First Regiment being merely ninety-day volunteers , who were disbanded shortly after the battle of Wilson 's Creek . From that time on General Curtis 's career was a distinguished one in the annals of the civil war . He at once suppressed the rebellion and protected the railroads from east to west in northern Missouri . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in St. Louis . He was finally sent with an army of eighteen or twenty thousand men in pursuit of Price and others in southwestern Missouri . He dispersed and followed these into the Boston Mountains in Arkansas , and at Pea Ridge , where the enemy rallied and gave him battle , he won one of the most remarkable victories of the war . It is very true that this battle , in the numbers of men engaged in it and in the practical effect it had upon the war , can not be compared to such great victories as the capture of Vicksburg , the battles of Gettysburg , Chickamauga , and otliers that might be mentioned , but if the comparison is to be made with regard to the tactical skill displayed , by which the Federal army was enabled to contest the field with twice its numbers , and also considering the overwhelming defeat of the enemy , it must be conceded that it presents features of ability and capacity for command in battle and in arrangements preliminary to it of the highest order . Yet General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any public form even the scant justice which would show the measure of gratitude and consideration to which his eminent services entitle him . After the battle of Pea Ridge he continued in command in the Southwest until lie was superseded by other commanders . He died December 26 , 1866 . The level prairie in the northern part . of the State , about half-way between the Mississippi and Missouri rivers , at a point near Spirit Lake , attains an elevation of 1700 feet above the sea . This rise from these rivers is so gradual that it was not suspected until some enterprising engineertested it by his instrument . A lover of his State , gazing from this point over the broad reach within his vision of wheat and rye and oats and corn , and the cattle grazing on its natural meadows , might paraphrase Mr. Webster 's eloquent allusion to Massachusetts , and say of Iowa : " She needs no eulogium from me . There she is ; she speaks for herself . " 5AMUEL R. CURTIS .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
