txt Everybody in and Out of Congress is hoping that the two houses will adjourn on Monday , but everybody wonders why , if the two houses can waste hours , as they did to-day , in making stump-speeches , an adjournment can not be taken on Saturday . The Senate did a little work to-day , but at 2 o'clock Mr. Morrill plunged the body into the tariff again by moving to lay aside all orders so that the bill to correct an error in the law might be brought up , and he added : " It is the Knit Goods bill . " The announcement was not unexpected , for the manufacturers of unit goods have been endeavoring for weeks to have the blunder made in passing a previous bill , also intended to be a correction , repaired by a new act . " What 's become of the tariff bill ? " demanded Mr. Beck , bouncing out of his seat . " I though that was to be taken up . " Mr. Morrill assured him that the tariff bill would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Morrill 's announcement was made with the utmost courtesy and with rare mildness of manner . The Senator from Kentucky instantly and breathlessly declared that if the Knit Goods bill was taken up his side of the Senate wonld offer all the amendments they had already offered to the revenue bill . It was to no purpose that Mr. Morrill reminded Mr. Beck that 354 establishments in different parts of the country were at a stand-still , waiting for Congress to act justly in this matter , and that it would take only a few minutes to pass the bill if it were taken up . Mr. Beck wasdetermined that the whole subject should be cone into . " I hope , " said Mr. Allison , " that the Senator from Vermont will take up the tax bill , if the Senator from Kentucky is so anxious . " Then Mr. Bayard offered a suggestion . He had no idea that the Senate had postponed the great subject of taxation , the proposition to reduce taxes , in order to take up a bill to increase taxes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugffested Air . Allison . The pleasant manner of the Iowa Senator irritated the Democrats . Some of them evidently feared an indefinite extension of the debate , for Mr. Butler suggested that before the talk began it was important to dispose of a resolution to adjourn which had been received from the House . For a short speech , that of Mr. Hawley , urging the importance of disposing of the . k nit goods bill , was one of the best of the session . The passage of the bill , he earnestly pleaded , was not at all a question of policy , but one of common decency , justice , and humanity . There were *16,000,000 invested in a business in 354 manufactories , and the manufacturers bad , by a decision , been struck by lightning out of a clear sky . It was of as much concern that they should be relieved as that the people of the South should be assisted in pestilence , the people of Chicago after a fire , or the people of the Mississippi Valley after a flood . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in their distress they ( melt to be assisted by the Senate . Mr. Morrill , yielding to the demand for the tax bill , pressed the motion to take it up , and it was laid before the Senate . For a short time it was laid aside at Mr. Williams 's request , in order that the bill to create a bureau of animal industry might be passed . After this bill had been discussed for a few minutes it was shown by Mr. Ingalls to be so loosely drawn that it would increase the number of officers in the Agricultural Department , create a new and expensive bureau with extraordinary powers , and that the powers conferred by it were really not desired by those who are axious to prevent the spread of pleuro-pneumonia in cat ' le . Mr. Van Wyck , who had favored taking the bill up , said he was convinced that it ought not to pass , as he saw that the bureau it proposed to create would live , if the Senate created it , long after the pleuro-pneumonia bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration of the tax bill , Mr. Morrill expressed the hope that , as it was clear no general reduction of taxes could be reached , some reduction could be made . He proposed that the Senate take the revenue bill as it came from the House , with the addition of the clause reducing the tax on snuff and tobacco 12 cents and the provision allowing a rebate on stocks on hand , and pass it , rejecting the other amendments . If the Democrats would not do this , he should regard it as a refusal to reduce taxation . For this proposition Mr. Bayard. leading the Democratic stump speakers , rebuked Mr. Morrill and said the proposition to reduce taxation was certainly a misnomer : With great apparent earnestness he rallied Senator Sherman for having made a speech setting forth the great necessity for a reduction of taxes , and expressed his astonishment at the change of view on the other side . He did not propose to accept the proposition without discussion , and was willing to stay and discuss the " shamefaced little apology for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would stay . Mr. Sherman made a speech in defense of 51 his position , and a somewhat apologetic speech , too , to which Mr. Beck replied , giving the Senate a slightly modified slice of that familiar speech ridiculing the proposed abolition of stamp taxes and the tax on bank capital and deposits , which has been heard so often during the session . and closing with a request for the adoption of Mr. Harris 's proposition to scale down the tariff 10 per cent . on Jan. 1 , 1653 , and again 10 per cent . on Jan. 1 , 1834 . He was followed by Mr. Hoar , who made the best speech of the day from the protection point of view . He accused the Democrats of seizing the opportunity to make stump speeches . They would not permit the taxes to be reduced $30,000,000 or $40,000,000 because tney desired to make a point against a political , antagonist , prefering to keep up the visits of the tax gatherers as long as they could , and by so doing make their opponents appear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate was equally divided , and that it would not be possible to lay blame on one side for failure to reduce taxes in face of the record . The Democratic proposition to make a horizontal reduction of 10 per cent . next January , and again a year later , would , he maintained , ruin manufacturers who were obliged to buy at high prices and sell at low prices . Even if the 30 or 40 amendments were adopted the Democrats knew that there was great probability of a failure of the bill in the House . He said that the people could not be deceived by the sneers , taunts , and stump speeches of the Democrats . He reminded Mr. Beck of some passages in his political history that were evidently annoying to the Senator from Kentucky , and closed with a reference to his recent remarks as " cheap and easily seen through bluster . " Mr. Vance 's remarks were funny and for free trade .

The widow 's salt was taxed 56 per cent . ; the couch of the sick man was taxed , and the poor man 's blankets , wool , hats , and other necessities , and yet here was a proposition to free banks , perfumery , cosmetics , and high , low , jack , and the game . For his part he would like to trample a hundred such infants in the ground every morning before breakfast just to get an appetite . This sort of talk provoked a laugh , and there was more laughter when , after Mr. Hoar had asked if Mr. Vance would like to have whisky added to the exempted articles , Mr. Vance retorted : " I said nothing about whisky . I think the Senator from Massachusetts must be dry . " To this Mr. Mar impatiently responded that he did not care for fun from the comic almanac , and Mr. Vance retorted : " No , that 's too near home .
