Second . To grant separations without leave of remarriage is not so disastrous to family life as to grant divorces , which but spread the evil for which they are provided as a remedy . Such separations may be granted for gross violations of matrimonial duties without coming into conflict with the feeling or faith of the great majority of Christian believers . Third . But , to grant divorce except for adultery , does come into conflict with the faith and discipline of large bodies of Christians . This is a very serious evil . It holds out a relief which multitudes are taught to believe to be unlawful . It destroys the dread which breaking up and reconstituting families is fitted to excite . If it tempts to commit the most serious crime in order to obtain a relief which could not otherwise be obtained , there are or can be laws which will make such a step costly to one who takes it . Fourth . There is a common , and we fear , well-grounded opinion that the procedure of many courts in divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , evinces a want of due regard for the most sacred things among men , without the protection of which there could be no morals and no religion . We fear that the number of divorces can not be lessened without stricter action on the part of the judges . And to those who may feel that it is an idle thing to keep alienated parties together , we offer the opinion of a great English lawyer , Sir W. Scott ( Lord Stowell ) : " If it were once understood that , upon mutual disgust , married persons might become legally separated , many couples who now pass through the world with mutual comfort , with attention to their offspring and to the moral order of society , might have been at this moment living in a state of mutual unkindness , in a state of estrangement from their common offspring , and in a state of most licentious and unreserved immorality . " THEODORI* D. WOOLSEY . JUDGE JAMESON . So* misconception prevails in regard to divorce laws and their administration in the Western States . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect than Chicago . Considering the origin and magnitude of its population , made // up by the confluence of the separate overflows of all nations , the public will doubtless be surprised to learn that that city lags behind many parts of the East in the relative number of its divorces . By those who know the facts , this has been publicly admitted . In a sort of pastoral allocution delivered two years ago to her various churches , through the mouth of one of her clergy speaking from the platform of the Boston Monday lectureship , New England made sorrowful confession of her own pr&amp;minence in this unsavory business . If her mouth-piece , the Rev. Dr. Dike , is to be believed , the liberal divorce system among us is to be reckoned as a New England idea . Before inquiring , as we purpose doing , into the operation of the divorce laws of Illinois , it may be worth while to ask whether the prevailing system of divorce is to be credited to New England . In brief , then , before the rise of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce , either by the consent of the parties , or at the will of the husband . This was the law of the ilindoos , the Chinese , the Jews , the Romans , the ancient Britons , and , with some reservations , of the Greeks . Christianity , re*3nacting the supposed divine law , placed strict limits to the right of divorce , confining it to a single cause , adultery , by which seems to have been meant only the adultery of the wife . From the union of the Christian and Roman arose the canon law , which , as the law of the Church of Rome , became , as to marriage and divorce , that of Christendom . Down to the Reformation , divorce a vineulo was by that law allowed only for causes arising before the marriage , as precontract , consanguinity , and the like , which were declared to make the marriage void ab initio . Adultery and other causes , subsequent to marriage , to the common mind equally justifying causes of divorce , were made grounds merely for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against these canonical restrictions , and in all communities in which their principles have prevailed a more liberal system of divorces has been established . Milton , in his " Tractate on the Doctrine and Discipline of Divorce , " laid down the authorities and the reasons supposed to justify this change . So far , then , from being a New England idea , liberality in granting divorces is a step in the general movement for greater social freedom which characterizes our modern age . If New England has become distinguished for it , it is because she has reverted farthest toward the original type . When diverse tendencies // have become balanced and the system has reached its best , there will be much freedom of divorce , but with it a constant and powerful pressure of moral considerations tending to prevent it . Whether the pendulum , swung by the early Fathers too far in one direction , has not by many communities been swung too far in the other , is a great social question , which , doubtless , is not settled by pointing to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England has a particular practice , to many minds proves that it is not obviously immoral , and that it must have plausible reasons to show for itself as a social necessity . The diversity of modern law and practice of divorce rests upon differing conceptions of the nature of marriage . The extreme secular theory is that marriage is a mere civil contract , subject to be dissolved , like any other contract , by the civil tribunals . That of the Roman Church , and of those communities which have adopted or inherited the canon law , is that marriage is a sacrament , dissoluble only by death or by papal dispensation . A third theory , advanced by writers on private international law , is that marriage is a civil contract , and more , that it is the creation of a status which is of public , and even of international concern ; and that while it may , for sufficient causes , be dissolved , it is not the Church alone , nor the immediate parties to it alone , that are concerned in its dissolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domiciled has a controlling voice in fixing its causes and its consequences . Properly viewed , divorce is a religious question only for the Church ; for the state it is merely a social question , and , consequently , as intimated by Hume , " all regulations** touching marriage and divorce are " equally lawful and equally comformable to the principles of nature " ; hence , they are equally subject to modification by the public authorities . Indeed , diverse customs and laws touching these subjects have been but attempts at different stages of civilization to reach the golden mean , where , either by the enforced continuance of marriage or by divorce , the evil to all concerned should be the least , and the good the greatest ,  --  the test question being , What regulations will best subserve the interests , first of society ; secondly , of the children ; and lastly , of the parties themselves * The arguments bearing on the question of liberal or of restricted divorce are very nicely balanced . Where by law // marriage is indissoluble , or where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolution , the discontented parties are likely either to abscond , or to defy law and religion , and sink into flagrant immorality . This presents the least injurious phase . Compelled to continue a hated union , they may endeavor to cast off their burden by crime , or seek revenge by brutal treatment of the innocent standing in the way . The law of England before the Divorce Act of 1858 illustrates these principles . Before a husband , for instance , wishing to marry again , could procure a divorce from his wife who had robbed him and run away with and married another man , he must have had recourse , at great cost , to three separate tribunals , ending with the House of Lords . This regulation , which rendered men desperate , was a fruitful source of crime . The experience of Rome was to the same effect . The maxim laid down in the pandects , hona gratia matrimonium dissolvitar , was much restricted by the later emperors , but the Emperor Justin restored the ancient license . The reason given was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed from indissoluble connections , required as a necessary measure the restoration of the law by which marriage was dissolved by mutual consent . " On the other hand , the knowledge on the part of married persons that they may easily , or for slight causes , dissolve their relation , tends to make all marital differences irreconcilable . But , if it be known that no divorce will be allowed for any cause , or that nothing but an offense of the most serious character can be made the ground for it , and that only at great cost in money and in social ignominy , quarrels will be settled and a modus vivendi discovered . This is the chief argument against liberal divorces . Whether it is of such weight that it ought to lead to a return to the restricted system of the canon law , or to a material modification of our divorce laws , is a question that can be determined only by studying the results of those laws as shown in experience . The experience of South Carolina , though perhaps exceptional , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no absolute divorce had ever been allowed in that State for any cause , and the general opinion seemed to be that the system had worked welL During the first years of reconstruction the old law was repealed and divorces were freely allowed . After a few years ' trial the old law was restored , experience having taught // the law-makers of the State that the old law worked better than the new . Whether , under the former , those desiring divorce had emigrated to other , thus swelling unfairly their divorce statistics , does not appear , and doubtless the experiment in an isolated commnnity , under such circumstances , must be far from decisive . In Illinois , divorces a vinculo are granted for adultery , extreme and repeated cruelty , desertion , and habitual drunkenness continued for two years , and for felony . Some other causes are specified , but they are of rare occurrence and may be omitted . Cook County , in which is the city of Chicago , had a population , in 1880 , of 607,468 . In the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these , 665 were cases in which no defense was interposed by the party accused , and 49 cases in which there was an issue tried by a jury or by the court . In something over two-thirds of the cases ( the exact figures are not given ) , the wife was the complainant . During the same year there were in Cook County 9,605 marriages . That gives one marriage to every 63.2 of the population ; one divorce to every 13.4 marriages , and one divorce to every 850.7 of the population . Of the 714 divorces granted , 318 , or 44.5 per cent . were for desertion ; 142 , or 19.8 per cent. , for adultery ; 141 , or 19.7 per cent. , for cruelty ; and 93 , or 13 per cent. , for drunkenness . These figures are undoubtedly painful ones , but , as intimated , they are below those exhibited by some of the older States . Thus , in Maine , in 1878 , there is said to have been one divorce to every 819 inhabitants ; and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to every 820 inhabitants . In the Western Reserve , a district of Ohio originally settled by emigrants from New England , there is said to have been , in 1878 and 1879 , one divorce to every 11.8 marriages ; in Ashtabula County , one divorce to every 8.5 marriages ; and in Lake County , one divorce to every 7.4 marriages . When it is considered that Vermont is an old State , with a ftxed population of nearly pure American descent , the ratio of one divorce to every 14 marriages , in 1878 , indicates a much greater laxity in its divorce laws than prevails in Illinois , even if no credit be given to the assertion made by citizens familiar with the facts , that in a certain county of Vermont , out of 22 divorces granted at one term of court , 21 were believed to be collusive . These figures remind us of the activity of the French courts during the Revolution , when , in the first // three months of 1793 , according to Burke , there were 562 divorces in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the same ratio continued for several subsequent months . In respect to the nativity and the business and social standing of the parties to divorce suits , it is , of course , impossible to make precise statements ; but it is believed that a large majority consists of freshly arrived immigrants from Europe , and from other States , the latter class preponderating . This arises , in many cases , doubtless , from the lessening of social restraints by change of residence , while in others the change was made probably for the purpose of procuring a divorce . Foreign-born applicants for divorce would rank , in point of numbers , thus : Germans , including Austrians , Prussians , and all others speaking German , Bohemians , Poles , Scandinavians , English , Scotch . To these may be added a few Irish and a few Jews , generally persons upon whom religious restraints have ceased to be operative . No business or profession fails to contribute its quota to the throng seeking divorces , but the number of so-called professional men is not large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial houses , clerks , saloon-keepers , actors , gamblers , farmers , and other classes of rather obscure men . Boarding-house life is especially fatal to permanence of the marital relation , perhaps because in it wives are commonly left without employment , and fall a ready prey to sinister influences . Every one , also , conversant with divorce trials , is struck by the frequency with which wives or husbands in the humbler walks of life tire of their connection , and abandon their homes , the wives carrying with them all that those homes contain , the husbands taking their ready money and most valuable effects , and neither ever returning . The more uneducated and inconspicuous the married persons , the more numerous are their divorces . And the number of ' the well-to-do , or rich , seeking divorces , is very small ; not be cause they are necessarily more virtuous , but because the social pressure upon them , and perhaps their intelligent perception of consequences , is greater . But by far the most important question relates to the rightful causes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce at all , that adultery is a sufficient cause . In the history of opinion in regard to it , however , there may be noted three grave inconsistencies : in the Bible the adultery held to justify divorce a yincub // seems to have meant , as it did among the ancient peoples generally , only the adultery of the wife ; when the rule was extended so as to deal equally with both sexes , the divorce permitted for it was confined to a separation a mensa et thoro ; and finally , the sincerity of the Church in opposing divorces was placed in doubt by its practice of authorizing them for money , by papal dispensation-thus , for mere purposes of revenue , winking at an infraction of the supposed divine law against divorces . As to the first , the reason given for the limitation was , in the main , a selfish , pecuniary one , personal to the husband  --  the danger of having cast upon him the care of spurious offspring . Spurious as to whom ? Of course , as to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have no application . But was the offense , when committed by the wife , ever intrinsically more destructive of the integrity of the marriage , or in its consequences more fatal to the interests of the family , or of the public , than the adultery of the husband , formerly winked at by the law and tolerated by the Church ? What force to justify even a separation , as against a wife , was there in the danger of spurious offspring , in a state of society like that which existed in France from the time of Louis XIV . down to the Revolution , of which there could be no more graphic or accurate description than that of iMlehemet Effendi , a Turkish ambassador , when he said to a Frenchman : " The Turks are great simpletons in comparison with the Christians . We are at the expense and trouble of keeping a seraglio , each in his own house ; but you ease yourselves of this burden and have your seraglios in your friends ' houses . " So of the rule authorizing divorces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly was not the rule of Jesus , but an extension of it to meet social exigencies . If the rule could be extended at all for such a purpose , why might it not be extended so as to cover all the real exigencies of society ? Looking alone to the consequences , is adultery , by whomsoever committed , deserving of greater condemnation than extreme cruelty , which , if repeated , is made the ground of divorce ? Cruelty is defined as physical violence endangering health or life , and making longer cohabitation practically impossible . From the nature of the case , such cruelty is commonly exercised by the husband upon the wife . A brutal temper can wreak itself upon its object in but two ways-by acts of violence , and by injurious words . The // acts are commonly blows with the fist , or with the first weapon that comes to hand , dragging the wife by the hair of the head , and the like ; the words , those dreadful epithets which , addressed to a woman , wound more cruelly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are assaults with dangerous weapons , poison in On&amp;5 coffee , with the most opprobrious adjectives in the language applicable to man . Such conduct indicates a temper incompatible with the marital relation , and , while it may inflict a less poignant mental distress than the scriptural cause , it ought not to be permitted , on any terms , to continue . It renders one great object of marriage , the right training of offspring , impossible . Consider , also , the case of desertion . We have seen that nearly one-half of all the divorces granted in Chicago during 1882 for that cause ; in a majority of the cases for deser-were tion of the wife by the husband . The typical case of desertion is that of a worn-out , heart-broken mother left by her wretch of a husband to struggle against poverty , alone , with his children ; their natural protector in the meantime playing elsewhere , perhaps , the role of father , after a fraudulent divorce from her , or a criminal second marriage without divorce . In many cases the deserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of struggle , has acquired a little home and a comfortable support for his children , and quartered himself upon her , contributing nothing to ' her support , and often selling her household furniture for drink . The great extent of our country and the migratory habits of our people make these the commonest of all the histories of domestic misery in our courts . So we might go through the whole catalogue of causes . We shall refer to but one more , that of habitual drunkenness . In the present state of our laws there may be much drinking of spirituous liquors without legally endangering the status of marriage . So long as a husband , is able to give to his family a maintenance and education suitable to their condition in life and adequate to their physical necessities , however loathsome he may be to his wife , however unkind to his children , however useless to society , he may continue to squander his means , to brutalize himself , and to disgust his friends , with impunity . Before he can be divorced for drunkenness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecuniary support . As if the mere failure to feed and clothe his wife were the greatest , the most intolerable injury to // her , and the compulsory making of her , year after year , the mother of offspring likely to become drunkards , ought to go for nothing ! While demanding the production of the technical evidence required by law , no judge , passing upon cases of that kind , can or ought to overlook the terrible evidence of physiological fact exhibited in the swollen face , the shaking hands , and the tainted breath . No such man ought to be allowed to become the father of any woman 's children . The best good , therefore , of the wife , of the children , and of the public , demands that some divorces shall be granted for non-scriptural causes . This no one much conversant with the trial of divorce cases will deny . But , when this is said , all has been said that can be truthfully said in favor of liberal divorces as they are granted in Illinois . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascertained , at least two-thirds , perhaps four-fifths , of the seven hundred and fourteen cases of divorce during the past year in Chicago either were fraudulent in fact , or , with a reasonably conciliatory temper on the part of the couples divorced , and under sufficiently stringent legal conditions , were avoidable or preventable . There is , beyond question , fraud in the inception of many cases . Most proceedings for divorce being against nonresident persons , brought into court by advertisement , of which a copy has been mailed to the residence of the defendant , if known , in a great many cases the residence is sworn to be unknown , and the result is a mere ex pctrte triaL In others , doubtless , there is real or virtual collusion : if there is no actual agreement not to contest the divorce , there is a willingness ' that it should be granted . A divorce suit is the only one known to the law in which both parties may desire the decree asked for in the bill . If disposed to collnde , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all cases of resident defendants not appearing , one or all of these conditions may , and often doubtless do , exist . While fraud or collusion may be suspected , if the technical proofs , well understood by the bar , are furnished , even if they have been manufactured , the court is generally powerless to look behind them , and the decree is granted . In far the greatest number of cases , no court , listening to the narratives of the parties , can doubt that , had they been held together by an iron bond making divorce impossible for any cause , they would , at an early stage of their marital differences , have effected a rec // onciliation ; the fatal step of revealing to gossiping friends their real or fancied wrongs would not have been taken , and so their mutual wounds would have healed " by the first intention . " If some divorces on all the grounds stated ought to be g'ranted , and if , as the laws are , there are vast numbers that ought not to be granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The answer is , the proceedings must be so modified as to reduce fraud and collusion to a minimum ; the consequences of a decree must be made to the guilty party highly punitory , and the public sentiment in regard to divorces must be corrected . The first requisite to an honest divorce is an actual domicile of the complaining party , for a considerable time , within the jurisdiction . The one year required by Illinois law is not enough . It invites immigration for the purpose of divorce . The next requisite is actual notice to the defendant , by copy of the bill , or proof to the satisfaction of the court that his or her residence can not be ascertained . This would cut off a large part of all the fraudulent divorces , rendered upon notice by publication in a newspaper . Still more important is it that all third parties interested in the suit , the children and the public , should be made parties , and be represented by counseL Not only is a divorce suit the only one in which both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bat it is the only one in which parties directly and often the most deeply interested , like those mentioned , are never made parties . To correct this evil , there should be appointed for the children a guardian ad litem , and it should be made a condition to the commencement of a divorce suit , that , unless exonerated from it by special order of the court , the complaining party should deposit with the clerk a reasonable fee for such guardian , and that the guardian should be required to make careful inquiry , and , if possible and just , an actual defense in the case . A similar regulation should exist as to the public , save that the State 's attorney should be required to appear and defend all suits for divorce . So much touching the notice and defense . Beside these changes , there should be one in the consequences of decrees of divorce to the offending parties . To permit both divorced parties to marry again is to place a premium upon the commission of the offenses by law made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case in which he was satisfied adultery had been committed for the very purpose of bringing about a divorce . // If that was true in New York , where no marriage is permitted to the offending party , how much more likely is it to be so where , as in Illinois , both parties may marry again . In one case , at least , in the experience of the writer , that species of fraud was committed . In cases of desertion , it should be provided that , if the complainant be a wife , the court should have power to grant the divorce , or , at her option , to continue the case , to await her application for a requisition to compel her husband to return and resume the performance of his marital duties . Upon his undertaking to do so , he might be discharged , upon reasonable conditions as to future good conduct ; or , upon his refusal , he might be ordered to be committed to prison , if it should appear that he had absented himself from her without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of legislation would involve a Fed .. eral enactment authorizing requisitions in such cases , constitutes no objection to it . One who has lost a watch worth fifteen or twenty dollars , by theft , in Maine , may set in motion the formidable machinery of State and Federal law , and drag the thief back to that State from the remotest corner of Oregon . Why should the wretch who has left his helpless wife and children , in the same State of Maine , and " gone West to grow up with the country ' * and another wife , not be dragged back from Oregon as well ? If it be said that theft is a crime , and that the desertion of one 's family is a mere social wrong , then let the wrong , so infinitely surpassing the crime in its meanness and in the misery it entails , be reclassified , or a definition be given to crime which shall embrace it . Doubtless a Federal statute upon that subject ought to be supplemented by others regulating the whole subject of marriage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the States , the despair of courts and publicists and the opprobrium of the law . Finally , the most effective remedy will be the elevation of public sentiment in regard to the sanctity of marriage ; not sanctity in the ecclesiastical sense , which makes of it a sacrament , but in that of the highest social obligation that can bind the conscience of a man of honor and honesty  --  the obligation to keep the faith he pledged in marriage to his wife and to the state , and which he renews upon the birth of each of his children , to abide with her until death , unless separated by law for strictly necessary causes .
