txt A report that the Legislature will be asked to abolish the State Board of Charities by cutting off the threethousand-dollar appropriation for its support occasions much disquiet in certain circles here . Friends of the board urge that opposition comes from petty politicians who find themselves handicapped by the board 's watchfulness . The board consists of Mrs. Dr. Francis Bacon and James Gallagher , of New-Haven ; Virginia T. Smith and Henry E. Burton , of Hartford , and H. P. Harris , of Salisbury . The board has a general supervision of the charitable institutions of the State . Mr. Burton , as Secretary , draws $1,800 salary , and is allowed $300 for office rent , the other $900 of the appropriation of $3,000 being allotted to traveling expenses . Opponents of the board aver that practically the chief aim of the board 's existence is to furnish Mr. Burton , who was Executive Secretary to the late Gov . Jewell , with a snug berth , while really no substantial good comes to the State . One of the New-Haven members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposition to abolish the board , making charges which point to a condition of affairs in the management of Connecticut almshouses that would seem to demand an official investigation , as they are sure to create a sensation . " When the Board of Charities was first organized , " said this member , " a good many people looked upon it as a farce , and it did n't accomplish much in the way of showing up the base and heartless management of the almshouses , of which we have any number in Connecticut . But new life has been infused into the board , and its members have shown to the citizens of the State in their report for the year 1881 the immense and useless expense involved in running these institutions , which are simply lodging houses for lazy and drunken women and good-for-nothing men . It is an outrage on the taxpayers of the State that they should be made to pay in cash every year the monstrous sum of $556,315 50 for the support of these worthless people . Take . for instance , our almshouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able-bodied men and women . That they are well treated no one in his senses will deny . The trouble in this particular case is that they are altogether too well treated . They should be made to work . The Selectmen will say they do work , but it does n't take the number of women they have out there to do the work required . They are simply a lot of lazy old trollops . Where these people ought to be is in the workhouse . In tact we should have no almshouses . They should be supplanted by the workhouses and the infirmary . " " Have you any idea of the number of almshouses in Connecticut ? " " Well , there are about 100 , and in some of them the most heartless cruelty is practiced upon the inmates . In almost every town in the State , in ' some out of the way spot , you will find what is called an almshouse . It often happens that these buildings are little more than ricketty old houses abandoned by their former occupants , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have gathered through my visits to these places , I find that the new and cozy cottages inhabited by the keepers are in reality the almshouses . That is , they have been erected by the town , but Instead of putting the pauper 's in the buildings , in which the taxpayers intended they should he placed , they have been thrust into the old dwellings of the keepers , where men , women , and children live together without any supervision whatever . " Here is another little instance of facts the existence of which the board has forced upon the notice of the State lawmakers . Some time ago the Legislature passed a law providing for the erection of temporary homes , where the children of drunkards and paupers might be placed . Now what do we find ? We find that an amendment , engineered evidently by the Selectmen of the towns has been made to this excellent law which practically offsets the law , as it allows children to live in almshouses provided their parents live there also . This is wholly wrong . Anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is precisely what this law as amended does . It has been the work of the board to make public and seek reform for these abuses . The appropriation is needed to carry on the work effectively , and is not excessive . The whole pauper law of the State is in the interest of spoils-seeking ' politicians . "
