txt Ex-Senator Dorsey has written the following letter to the newly elected Secretary of the Republican National Committee : Gen. Jan A. Martin , Atchison , Kan. ; DEAR SIB : At the time when I was confined In a dark room , not able to see walls that surrounded me , I received a letter from you which I answered by dictation . as I have been obliged to do for many months . I supposed my answer was sent you , but it turns out that the stenographic notes were never transcribed . I reeret this for the reason that I would not wish to feel guilty of discourtesy to a man who has always been just to me . When I was appointed Secretary of the Republican National Committee at the request of Gen. Garfield , and accepted the place at the earnest solicitation of Gen. Arthur , representing the Grant side of the house , and the Hon. William E. Chandler . representing the Blaine side , I made the same request of Gov . McCormick , who was my predecessor . that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fanciful notion that a record had been kept of the Republican Party that showed its life and purposes , and that would leave a permanent history of its honorable existence and what had transpired in 1856 , 1860. 1864. 1808 , and 1872 , and that that record belonged to the Republican National Committee , and that the Secretary was the proper custodian of it . The answer I received from Gov . McCormick was that no record had bean kept ; that a bonfire of forgetfulness was built to eat up what we had the right to assume to be the evidence of honesty at the end of each campaign . By the great mass of the people of intelligence in the North it is believed now , and will be believed for all time , that there is not a scrap , a word , a dot , or a line in any record that will show a wrongful act on the part of any person charged with the duty of representing the Republican Party during a national campaign . Mr. Chandler was unquestionably the ablest man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee . being one of the first , if not the very first , who was recognized as the real head of the Republican Party in the sphere assigned him . It was therefore only proper that those who followed him should be governed by the precedents he laid down . Mr. Chandler gave Gov . McCormick no records . Gov . McCormick. in reimonse to a letter similar to the one you have written me , told me be had no records to give . They were my predecessors and you are my successor . I have nothing more to give to you than they had to give to me . I have a great mass of papers relating to the last campaign . They are chiefly made up of letters addressed to me , and letters written by me to others , in which no one could have the slightest , interest , except to obtain curious information . When I accepted the Seertaryship I made it a condition that not a penny of money subscribed for political purposes should come into my hands , and there never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out by me personally . Money was used under my direction , but all my personal expenses and the expenses co ; the clerks serving with me were paid from my own pocket , amounting to something over 513,000 . I say this much lest you may think that I have ' records showing the receipts and expenditures of 1880 . The only records of that kind I have are the paid cheeks of my own contribution , and the unfortunate bank book showing the charees of my own folly . I regret more than I can , tell ttutt I made it possible that such records should be in my hands , but they are here . and I think best to keep them as a reminder of the splendid gratitude of dishonest power . I do not owe the Republican National Commitsee a cent of money or a grain of thankfulness . In the midst of a storm brought about by the efforts I had put forth under its directions , and in its behalf. : a brutal assault was made upon me at the last meeting of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not one among the 40 members present had the courage or manhood to resent the miserable cowardice of an ambitious hypocrite . But never mind that . The balance sheets of justice will some time De written by the hand of honor . So far as you are personally concerned , If there is any paper in my possession or any suggestion I can make that you think will be useful to you , will be gratilied to respond to your call .
