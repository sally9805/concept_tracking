EVENTS of importance which have recently occurred in the United States , in France , and in England , are drawing public attention to the subject of oaths , and are causing the inquiry to be made , Of what conceivable use are they , especially in legal proceedings , in this age of enlightenment ? Not long since , in New York , a man was imprisoned because , having some scruples ( which the court held did not fall within the general provisions of the law upon the subject ) as to the prescribed form of the oath , he refused to be sworn as a witness . In England the ease of Bradlaugh has led the majority of Parliament to exhibit feelings so conservative and narrow-minded as to cause elsewhere emotions of profound surprise . In France , on the other hand , the ministry but a short time since introduced a wise and liberal measure in reference to the taking of oaths . The only practical use of an oath is to increase the moral responsibility of the person to whom it is administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employed for other purposes . In later times it has been used as a means for harassing and persecuting those not of the same religious faith as the lawmakers themselves . Oaths were prescribed which none could conscientiously take unless they believed exactly as the legislators did . If they could not so conform their belief , they were excluded from ali offices and emoluments and from testifying in courts of law , which , however , proved a greater injury to others than to themselves . As laws have until a very late period existed in America as well as in England , oaths have been required which might easily be taken by the infamous Lord Jeifreys and by the more infamous Benedict Arnold , but which could not be subscribed by men of such pure lives and exalted piety as Richard Baxter and Jonathan Edwards . Had the philosophers Confucius or Plato or Pascal lived in and been natives of England // or some portions of America at a recent date , they would have found themselves little better than outcasts from their inability to take certain oaths according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ward politician , who cared no more for the sanctity of an oath than for a puff of tobacco-smoke , would have been permitted to swear as rapidly as an officer could administer the oath . How powerful an influence would the ceremony exert upon the conscience of such a man ? Conscientious men are frequently restrained from swearing at all . Those who are conscientious will tell the truth under ali circumstances . The remainder of the human family do not place much importance upon the sacredness of any form . The absurdity of some of these requirements is illustrated by our famous " iron-clad " oath . Every loyal man who shed his blood in defense of his country has been compelled to take this oath when inducted into any office . He could of course take it readily enough . But what good did it accomplish ? For the man , however , who had participated in treasonable practices or borne arms against the lawful government , a different and far milder oath was provided , for he could not take the one termed " iron-clad " without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such proceedings , especially in a country where freedom of conscience is guaranteed to all ? Some men appear to believe that the Supreme Being regards outward forms more than real virtue , and that he will punish a person who tells a falsehood in one way with far greater severity than he will one who tells it in another . According to their view of the case , a man under oath , making a statement which is false , but otherwise harmless , would be caused to suffer more acute agony in the future world than one would be who , not under oath , told a willful and malicious lie , which ( as he intended it should ) caused an irreparable injury . Are we not to suppose that it is the falsehood itself , and the intent to deceive , which are considered by the Supreme Being ? Or does he regard the particular forms under which it is told ? " It is laid down by legal authorities , " writes Lord Hardwicke , " that what is universaliy understood by an oath , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God upon him if the oath he takes is * Oaths are of very ancient origin . Devised by priestcraft to still further fetter the consciences of its victims , terrible denunciations were uttered against those // who made false ones , or who failed to do as they had sworn ; and the dark clouds of that old superstition yet shadow the world , which teaches that prevarication , deception , and even willful lying are comparatively harmless , but that breaking an oath is truly terrible . The practice of administering oaths in judicial proceedings existed for many centuries before Christ . The priests of every clime and of every faith lent their arts and influence to render the ceremony as impressive as possible to the minds of the uneducated . For themselves , however , they reserved the privilege of dispensing with the obligation so incurred , when to fulfill it would prove a serious inconvenience . As the means of rendering promises more sacred and effectual , the Egyptians , ilindoos , Persians , and Hebrews , enforced the custom upon all grave occasions . The Greeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation was derived the form now in common use , of terminating the ceremony with the words " So help you God . " History does not record that this universal practice has at any time resulted in good , nor is it shown that in any instances it has proved more beneficial to the human race than the simple Yea , yea , Nay , nay , prescribed by the Founder of the Christian religion . The administration of oaths is required in America upon every trivial occasion . Any man elected to office , however unimportant it may be , is in every instance sworn to support the Constitution of the United States and to perform the duties of his office to the best of his ability , when in nine cases out of ten he does not know ( and never takes the trouble to find out ) , what the Constitution contains , nor of what the duties of his office consist . Under these circumstances the sanctity of an oath can not long be regarded by the people with any exalted degree of reverence or of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the custom . The Friends and Moravians have refused on the one hand to take oaths , Freethinkers upon the other . One class of writers has treated the ceremony as absurd , the other as profane . The governments of America and England have ascertained that in the cause of justice it was necessary to modify to a certain extent the strict rules which had long been established as to the forms of oaths and the admission of testimony . Now , as I have already stated , the subject has assumed great prominence in England and France , as well as in America , by reason of cer // tam judicial and parliamentary proceedings . The countries first mentioned still retain many ancient prejudices . In both of them a class exists which can not comprehend the meaning of advancement and reform . They look back with regret toward the Dark Ages . In England , where , as Mr. Labouch*re says , " the climax of unreason has been reached , when an oath is taken on a book which contains the words Swear not at * the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being sworn as a member of Parliament , upon the ground that he could not take the required oath , and then , when he did take it , expelled him for having done so . The French Government , which appears to be pursuing a safe and enlightened policy , has seen proper , on account of the increasing antipathy to oaths and of the great changes in religious belief , to introduce into the Chamber of Deputies a bill which will give to the scrupulous and the skeptical the right of merely affirming . This certainly is a step in the right direction . It was recently stated that in one case , in France , a witness argued with the court for more than an hour before he would consent to be sworn . Another witness insisted upon the removal of the crucifix from the hall of justice . In another French court the foreman of a jury was discharged because he refused to take the prescribed oath . In England , where the law-makers have , even in this age , seemed to regard a large class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spirit of advancement , to judge from late proceedings in the House of Lords , appears to be making slow but certain progress . In the consideration of such matters the condition of a man 's conscience should have greater weight than that of his faith . England has never been more badly governed than when neither Catholics nor Dissenters , Jews nor Freethinkers , were permitted to sit in the Legislature , and when every member of Parliament could cheerfully subscribe to the Thirty-nine Articles of the church , and take every test-oath devised and in force during the two preceding centuries . These men , so eminently orthodox , did not , however , hesitate to plunder and betray their country . Even those who have most strenuously advocated the necessity of oaths have admitted that a high sense of honor was equivalent to a fear of future retribution . Thus , in England , noblemen who sat upon the trial of their peers were not sworn . They delivered their vote or verdict upon honor . In America , the certificate // upon honor of an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affidavit of another person . In judicial proceedings likewise , if a witness is not governed by a sense of honor and of right , or by fear of punishment in this present world , how far in these days of independent thought will he be restrained by the dread of punishment in the vague hereafter ? If he is a consistent Christian , an oath can not further add to his determination to " tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth . " If a skeptic , he will either be guided by a sense of honor or by fear of immediate punishment . If a Christian in belief , but not in practice , he is presumed to stand in greater fear of the penalties of perjury in this world than of those in the next , for if the fear of future punishment ( in which he must fully believe ) does not influence him nor direct his actions in other earthly affairs , why should it as to fnlfllling the obligations of an oath ? The Bible says that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it be a greater abomination because certain forms have taken place before the lies are told ? Whatever peculiar views any class may entertain upon the subject , nothing more sacred than the presence of God can now be invoked in the cause of truth . In former times a different opinion prevailed . William the Norman , prior to his conquest of England , compelled Earl Harold , his shipwrecked guest , to take what was then regarded as a terrible oath , to support and assist the ambitions projects of the Norman duke . To render the oath more effective , William is said to have concealed under the altar upon which it was taken all the old bones ever appertaining to a saint which he was able to gather from the different parts of Europe . William , for his chicanery , was rewarded with the blessings of the Pope ; while Harold , for his brave defense of the liberties of his country , received nothing better than anathemas . The forms invented for binding a man 's conscience are various and peculiar . Those most simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , as Professor Dwight writes in an article on oaths in one of our cyclopedias , " Each witness is allowed to take the oath in the form which , according to his view , is the most binding upon his conscience . " The Greeks and Romans swore upon the altars of their gods , a custom subsequently introduced , with other Pagan ceremonies , into the Roman Catholic Church . The Persian swears by the beard , the // llindoo by kissing the finger or toe of a Bralimin , the Parsee by holding the tail of a cow , the Christian upon the Gospels , and the strict Catholic upon the Gospels with a cross . The Jew may be sworn upon the Pentateuch . In ancient times he placed his hand , when making oath , upon certain parts of a man 's body . The Chinaman from one province swears by a burning scroll upon which have been written certain cabalistic words . Those from another province take the oath by kneeling and breaking a china saucer against the witness-stand ; while those from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which their consciences can be bound is to have the ceremony administered upon the quivering body of a cock just decapitated and bisected . Yet , according to the authority above quoted , any of these ridiculous forms must be permitted in our halls of justice . As stated by the same writer , the oath in ancient times was regarded as an imprecation or an address to the Supreme Being , caUing upon him to visit with his vengeance the person who should commit perjury ; but more recently it is regarded in the nature of a warning or suggestion that God will fitly punish false swearing . As I have said , the forms for oaths now generally used in this country are exceedingly simple . They should also be regarded as very impressive . Yet of what avail are they ? In the Territory of Wyoming , and in other portions of the United States , the person who , by false swearing , causes the conviction of another of a capital offense , is regarded by the law as being himself guilty of murder , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a provision in the statute books will accomplish more toward checking false evidence than the exaction of all the oaths ever invented by the cunning of man . Many of our leading jurists are strenuously opposed to the law which permits parties to suits to testify in their own behalf . They insist that such laws encourage false swearing , and that acts of perjury are rapidly increasing . If such is the case , it tends to prove that neither the fear of punishment in this world nor in the world to come wrn deter witnesses from perjuring themselves where they are interested . Mr. Junkin , a clergyman who has written very fully upon this subject , and who regards oaths as of divine origin , says , nevertheless : " Many deny that it is lawful in the sight of God to take an oath , while thousands who do not scruple to be sworn are ignorant or regardless of the // awful obligations they assume , and swear with rashness and frivolity , without a proper sense of the criminality of such conduct . So grievously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form distorted in our courts of justice , that it fails to a lamentable degree to subserve the ends for which it was instituted . " It appears difficult at the present day to conceive the character of a person who , neither fearing the penal enactments of man against false witnesses , nor the denunciations of God against liars ; a person who would not hesitate to rob his neighbor of all his possessions by means of false testimony , nor to send him to the penitentiary or the gallows by the same instrumentality ; yet who , in opposition to his own interests , would be restrained from the commission of all these enormities solely by the sanctity of an oath and the fear of the additional punishment in the future world . He might reason with himself that man , unable to prove his guilt , would not punish him ; but that an omniscient God certainly would . Could not God as readily perceive and punish the sin of making a false statement , by which an innocent man would be defrauded , imprisoned , or judicially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just described , he must closely resemble that robber mentioned by Irving , who had no scruples whatever about cutting the throats of several of his fellow-beings before breakfast for a small sum of gold ; but was thrown into an agony of remorse when he learned that he had been eating a piece of meat upon a fast-day . Nothwithstanding the dignity of our courts of justice , the customary methods of tendering oaths are far from impressive , and to people possessed of great veneration are somewhat shocking . The person who administers them is not usually eminent for piety . To obtain the position of clerk , he must rather have evinced political shrewdness and profound sagacity . He is far better acquainted with the voters of the Ninety-ninth ward than with the Psalms of David or the Holy Gospels . He hardly seems to be the proper person to invoke the Supreme Being to aid a faltering witness , or to denounce the wrath of Heaven upon the one who gives false testimony . Upon the opening of a term of court , one of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Directing the one who has been selected as foreman to stand up , he hurries through with the prescribed form in a manner scarcely intelligible to those even who are familiar with it . // The rest of the grand jury are then sworn in squads and platoons , without having the oath repeated to them , and at the close the man of cleanliness and refinement is compelled to bow down and kiss the same ancient and greasy volume , which for years has been used for similar purposes , with his next neighbor whose month has never known a tooth-brush , whose lips are dripping with tobacco-juice , and whose breath is redolent of whisky and onions . Is it remarkable that some should prefer to be sworn with the uplifted hand ? Then as each witness takes the stand , the Supreme Being is again called in by the clerk to assist in the judicial proceedings and to brace up the witness to do his duty . Jeremy Bentham1 in 1817 , wrote of oaths in his strange style : " On the supposition that , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other purpose , be exercised or exercisable , an absurdity than which nothing can be greater , can not be denied to be involved ; man the legislator and jndge , God the sheriff and executioner ; man the despot , God his slave . . . - God is a negligent servant indeed , but still a servant ; He disobeys the orders nine times out of ten , but he pays obedience to them on the tenth . " In many of the Western States witnesses are sworn en masse , to save time . While the ordinary business of the court is progressing the clerk finds it convenient to add to his own emoluments by increasing the number of American citizens . On such occasions another oath is employed , the termination of which at a little distance sounds very much like " s'port the Conshetushun United States , so help-yeh God - five dollars , sir . " To an enlightened American of the present day , whether he is an orthodox Christian or an advanced Freethinker , the practice must appear not only useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this time assist courts of justice in arriving at the truth ? Do they not rather , with all the cumbersome strictures connected with them , prevent the truth from being obtained in many instances ? To exclude a man who is strictly moral , honest , and conscientious from testifying in a court of justice for the reason that his belief differs from that held by a majority of his neighbors , while every fawning hypocrite Is permitted to do so , is an absurdity . The absurdity , however , existed in all the States of the Union until quite recently , and yet exists in many of them . This absurdity appears yet more // conspicuous when we consider the present views entertained by many on the subject of plenary inspiration and the great progress made at this time in liberal thought and in agnosticism . It may be urged that at the present time a man , no matter what his belief is , can not be excluded from testifying on account of that belief . But , admitting that to be the fact , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no State religion , to impose a disagreeable form of this kind upon any one ? How can the members of such a class justify themselves in compelling any man in open court to make such statements in reference to his religious views as may subject him to distrust and obloquy ? Such to-day is frequently the result when a person refuses to be sworn according to the form most in use . If , as Jeremy Bentham attempted to prove more than sixty years ago , oaths were useless , absurd and pernicious , how must they be regarded in America to-day , from whatever stand-point we may consider them ? He proved quite satisfactorily that the custom of taking oaths , especially of an official nature , led to continual perjury , and that men swore to do things which they had neither the will , the intention , nor the ability to perform . To an untrammeled thinker , whether an advanced skeptic or one strictly orthodox in faith , strong arguments must present themselves for abolishing all forms of oaths . If , as it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are an additional appeal or incentive to the person taking them to tell the truth or to perform his agreement , then there is certainly but little reason for retaining them . Upon the other hand , are there not numerous reasons for dispensing with them ? Unless an oath is taken strictly in accordance with certain forms , it is pronounced null . Technicalities multiply about the mere form . Many proceedings are declared nugatory because such forms have not been precisely followed . Thus interests of great value are impaired through the carelessness or ignorance of a clerk or notary . While from past experience it appears that an oath is binding upon the consciences of but few , it is certain that it has precluded many conscientious men from testifying as to important matters , and from holding offices the duties of which they were well qualified to perform . In this land of freedom no particular religious faith is recognized . Why should ancient forms of religion and of superstition // be insisted upon ? While liberal laws have been enacted which permit a person to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God without making use of the Gospels if he so desires , what benefits can accrue from maintaining a practice which shocks the sensibilities of one class of the community and excites the derision of another ? Why would it not be sufficient if the laws provided ample penalties against all who should give false evidence upon the witness-stand , and that the clerk of the court should distinctly state to each witness at the commencement of his examination what those penalties were ? Why not adopt a rule which in this enlightened age will permit all citizens of this great country-whether their beliefs accord with that of Washington or of Penn , of Jefferson or of Parker  --  to give their testimony in court , or to enter upon the duties of office , on the same equality and under precisely similar forms , without enacting what may seem to be a sacrilege to one and a mummery to another ?
