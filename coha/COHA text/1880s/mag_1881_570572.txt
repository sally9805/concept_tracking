DURING the past collegiate year the Medical Department of Yale College has suffered an irreparable loss in the death of its Professor of Surgery , Doctor David Paige Smith . He had been connected with the University nearly eight years , serving four years as Professor of Theory and Practice and nearly four years as Professor of Surgery and lecturer on Medical JurisprudeneG . At the time of his death he was about making arrangements to remove his residence to New Haven , that he might give the remainder of his life more entirely to medical instruction and the building up of this Medical School . During his connection with the School he devoted to it his time , his energies , the inspiration of his hopeful ardor , and the courage of a temper that would acknowledge neither discouragement nor defeat . He had purposed to give to its enlargement the remaininge nei-gies of a life which seemed scarcely to have abated a jot from the fiery ardor of youth . The college to which he had * Delivered in the Battell Chapel , Yale College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he did not forget in anticipation of death , but directed that it should share largely in the final division of his estate . It has seemed eminently befitting for all these reasons that at the close of this academic year , some public notice should be taken of a personality so unique , a career so interesting , an academic life so eventful , and a relationship to Medical education and the Medical profession so intimate . Dr. Smith was born Oct. 1 , 1830 , at Westfield , Mass. , where his father , Dr. James Morven Smith , commenced practice and resided for a few years before his removal to Springfield . The father was a graduate of the Medical Institution of Yale College in 1828 , and was the son of Dr. Nathan Smith , who was in one sense its founder , and one of the first Professors , having served from 1813 , till his death in January , 1829. * Dr. Smith , the grandfather , had many of the same striking peculiarities of temperament which distinguished our lamented friend . His life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ success , distinguished alike for the services which he rendered to medical science , and the unique combination of simplicity of thought and feeling , with singular sagacity and penetration of judgment . Dr. Knight , who was proverbially cautious and considerate in his statements , did not hesitate to say " that the assertion that he has done more for the improvement of physic and surgery in New England than any other man , will by no one be deemed invidious . " Till he was twenty-one years of age he had no education beyond what would qualify him to teach a country school in a frontier town in New Hampshire , and little culture except what he gained in the adventures of a hunter and a woodsman . Having accidentally witnessed a surgical operation , he proposed himself as a student to Dr. Goodhue , the surgeon in charge . He was told that he would receive him when he could pass an examination for admission to Harvard College . Following this advice , he pursued a three years course of medical study with his adviser and patron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eulogism on Nathan Smith , MD. , by Dr. Jonathan Knight , M.D. ; also Quarterly Christian Spectator , vol. i. , pp. 204 ; also Dartmouth Medical College and Nathan Smith , by Prof. 0 .

On resuming practice he was so forcibly affected by the low state of medical knowledge and skill in the interior counties of Vermont and New Hampshire , as to project the plan of a Medical Institution in connection with Dartmouth College . The plan was adopted , he serving as the sole professor for several years , not only in the various branches of medicine , but in some auxiliary studies . Before the school was opened , however , or the plan for it had been formally accepted by the Trustees of the College , he broke off his lucrative practice and spent a year in Great Britain , attending a full course of lectures in Edinburgh , and witnessing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to New Haven he not only delivered annual courses of lectures in the Theory and Practice of Medicine and in Surgery , but a course of lectures at Dartmouth College , at the University of Vermont , and two at the Medical Institution of Bowdoin College . His resignation at Dartmouth was not accepted till 1818 , and he did not remove his family to New Haven till 1817 . His character was strong , simple and unique . He was loving and beloved , sagacious in judgment , quick in action , inventive of expedients and cool and fearless in sudden emergencies . He left a large family and all his four sons adopted his profession . The third son , James Morven , the father of our friend , removed from Westfield , after a few years ' practice , to Springfield , where he was a greatly beloved and highly successful practitioner for nearly twenty years , till his sudden death in April , 1853 , at what is still remembered as the railway disaster at Norwalk , Conn . He was erect in form , direct in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patients and their households , and the beloved friend of very many prominent families in Springfield . David Paige , his oldest son , was a grave , quiet boy . At least so he looked to me when he stood at the head of his mother 's coffin in 1843 , while his infant brother was baptized . The impression he made in his boyhood was of a reserved lad , with more than usual thoughtfulness and constraint . That as a boy he should be reserved , is not // surprising when one thinks of the infirmity of speech which he never completely conquered , and which to a sensitive lad would be a constant and most painful trial . The loss of his mother at the age of thirteen , would increase this sensitiveness which was naturally intensified by the special intimacy which always existed between the most affectionate of fathers and the most confiding of sons . He was a faithful , but not a brilliant student , and entered Yale College at the age of sixteen . As a college student , he suffered without complaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with so much quiet dignity as to enforce respect without appealing for sympathy . He did his work with uniform fidelity , and ranked in the first quarter of his class . During all his college life and especially towards the end of it he was a constant and welcome visitor at my house and used a freedom of speech and feeling which he would not venture elsewhere . Though young iu college he anticipated the future responsibilities of life with clear and cool judgment , and deliberately elected the profession to which he was constrained by his love for his father and his pride in his grandfather 's and his uncle 's renown . Indeed , a year before he graduated he had begun to anticipate its duties in his vacations . He immediately entered the Jefferson Medical College , in Philadelphia , and in the spring of 1853 had received his degree in medicine , and made his arrangements to settle in Utica , N. Y. At his father 's desire he lingered in Springfield till the Medical Convention should adjonrn , which called his father away never to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the pressure of new responsibilities for his father 's household , gave a new seriousness to his life and a new earnestness to the character of this sensitive young man of twenty-three . But his father had many warm friends , to whom his memory was very dear , and these friends immediately took him to their hearts and gave him their confidence in his profession . These tokens of their love and these practical demonstrations of their trust he never forgot . So it was that the son took the place of the father and earned the confidence of love all the sooner and the more firmly , because the gift which was first made for the sake of the father was recognized by the son as for this reason // doubly welcome . He became in a sense almost a petted boy in many households , who yet showed himself every inch a man , till , sooner than either knew , he commanded the confidence of all who had begun by loving him , and from being the pet became the pride of the then rapidly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Miss Eunice P. Brown , of Springfield , who survives him . His marriage connected him in closer relations with a large family circle . A son was born to them September 9 , 1863 , who died February 27 , 1873 . From his marriage till 1860 was the first development and growth of his professional activity and reputation . His advantages were many , in the circle of friends predisposed to confide in him , the growth of the city and its dependencies , and its manifold and ready connections with populous towns and viilages . The secret of his success , however , from the first , was in the man who responded to all these opportunities and devoted himself to his profession with an ardor which never ceased to glow , an industry which never tired , and a sagacity , self-command , and courage which men call genius . It was not simply that he was determined upon success , if by success money and fame are intended , but it was that he was determined to merit success , by mastering all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing . He was laborious , persevering , undaunted and indomitable , finding in every patient some new subject for study and new opportunity for invention , and being held to his work by an enthusiasm that never faltered . But he did not stop here , as he might have done and as many physicians of well-earned eminence and well-deserved renown do , being animated by a professional or scientific interest as supreme , or warmed by a feeble glow of human sympathy . Strong as was his scientific curiosity and his professional ambition , his personal sympathies were stronger and more readily kindled , and under the combined influence of both what might have seemed only human sagacity put on at times the appearance of a deeper than human insight and inspiration . But more of this hereafter . It is sufficient to say that from 1853 to 1860 he rapidly gained in conscious strength and skill , and in a well-earned and widely spreading reputation . But he was not satisfied with either , so long as he thought // others knew more than himself , or had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attained . The blood of his grandfather was in him , and he must go to Edinburgh and London and Paris . For six months he studied with Dr. James Syme and imbibed inspiration from Sir James Simpson , and spent weeks of profitable observation in London and Paris , coming home in time to enter the rapidly enlisted army in 1861 . The firing upon Fort Sumter brought him prematurely home , eager as a patriot and surgeon to enlist and act in the service of his country . He went into the field as surgeon of the 18th Infantry regiment , Massachusetts Volunteers , and joined the army of the Potomac . He was soon promoted to be brigade surgeon , and ordered to report to General George H. Thomas . He was soon gazetted as medical director of his column , and went with Gen. Thomas through the campaign ending with the occupation of Corinth , doing arduous service at the battle of Pittsburg Landing . Being taken very ill after the occupation of Corinth he came East on sick leave , but meeting intelligence of the disastrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported for duty and was put in charge of Fairfax Seminary lospital , near Alexandria , Va . He was in charge of this hospital nearly the whole time and closed it at the end of the war , retiring from the service with the brevet rank of Lieutenant Colonel . The author of the brilliant tract entitled " Ally Hospital Days , " served under him , and dedicates her story " To the Surgeon-rncharge , ' Honored commander , True comrade , Beloved friend . " The number of operations performed by him while in service was scarcely exceeded except perhaps by one , and his interest in practical surgery became ever afterwards a passion . He hesitated doubtfully whether or not to accept a post as Surgeon in the IRegular Army , but at last decided to resume practice in his old home . He found his old friends ready to receive him , and the old circles of practice widening out as he re*intered them . A new joy had come to his life , and an only son worthy of such a father 's love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and warming his heart with such love as few men give to a child . The child died in 1873 , at the age of 10 years , and with the child went out the light of his life Not long befoie , // 557 he had made a visit to Europe in 1872 , for recuperation and improvement , accompanied by his wife and the little boy who had just begun to be his companion on many professional visits . But his life had lost its zest , although he had not lost his courage nor his ardor for science or for his fellow-men . He was forty-two years of age , and he had enough of wealth , enough of reputation , enough of affection-so far as either can tempt an aspirant for future gains of either , and he deliberately consecrated himself to the new field of labor which just then opened to him in a post of medical instruction . He thought to forget in part the intensity of his great sorrow , by transferring himself to another place , and surrounding himself with new faces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was animated by the untried experiment of teaching the science and art in which he had so much delighted . The special difficulty which he foresaw he should encounter from his infirmity , was fitted to inspire and arouse rather than to depress and discourage his undaunted spirit . The example of his grandfather and the remembrance of his special service in founding the New Haven school appealed to his filial sympathies and roused the active and romantic spirit of adventure which was prominent though not always suspected in his nature . Predominant over all there was a profound religious submission to the will of God , who had disappointed his fondest hopes in taking away the idol of his earthly life , and in bidding him live for his fellow-men ii ) the only way possible to himself by a renewed activity to his profession in a new and special method of service . He felt , as he expressed himself to me , that he must henceforth live for man , especially by relieving little children who were crippled and infirm , in living remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this life . It was at first his fond and darling project to proceed at once , if possible , to found a hospital for this class of patients , in immediate connection with the school of instruction which might lead to the enlargement of similar facilities in other directions . He cherished ardent and perhaps not oversanguine hopes for the rapid expansion of this medical school , in spite of the active competition and the apparently more // varied attractions in the schools of the larger cities . He entered with ardent sympathy into all the plans which were devised for its more thorough discipline , and its more enlarged and thorough scheme of instruction . He saw no reason , in view of the facilities of railway communication , why the New Haven school should not receive pupils over all the lines which radiate through southern New England and the valley of the Con necticut . This was his dream , and he was confident that it might *be made a reality . He had seen more romantic visions cystallize into solid facts . Distances were nothing to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 200 miles , and met the calls of a pressing local practice at home . It seems to us now a matter for deep regret that he did not remove at once to this new scene of action . Had he established himself from the first at New Haven , and made new acquaintances by means of the large consulting and surgical practice which certainly awaited him , his own inspiring energy and kindling ardor would sooner or later have accomplished these fixed purposes , and he might have been spared to his fellow.men and to science for a score of years . But unexpected obstacles presented themselves . The troops of patients whom he had gathered around himself would not be persuaded to spare him . New and special engagements led him to defer his removal for another and still another season . Strong family associations increased the difficulty . He thought at first to remove after the experiment of a single term , during which he would easily make his 120 miles by railway , and have leisure to con his lectures by the way , . and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station at home , to take or bring him on his rounds . The comparative ease with which this could be done tempted him to try the experiment for another and still another season . The school did not always prosper as he expected it would , and his sensitive reluctance to interrupt the relations already established between the physicians of New Haven and their patients and family friends , joined with the tenacious resistance of his host of friends in Springfield , suggested new reasons for his longer delay . But the old and new difficulties seemed at last to be surmounted , and his final resolution was definitely taken . His negotiations for a site for // 559 a new home in New Haven had been slowly but finally completed . Tuesday of the week after his fatal attack was fixed upon for the arrangement of a purchase , which involved his final removal . Meanwhile his vital energies had been slowly wasted by the constant and varied strain to which they had been subjected , and he yielded up his life to a short and not excessively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been upheld , and the relaxation which he could find so easily , and the force of a will that would not break , and a sympathy which cheered him at every turn like a fresh fountain beneath every footfall of his life 's path ,  --  he fell prostrate , and was transferred to other scenes of self-forgetting ministrations , which are marred by no human limitations , and requited by no misconstructions and no ingratitude , where he finds sympathy that is pure and intense enough to satisfy his ardent and generous longings . To his large circle of friends and patients he left a memory which will long be cherished . To the members of his profession he bequeathed a stimulating and ennobling example . To the medical institution to which he had devoted so much of promise and of hope , the grateful recollections of his unsparing consecration to its interests and a substantial reversionary interest in his handsome estate . True to his original humane purpose he bequeathed an equal amount for disabled and crippled children in Springfield . Into this brief sketch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less of a delineation of the man . Let me now call your attention more distinctly to some of the most striking features of his character in connection with some suggestions of more or less immediate interest to the members of the medical profession and the community . Dr. Smith had the very great advantage of a thorough intellectual training . He not only had a good mind , but he was a good scholar from his boyhood . . His early promise was not so conspicuous as was his early faithfulness . His school and college days were more remarkable for quiet work than for any remarkable achievements . No one would have predicted what was before , or what was in this reserved and sensitive boy , who watched the even course of his patient application to his books . The intense and kindling // ardor that was subsequently woke up within him , the volcanic passion that was ever slumbering , the fiery purpose to be and to know all that his profession rendered possible , were scarcely suspected . Possibly they had never been awakened or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him so much a man . On the other hand , when they did come , they found him ready to meet them and to turn them to a most effective use , by reason of the discipline of mind and of character which his school and college training had imparted . The ease with which he could read , the rapidity with which he mastered what he read , the eagerness to know and to make completely his own whatever he saw or learned , the wide range of his curiosity , his fresh and never satiated interest in literature , the wide range of his thinking , his logical and penetrating judgment , these were not indeed learned from his teacher or copied out from his books , but they were to a large extent gained and made effective by the thorough school training to which he had submitted in deference to the wisdom of those who he knew were wiser than himself . In harmony with this we observe that his subsequent growth was by a natural and steady progress . His eminence was attained by no sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or skill . In the first few years of his professional life his career was modest , distinguished for persevering attention to his patients , and an unpretending but manifest skill and sagacity , such as come from the absorbed application of the attention to the cases in his hand . Nothing was remarkable except the desire to know and the determination to know whatever was possible to be known . I distinctly remember meeting him in the most casual way early in his professional life , on a brief visit at Sprincrfield and the conversation turned upon the profession of medicine and the great uncertainty which prevailed concerning thespecific effect or operation of medical agents . The confession of ignorance on this topic was not more frank than the implied determination that this ignorance would not be insuperable if life and opportunity should be given to himself . In this natural and practical growth of knowledge and skill he was doubtless aided by the nature of his profession and its adaptation to his own powers . It will be conceded by all men // who think-indeed it has become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical profession can be attained by experience alone-that however much science can do in its studies of healthy or diseased structure and organism , and of normal and abnormal functions , or even of the physiological or pathological action of food or medicine , still the capacity to judge of symptoms *and cure in the concrete , can only be matured by actual observation and trial . It is equally clear that observation witbout interpretation , the use of the eye in which there is " no Speculaition , " and a routine application of prescribed remedies only makes a man the more stupid and obstinate the older he grows and the more abundant his experience . To the practitioner who makes each new case a new opportunity for sharp discernment and sagacious insight , for comparative interpretation and skillful invention , his profession must ensure a certain and often a rapid growth , the more certain and the more rapid often , in proportion as he is docile and patient , observing and cautious . The dashing interpretation of symptoms without experience and on few and indecisive data , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physiological or pathological theory , may rapidly mature a bi'illiant figitrarde in medicine . The confident and desperate use of the newest medicaments with empirical rashness may enable a man to keep up appearances with himself and his patients , but neither can ripen into that medical sagacity which , whether it comes earlier or later , is the growth of actual experience , conjoined with scientific insight . What is the nature of the process called scientrfic insight , which must be superinduced upon facts , is an old question that is more easily asked than answered . What induction is , i. e. , the interpretation of facts , what its methods and rules , what its grounds , what it implies in principles and relations , we can not stay here to explain , and it is perhaps impertinent here to refer to such questions . It is enough for our purpose and yet important to notice that skill in this process always requires kind and patient and docile dealing with facts-not the same length of time to all-for a single fact to one mind is more instructive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or shorter time in which to work , and more or fewer facts on which to work . // Hence the practitioner who at first is docile and patient , assiduous and cautious , after a few years , and sometimes suddenly , becomes confident and positive and almost inspired . David Smith , the beginner , was quiet , slow , tentative , and patient . David Smith , after his army days , seemed to the patients whom he gave back to life or relieved from sore extremity , to carry the gift of healing in his hand and of discernment in his eve . This surprising change was but the natural growth of a gifted , docile , earnest soul , controlled by great singleness of purpose , and warmed by intense human sympathies . The florist will take a modest , thick-set , slowly grown , stiongly rooted plant , and introduce it into a stimulating and favoring atmosphere , and all at once it will put on new proportions and bloom into tropical brilliancy and life . In this way it was that our friend , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius , with the sagacious discernment and brilliant gifts that belong to gennis . That his personality was unique and strikingly individual , all who knew him were forward to recognize . But this was no more true of him than of many who have been eminent in his profession . Like many whose names are familiar , he was quick , abrupt , positive , at times impatient of opposition , and sensitive to stupidity and unreasonableness . These and other characteristics were in part hereditary . In part they were the causes and the effects , of the gifts and experiences of many eminent in his profession . The quick and positive judgment that can not or will not give the reasons for its opinions ; the peremptory tone that has been made habitual by long experience of careless or deliberate neglect in patient or nurse ; the rapid movements that crowded engagements form into a second nature ; the assuring or the impatient reply , either of which may express the tenderest sympathy , the momentary abandonment of manner which is but the quick reaction that seeks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain ; the sudden jest , the abrupt question , the stern reproof , are all familiar in tales or personal experience of eminent medical practitioners . No man could easily describe the personality of our friend to one who had never seen him ; with form erect , with eager // and yet gentle face ; with striding gait and positive utterance , all the more positive because given with explosive earnestness ; noble in aim and generous in intent , even when denunciatory and impatient ; but always direct , truth-loving and magnanimons . His love to his friends knew no bounds . To his patients he was all that patients could desire . He crossed their threshold as a messenger from God , ready to be all and to do all that man could possibly be or do , reassuring them beforehand by his words and looks . He was ready to come at a moment 's call , however fatigued or pre*ingaged , willing to forego any pleasure or any engagement if they needed him ; quick to return from his long needed and long deferred relaxation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether death or recovery or confirmed invalidism followed , he had hound the patient or his family to him self by new and stronger bonds of c*ratitude and sympathy . In critical cases he was aroused to his utmost , and he never failed to meet a gm-eat emergency . Every capacity of intellect and feeling was stimulated to do its utmost . His discernment , his invention , his heroism , his self-control , were all aroused in every battle for the life of his patient , and with all these heroic and courageous qualities there was intermingled a tender and loving sympathy . Though he would repress the emotion of others with annihilating reproof , and in no measured words , he would burst into tears after he had carried a patient safely through a crisis of supreme peril . His cheering voice , his beaming and courageous looks , his chivalrous devotion to his work , and his confident and sunny hopefulness , were like an invigorating north-wester , or , as the occasion might be , like a soft and gentle zephyr . In surgical cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and dexterity . For the gm-eat field-days of the eminent surgeon 's life , he had prepared himself by marvellous patience with the hand and trained quickness of eye and mind , by abundant experience , conjoined with the general qualities which were trained in ordinary practice . When such an eminent surgeon dies , it is felt by all the thinking men and all the suffering invalids within his call that the world has suff*red an irreparable loss . // Towards his fellow practitioners he could be unjust in a hasty moment , but he never could be ignoble . He could use sharp words , the force of which he did not measure , but after they were spoken they left no gall upon his lips . He was often headlong in his judgments about men and their opinions . Not infrequently he was mistaken in measuring and qualifying good and evil . Words that had better never have been spoken would break forth from his lips , but he was eminently without guile or bitterness in his heart . However easily he might be prejudiced or alienated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man and a thinker , he combined manly sense with childlike simplicity . For literature in all its forms he had a passionate fondness and surprising familiarity with it . It was a wonder to his discerning and intimate friends that he could read so much under the manifold and the exhausting demands which were made upon his strength and his time . Some who thought to surprise him by being beforehand with him in read the last new novel would not infrequently find that they ing were behind in the race . As a thinker in the scientific sphere , especially in the sciences that are akin to his own profession , he was a study . Though intensely realistic and objective , though positive iii the extreme in his ways of looking at all classes of phenomena , especially those pertaining to physiology and therapeutics , he seemed entirely delivered from any sympathy with materialistic theories . The extreme forms of materialistic evolution apparently made no impression upon his sound understanding . In a casual conversation which I had with him , a few months since in the railway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pronounced assent to the remark , unity of plan does not make unity of substance , rapidly dting certain striking embryonic phenomena in illustration of this point , and proceeded to some other subject . It might seem , from one view of his bold and imaginative disposition , that he would have found temporary fascination in this newest form of physiological romancing , for like every man of genius he was ardently and extravagantly romantic in his way . But he was as realistic on the spiritual side of his nature as in the hard common sense with which he responded to material facts . He believed // 565 in himself , in his friends , in his suffering and grateful patients , in the little boy , whom he had so passionately loved , but could not believe that he had lost , in the mystery of sorrow of which each day 's experience presented some strange and agonizing phase ; in the exuberant overflow of joy which he saw flooding the world with the beginning of each day and the renewal of each life , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fullness of his sympathy . He believed in knowledge and in the power to know ; in science , whose new and ever multiplying trophies he greeted with new astonishment ; in his own intellectual insight , each exercise and product of which thrilled him with new delight . As a consequence , conversant as he was with material phenomena in those phases which fascinate the philosophic imagination , he was equally and more sensitively , though perhaps unconsciously responsive to the spiritual side of nature , and he unhesitatingly struck the balance against the new theories , with a single stammering but decisive word , which though a word , represented his large experience and life-long reflection . But though very positive in his opinions on these points , he was in no sense intolerant of those of his profession who held the opposite . Such phenomena he looked upon as harn-iless and temporary , like the measles or the whooping cough , incident to the early stages of growth , but certain to be outgrown by a healthy constitution . He had learned from his own experience and from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own thinking , and that the way to clear and solid convictions is long and dim and perilous , which must be traversed by minds of a certain cast before they reach a harbor of conviction and rest . Then he was in his temper generous and noble , not given to suspicion or misconstruction , but hopeful and charitable in feeling , even when he was sharp in speech and defiant in manner . These thoughts lead me naturally to his Christian faith and his moral and religious character . He was in heart and by avowal a positive Christian believer . In many of the several technicalities of Christian doctrine he had no interest . His training and his temperament rendered him impatient of them . Against some forms of doctrinal statement he had a strong and positive repulsion . He might perhaps have been persuaded // to think better of them , had he taken the time and patience to consider them , or had his friends the courage to attempt to influence him ; but neither ever came near the effort . He was not fond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not care to subscribe to a creed which did not express his fullest and most minute convictions , and never offered himself as a communicant in the church at which he was an interested and devout worshiper . But he often expressed the intention of connecting himself with the communion of the church in this college so soon as he should become a resident of this city . He loved good men most cordially , and earnest Christians , but not all who call themselves such with loudest pretensions or with sanctimonious ways . For some such he was neither unstinted nor reticent in the expression of his distrust and want of sympathy , but for some of the best men of his town , men honored for Christian zeal , benevolence , and uprightness in all this land and through the world , ho had a brother 's love , and would have died for them with a brother 's devotion . With some such he maintained the most intimate intercourse , in which his Christian sympathies were most freely expressed , with his likes and dislikes . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God were of the purest and noblest in their quality , and that his strongest antipathies were against " malice , pride , and all uncharitableness . " He died with the courage of a hero , and the submission of a saint . To his pastor , who was also a man of medical knowledge , of whom he asked a critical examination of his condition , he added : " do not be afraid to tell me the truth ; I shall be as ready to die in two hours as I ever shall be . " " Though he could say but little , " he writes , " what he said was entirely satisfactory . He had no fear ; he was resting in Christ . Only a few months before he had told a dying friend , that she was safe in the arms of Jesus . ' and he was now proving Christ in the same experience . " The uses of adversity were signally exemplified in his character and his career . Though in many respects he was singularly successful and prosperous , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His life-long and constant infirmity could never be long away from his notice and at times would suggest impatient and bitter thoughts if it did not prompt // 56*7 sharp and bitter words that else had been smooth and sweet ; the early death of his mother-at the beginning of his boyhood ; the awful blow that smote him to the earth at the dawn of his manhood in the tragical fate of his father ; the sights and scenes of agony and horror that for day and night occupied him in the field and at the hospital , and the great disappointment of his life in the death of his son , the constant drain upon his sympathies from his love for his patients-together with the manifold and chafing vexations that a temperament like his must suffer in such a profession as his , all these together made his life a constant struggle , and shortened it by at least a score and a half of years . But what was shortened of this life was added to the life which is immortal . In the light of Christian hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ career on earth are better spent in the perfect life ,  - -  certainly better for the man himself , But what shall we say of those who are left behind ? Of us who have lost his accumulated experience , his sharp discernment , his sagacity matured into genius , his lofty nobleness , his undaunted courage , his contagious enterprise , his chivalrous unselfishness ? Perhaps , though we can not easily believe it , this life will be even worth more to us now that he is gone and we see his virtues transfigured into a noble ideal by his sudden and tragic death than had he been with us longer . It is with this hope this brief sketch has been prepared and submitted to your attention . This life has more than a personal interest and importance to each and all of us . It enforces one or two lessons which vitally concern the medical profession and the public . First , it exemplifies the essentially elevated character of this profession and the high place which it should hold in the public esteem . Viewed ideally this profession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which it is founded is the science of nature ; perhaps in the most fascinating of its phenomena , the phenomena of life made doubly attractive because modified by the darkest of nature 's mysteries ,  --  the mysteries of disease , and decay , and pain . These phenomena are studied by the physician not primarily out of scientific curiosity but for a practical application which is the noblest conceivable , the relief of // human suffering . For this end , the chemist analyzes , the anatomist dissects , the physiologists interpret structure and function , the therapeutist heals or prevents disease , the surgeon extirpates or binds up , and the student whom they train goes forth with the single duty of applying what he has learned and of learning more that he may apply the more . The problems which he is to solve and the theories which he must unravel are not abstract but concrete . He visits his patient not to make a skillful diagnosis , which he may test by his death , but which he may prove by his restoration . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as truly as to his mind , or rather to his mind through his heart . Every theory of disease or medicine with which he grapples concerns a living sufferer struggling for his life . He can not avoid a most excited interest in his studies , unless he is stupid beyond endurance or selfish beyond common example . The infant sufferer makes by his looks that mute appeal to which only fiends are insensible , the strong man in his agony shrieks out for instant help in tones that pierce to the heart , the dying makes the last call that is possible from man to man . Under circumstances like these a man can not but study if he has the capacity to learn anything under any excitement . The physician is also brought necessarily into the most intimate relations to his fellow men . If he is skillful and faithful and successful he earns their gratitude . He must be admitted often to their inmost confidences , seeing them on their weakest side , beholding them under the humiliations of pain and fear , sometimes of sin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has the opportunity to show patience , fidelity , sympathy , courage , disinterested ness , and magn ani mity as the devotees of few other callings , and of becoming often , as was oni- departed friend , the trusted benefactor and the welcome visitant of hundreds of families . When such a physician submits to the final arbitrament , the sentence of blessing , Iwas s*c1c and ye visited me , will not merely be pronounced on the good physician by the Lord Christ , but it will be repeated by the crowd of his patients whom he has blessed . The physician who meets these opportunities in the right spirit becomes one of the most favored of men , in the character which he forms , and the social and personal position which he acquires . // He may abuse these advantages iii ways which I do not care to specify . He may pander to vice . He may abuse sacred personal confidences . He may degrade and lower himself and the community . In this the old adage is exemplified , corruplio optimi pessima . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for these abuses . I need not say that at the present time the dignity of this profession is more generally acknowledged than at any prev*-ons period in the history of man . One manifest evidence of this truth is furnished in the fact that to no profession are its members more enthusiastically devoted both in the science which prepares and the practice which perfects the accomplished physician . I am confident that our departed friends as he reviews his past in the light of his present life , will be grateful if his own example may be an inspiration and guide to many who shall follow him . The second and final thought which this life suggests is the importance of elevating the character of medical education . It seems strange , it is strange and almost inexplicable , that at a time when the medical profession is so highly esteemed and so enthusiastically prosecuted by its devotees so little attention has been given to the devising of efficient measures for the elevation of medical science and the improvement of medical skill by ample and thorough preliminary study . Legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and irresponsible practitioners . The power to guard their own guild from quacks and charlatans has been given to the profession itself and a modicum of aid has been granted to the beginnings of medical institutions . But with few exceptions the medical schools of this country are to all intents private institutions , in which the instruction till recently has been given in connection with a large and engrossing private practice , the terms have been short , the course of study has been contracted to a lecture season , and the preliminary education has often been most meagre . It is no place here to sketch the outline of an ideal Medical College . It is perfectly clear , however , that such a college must command the exclusive time and occupation of at least some of its professors . However wise the arrangement may be , which has connected medical instruction in some departments with an // active practice , it has now become an axiom with those who alone are competent to decide such a question , that in those departments in which science has of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can give their lives exclusively to study and instruction . If this is so , their chairs must be endowed . Tuition fees can not be relied upon as the sole support of chairs of this kind . Let these chairs be filled , and the way will at once be opened for a longer curriculum and an ampler preparation . This was the judgment of our departed friend which he expressed in the disposition of his estate , and in the devotion , if not the sacrifice of his life . It is written in the oldest of books , " all that a man hath will he give for his life . " This is true when he is prostrated by disease or threatened with impending death , but it is not true of a man , much less of a community , when either has occasion to provide against sickness and.death by sanitary or scientific precautions . W hen a man is overtaken by mortal disease , he spends his money like water , his hundreds , his thousands , his mill ions , it may be , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than reckless of manifold exposures that scatter the seeds of certain death . A community will become frantic at the threat or visitation of some invading pestilence , and freely incur the ruinous expenses which flight or terror suggest . And yet the same community will quietly allow deadly poisons to course with subtle stealth beneath its streets and arrange for the admission of a mortal enemy by midnight into every chamber . Similarly , public spirited individuals will acknowledge their public responsibilities for public blessings of every other sort , even of education and culture , and yet the same class of individuals and the State itself are slow to avail themselves of that permanent security to the public health which sanitary and medical appliances alone provide . May the lesson of this hour awaken in some who hear and are able to respond to it , a sense of the obligation and privilege which is enforced by this self-sacrificing life , amply to provide for our Hospital , our Dispensary , and our Medical Institution . Should this follow , our friend will not have died , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blessing which he sought to bring to us by his living prescnce , will havc come to us with his death .
