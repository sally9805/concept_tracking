THE main psychological distinction between men and women is that men think more than women , and that their thinking is of a better quality , because it is carried on chiefly in the form of reasoning , and is drawn from a wider field of facts . This is not a random inference , but may be scientifically verified by any observer who will approach this question in the same impartially critical spirit which should guide investigation upon every subject . Brainactivity is a constant phenomenon in both sexes during waking hours ; but much of this activity is merely emotional in women . A great part of the conversation of women is a helpless playing with facts , a bringing of them together like the words of a dictionary , with little endeavor to found any conclusions upon them ; and it is among women that we hear the most positive expressions of approval , condemnation , or pity . An intense personality modifies their decisions on most questions . The scientific spirit which desires to possess the truth and the philosophic spirit which impels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nature has exacted the penalty for this constitutional narrowness by keeping their activity within narrow bounds . To verify this , we have only to take the testimony found in the records of modern civilization . Wherever we look we find woman caring for the individual , while man has cared for the individual and for the community . General interests have fallen into his hands , while personal ones have been left to hers . This division of labor has been so strictly based upon natural facts that we see that those facts must hold a fundamental cause of such results . In many of the processes of civilization we get the combined influence of the sexes ; but we have one institution which shows the record of unmixed masculine activity ; and this institution is the state . The moral evolution of national life has been shared by women ; but // the intellectual bases of all governments have been devised by men . The modern state , in its two forms of republic and constitutional monarchy , covers a vast variety of relations , and attempts the orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all agreeing or endeavoring to live in accordance with its requirements . These requirements are called laws  --  the constitution being the soil out of which laws grow to answer special needs . Not only is the plan of the modern state an emanation from the masculine mind , but its administration has been wholly in the hands of men . Queens hare leaned upon masculine advisers so completely as to have left their reigns practically to masculine guidance . Now , the course of history does not show any deliberate exclusion of woman from the affairs of government ; but it does show , most clearly , that her want of participation in governments has been due to her defective reasoning powers , and to her incapacity for judging of general interests . Her small brain has limited her to a small field of activity ; and her activity in this narrow field has been so intense as to give great perfection to those departments of life which have fallen under her care . She has ruled well in her small realm , and has shown a fine ability in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four important contributions to modern civilization : they have cared for the body in its immediate needs by the preparation of food and clothing , and by ministration to the sick ; they have been the conservers of moral forces , and have insisted on special standards of conduct in society and in the home ; they have guided the rudimentary intellectual training of children ; and they have contributed to the aesthetic development of the race by creating and combining beautiful forms and colors in dress , in decoration , and in household art . These four departments have been mainly controlled by women , and the comfort and beauty of every-day life proclaim their success . Moral claims or rights exist only in the fitness of the claimant to do the work involved in such rights . Man 's right to found states was in his comprehension of the immense interests involved in them . Women could not possibly have organized any modern state . There has never been any body of women of sufficient largeness of mind and inductive reasoning power to have grasped and dealt with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of our better national constitutions . In every civilized commu // nity it has always been possible to select a larger number of intellectual men than of women equally endowed ; and it is safe to say that , if nation-making had been left to women , the elements would still have been in seething confusion . But , now that the wild horse is caught and tamed , answers obediently to word , bit , and bridle , we may all take a holiday ride ! We may even hold the reins and guide him over the smooth road . The owner is at hand to relieve us if he grows restless , and it is our right to take advantage of a holiday prepared for us by the foresight of generations of thoughtful men . It is not true that men have legislated for themselves alone . If they have fought for their altars and firesides , they have also legislated for them . Nothing is so plain to the scientific student of history as that the inconspicuous position of women in the state has been due to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Small brains can not give birth to great thoughts . Certainly there can have been no conspiracy on the part of man throughout the centuries to lessen the amount of woman 's brain . Men lay far-reaching plans ; they project undertakings which are to cover wide territories and affect large communities . Women 's plans rarely extend beyond the few immediately about them . It is true that the modern movement for woman suffrage has been originated and mainly carried on by women ; but this is the only project of great magnitude which they have originated . Putting the man 's share in creating civilization beside woman 's , the latter shrinks to a mere speck in contrast with the mighty achievements of men . This contrast has rarely been stated and dwelt upon with the emphasis which it deserves . Woman 's work has been temporary in character , accomplished , expended , and repeated day by day . Much of man 's work has been permanent . The principles of mathematics and optics , the inventipn of machinery , the immense industrial enterprises which feed millions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of printing , the creations of architecture , temples , palaces , bridges , ships , the great accumulation of facts in natural science , marine geography , meteorology , medicine , jurisprudence , musical composition , sculpture , creative painting , and literature are , with slight exceptions , the work of men . The only one of these departments to which women have considerably contributed is literature ; here their creations have been mostly of poetry and fiction . In history , philosophy , criticism , and the drama , they have done nothing of great value or amount . The names of the few women really distinguished in literature belong to the last century // of our history , and the list is a very short one-Madame de Sta*l , George Sand , Charlotte Bront* , Mrs. Browning , Miss Martineau , Frances Power Cobbe , and one name which by its superiority refuses to be classified with the rest , George Eliot . America has produced only two women that could be called great : these are Margaret Fuller and Charlotte Cushman . Yet the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she is but an intense type of the American woman of the nineteenth century , who shows a divine discontent with her present intellectual status and a desire to grow to her full development . But in the nature of things this desire can not expand into a reality , save in rare cases , for many generations . Under the most favorable conditions women can not hope to overtake men in intellectual pursuits ; for the same stimulating circumstances which impel woman forward act with equal force upon man , and there is little danger that he will play the rdle of the tortoise in the fable , and lie down to repose while she presses on to the goal . Yet he might sleep for a thousand years , and wake to find that he had not yet lost his pr&amp;minence in intellectual power . A certain body of reformers have so persistently held up the names of a few eminent women as types that the unscientific observer is continually tempted to base his conclusions on a few reiterated and conspicuous facts instead of on a survey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the scientific student of the evolution of the human , intellect to calculate from carefully gathered data , and using an ascertained rate of brain-development as a unit of measurement , how long it will take for the average feminine brain to reach the present development of the average masculine brain . Studied from the physiological side and under the known law that , qualities being identical , the amount of power in any two brains will be determined by their relative quantities , we must admit that , unless it can be shown that the quality of woman 's brain is superior to man 's , the conclusion will show him to be permanent master in the domain of intellect . Now , the question of quality can be readily settled by an appeal to facts . The intellectual and iesthetic productions of men are of finer quality than those of women because they contain and express a larger range of emotional experiences . With the one exception of George Eliot , we can not name a woman who is worthy of comparison with Shakespeare , Schiller , Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the novel and drama may // be legitimately compared as expressions of the same phase of intellectual activity  --  the creative imagination . In the reconstruction of popular creeds , it has always been men who have formed the advanced guard . Women have lingered longer in the churches and have dropped their superstitions more reluctantly . Men , always in advance , have set up intellectual standards which women have continually endeavored to reach ; and this endeavor of women to appropriate the thinking of men has had more analogy with the overlaying of one geologic stratum by another than with the natural organic growth of plant-life . Women have picked up ideas as they have picked up specific facts , have handled them like toys or flourished them like fans , have made society capital out of them , and have used them as they have used dress and paints to win the attention and approval of men ; so little conception has the ordinary well-read woman had of the sacred value of ideas as helps in the development of human nature . Although the claim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their excited denials of masculine preeminence still more so , there is a claim which may be fairly made for them , the granting of which would lessen the inequality . They have a right to the most favorable conditions for intellectual development ; but , as no advantages can atone for a defective natural endowment , so women must mainly climb intellectual steeps by means of scalingladders which men have put in place . It is true that individual men may be met every day who would show inferiority to individual women in power of independent thought ; but , if the comparisons be made from those reared in the same social and educational ranks , our statement will hold . The great distinction between boy and girl in grammar and high schools is that , while the girl is dreaming , the boy is thinking . There is no discouragement in facing and accepting scientific truths . There is no humiliation in it : and it is a finer and more honorable thing to see and admit one 's true position in the great drama of human evolution than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nature of things can never be ours . Women will have given proof of candor and will have made a step toward that intellectual power which they long to attain , when they can see and acknowledge that a decree of Nature has made them permanently inferior to men in intellect . If N*ature had given them brains as large and as finely constituted as those of men , they might hope for the same results by exposing themselves // to the same developing influences ; but , while the physiological fact remains , the psychological one must keep it company . There is nothing disheartening in a great truth evolved from an immense accumulation of facts . When we have put our feet upon an eternal truth , the desire of growth and the power of growth are born in us like strong twins of one blood . Shall we neglect music because we can not compose like Beethoven , or sing like Parepa ? When we have repented and cdnfessed our sins , we are ready for amendment . It is not to be doubted that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the disposition of women to reason and think independently . If the mind be brought into continual contact with large facts and extensive interests , it makes continual effort to take in such facts and interests . We can not find any natural law which should keep women from exercising the suffrage power . All the declamation and argument which has been spent upon it has been less needed to convince people of its rightfulness than to move inert bodies of legislators to act upon the conviction . " When women want the right , they will get it , " has been the common remark from the lips of men . Now , if women do not want this power , as the greater number do not , it must be either because they fail to see that it would help them in their growth , or because , already understanding political affairs , they prefer to take no active share in them . As a matter of fact , no information is more easily acquired in our own country and iu England than political information . Every newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts of national life are just as well known to women as to men . Their acute power of understanding and judging individual character would help them in deciding upon the honesty of candidates ; and doubtless the chief result of woman 's participation in politics will be her insistence upon certain fixed moral standards . Into politics as into society she will carry her inclination to deal with the individual instead of with the community ; and she will always better understand and better guide the individual than the community . Her mind chooses detail ; and , while it can employ itself upon the individual , it is content to leave the genus to others . Women are much happier in the study of character than in the study of political economy . It has become comparatively safe for American women to enter into political life because the most diiicult work has already been done by men , and because there are still men enough ready to assume all the hardest positions . If men were // now to retreat from the political arena and yield it up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them wholly unfit for those positions in which the largest demands are made upon them ; and this , although our political machinery now runs so smoothly that secondrate men can successfully oversee it . The participation of women in politics would probably be of no benefit to the state ; it lacks no element which they could contribute . The official and administrative work can be better done by men . If women were to enter the civil service , as they would certainly wish to do , they could expect only the least honorable positions ; for in this market , as in every other where competition exists , it is the excellence of the work which determines precedence . The ethical point which remains to be considered , then , is whether women are in such need of the developing influence of the suffrage as to justify them in taking a share in an institution which has no need of their c&amp;5peration , and which in every department would be better administered without them . If they can , in some other way , win the development which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right they should keep free from interference in state matters . It is certainly a small demand upon the patriotism of women to ask them to refrain from a course which would imperil the wise conduct of public affairs . No one can deny them the right of voting . But they are not obliged to eat the cake because it is set before them . If they see that , once having obtained the power to choose , it is the highest duty to put it aside , they should be strong enough to act upon that conviction . The danger in exercising the suffrage is , that it opens the way to contention for office , and that women would not be likely to refrain from entering so tempting a field . It is to be hoped that , once having removed the barriers and legal disabilities , they will be content to turn to other matters after some harmless experimenting has convinced them that they can gain all the intellectual advantages of the suffrage without committing themselves to experimental politics . As there are only so many heartthrobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brain per diem , only so much thinking possible , therefore all the thought expended by women upon political matters must be so much subtracted from the sum of other possible experience . What is given to the state can not be given elsewhere , and more politics means less literature , less music , and less acquaintance with the physical sciences . In all these fields women have shown good capacity , and it is a fair inference // that persistent devotion to these will show still finer results in the future . Women will contribute more to the civilization and elevation of the nation by devotion to literature , *esthetics , and the natural sciences , than by expending their strength in trying to solve problems of state ; while the practical efficiency , physical endurance , and inductive reason of man make such work easy for him Nor will women miss the possible benefit of politics by declining participation in it ; for already , without such participation , their knowledge of the facts of public interest is very extensive , and whatever reasoning power they possess can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men do not vote , so , doubtless , the wisest women will not . When politics is a trade , and offices are scrambled for like clerkships in a commission-house , it is a rather low ambition to add one 's self to such a multitude . Of all the agencies set at work for the elevation of woman , political rights will probably be the least helpful . Along the whole course of human development we can detect an increasing tendency to the subordination of sex to the multiplication of powers and activities common to both sexes . The influence of sex is diminishing as a distinct factor in human life . Work of all kinds is rated at its simple value , irrespective of the producer . Power of all kinds is directly proportioned to the number of things which the human being can do well . All things which men can do better than women they have the greater right to do , because the better doing constitutes the right . It is a base violation of the economy of Nature to expend more material and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain the end . The problem of the wise expenditure of force and the closest adaptation of means to ends is the most important question in our present civilization . There is a constant extension of the territory occupied by men and women in common . The number of avocations pursued by both men and women is perhaps ten times as great to-day as was the number three centuries ago , and this creates a corresponding increase of their points of contact and common interest . In arguments upon the sex question it is usually claimed that women have a finer moral development than men ; that the ethical idea , or conception of duty , controls them more powerfully . Applying the scientific method to this inquiry , and looking at facts , we do find a more frequent solicitude to conform to fixed standards of conduct , determined by society , law , and religion , a more intense anx // iety to secure the approval of others , a ) ad a greater reluctance to refuse any individual appeal for aid . Women give sympathy as freely as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been jarred or wounded , nothing is more necessary than sympathy . But a thought which will mend the hurt by preventing its repetition is of more value than a tear which expresses sympathetic suffering . Womenhave a preeminent power of putting themselves in the place of others , and of carefully considering every weakness and sparing any infliction of pain . This kindliness and consideration for the individual explain their exquisite power of ministering to the happiness of others . What is called conscientiousness  --  the careful , painstaking balancing of different courses of conduct-is very native to them ; and this dealing with the minutlie of morals makes them the rightful guides of children in the school and home . Wherever the question has been one of immediate relief and of present comfort , women have been natural ministers . In many cases their benevolence has extended to a thoughtful removal of causes ; but great plans of philanthropy which have involved the bettering of the condition of whole nations have originated with men . This has been due to a no less intense desire for general good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of seeing wide ranges of facts and reasoning from them to general remedies . While the woman is ministering to the needs of one sick family , the man is organizing a plan of action which shall improve the sanitary condition of the whole village . Women have in many instances appropriated fortunes to philanthropies founded upon the thought of men ; but they have seldom originated such schemes . They have been far behind in thinking upon philanthropies and reforms , though they have been prompt to feel and to act . This feeling and action are most valuable in supplementing thought , but , from their great amount , their relative value has been overrated . The one who conceives a great plan is always greater than those who execute it . He is the master , and they who follow are his servants . Into all estimates of the comparative morality of the sexes , one specific criticism always enters , that of the greater insincerity of women . If a fair investigation could be made of the social and home life of a score of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubtedly show a greater proportion of deceptions , affectations , suppressions , and unworthy plottings on the part of women . If the observations were made in commercial and business life instead of in society , the proportion of masculine falsehoods and concealments // would undeniably be greater . The plain reason for this difference is , that women have more points to gain in society , while men have more to gain in business . Men deceive to gain money , women to gain favor . The instinct of self-preservation is at the bottom of both orders of falsehood . Women , who must have occupation and position , seek them in the direction which offers least resistance . It is always easier to rest in the satisfaction of the emotional life than to push forward in the direction of intellectual growth . The hard work and hard thinking which the world exacts before it will give place and remunerative occupation to the worker is too hard a condition for most women with their present development . It is easier to take up and deal with simpler things ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end is gained . The strong and constant demands which wifehood and motherhood make upon the physical , the emotional , and the moral forces , seem to constitute a reason for the checking of intellectual growth . Yet , in the cases of women upon whom no such demands are made , we see no higher degree of development ; and this certainly helps to show that their general contentment , with emotional gratification , is an inherent trait . What sufficient cause can there be for this relatively lower development than the relatively smaller bodies and brains of those who exhibit the effect ? There is a direct ethical value in the exercise of the intellect . Its most healthful action can occur only where the moral nature is perfectly sound . We can not acquire facts or reason to conclusions under emotional excitement , or when we are devising some social stratagem . If there is any reason for concealment of motives or of conduct , the necessity for keeping up that concealment will so employ the brain as to render any except this low form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sense of a strong desire for the right and true , is the clearing of the field and preparation of the soil for intellectual harvests . The motive to selfpreservation and the very general dependence of women upon men for the means of life have fostered moral disease . We know a woman who , for the last quarter of a century , has habitually taken money from her husband 's purse while he was asleep , and this has been done to supply reasonable needs and social requirements which he ignored . To be free from the temptation to deceive men , women must be independent of them in respect to the means of life , and they must gain such an intellectual culture as shall lift them out of // their exclusive indulgence of the emotions . At present , women seem obliged to marry for two reasons : one , that they can not win social independence without it ; and the other , that their emotional natures crave constant exercise . How much the severe culture of the intellect will do toward the moral redemption of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less solicitous for their favor , is one of the problems of our future civilization . One perplexing aspect of the sex question has grown into conconsiderable importance in America , the so-called free-love philosophy . The very great majority of women , with their inability to take in facts in their larger relations , have nothing but utter condemnation for a movement which attempts the destruction of the family in the name of a reform . The majority of advocates of this social theory are men who show that they have thought upon the question , but that their conclusions have neglected some of the most influential facts . One of the fundamental arguments against the present solution of sex relations is that monogamic marriage is a failure : it has not solved the problem of human happiness . Instead of this rotten social institution , in which men and women give pledges and promises under legal and ecclesiastical sanction , it is proposed to substitute absolute personal control of these relations . Neither church nor state , it is claimed , has any more moral right to interfere with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere with the choice , purchase , or sale of a house or of a suit it of clothes . The history of civil liberty , is said , is a history of the enlargement of the rights of the individual ; as he has grown more intelligent , he has continually wrested from the state more and more liberty to control his own actions . It is the policy of governing organizations , like church and state , to keep men in vassalage as long as possible . People can not be freed from irksome matrimonial bondage without the expense and delay of legal processes . So long as people must submit judgment and inclination to statute laws , on such questions they are children or slaves instead of freemen . Such is the general argument of these reformers . It is not hard to discover the sources of such a social theory . The plan of government in the United States favors the largest possible individualism . It was to give the freest possible play to individual rights that the men of the Revolution fought their battles and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yearly augmenting number of divorces under state legislation is a further movement toward strengthening individualism . If // anything goes wrong , the spirit of our legislation is to right it , as far as practicable , by altering the conditions for the individuaL This extreme liberality of the state toward her citizens is analogous to the indulgence of a mother to her children who insist on trying some experiment which the mother foresees will not help them . Yet the wise mother knows that the scientific method of developing her child is to let it see for itself what is helpful and hurtful . Changed conditions sometimes increase the happiness of sexual relations ; but , as the reason for unhappy associations is found in the imperfect moral development or lack of judgment of those forming them , the way to insure happier results is to improve human nature . Happy unions are always voluntary , not only at the beginning , but as long as life lasts . Love can not be made free by a change of statutes . It can not be bound or loosed under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petitions of those who ask that sex relations be exempted from control , the experience of a quarter of a century would convince the world that the old , long-tried , monogamic solution of the sex question is the wise one . There are evident reasons why such a result would come . In all the past emotional experience of the race it has been found impossible to create an intense idealization of more than one object at one time ; it has been found , too , that when such idealization has been tested by knowledge and time it does not diminish , but deepen ; and that the effect of this long-continued idealization is to create the best conditions of development , both for those who exercise it and for those toward whom it is directed . Now , if the best conditions of happiness are once secured they should be maintained . It is not possible to bring out all the results of this mutual sex idealization in any short period on association . The very fact that the association is a permanent one gives it earnestness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half-dozen associations , extending over twenty-five years , the same amount of fine character-development that would come from one fortunate association lasting for the same time . When we are once sure of the wisdom , integrity , and affection of some friend through long experience , we spend no more brain-activity in learning his peculiarities of character and in adapting ourselves to them . The association of husband and wife is rather moral and affectional than intellectual . It is a rest , a certainty , a point of departure for all other activities . Once settled , and safely settled , we waste no power in readjusting these relations , but take the fruit as it ripens , // without the need of uprooting the old and planting new trees . There is abundance of unanswerable scientific proof of better results in character and in happiness from long-continued sexual association than from transient and varied connections . For the state to grant to individuals the power of forming and dissolving such associations at will would be to grant them a power of injuring themselves by an unwholesome experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any fair-minded observer of the true solution of this question , without a resort to such a dangerous legislation . A wiser development of human nature in all directions is the real key to human happiness . M. A. HARDAKER.
