txt Senator THURMAN made a little speech the other evening at Columbus , at a meeting over which he presided . In the course of it , he referred to the blissful consequences which would follow when Gen. HANCOCK was elected President . " When this great and good man , " said the Senator , " takes his seat  --  and he with take it if elected  --  then you will see the exit of the bloody shirt ' and obedience to the Constitution ; then you will see one of the greatest nations that ever lived , united as one people , as brothers . " Waiving the accuracy of this prediction , for it is hardly worth while to discuss the prophetic capacity of a man whose political ! career has been so melancholy a failure , we would call our readers ' attention to the bit of bombast thrown in by way of parenthesis . Other Democratic orators , of less pretensions to respectability and candor than Senator THURMAN , have already announced , as if it were something novel and interesting , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat . " Of course , if this announcement has any force at all , it is in the implication that Mr. TILDEN was elected President and did not take his seat . From the ordinary irresponsible stump speaker of the Democratic sort this implication might ? be passed by with contempt . It is the dying echo of the hubbub with which the press of that party was filled during a good part of the year 1877 . But from Mr. THURMAN , it is entitled to some examination . He is a Senator of the United States , and , when he chooses to be so , a sound constitutional lawyer . He was a member of the Electoral Commission , and of the Congress which adopted the conclusions of that Commission . When he makes the unmistakable insinuation that Mr. TILDEN was elected and did not , either from cowardice or some other motive , take his seat , he simply lends the authority of a high position and a name once respected to an entirely unjustified and false assertion , which might be pardoned in an ignorant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should even indirectly sanction . Either Congress had , in 1876 , under the Constitution , some discretion in directing the determination of the mode of counting the Electoral votes , or else the Republican view was correct that they should be counted by the President of the Senate in the presence of the two houses acting only as witnesses . If this latter view was correct , then Mr. TILDEN never did obtain , and never could have obtained , the slightest title to the Presidency . If the former view was correct , then Congress exercised and exhausted its power in providing for the Electoral Commission and in approving the findings of that Commission . In this case , also , Mr. TILDEN never obtained , and never was in a position to obtain , any title to the Presidency . Mr. THURMAN was a participant in the whole proceeding . He was in the Senate when the bill was passed , in the Commission when it acted , in the Senate still when the results of that action were submitted . to the two houses and rendered final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opinion may have existed regarding the votes of Louisiana , South Carolina , Florida , and Oregon before or after the action of Congress , that action closed the case completely , with only one reservation . That reservation , which was made by the suggestion of Mr. THURMAN himself , was of the right of the candidate who should fail to make good his title before the Commission to appeal to the Supreme Court . No such appeal has ever been made , and Mr. TILDEN , in refusing to make it , is , as are all his advocates , estopped forever from pretending that he has the slightest claim on the office for which he was a candidate .. , The impudence and inconsistency which Senator THURMAN displays in thus reviving a stale partisan cry which never had any excuse , would be of no consequence were he merely engaged in a historical retrospect ; but when he indulges in threats as to the future he must take the responsibility of his real meaning . He says , with significant emphasis , that if Gen. HaNcocK is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose there should be a dispute about his election similar to the one which arose regarding the election of Mr. TILDEN in 1876 , does Mr. THURMAN mean to say that Gen. HANCOCK would constitute himself the final judge of that dispute , and would force his way to the White House ? Or that he would , as he did in 1876 , assume that the Democratic view of the matter in question was necessarily the right one , and undertake , as he advised Gen. SHERMAN to undertake , in 1876 , the inauguration of a President by the use of his military authority ? If this be not the meaning of Mr .. THURMAN 'S vaporing , what meaning is there to it ? Of course , if Gen. HANCOCK gets an undoubted majority of the Electoral votes , he " will take his seat , " and the Republican Party , with perfect loyalty , will not think of trying to prevent him . But if he claims to have such a majority , and his rival claims with equal confidence to have a majority , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispute are open to the same conflicting interpretations as four years ago . Congress has refused to remove the uncertainty which exists in them . Though possessing a strong majority in both houses , the Democrats have done nothing to prevent the recurrence of the wretched dispute which then arose . Doubtless , this neglect has been intentional . It was to the interest of the party to keep the question open in hopes to settle ' it as the partisan caucus should decide . And now , in face of the experience of 1876 , we hear these party leaders threatening that , no matter what others may think of it , if Gen. HANCOCK believes , or chooses to profess to believe , that he is elected , he " will take his seat . " That is what Senator THURMAN 'S parenthesis means , and it is as mischievous talk as he could well indulge in . Now that Mr. THUR744N is permanently laid away in politics , and has nothing to hope from gratuitous . servility to his party , why does he not indulge in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this importance , as he can treat them when he wishes , like a statesman ?
