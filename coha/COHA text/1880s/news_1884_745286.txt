txt A variety of rumors are afloat regarding the purposes of the Mayor in respect to the appointment of a Commissioner of Public Works and a Corporation Counsel when the terms of the present incumbents of those offices shall expire , on the 10th of December . For the first time since he came into office Mr. EDSON will then have an opportunity to apply a principle which a year ago last February he professed to regard as of great importance in the administration of the affairs of this city . He had then been Mayor only a few weeks , and showed great interest in the subject of charter reform . He prepared a series of amendments to the charter of the city , which he sent to Albany , and which he advocated with a good deal of force and . apparent earnestness . The fundamental idea of his scheme of reform was that all departments should be singleheaded , that the Mayor should have full power of appointment and removal , and that all officers appointed by him should have terms expiring with his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointing new heads of departments and be held responsible for their character . Some progress has been made since that time toward the results at which Mr. EDSON aimed . The departments have not been made single-headed , and he can do nothing by his own action to make them so , but the power has been given to the Mayor to make appointments without the intervention of the Board of Aldermen , as he advised . It was the intention to make that power applicable to the selection of successors to those officers whose terms are to expire next month , but the bill providing for this was so unfortunately muddled that the Governor , when it was too late to remedy its defects , felt called upon to withhold from it his approval . It was the apparent purpose of this bill as amended to make the offices of the Mayor 's appointees conterminous with his own in point of time , but it failed clearly to provide for this . Among the recommendations of the Roosevelt committee made in. its supplementary report last May , too late for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor , a three years ' term of office , an , the expiration of the terms of his appointees at the same time with his own . These two latter points were among those on which the Mayor laid stress in his own propositions for reform . It is impossible for Mayor EDSON to do very much now toward carrying out the ideas which he advocated last year , or to advance the reforms which have since been initiated , but there is one point on which he has an opportunity to show his consistency . If the successors of Commissioner THOMPSON and Corporation Counsel LACOMBE are not appointed in December these men will hold over until the appointments are made , and they can then be made by Mr. GRACE without consulting the Board of Aldermen . By merely omitting to make these ap- pointments Mr. Edson can in an important particular , apply the principle so ably advocated by himself , He can avoid the evil of selecting men who must be acceptable to the petty politicians of . the Board of Aldermen and of giving effect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give to his successor the opportunity of selecting men for these positions for whom he . may justly be held responsible and who may be expected ' to work harmoniously in his administration , and he can repair all the harm that was done by the failure to put the Tenure of Office act in a shape to receive the Governor 's approval . By this single act the Mayor can not only show his consistency and his fidelity to a principle propounded by himself , at a time when there can be no misconstruction of his motives , but he can do an essential service to the public which will enable him to go out of office with much additional credit . The stories that are circulated about the deals over these offices and the part assigned to the Mayor in carrying them . out indicate an expectation on the part of the faction leaders that Mr. EDSON will be subservient to them in a matter which he really has in his own hands . This is not creditable to him if he has given any ground for it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the city administration and his sincerity in advocating reform by simply leaving these appointments to his successor .
