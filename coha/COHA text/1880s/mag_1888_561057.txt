IT seems not unlikely that within a year the fastest steamers now on the Atlantic , such as the " Umbria " and the " Eturia , " will cease to hold their pre-eminence in the matter of speed , and that the time of the passage between New York and Queenstown will be reduced by at least twenty-four hours , making it just onehalf what it was when the old " Scotia " represented the minimum . The quickest passage on record now is a little over six days , and we have the authority of the most successful of modern shipbuilders for saying that the only question whether this can be surpassed or not is the question of expense ; that there are no natural or scientific obstacles to still more wonderful achievements ; and that the chief thing which shipbuilders and shipowners have to consider is whether a higher rate of speed will be profitable . Meanwhile , many passengers who cross the ocean , glad as they may be to curtail the tedium and distress which are so often inseparable from the most luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the velocity of those so-called " ocean greyhounds , " and are yet more apprehensive of proposed attempts to accelerate them . To make the passage in six days a steamer has to maintain , day after day , night after night , without break or intermission , a speed little lower than the average of the express trains which run between the East and the Pacific . Does not this expose her to imminent peril from collision and in approaching the coast ? Does it not deprive her of any chance of avoiding an obstacle in her path ? The partial knowledge of the subject possessed by landsmen disposes them to look upon slow steamers as the safest , and the tortoise and the hare again start out to adorn the debate . The ill-fated " Oregon , " of the Cunard line , is remembered . Would that splendid ship have been lost as she was had it not been for the extraordinary speed at which she was traveling ? The commanders of the principal // steamers on the Atlantic are almost unanimously in favor of fast ships , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a number of them show : " After an experience of 585 passages across the Atlantic , I am decidedly in favor of fast steamers , both on account of their safety and comfort , and I will as briefly as possible give my reasons . " First , if you have a danger to encounter , the sooner you get over it the better , and if one steamer takes seven and another ten days to cross the Atlantic , it is evident that you have three more days of risk in the slower ship . " Secondly , a fast steamer will run through a gale of wind and reach fine weather much quicker than a slow one , and the same holds good in regard to banks of fog . Unless there is ice in the vicinity , I always maintain that it is the safest plan to run through a fog bank as speedily as you can . " Thirdly , if a collision takes place between two vessels , you may depend upon it that the one going fastest will sustain the least damage. ** @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona. ** " I , for one , would not like to say , after my forty years ' experience , which is the safer . There can be no question that the less time on the voyage the less risk . In event of a collision between a slow steamer and a fast one , I should prefer to be on the fast one ; but in the event of striking ice , rocks , or a sand bank , I say take the slow one , and the slower the ship the better . " HAMILToN PERRY , Late Commander White Star Line Steamer " Britannic . " " In my mind there is no question as to the greater safety of a fast and powerful steamer over a slow one . In cases of necessity , such as fog on the coast or ice in the ice track , you can reduce // the speed of the fast ship to any degree . In all other cases high speed and power are sources of safety . For instance , if in making a passage you are warned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you are approaching unpleasantly near the vortex of a revolving storm , you can quickly run a fast ship into the outer circle and in many cases what might otherwise prove to be a disastrous gale may be transformed into a fair wind . Again , should you be caught in a heavy gale without due warning , the great power of the fast ship renders her a much superior sea boat , inasmuch as with a judicious use of that power you are enabled to keep your ship in the most favorable position all the time , while a ship of small power would be continually falling off and bringing the sea abeam , rendering herself liable to suffer damage about the decks as she came to the wind again . In support of this statement I may mention that I have been for some years in command of the Alaska , ' during which period I have experienced the heaviest kind of weather , not excluding the late blizzard of March 12th , and yet I have never suffered the slightest damage about the decks , boats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship will get through the bad weather in half the time a slow one will , and in dull , cloudy weather , such as one meets at certain seasons of the year for days together without sun , moon , or stars , a fast ship from her greater speed will be able to make safer and more direct courses than the slow one . In making land you are often able to save your daylight by a fast ship , and in making port you may save the tide and enter when a slow ship would have to anchor outside and face all the contingencies t'hat might arise in that period . I quote these instances to show why I am so fully convinced in my own mind that the fast ship is so much safer than the slow one , and that in the former the risk is minimized to passengers , crews , owners , and underwriters . " GEORGE MURRAY , Commander Guion Line Steamer " Alaska . " " I am of the opinion that the fast steamer is the safest . Whereever there is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By exercising care in foggy weather , and slowing down to a moderate // speed , you have the same degree of safety as a slow ship , and a great advantage over her when it clears . On the other hand , we are more exposed , making two passages for a slow ship 's one . But taking the two making the same voyage , the fast ship has decidedly the advantage . " WILLIAM MCMICKA* , Commander Cunard Steamer " Umbria . " " Speed on the Atlantic , or , indeed , on any sea , is a muchvexed question , and you have so many conflicting statements on the subject that those who have had no experience find it hard to reconcile the various opinions . According to my judgment , a steamer of great speed is safer than one of small power . " First , in case of bad weather , fast ships can keep head up to the wind and sea , and so be in the best and safest position for meeting the high waves we so often encounter during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be regulated according to the height of the waves and the severity of the storm . It is also to be said of fast ships that they are a shorter time at sea , and the dangers of the ocean are of less duration with them than with the slow ships . Ships of very moderate and small power are never so safe as their faster sisters in bad weather . For example , a steamer that goes nine knots in fine weather would find it hard to keep her head up to the gale in boisterous weather , especially if she were lightly loaded , and would be in danger of falling into the trough . A fast ship is also better going before the gale , as there is little chance of her being pooped , that is , swamped by a following sea . " ARTHUR W. LEWIS , Commander Inman Line Steamer " City of Chester . " " Strength and stability being equal , the fast steamer has a great advantage over her slow neighbor in many ways ; but the handling and sailing of fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so to speak , for that special work . " HORATIO MCKAY , Commander Cunard Steamer " Servia. " // " In March , 1871 , when the steamers of the White Star Line first started , they were looked upon as vessels altogether faster than safety demanded , and many people predicted that the line would soon come to an end through disasters caused by collisions . They have now been running seventeen years and show a record second to none for freedom from collision . When the Britannic ' and Germanic ' first came out they were looked upon as marvels of speed , and notwithstanding the success of previous ships on our line fears were entertained that such speed would be dangerous and that collisions would certainly occur . As time passed on and passage after passage was made with such precision that almost the hour of arrival could be accurately determined , and as no accident happened , the confidence of the public was gained , and travelers who suffered from that dreadful affliction , seasickness , were only too glad to take passage by them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both ships are still running , and with the exception of the collision between the Britannic ' and the Celtic ' in May , 1887 , they have been clear of accidents and are among the most successful ships afloat . I made one hundred and thirteen round voyages ( two hundred and twenty-six passages ) in command of the Germanic ' in eleven years and six months , and during that time not one collision occured . Previous to taking her I commanded the Baltic ' for nearly three years with the same result . " Since the advent of the Britannic ' and Germanic ' the Cunard , Inman , Guion , French and North German Lloyd lines have all built ships superior in size and speed to the two former , and the eight and nine day passages of the White Star steamers have been reduced to six days and a half by the Etruria ' and the Umbria ' of the Cunard line . The French and North German Lloyds have reduced theirs from ten and eleven days to about seyen , and without any serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public the fact that the increase of speed in the passenger steamers of the present day has not caused an increase of danger , and that they are quite as safe as the slow steamers of the past . " It is hardly necessary for me to say how important it is that fast ships should be commanded by competent men-men who are careful and watchful ; for as the size and power of a steamer are increased , so ought to be the vigilance and responsibility of the // captain . His duties , while on board his ship , are endless , and considering the number of lives and the immense amount of valuable property intrusted to him , it is not to be wondered at that his countenance is stern , and his manner perhaps not as agreeable as it might be if he were at a dinner party . Passengers who call the captain Bear ' should take these facts into consideration , and respect him accordingly . " Although the speed of passenger steamers has been increased , very little has been done in providing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however . Several different codes have been laid before the English Board of Trade and the admiralty , but although the necessity of such signals has been proved and strongly advocated by seafaring men , none has been adopted . The different steamship companies acknowledge the necessity of such signals , and would willingly use them as an additional factor in promoting the safcty of their ships ; but as the Board of Trade has made no move in that direction , it is useless to adopt them unless they can be enforced generally . The international rules are to-day ( with the exception of one or two slight changes ) the same as they were years ago , and when in a fog the only umeans a commander has of making known his approach to another vessel is the single blast of the steam whistle , which conveys no information regarding the course he is steering . The codes I allude to give certain blasts for each point of the compass , so that a vessel using one of them can indicate to an approaching vesscl the course she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a code were adopted and made compulsory on board all steamers , the ocean voyage would be relieved of a peril much more serious than any arising from a high rate of speed . Had such a code been in use on board the Britannic ' and the Celtic ' the collision between those ships would never have occurred . " CHARLES W. KENNEDY , Late Commander of the White Star Steamer " Germanic . " " My opinion is that while extremely fast ships lessen the duration of dangers , they augment the number of dangers . " C. FRAI*GEUL , // " Without entering into long comparisons between slow and fast steamers , I may say , briefly , that I think the fast steamer safer than the slow one . She is a shorter time on the ocean , and the chances of accident are thus diminished . The personal interest of the captain and officers in her is greatly enhanced . " TH . DE JOU5SELIM , Commander French Line steamer " La Bretagne . " " The Board of Trade commanding and regulating most of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt gathered from the experience of many men ) that a slow rate of speed is safest in foggy weather , and , therefore , I try as nearly as possible to carry out its idea , so as to escape unfavorable comments in case of an accident . " When a ship is approaching land and sounding constantly , a low rate of speed is , no doubt , best , since , should you be in error it might prevent you from becoming a total wreck . Again when a ship is in the vicinity of ice floes and bergs a low rate of speed is advisable , as it also is when a thick gale or beam wind is blowing , preventing your whistle from being heard any distance ahead . But in an ordinary fog I argue that full speed is the safest , and my reasons are these : If you slow down the moment fog comes on the steam roars out of the escape pipes with such a noise that for some time you are in absolute danger , not being able to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take power off your ship and pressure off your whistle , and if you suddenly hear some sound ahead you can only turn to the right or left slowly or stop altogether , letting the other ship take her chances of clearing you . Again you can not reverse full speed , as your steam is too low to move the engines quickly . Now , going full speed all is as still and as quite as the grave . Ears and good look-outs are ready for the least sound . The moment you hear a sound , up helm and bring the horn or whistle abaft your beam , which is comparatively a place of safety , and blow once or twice to the other steamer , indicating to him whether you have directed your own ship to the port or starboard . " The greatest trouble I find in foggy weather is the dislike many commanders of the smaller steamers have to sounding their fog signals . Some say , 0 , you can see farther than you can hear . ' // Others say , 0 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the passengers . ' Others , 0 , once in two minutes is quite often enough. * I maintain that a whistle should be religiously sounded at least every minute , and oftener if necessary , but never less . " FRANK S. LAND , Commander Jnman Line Steamer " City of Berlin . " The commander of a White Star steamer , who does not wish his name to be published , writes : " As a matter of fact the whole question : Are fast or slow steamers the safest , ' resolves itself into a question of fogs , for , due vigilance being always exercised by the commander and his officers , that is where the real danger lies . We hear of vessels such as the City of Brussels ' being run down when stopped or at anchor , and we hear of other cases where serious calamity has been avoided , simply and solely by reason of the high speed of the meeting vessels . A fog is the most treacherous and dreaded of all the sailor 's enemies . " Again , what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Government ( Board of Trade ) regulations , commanders are instructed to go slow in a fog , and yet another department of the Government ( the Post-Office ) comes forward offering a premium on fast passages . The mails are given to the steamers which make the shortest passages , be the weather fair or foul and the risks what they may ; with such matters , of course , the Post-Office officials have nothing to do ! " Another commander in the White Star Line , who also wishes to be unknown , writes " Your question might be divided thus : Is it safer to go through fogs as quickly as possible , or by going slower and keeping your vessel more under control , as far as reducing her headway is concerned , are you less liable to accidents ? I think it is generally acknowledged among seamen that the former is the wiser course , especially with large steamers supplied with steam steering gear , as the greater the speed the quicker the vessel will turn in // answer to her helm . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a much shorter time in a region of fog than with a slow steamer . " Indeed , to my mind there is quite as much danger going slow as going fast . Then as to approaching land at a high rate of speed : this is said to be dangerous ; but since Sir William Thomson invented his patent sounding machine , soundings can be taken when a ship is going at any speed . " The safety of steamers going at a great speed can not be better demonstrated I believe than by a reference to the Holyhead and Dublin mail steamers . These are among the fastest vessels in the world , making a speed of nearly twenty knots , or twenty-two and a half miles per hour ; but though they have to cross the track of all vessels bound up the Irish Sea accidents to them are almost unheard of . Passengers may always rest assured of their safety in a first-class , well regulated steamer , should she be going fast or slow , and may relieve their minds of all anxiety , confident that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken . " The opinions of some of the principal ship builders were also sought , and among the replies received was this from Messrs . James and George Thomson , the builders of some of the most celebrated of the Cunard ships and also of the two new Inman ships which are expected to " break the record : " " In our opinion , if proper attention be given to the steering power of the ship , a fast ship , in the hands of an able commander , is more able to avoid collision than a slow ship . On account of the shorter time a fast ship is at sea , as well as the shorter time she is in the vicinity of another ship , she is less liable to be in danger of collision , and even when in danger we think she is more able to avoid it . But we would point out that the question of safety is not wholly dependent on avoiding collisions , and that if proper structural arrangements are made a ship may be as safe after a collision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , we may say that the fastest ships on the Atlantic are the safest in our opinion . " JAMES AND GEORGE THOMSON . // Perhaps it is because the obvious is so apt to escape us that the point oftenest reiterated in these communications comes with an undue freshness of conviction to the landsman , i. e. , that dangers are usually in proportion to the length of time a ship is at sea , and that , therefore , a fast ship is safer than a slow one , because the period of her exposure is of briefer duration . But though there is a remarkable unanimity of opinion in favor of fast ships , the reasons given for the preference are not always sound , nor do they in all cases accord with what one might desire in the interest of humanity . If , for instance , a fast ship runs out of an area of fog or storm sooner than a slow ship , is it not true that the superiority of speed which enables her to do this also allows her to reach another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her tardier competitor could reach it . Let us say that the " Alaska " encounters a heavy gale on the banks on a Sunday , when she is in company with a slower ship . She has run out of it by Monday morning , while the other ship has to struggle through it several hours longer . On the following Wednesday the " Alaska " meets another gale , and has to bear all the force of it , but by the time the slow ship reaches it , it has moderated or blown itself out . Possibly it may be said in answer to this that still another storm might overtake the laggard , which the fast ship being so many miles ahead would be able to avoid ; but chances of this kind do not afford any secure basis for a positive assertion . Again , though it may be a selfish , not to say inhuman consideration , it is undeniably comforting to the passenger by a fast steamer to be assured that in event of a collision his vessel is less likely to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a fallacious assumption . If the fast ship runs into another ship , fast or slow , the will probably cut her down and escape with comparatively little injury . What , however , if she herself is struck amidships , or in any vital part ? Her speed can not save her then , but on the contrary , it is likely to augment the proportions of the disaster . Aside from a few such fallacies as we have indicated , the testimony of the distinguished seamen , who have been good enough to communicate their opinions , demonstrates satisfactorily that a passenger on board a very fast steamer is quite as safe as on a very slow one . Speed does not necessarily increase peril . Summin*g up the evidence we find that the ship of great power // not only diminishes the period of exposure to such dangers as there may be in the transatlantic voyage , but that she is also better fitted for meeting those dangers . Fast ships are superior as sea-boats to ships of smaller power , more easily handled in fogs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as Captain Murray of the " Alaska " points out , their speed often enables them to make land by daylight , and to save tides , when slower ships would have to approach a treacherous coast at night , and anchor outside the harbor while waiting for a tide . The maximum of speed has certainly not yet been reached . In all probability the " City of New York " and the " City of Paris , " which Messrs . James and George Thomson are building for the Juman Line , will surpass all that has heretofore been done , and they in turn may be left behind by still newer ships . Such extraordinary speed unquestionably calls for extraordinary vigilance on the part of the officers , and it is pleasant to note that in the new Inman ships several unique features are being introduced , which it is believed will make them unsinkable .
