txt The steamer R. R. Springer , of the New-Orleans and Cincinnati Line , went up the river to-day with 260 students of Nelson 's Business School , of both sexes , mostly persons of nearly mature age , on a picnic to Parker 's Grove . about 14 miles up the Ohio River . The steamer in returning arrived near the Newport Railroad bridge at 7 o'clock this evening . The river is nearly 40 feet high , and a strong wind was blowing . The steamer had to lower her chimneys to got under the bridge , but there was some delay on account of the imperfect working of the machinery . Capt . Hart was at this time at the wheel . A strong wind from the north struck the boat , which was high in the water on account of her light load . The Captain saw that the boat was drifting so as to strike the edge of the bridge pier amidships . lie saw at a glance the peril of the position . It was too late to back against a strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered on all the steam possible and dashed ahead . The starboard side of the steamer struck the pier . All the passengers were on the upper deck . The jar threw many of them on their faces . The passengers rusned to the boiler deck and huddled together on the forecastle . The steamer grazed the pier , crushing in her smith 's shop , barber 's shop , mess-house , wheelhouse , and the wheel . A signal of distress was thrown out . The boat floated helplessly down the stream and struck some coal barges moored below . damaging one so much that the coal had to be thrown into the river to save the barge . The passengers all scrambled on to the coal fleet and escaped without injury , except that some had their hands and faces scratched and received slight bruises . The steamer was made fast , and every body rejoined over the marvelous escape . Very few children were on board . There was a panic for a moment , but no one jumped overboard . The time between striking the pier and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a very fortunate circumstance . It was a very narrow escape from a frightful catualty . Two seconds ' hesitation on the part of the Captain at the wheel in that emergency would have been equivalent to cutting the boat in two and losing the lives of nearly all on board . The damage to the steamer is estimated at $1,000 , but the loss , including repairs and liability for damage to the coal fleet , will he probably twice that amount .
