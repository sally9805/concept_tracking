Cooke , Rose Terry , 1827-1892 : Give her the soldier 's rite from " Give her the soldier 's rite ! " 1886 Give her the soldier 's rite ! She fought the hardest fight : Not in the storm of battle , Where the drum 's exultant rattle , The onset 's maddening yell , The scream of shot and shell , And the trumpet 's clangor soaring Over the cannon 's roaring , Thrilled every vein with fire , And combat 's mad desire ; She fought her fight alone , To the sound of dying groan : The sob of failing breath , The reveille of death : She faced the last of foes , The worst of mortal woes ; The solitude of dying , The hearts for kindred crying : By the soldier 's lonely bed , In the midnight dark and dread , Mid the wounded and the dead , With life-blood pouring red , The cries of woe and fear , Rending the watcher 's ear , The hovering wings of death , Muttered by dying breath , There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her strong word to impart Peace to the fainting heart . Give her the soldier 's rite ! Let the old Seventh wave Their flag above her grave : Let the deep minute gun Tell of her battle done : Lo ! on the other bank , Comes down a serried rank , The souls she comforted , The army of the dead : For her salute and shout ; Their victory is our route . Give her the soldier 's rite ! Honor her sleep to night , For now she ranks us all . Weave laurels for her pall , And fold above her bier The flag she held so dear ; For another fight is won . Another soldier gone Through the night , to the light  --  And another left alone ; God of battles ! help us all !
