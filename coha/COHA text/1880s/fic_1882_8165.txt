Cooke , Rose Terry , 1827-1892 : A GREAT SHAME . from A great shame 1882 Mr. and Mrs. Blue-back Swallow Back from their Florida journey came , To their summer home in that shady hollow Other people a chimney name . Theirs was not on a modern villa , Inches square , with a fluted top , And arching cover , with scroll and pillar , Squeezing and blinding their homeward flop . A great old-fashioned chimney 's corner Many a year had held their nest : Loved in spite of the oriole scorner Who jeered and sneered from his hammock rest . Here they came when the sun was rising , Veered , and hovered , and downward dropped ; But Madam suddenly screamed , " Surprising ! Look , my dear , how our door is stopped ! " " Sure enough ! " chirped Mr. Swallow ; " What ! a stone on our very door ! Never again with twittering hollo Shall we dart to our nests once more . " Stone , and bricks , and wiry netting Where the wind went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! no use fretting : We are a houseless , homeless pair . " " I know who ' t was ! " said the bright-eyed woman . " Creatures that live in the house below : Beings who call their own selves ' human ! ' Very inhuman to treat us so ! " These are they who scorch and smoke us , Making fires on our chimney floor , And , if we fall to the hearth-stone , poke us , Bang us , and throw us out of door . " Now , I suppose , because we twitter And thunder wings in the early dawn , As up and down to our nests we flitter , Their nets are over our house-door drawn . " Selfish things ! may black flies eat ' em ! All mosquitoes bite ' em , too ! Night moths , horn-bugs , May-bugs beat ' em , Till every visage is black and blue ! " Dear !  --  I hate these horrid people ! Let us fly to a safer home . What do you say to the old church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Never a chirp Sir Blue-back uttered , Only looked at his wife askance : Something cross in his beak he muttered , Then up and off he led her a dance . Where they went is past my telling . Sorry I am I must relate That I shut up their life-long dwelling : But the snow and rain came down too straight .
