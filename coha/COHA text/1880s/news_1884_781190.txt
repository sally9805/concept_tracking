txt The janitor of the Madison-Avenue Uongregational Church evidently had forgotten that the Board of ' Trustees were to meet in the church last night , for when seven members of the board arrived they found that the doors wore locked and the whole church was in an alarming state of darkness . No one seemed to know where &he; janitor lived , but after some minutes of Shivering uncertainty a Trustee suddenly bethought himself that the sexton also had keys , and he went to get them . He returned with the sexton 's son and the keys . Admittance being gained to the vestry the seven gentlemen present , who were Messrs . Breen , Nicoll , Hopkins , Knapp . Seymour , Cooley , and Secretary Ward , warmed themselves at the remnants of a fire which remained in the stove , and then gathered about a table . Mr. Breen took the chair and called the " meeting " to order . Treasurer Seymour then furnished his report for the months of June , July . and August , by which it was shown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , while the disbursements amounted to $2,309 11 , and there was a balance in the treasury on Sept. 1 of 849 88 . Then a list of present indebtedness was read by Mr. Seymour , and the others looked glum . The church was in debt to its choir to the extent of 8441 ; to its Pastor , ( on Oct. 1 , ) $5,134 , according to one count , and under the recent injunction obtained , $2,800 ; other small bills amounted to $920 06 ; a carpet claim , $500 , and interest due on the mortgage on the church , $2,750 . Then a list of people covering several sheets of foolscap who owed pew rent was read , and it was found that from this source alone $3,097 was due , which it seemed could not be obtained . Mr. Seymour had had a collector at work all Summer trying to get the money , but the people refused to pay except to Dr. Newman , and , as Dr. Newman refused to accept it , in all likelihood the money would remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , together with Trustee Hopkins , asked to be allowed to make an inspection of the Treasurer 's and Secretary 's books for the past few years , was read , and after a long discussion it was decided to have the books at Mr. Foster 's office at 12 o'clock to-day , when Trustee Hopkins and the lawyer will look over them . A bill for printing amounting to $152 70 was next presented . The bill had long been due , and Burgoyne , the printer , had finally put it in the hands of a collector , who had written for payment , and , being informed that it could not be paid , obtained a summons from the Superior Court for the Treasurer to appear before that tribunal 20 days from the date of service . Then the matter of arrears of and interest due on the church property mortgage was taken up . A letter from the lawyer of the Mutual Life Insurance Company , which holds the mortgage , stated that unless the interest was paid forthwith the company would foreclose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chairman . " People wo n't pay their pow rents , and how are we to pay our debts ? " Trustee Hopkins , in a tone of mild sarcasm , advised the board to apply for a second mortgage . Trustee Cooley , who had up to this time preserved a discreet silence , suddenly asked about the famous stereoptican which Dr. Hepworth had given the church , mid which Dr. Ranney persistently holds , claiming that Dr. Hepworth gave it to him . Trustee Cooley moved that l ) r . Hepworth " demand " it from Dr. Ranney , whereat the other Trustees laughed . Trustee Hopkins made himself energetically heard in protest as he said the affair belonged to Dr. Ranney , and not to 1 ) r . Hepworth . " But , " said the Chair , " Dr. Hepworth wrote to me that the stereopticon belongs to us and not to Dr. Ranney . " " And 1 know , " ejaculated Mr. Hopkins , " that it belongs to Dr. Ranney . " " Then , " said the Chair , " Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! no be is simply mistaken , " mildly corrected the Rannyite . Then . Trustee Cooley irrelevantly branched off into another matter and offered this resolution which was finally passed , Trustee Hopkins , however , voting against it : Resolved , That the Treasurer be authorized to write the Mutual Life Insurance Company that we have no money in the treasury to pay the interest on the mort-age , and ca n't name a definite date when we will have . " IsiA that just a trifle abrupt ? " asked Mr. Hopkins , amid a general smile . " No Sir ; but its sound sense , " said the mover. and continued again somewhat irrelevantly , " I move you , Mr. Chairman , that the $15Z printing bill be paid . " In view of the fact that not quite $50 remained in the Treasury , the other Trustees thought they would laugh and did so . But they will levy on us , if it is n't paid , " insisted Mr. Cooley . " They may take our organ . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nailed : They ca n't ' take anything that 's nailed . " The Treasurer thought that within the 20 days allowed he might raise the money , but was somewhat discouraged at the smallness of the two previous Sundays ' collections . One had amounted to a little over $8 , and the other to $10 . It was finally decided to lay this matter over till the next meeting , and the Trustees then adjourned to Nov. 3.
