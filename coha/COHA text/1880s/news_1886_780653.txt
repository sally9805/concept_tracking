txt A daring attempt at highway robbery was made last night near Overbrook . About 10:30 o'clock an elderly gentleman , accompanied by a young lady , was driving on the Lancaster Pike , this side of Overbrook , a place which is particularly lonesome , there being woods on both sides of the road . As the carriage neared this spot three men jumped into the road , two of them seized the horses ' bridles , while the third pointed a revolver at the gentleman 's head and demanded his money . Before the occupants of the carriage could recover from their surprise a young man , Alfred C. Sedgwick , of No. 3,714 Filbert-street , crept from behind the carriage , knocked one of the ruffians down , and when the other two released the horses ' heads to see what was the matter with their companion he sprang upon one of the horses and , striking it a sharp blow . succeeded in getting the carriage away from the robbers . Mr. Sedgwick was seen to-day.and said : I was riding up the pike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thinking something was wrong I took my horse up the road and , after tying him came back to watch the men . As soon as the carriage came down I got behind it , and when it was stopped I struck the man who held the revolver in the face , knocking him down , I then jumped on the back of one of the horses , and before the robbers could recover themselves we were down the road . The gentleman offered to give me his pocket book , which , he said , contained some $600 or $700 , but I said that I only did Inv duty , and refusea his offer . After seeing that the occupants of the carriage were out of danger . I went back to where I-had left my horse . but it was gone , and was , no doubt , stolen by the highwaymen . The , horse was the property of a friend of mine .
