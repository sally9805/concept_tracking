txt The colored people of Asbury Park are doing their utmost to bring the projector and . patron of that resort into odium and . contempt . Mr. BRADLEY has had so much to do with the growth of Asbury Park that it would . not be inaccurate to describe it as a proprietary resort . His interests in it and his stake in its prosperity are at all events much larger than those of anybody else . When he forms and expresses the opinion that a particular line of conduct on the part of a particular class of people is injuring the place it must be supposed that this is his opinion as a man of business , and has nothing to do with his personal sentiments toward the class in question . This is a consideration which has been entirely lost sight of by the zealous and . passionate colored orators who have undertaken to fire the colored heart of Asbury Park against its proprietor . It appears that the colored population of the resort in question is very . large . It is not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there to spend money , but of those who go to earn it in various honorable callings , from that of a laundress to that of a head waiter . In order that these people may earn . their livings it is necessary that peo'pie , mostly of the Caucasian race , s141 find . Asbury Park attractive . Mr. BRADLEY , who ought to be a judge , declares that its attractiveness is diminished for these people by the pervasiveness of the colored. race in general , and by the misconduct of some of . its members in particular , not in the kitchens and . laundries , but upon the beach . There are undoubtedly many whites who object to the mere presence even of well behaved and well conducted colored. people , In any considerable number , on a beach to which they go for recreation . There are also many whites who would . object to the presence , in any . considerable number , upon such a beach of the servants from the hotels in which they themselves were guests . When they find . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the colored. servants from their hotels these people resent fthe presence of the colored. servants , either as being colored , or as being servants , or as both . These objectors may be as unreasonable and as prejudiced and as full of the spirit of caste as the colored orators declare them to be . Bid if they , really entertain objections to the society of colored servants , what are the orators going to do about it ? The orators can not persuade them to delight in society which they in fact . dislike , nor to compel them to frequent that society . The prejudiced and tyrannical white , when he finds the beach strewn with happy and innocent colored people diverting themselves , simply betakes himself to fresh fields and . pastures new . The loss does not fall upon the Caucasian criminal himself , but upon Asbury Park , upon its proprietor and its hotel keepers and . its boarding house keepers , and upon their men servants and their maid . servants , who are mostly of the African race . When , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " keep the colored people off Goros beach , " he is in effect maintaining the right of the colored people , in their capacities as human beings and as American citizens , to . prevent themselves from earning wages in their capacities as head waiters and cooks and laundresses and chambermaids and . carpetshakers and whitewashers . The unfortunate Mr. BRADLEY is , in effect , required by the colored orators - to emulate the behavior of that character of DICKENS who blew out his brains in vindication of his great principle that crumpets were wholesome . They call upon him toil , maintain " Gorl 's beach " as a resort for colored people , even though he depopulates it of every paying Caucasian , plunges himself into the abyss of bankruptcy , and dooms his hotels to tumble into a ruinous wreck of olive clapboards and Indian , red shingles . When . the orators recover their mental equipoise they will , we think , consider that it is asking something too much of poor Mr. BRADLEY to convert himself from a man ofv business , engaged in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon securing the use of GOD 'S beach to colored people at all hazards and at his own expense .
