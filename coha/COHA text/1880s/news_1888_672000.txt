txt One of the most beneficent results of a republic.an form of government is the cultivation which it fosters of that sentiment of brotherhood in trouble as well as in prosperity which finds expression in such widespread movement ; as . that now under . way for the relief of the yellow ' fever sufferers in the South . Popular contributions in behalf of stricken communities , or for any strictly charitable purpose , are practically unknown in lands where the people do not govern themselves . In such countries the masses have not that commingling of sympathies and of interest which makes a calamity to one section felt and appreciated in every other section . Such a spontaneous outpouring of money and . commodities as is now being witnessed throughout this broad land to give aid and comfort to the stricken people of the South could be seen in scarcely another country on the face of the globe , and it is  --  a glorious testimony to_the the humanizing influences of a thoroughly humane system of government . It was natural to expect , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , would take the lead in this grand work of humanity , and she is not disappointing this expectation . Already more than $50,000 in money , to make no note of the tons of provisions and . other necessaries which have been contributed , have been sent to Florida from the Mayor 's office , the Produce and Maritime Exchanges , and other bodies which have lent themselves ' to this great scheme of charity And act as forwarders of the people 's bounty . The theatres of the city are ready , as always , to give freely to any cause which appeals to the sympathies of human nature , and the result of their efforts promises to add substantially to the relief fund . DOCKSTADER has already given a benefit performance , which netted a good round sum , and this week the Lyceum , Wallack 's , and . the Casino announce special performances , the entire receipts of which will practically go to the South . Other theatres will be heard from soon , and this branch of the work promises to make a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally balanced . But with all these different agencies at work the supply of money and commodities threatens to fall short of the demand from the afflicted cities . In Jacksonville alone there are 10,000. negroes , who will have to be supported for at least three Months , and this Is but one of the items for which the relief fund . is chargeable . Liberal as the contributions thus far have been , the cry is still for more , and the cry is a legitimate one . Thus far the churches of New-York have made no organized effort to shire in this great work of aiding the sufferers in our own land . It has been suggested that special services be held in every church in this city and Brooklyn on some appropriate Sunday at which contributions for the yellow fever sufferers shall be collected . If due notice of such services were given from the pulpits , say a week in advance , there is no doubt that ' the contributions would realize a large amount . Our churches certainly do not want to occupy a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongly to Christianity as this , and if they do not , it would seem that the time for them to act has come . ?
