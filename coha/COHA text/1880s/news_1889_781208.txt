txt Workingmen in the Dick &; Meyer Company 's sugar refinery , which is situated on North Seventh and North Eighth streets , Brooklyn , E. D. along the river front , had just settled down to their work after their noonday rest yesterday , when they heard the report of as explosion In the big building . It was not very loud , and they did not pay muoh attention to it and kept right on at their work . Superintendent Gustave Prost , who was in charge of the refinery , was coming up stairs at the time , having been out to lunch . He heard the report and in a laughing way remarked to one of the men that a beer keg had evidently burst down in the lunch room , where beer was often brought for the men to help wash down their midday meal . The Superintendent had no more than said the words when an employe named Brown , whose station was on the fifth floor , came jumphog down the Stairs cryiner out that the refinery was on lire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor ablaze . The very air seemed full of tisane . The cry of " fire " was passed from floor to floor in quick order , and while Brown went to turn ou the fire alarm from a box on the ground floor the Superintendent bestowed all his atteution to working tue limited fire apparatus in the refinery . There were several tanks in the building from which pipes ran to the several floors la the refinery , anu by turning a cock the water could ae , pumped through the pipes by the regular engines used In the sugar-making process . This was done at once . but the fire had too good a start , and the men found they were unable to do anything on account or the intense heat . Indeed , they bad little time to escape with their lives , for the flames spread with marvelous rapidity . A new refinery was built two years ago close up to the wails of the old one , and between the two were large apertures covered with doors . Part of these uoors were open , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Laborers on the top floors found that the usual means of getting down by the stairs meant passlua through a fiery furnace as well as groping their way through dense black smoke . They , therefore , were glad to jump through . the uoorways into the new refinery , as it is called , and escape through that way . But even with this means of escape all of tile men at work in and around the refinery did not escape without a touch of the blaze . Two extra alarms were sent out in quick succession , calling nine engines and five trucks to the fire , and before it was under control special calls had summoned three more engines and two more trucks , while the fireboat Seth Low hauled up to the dock and began throwing powerful streams on the water-front side of the refinery buildin ? . From the time tee explosion occurred , at 1:15 , till 6 , the firemen worked hard to get the better or the dames . When they had the lire under sate control nearly one million and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingmen saw ugly-looking ruins where they had been accustomed to work . The refinery occupied a lot about 400 feet long and 200 feet wide . The new refinery where the fire started was about 100 feet by 75 feet in dimensions . It backed up against the old building , so teat practically they were one . These refineries , taken togetheareached through from North Seventh-street to North Eighthstreet . On the Kent-avenue side , adjoining them , were a storage house , a small Office , and a repair or machinery shop . Below , toward the river , the building was divided up into three large filter houses , or rooms , a kiln house on the North Seventh-street side , and in the middle a large boiler and engine room . On the North Seventh-street side the main refinery was 10 stories high and the filter houses a story higher , or 98 feet high . On the South Eighthstreet side the refinery was 9 stories in height . The flames did their work quickly , the timber in the building beingi , dry . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hot , turbulent roll of flame and sent out dark smoke . Shooting up through the new retluertath.e flames were soon peeping through the roof , and sending up red looked tongues of red lire . Blowing through the apertures between the old and new refinery , it soon had the sides of the old building ablaze . To stop it was impossible . The firemen would make brave sallies with lines or hose to pour streams into the interior when the fire was fiercest , but waves of heat would drive them back . Chief Nevins and Assistant Chief Smith , who had charge of their movements , saw that the best they could do was to confine the lire to the refinery and /to save such other portions of the plant as they could . In less than two hours after the fire started sections of the walls began to fall . A great mass fell on the North Seventh-street side and broke in a doorway in the Brooklyn Cooperage Works . One of the engines was nearly buried by the bricks and became useless for active service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bricks , which rained like hailstones about them . The wall on the North Eighth-street side fell later with a great crash , leaving four great chimneys rising up from the ruins . After the fall of the walls the firemen again closed in and bent their energies to save the storehouse . a low two-story building east of the refinery proper . In it were S , 000 barrels of powdered sugar . The heat again proved too much for the firemen , and the interior of the storehouse was burning in a short space of time . Streams of melted sugar ran out through the doorway , anu the black smoke poured out of the top as from gigantic sulokestacke of an immense ocean Wainer . This building was the last to burn . Its contents were entirely ruined , and the interior pretty much burned out . The crowd who had come to see the fire increased in size till Kent-avenue was blocked and a line of people reached back through North Eighth and North Seventh streets to Myrtle-avenue . It took a large force of police under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cause of the fire could not be satisfactorily accounted for by those employed in the refinery . There had never been a fire there of any account before . A year ago a spark in the repair shop created a bit or a blaze , but a bucket of water effectually squelched it . Mr. John N. Meyer , a member of the company , who saw the flames destroying the property in which he had an interest , said that an explosion was an unusual thing in a sugar refinery , and that such a thing had not happened before in his experience . The man Braun who was in the fifth floor at the time of the explosion could not tell just ' when it occurred further than that it was in the room where two mills are used to grind granulated sugar into powdered sugar . The room seemed to blaze up ou all sides just after the explosion , and then the flames spread rapidly through the openings for the belt elevators through which the boneblack is carried up . The lose by the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estimates of those Tame . far with the refinery . The whole plant was estimated as being worth from $2,000,000 to $2,500,000 , and the fire wrought . havoc with the valuable portion . The vast quantity of machinery used in refining sugar , expensive at well as extensive , was rendered practically worthless . The damage to the building is about $300,000 , and that to the machinery is estimated at $800,000 . There were twentyeight horizontal tubular boilers in the boiler room and nearly as many engines , while all through the refinery were the most improved devices and most valuable machinery that Is made . In all , there were about twenty thousand barrels of sugar , either stored or inprocess of making , which is valued at $300,000 . In the storehouse there were 8,000 barrels of tine sneer . and beside a quantity lu process of retiuing , there were several thousand barrels scattared through the building . NVhen the refinery was worked with a full quota of men Its capacity was 1,000,000 pounds of sugar a day , but as two and one-half days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were really 2,500,000 pounds of sugar in process of making in the building . This Summer the refinery has been worked at one-half Its capacity , , and the force or men cut down from 400 to half the number . There wore working yesterday in the day gang 1 ' 20 men , and at night 60 . The firm of Dick &; Meyer began the business of sugar relining in 1873 , and at that time put up the old refinery on North Seventh-street . It was only five stories high at first . Since that time business increased rapidly , and it became necessary to make additions to the plant . Several small additions were made from time to time , but two years ago a great improvement was effected . At that time the Dick &; Moyer Company was incorporated , and assumed the business of the firm . The members of the old firm , Messes . William Dick &; Cord Meyer , became , respectively , President and Vice President of the company , while John N. Meyer and J. henry Dick , eons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At , present , however . Mr. J. Henry Dick is both Secretary and Treasurer . The company are members of the Sugar Trust . They are insured in several companies . Lethbridge and Davies were the brokers who looked . after the insurina of the stock . The amount is not known , but it will go a good way in coverIng the loss . The oilicea of the company are at L 110 Wall-street.
