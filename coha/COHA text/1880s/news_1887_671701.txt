txt It is a promising sign that so much time was given at the National Convention of the Master Plumbers at Chicago and of the Master Painters in this city to considering the best methods of training apprentices . All over the United States the master mechanics are beginning to realize that it is their duty not only to keep up the standard of workmanship but to see that the foreign workmen who do so much of the skilled work of this country do not exclude Amerioan young men from the trades by selfish union rules against their instruction . The patriarchal system of binding a lad to a master who in return for his services was not only to teach him a trade but to receive him into his family has long since disappeared . The master mechanic does not now work with his men and . can not give much attention to his apprentices . There are also few respectable parents who would be willing to place their sons beyond their control , and there are few conscientious employers who would care to incur the responsibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire , however , on the part of the master mechanics to control in some way the labor of the lads they ' receive in their employ still remains ' and this point was kept clearly in view in the discussions at the two conventions referred to . The difficulty of retaining a lad 's services for a specified number of years lies in his unwillingness to work during the latter part of his term at low wages in consideration of past benefits , or even to admit that he has received anything more than he has already paid for by his labor . The attempt to force the young mechanic to work for less than he can get in the open market usually results in his abrupt departure and . perhaps , after repeated experience of this kind , in the master mechanic concluding that the young men of the present day are a shiftless lot . The fault , however , would seem to be not so much with the young men as with a system which seeks to lump the clever with the dull and the handy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five years and then consider that they are skilled - workmen . In such a system the more carefully a lad is trained in the workshop , or , as it is now proposed , in both the workshop and the trade school , the greater the difficulty will be of retaining his services as he approaches manhood . If rules are devised . to keep him , his young brain will find some means to circumvent them . The interest the master mechanics are now taking in this apprentice question is a long step in the right direction . It concerns so deeply the welfare of many thousands of young men that it is important in any scheme to avoid as far as possible anything which may tend to discourage the masters or create a feeling of injustice among the apprentices . It might be possible to find some test of what constitutes a skilled workman besides the number of years passed in learning a trade . The main point would seem to be how much the apprentice knows when old enough to do a full day 's work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
