txt A new copper discovery , which promises to be of the greatest importance , has just been made in the Lake Superior district . The perpendicular combination shaft , which was started In February , 1882 , by the Tamarack Mining Company for the purpose of striking on its property the Calumet conglomerate on its " dip , " has flnallyy reached that famous belt by means of a single drill , hole , and a shaft is but a short distance behind . The total distance sunk to reach the objective point is over 2,260 feet . It is located about 2,800 feet northwest from the surface opening of the rich Calumet and Hecla mine . The dip of the vein of the latter is toward the Tamarack and at an angle of from 38 to 40 degrees . The Calumet and Hecla folks had no thought that any one would conceive the bold idea of attempting to tap their vein so far away , but modern enterprise , which laughs at seeming impossibilities , saw its feasibility . Every year showed the Calumet and Hecia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bold conception of the Tamarack was no more nor less than the sinking of a perpendicular shaft 7 by 20 feet through solid rook , until the rich Calumet and Hecla vein was reached . In July , one year ago , the shaft was down 1,600 feet and descending about 60 feet per month . On the downward course the shaft passed through several veins worth working at some future time . It is claimed by those interested in this mine that the copper rock can be elevated perpendicularly as cheaply as on the incline . At the point of striking this vein the Tamarack 's property only extends a few rods in length , as the shaft is sunk within a few rods of the corner of their land , but the breadth of the vein will rapidly increase as the shaft descends . While the find is no doubt a rich one , yet at the best it is small beside the Calumet and Hecla works , and will in no way cripple the latter , except that it will add to the great mass of copper to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the value of stock to a slight degree . On the other hand , the results of the work of the Tamarack demonstrate the continued richness of the Calumet and Hecla a long way beyond any prospecting yet done by them .
