THE DIARY OF A MAN OF FIFTY*** Transcribed from the 1887 Macmillan and Co. edition by David Price , email ccx074@coventry.ac.uk THE DIARY OF A MAN OF FIFTY by Henry James Florence , April 5th , 1874.  --  They told me I should find Italy greatly changed ; and in seven-and-twenty years there is room for changes . But to me everything is so perfectly the same that I seem to be living my youth over again ; all the forgotten impressions of that enchanting time come back to me . At the moment they were powerful enough ; but they afterwards faded away . What in the world became of them ? Whatever becomes of such things , in the long intervals of consciousness ? Where do they hide themselves away ? in what unvisited cupboards and crannies of our being do they preserve themselves ? They are like the lines of a letter written in sympathetic ink ; hold the letter to the fire for a while and the grateful warmth brings out the invisible words . It is the warmth of this yellow sun of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young romance ; the thing has been lying before me today as a clear , fresh page . There have been moments during the last ten years when I have fell so portentously old , so fagged and finished , that I should have taken as a very bad joke any intimation that this present sense of juvenility was still in store for me . It wo n't last , at any rate ; so I had better make the best of it . But I confess it surprises me . I have led too serious a life ; but that perhaps , after all , preserves one 's youth . At all events , I have travelled too far , I have worked too hard , I have lived in brutal climates and associated with tiresome people . When a man has reached his fifty-second year without being , materially , the worse for wear  --  when he has fair health , a fair fortune , a tidy conscience and a complete exemption from embarrassing relatives  --  I suppose he is bound , in delicacy , to write himself happy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been miserable ; I wo n't go so far as to say that  --  or at least as to write it . But happiness  --  positive happiness  --  would have been something different . I do n't know that it would have been better , by all measurements  --  that it would have left me better off at the present time . But it certainly would have made this difference  --  that I should not have been reduced , in pursuit of pleasant images , to disinter a buried episode of more than a quarter of a century ago . I should have found entertainment more  --  what shall I call it ?  --  more contemporaneous . I should have had a wife and children , and I should not be in the way of making , as the French say , infidelities to the present . Of course it 's a great gain to have had an escape , not to have committed an act of thumping folly ; and I suppose that , whatever serious step one might have taken at twenty-five , after a struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct might appear to be justified by events , there would always remain a certain element of regret ; a certain sense of loss lurking in the sense of gain ; a tendency to wonder , rather wishfully , what might have been . What might have been , in this case , would , without doubt , have been very sad , and what has been has been very cheerful and comfortable ; but there are nevertheless two or three questions I might ask myself . Why , for instance , have I never married  --  why have I never been able to care for any woman as I cared for that one ? Ah , why are the mountains blue and why is the sunshine warm ? Happiness mitigated by impertinent conjectures  --  that 's about my ticket . 6th.  --  I knew it would n't last ; it 's already passing away . But I have spent a delightful day ; I have been strolling all over the place . Everything reminds me of something else , and yet of itself at the same time ; my imagination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point . There is that well-remembered odour of spring in the air , and the flowers , as they used to be , are gathered into great sheaves and stacks , all along the rugged base of the Strozzi Palace . I wandered for an hour in the Boboli Gardens ; we went there several times together . I remember all those days individually ; they seem to me as yesterday . I found the corner where she always chose to sit  --  the bench of sun-warmed marble , in front of the screen of ilex , with that exuberant statue of Pomona just beside it . The place is exactly the same , except that poor Pomona has lost one of her tapering fingers . I sat there for half an hour , and it was strange how near to me she seemed . The place was perfectly empty  --  that is , it was filled with her . I closed my eyes and listened ; I could almost hear the rustle of her dress on the gravel . Why do we make such an ado about death ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinement of life ? She died ten years ago , and yet , as I sat there in the sunny stillness , she was a palpable , audible presence . I went afterwards into the gallery of the palace , and wandered for an hour from room to room . The same great pictures hung in the same places , and the same dark frescoes arched above them . Twice , of old , I went there with her ; she had a great understanding of art . She understood all sorts of things . Before the Madonna of the Chair I stood a long time . The face is not a particle like hers , and yet it reminded me of her . But everything does that . We stood and looked at it together once for half an hour ; I remember perfectly what she said . 8th.  --  Yesterday I felt blue  --  blue and bored ; and when I got up this morning I had half a mind to leave Florence . But I went out into the street , beside the Arno , and looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violet hills , and then decided to remain  --  or rather , I decided nothing . I simply stood gazing at the beauty of Florence , and before I had gazed my fill I was in good-humour again , and it was too late to start for Rome . I strolled along the quay , where something presently happened that rewarded me for staying . I stopped in front of a little jeweller 's shop , where a great many objects in mosaic were exposed in the window ; I stood there for some minutes  --  I do n't know why , for I have no taste for mosaic . In a moment a little girl came and stood beside me  --  a little girl with a frowsy Italian head , carrying a basket . I turned away , but , as I turned , my eyes happened to fall on her basket . It was covered with a napkin , and on the napkin was pinned a piece of paper , inscribed with an address . This address caught my glance  --  there was a name on it I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scribe who had made up in zeal what was lacking in skill . Contessa Salvi-Scarabelli , Via Ghibellina  --  so ran the superscription ; I looked at it for some moments ; it caused me a sudden emotion . Presently the little girl , becoming aware of my attention , glanced up at me , wondering , with a pair of timid brown eyes . " Are you carrying your basket to the Countess Salvi ? " I asked . The child stared at me . " To the Countess Scarabelli . " " Do you know the Countess ? " " Know her ? " murmured the child , with an air of small dismay . " I mean , have you seen her ? " " Yes , I have seen her . " And then , in a moment , with a sudden soft smile  --  " E bella ! " said the little girl . She was beautiful herself as she said it . " Precisely ; and is she fair or dark ? " The child kept gazing at me . " Bionda  --  bionda , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a comparison . " And is she young ? " " She is not young  --  like me . But she is not old like  --  like  --  " " Like me , eh ? And is she married ? " The little girl began to look wise . " I have never seen the Signor Conte . " " And she lives in Via Ghibellina ? " " Sicuro . In a beautiful palace . " I had one more question to ask , and I pointed it with certain copper coins . " Tell me a little  --  is she good ? " The child inspected a moment the contents of her little brown fist . " It 's you who are good , " she answered . " Ah , but the Countess ? " I repeated . My informant lowered her big brown eyes , with an air of conscientious meditation that was inexpressibly quaint . " To me she appears so , " she said at last , looking up . " Ah , then , she must be so , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent . " And having delivered myself of this compliment I walked away and left the little girl counting her soldi . I walked back to the hotel , wondering how I could learn something about the Contessa Salvi-Scarabelli . In the doorway I found the innkeeper , and near him stood a young man whom I immediately perceived to be a compatriot , and with whom , apparently , he had been in conversation . " I wonder whether you can give me a piece of information , " I said to the landlord . " Do you know anything about the Count Salvi-Scarabelli ? " The landlord looked down at his boots , then slowly raised his shoulders , with a melancholy smile . " I have many regrets , dear sir  --  " " You do n't know the name ? " " I know the name , assuredly . But I do n't know the gentleman . " I saw that my question had attracted the attention of the young Englishman , who looked at me with a good deal of earnestness . He was apparently satisfied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak . " The Count Scarabelli is dead , " he said , very gravely . I looked at him a moment ; he was a pleasing young fellow . " And his widow lives , " I observed , " in Via Ghibellina ? " " I daresay that is the name of the street . " He was a handsome young Englishman , but he was also an awkward one ; he wondered who I was and what I wanted , and he did me the honour to perceive that , as regards these points , my appearance was reassuring . But he hesitated , very properly , to talk with a perfect stranger about a lady whom he knew , and he had not the art to conceal his hesitation . I instantly felt it to be singular that though he regarded me as a perfect stranger , I had not the same feeling about him . Whether it was that I had seen him before , or simply that I was struck with his agreeable young face  --  at any rate , I felt myself , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have seen him before I do n't remember the occasion , and neither , apparently , does he ; I suppose it 's only a part of the feeling I have had the last three days about everything . It was this feeling that made me suddenly act as if I had known him a long time . " Do you know the Countess Salvi ? " I asked . He looked at me a little , and then , without resenting the freedom of my question  --  " The Countess Scarabelli , you mean , " he said . " Yes , " I answered ; " she 's the daughter . " " The daughter is a little girl . " " She must be grown up now . She must be  --  let me see  --  close upon thirty . " My young Englishman began to smile . " Of whom are you speaking ? " " I was speaking of the daughter , " I said , understanding his smile . " But I was thinking of the mother . " " Of the mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the most charming woman I have ever known . She was the Countess Salvi  --  she lived in a wonderful old house in Via Ghibellina . " " A wonderful old house ! " my young Englishman repeated . " She had a little girl , " I went on ; " and the little girl was very fair , like her mother ; and the mother and daughter had the same name  --  Bianca . " I stopped and looked at my companion , and he blushed a little . " And Bianca Salvi , " I continued , " was the most charming woman in the world . " He blushed a little more , and I laid my hand on his shoulder . " Do you know why I tell you this ? Because you remind me of what I was when I knew her  --  when I loved her . " My poor young Englishman gazed at me with a sort of embarrassed and fascinated stare , and still I went on . " I say that 's the reason I told you this  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me of my younger self . You need n't resent that  --  I was a charming young fellow . The Countess Salvi thought so . Her daughter thinks the same of you . " Instantly , instinctively , he raised his hand to my arm . " Truly ? " " Ah , you are wonderfully like me ! " I said , laughing . " That was just my state of mind . I wanted tremendously to please her . " He dropped his hand and looked away , smiling , but with an air of ingenuous confusion which quickened my interest in him . " You do n't know what to make of me , " I pursued . " You do n't know why a stranger should suddenly address you in this way and pretend to read your thoughts . Doubtless you think me a little cracked . Perhaps I am eccentric ; but it 's not so bad as that . I have lived about the world a great deal , following my profession , which is that of a soldier . I have been in India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived a good deal alone . That inclines people , I think , to sudden bursts of confidence . A week ago I came into Italy , where I spent six months when I was your age . I came straight to Florence  --  I was eager to see it again , on account of associations . They have been crowding upon me ever so thickly . I have taken the liberty of giving you a hint of them . " The young man inclined himself a little , in silence , as if he had been struck with a sudden respect . He stood and looked away for a moment at the river and the mountains . " It 's very beautiful , " I said . " Oh , it 's enchanting , " he murmured . " That 's the way I used to talk . But that 's nothing to you . " He glanced at me again . " On the contrary , I like to hear . " " Well , then , let us take a walk . If you too are staying at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Arno to the Cascine . There are several things I should like to ask of you . " My young Englishman assented with an air of almost filial confidence , and we strolled for an hour beside the river and through the shady alleys of that lovely wilderness . We had a great deal of talk : it 's not only myself , it 's my whole situation over again . " Are you very fond of Italy ? " I asked . He hesitated a moment . " One ca n't express that . " " Just so ; I could n't express it . I used to try  --  I used to write verses . On the subject of Italy I was very ridiculous . " " So am I ridiculous , " said my companion . " No , my dear boy , " I answered , " we are not ridiculous ; we are two very reasonable , superior people . " " The first time one comes  --  as I have done  --  it 's a revelation . " " Oh , I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduction to beauty . " " And it must be a great pleasure , " said my young friend , " to come back . " " Yes , fortunately the beauty is always here . What form of it , " I asked , " do you prefer ? " My companion looked a little mystified ; and at last he said , " I am very fond of the pictures . " " So was I. And among the pictures , which do you like best ? " " Oh , a great many . " " So did I ; but I had certain favourites . " Again the young man hesitated a little , and then he confessed that the group of painters he preferred , on the whole , to all others , was that of the early Florentines . I was so struck with this that I stopped short . " That was exactly my taste ! " And then I passed my hand into his arm and we went our way again . We sat down on an old stone bench in the Cascine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dust of ages , stood above us and listened to our talk . " The Countess Salvi died ten years ago , " I said . My companion admitted that he had heard her daughter say so . " After I knew her she married again , " I added . " The Count Salvi died before I knew her  --  a couple of years after their marriage . " " Yes , I have heard that . " " And what else have you heard ? " My companion stared at me ; he had evidently heard nothing . " She was a very interesting woman  --  there are a great many things to be said about her . Later , perhaps , I will tell you . Has the daughter the same charm ? " " You forget , " said my young man , smiling , " that I have never seen the mother . " " Very true . I keep confounding . But the daughter  --  how long have you known her ? " " Only since I have been here . A very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment he said nothing . " A month . " " That 's just the answer I should have made . A week , a month  --  it was all the same to me . " " I think it is more than a month , " said the young man . " It 's probably six . How did you make her acquaintance ? " " By a letter  --  an introduction given me by a friend in England . " " The analogy is complete , " I said . " But the friend who gave me my letter to Madame de Salvi died many years ago . He , too , admired her greatly . I do n't know why it never came into my mind that her daughter might be living in Florence . Somehow I took for granted it was all over . I never thought of the little girl ; I never heard what had become of her . I walked past the palace yesterday and saw that it was occupied ; but I took for granted it had changed hands . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought it to her husband as her marriage-portion . " " I hope he appreciated it ! There is a fountain in the court , and there is a charming old garden beyond it . The Countess 's sitting-room looks into that garden . The staircase is of white marble , and there is a medallion by Luca della Robbia set into the wall at the place where it makes a bend . Before you come into the drawing-room you stand a moment in a great vaulted place hung round with faded tapestry , paved with bare tiles , and furnished only with three chairs . In the drawing-room , above the fireplace , is a superb Andrea del Sarto . The furniture is covered with pale sea-green . " My companion listened to all this . " The Andrea del Sarto is there ; it 's magnificent . But the furniture is in pale red . " " Ah , they have changed it , then  --  in twenty-seven years . " " And there 's a portrait of Madame de Salvi , " continued my friend . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " He too was silent . Then he asked , " Why do n't you go and see it ? If you knew the mother so well , why do n't you call upon the daughter ? " " From what you tell me I am afraid . " " What have I told you to make you afraid ? " I looked a little at his ingenuous countenance . " The mother was a very dangerous woman . " The young Englishman began to blush again . " The daughter is not , " he said . " Are you very sure ? " He did n't say he was sure , but he presently inquired in what way the Countess Salvi had been dangerous . " You must not ask me that , " I answered " for after all , I desire to remember only what was good in her . " And as we walked back I begged him to render me the service of mentioning my name to his friend , and of saying that I had known her mother well , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I have seen that poor boy half a dozen times again , and a most amiable young fellow he is . He continues to represent to me , in the most extraordinary manner , my own young identity ; the correspondence is perfect at all points , save that he is a better boy than I. He is evidently acutely interested in his Countess , and leads quite the same life with her that I led with Madame de Salvi . He goes to see her every evening and stays half the night ; these Florentines keep the most extraordinary hours . I remember , towards 3 A.M. , Madame de Salvi used to turn me out .  --  " Come , come , " she would say , " it 's time to go . If you were to stay later people might talk . " I do n't know at what time he comes home , but I suppose his evening seems as short as mine did . Today he brought me a message from his Contessa  --  a very gracious little speech . She remembered often to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me her English friend . All her mother 's friends were dear to her , and she begged I would do her the honour to come and see her . She is always at home of an evening . Poor young Stanmer ( he is of the Devonshire Stanmers  --  a great property ) reported this speech verbatim , and of course it ca n't in the least signify to him that a poor grizzled , battered soldier , old enough to be his father , should come to call upon his inammorata . But I remember how it used to matter to me when other men came ; that 's a point of difference . However , it 's only because I 'm so old . At twenty-five I should n't have been afraid of myself at fifty-two . Camerino was thirty-four  --  and then the others ! She was always at home in the evening , and they all used to come . They were old Florentine names . But she used to let me stay after them all ; she thought an old English name as good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosi as she used to say . I meant to go tonight to Casa Salvi , but I could n't bring myself to the point . I do n't know what I 'm afraid of ; I used to be in a hurry enough to go there once . I suppose I am afraid of the very look of the place  --  of the old rooms , the old walls . I shall go tomorrow night . I am afraid of the very echoes . 10th.  --  She has the most extraordinary resemblance to her mother . When I went in I was tremendously startled ; I stood starting at her . I have just come home ; it is past midnight ; I have been all the evening at Casa Salvi . It is very warm  --  my window is open  --  I can look out on the river gliding past in the starlight . So , of old , when I came home , I used to stand and look out . There are the same cypresses on the opposite hills . Poor young Stanmer was there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I came in . I think I had been talked about , and there was some curiosity . But why should I have been talked about ? They were all youngish men  --  none of them of my time . She is a wonderful likeness of her mother ; I could n't get over it . Beautiful like her mother , and yet with the same faults in her face ; but with her mother 's perfect head and brow and sympathetic , almost pitying , eyes . Her face has just that peculiarity of her mother 's , which , of all human countenances that I have ever known , was the one that passed most quickly and completely from the expression of gaiety to that of repose . Repose in her face always suggested sadness ; and while you were watching it with a kind of awe , and wondering of what tragic secret it was the token , it kindled , on the instant , into a radiant Italian smile . The Countess Scarabelli 's smiles tonight , however , were almost uninterrupted . She greeted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and young Stanmer sat in the corner of the sofa  --  as I used to do  --  and watched her while she talked . She is thin and very fair , and was dressed in light , vaporous black that completes the resemblance . The house , the rooms , are almost absolutely the same ; there may be changes of detail , but they do n't modify the general effect . There are the same precious pictures on the walls of the salon  --  the same great dusky fresco in the concave ceiling . The daughter is not rich , I suppose , any more than the mother . The furniture is worn and faded , and I was admitted by a solitary servant , who carried a twinkling taper before me up the great dark marble staircase . " I have often heard of you , " said the Countess , as I sat down near her ; " my mother often spoke of you . " " Often ? " I answered . " I am surprised at that . " " Why are you surprised ? Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain time  --  very good friends . But I was sure she had forgotten me . " " She never forgot , " said the Countess , looking at me intently and smiling . " She was not like that . " " She was not like most other women in any way , " I declared . " Ah , she was charming , " cried the Countess , rattling open her fan . " I have always been very curious to see you . I have received an impression of you . " " A good one , I hope . " She looked at me , laughing , and not answering this : it was just her mother 's trick . " ' My Englishman , ' she used to call you  --  ' il mio Inglese . ' " " I hope she spoke of me kindly , " I insisted . The Countess , still laughing , gave a little shrug balancing her hand to and fro . " So-so ; I always supposed you had had a quarrel . You do n't mind my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delight in it ; it reminds me of your mother . " " Every one tells me that . But I am not clever like her . You will see for yourself . " " That speech , " I said , " completes the resemblance . She was always pretending she was not clever , and in reality  --  " " In reality she was an angel , eh ? To escape from dangerous comparisons I will admit , then , that I am clever . That will make a difference . But let us talk of you . You are very  --  how shall I say it ?  --  very eccentric . " " Is that what your mother told you ? " " To tell the truth , she spoke of you as a great original . But are n't all Englishmen eccentric ? All except that one ! " and the Countess pointed to poor Stanmer , in his corner of the sofa . " Oh , I know just what he is , " I said . " He 's as quiet as a lamb  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Countess . " Like all the world  --  yes . He is in love with you . " She looked at me with sudden gravity . " I do n't object to your saying that for all the world  --  but I do for him . " " Well , " I went on , " he is peculiar in this : he is rather afraid of you . " Instantly she began to smile ; she turned her face toward Stanmer . He had seen that we were talking about him ; he coloured and got up  --  then came toward us . " I like men who are afraid of nothing , " said our hostess . " I know what you want , " I said to Stanmer . " You want to know what the Signora Contessa says about you . " Stanmer looked straight into her face , very gravely . " I do n't care a straw what she says . " " You are almost a match for the Signora Contessa , " I answered . " She declares she does n't care a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognise the Countess 's style ! " Stanmer exclaimed , turning away . " One would think , " said the Countess , " that you were trying to make a quarrel between us . " I watched him move away to another part of the great saloon ; he stood in front of the Andrea del Sarto , looking up at it . But he was not seeing it ; he was listening to what we might say . I often stood there in just that way . " He ca n't quarrel with you , any more than I could have quarrelled with your mother . " " Ah , but you did . Something painful passed between you . " " Yes , it was painful , but it was not a quarrel . I went away one day and never saw her again . That was all . " The Countess looked at me gravely . " What do you call it when a man does that ? " " It depends upon the case . " " Sometimes , " said the Countess in French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes it 's an act of wisdom . " " And sometimes , " rejoined the Countess , " it 's a mistake . " I shook my head . " For me it was no mistake . " She began to laugh again . " Caro Signore , you 're a great original . What had my poor mother done to you ? " I looked at our young Englishman , who still had his back turned to us and was staring up at the picture . " I will tell you some other time , " I said . " I shall certainly remind you ; I am very curious to know . " Then she opened and shut her fan two or three times , still looking at me . What eyes they have ! " Tell me a little , " she went on , " if I may ask without indiscretion . Are you married ? " " No , Signora Contessa . " " Is n't that at least a mistake ? " " Do I look very unhappy ? " She dropped her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman  --  no ! " " Ah , " said I , laughing , " you are quite as clever as your mother . " " And they tell me that you are a great soldier , " she continued ; " you have lived in India . It was very kind of you , so far away , to have remembered our poor dear Italy . " " One always remembers Italy ; the distance makes no difference . I remembered it well the day I heard of your mother 's death ! " " Ah , that was a sorrow ! " said the Countess . " There 's not a day that I do n't weep for her . But che vuole ? She 's a saint its paradise . " " Sicuro , " I answered ; and I looked some time at the ground . " But tell me about yourself , dear lady , " I asked at last , raising my eyes . " You have also had the sorrow of losing your husband . " " I am a poor widow , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three years of marriage . " I waited for her to remark that the late Count Scarabelli was also a saint in paradise , but I waited in vain . " That was like your distinguished father , " I said . " Yes , he too died young . I ca n't be said to have known him ; I was but of the age of my own little girl . But I weep for him all the more . " Again I was silent for a moment . " It was in India too , " I said presently , " that I heard of your mother 's second marriage . " The Countess raised her eyebrows . " In India , then , one hears of everything ! Did that news please you ? " " Well , since you ask me  --  no . " " I understand that , " said the Countess , looking at her open fan . " I shall not marry again like that . " " That 's what your mother said to me , " I ventured to observe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat and stood looking at me a moment . Then  --  " You should not have gone away ! " she exclaimed . I stayed for another hour ; it is a very pleasant house . Two or three of the men who were sitting there seemed very civil and intelligent ; one of them was a major of engineers , who offered me a profusion of information upon the new organisation of the Italian army . While he talked , however , I was observing our hostess , who was talking with the others ; very little , I noticed , with her young Inglese . She is altogether charming  --  full of frankness and freedom , of that inimitable disinvoltura which in an Englishwoman would be vulgar , and which in her is simply the perfection of apparent spontaneity . But for all her spontaneity she 's as subtle as a needle-point , and knows tremendously well what she is about . If she is not a consummate coquette . . . What had she in her head when she said that I should not have gone away ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left him there at midnight . 12th.  --  I found him today sitting in the church of Santa Croce , into which I wandered to escape from the heat of the sun . In the nave it was cool and dim ; he was staring at the blaze of candles on the great altar , and thinking , I am sure , of his incomparable Countess . I sat down beside him , and after a while , as if to avoid the appearance of eagerness , he asked me how I had enjoyed my visit to Casa Salvi , and what I thought of the padrona . " I think half a dozen things , " I said , " but I can only tell you one now . She 's an enchantress . You shall hear the rest when we have left the church . " " An enchantress ? " repeated Stanmer , looking at me askance . He is a very simple youth , but who am I to blame him ? " A charmer , " I said " a fascinatress ! " He turned away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an actress , " I went on , rather brutally . He gave me another glance . " I think you are telling me all , " he said . " No , no , there is more . " And we sat a long time in silence . At last he proposed that we should go out ; and we passed in the street , where the shadows had begun to stretch themselves . " I do n't know what you mean by her being an actress , " he said , as we turned homeward . " I suppose not . Neither should I have known , if any one had said that to me . " " You are thinking about the mother , " said Stanmer . " Why are you always bringing her in ? " " My dear boy , the analogy is so great it forces itself upon me . " He stopped and stood looking at me with his modest , perplexed young face . I thought he was going to exclaim  --  " The analogy be hanged ! "  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it prove ? " " I ca n't say it proves anything ; but it suggests a great many things . " " Be so good as to mention a few , " he said , as we walked on . " You are not sure of her yourself , " I began . " Never mind that  --  go on with your analogy . " " That 's a part of it . You are very much in love with her . " " That 's a part of it too , I suppose ? " " Yes , as I have told you before . You are in love with her , and yet you ca n't make her out ; that 's just where I was with regard to Madame de Salvi . " " And she too was an enchantress , an actress , an artist , and all the rest of it ? " " She was the most perfect coquette I ever knew , and the most dangerous , because the most finished . " " What you mean , then , is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather think so . " Stanmer walked along for some moments in silence . " Seeing that you suppose me to be a  --  a great admirer of the Countess , " he said at last , " I am rather surprised at the freedom with which you speak of her . " I confessed that I was surprised at it myself . " But it 's on account of the interest I take in you . " " I am immensely obliged to you ! " said the poor boy . " Ah , of course you do n't like it . That is , you like my interest  --  I do n't see how you can help liking that ; but you do n't like my freedom . That 's natural enough ; but , my dear young friend , I want only to help you . If a man had said to me  --  so many years ago  --  what I am saying to you , I should certainly also , at first , have thought him a great brute . But after a little , I should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was helping me . " " You seem to have been very well able to help yourself , " said Stanmer . " You tell me you made your escape . " " Yes , but it was at the cost of infinite perplexity  --  of what I may call keen suffering . I should like to save you all that . " " I can only repeat  --  it is really very kind of you . " " Do n't repeat it too often , or I shall begin to think you do n't mean it . " " Well , " said Stanmer , " I think this , at any rate  --  that you take an extraordinary responsibility in trying to put a man out of conceit of a woman who , as he believes , may make him very happy . " I grasped his arm , and we stopped , going on with our talk like a couple of Florentines . " Do you wish to marry her ? " He looked away , without meeting my eyes . " It 's a great responsibility , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I would have married the mother ! You are exactly in my situation . " " Do n't you think you rather overdo the analogy ? " asked poor Stanmer . " A little more , a little less  --  it does n't matter . I believe you are in my shoes . But of course if you prefer it , I will beg a thousand pardons and leave them to carry you where they will . " He had been looking away , but now he slowly turned his face and met my eyes . " You have gone too far to retreat ; what is it you know about her ? " " About this one  --  nothing . But about the other  --  " " I care nothing about the other ! " " My dear fellow , " I said , " they are mother and daughter  --  they are as like as two of Andrea 's Madonnas . " " If they resemble each other , then , you were simply mistaken in the mother . " I took his arm and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a charge . " Your state of mind brings back my own so completely , " I said presently . " You admire her  --  you adore her , and yet , secretly , you mistrust her . You are enchanted with her personal charm , her grace , her wit , her everything ; and yet in your private heart you are afraid of her . " " Afraid of her ? " " Your mistrust keeps rising to the surface ; you ca n't rid yourself of the suspicion that at the bottom of all things she is hard and cruel , and you would be immensely relieved if some one should persuade you that your suspicion is right . " Stanmer made no direct reply to this ; but before we reached the hotel he said  --  " What did you ever know about the mother ? " " It 's a terrible story , " I answered . He looked at me askance . " What did she do ? " " Come to my rooms this evening and I will tell you . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way I should have acted ! 14th.  --  I went again , last evening , to Casa Salvi , where I found the same little circle , with the addition of a couple of ladies . Stanmer was there , trying hard to talk to one of them , but making , I am sure , a very poor business of it . The Countess  --  well , the Countess was admirable . She greeted me like a friend of ten years , toward whom familiarity should not have engendered a want of ceremony ; she made me sit near her , and she asked me a dozen questions about my health and my occupations . " I live in the past , " I said . " I go into the galleries , into the old palaces and the churches . Today I spent an hour in Michael Angelo 's chapel at San Loreozo . " " Ah yes , that 's the past , " said the Countess . " Those things are very old . " " Twenty-seven years old , " I answered . " Twenty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " I went to a great many of those places with your mother . " " Ah , the pictures are beautiful , " murmured the Countess , glancing at Stanmer . " Have you lately looked at any of them ? " I asked . " Have you gone to the galleries with him ? " She hesitated a moment , smiling . " It seems to me that your question is a little impertinent . But I think you are like that . " " A little impertinent ? Never . As I say , your mother did me the honour , more than once , to accompany me to the Uffizzi . " " My mother must have been very kind to you . " " So it seemed to me at the time . " " At the time only ? " " Well , if you prefer , so it seems to me now . " " Eh , " said the Countess , " she made sacrifices . " " To what , cara Signora ? She was perfectly free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet contracted her second marriage . " " If she was intending to marry again , it was all the more reason she should have been careful . " I looked at her a moment ; she met my eyes gravely , over the top of her fan . " Are you very careful ? " I said . She dropped her fan with a certain violence . " Ah , yes , you are impertinent ! " " Ah no , " I said . " Remember that I am old enough to be your father ; that I knew you when you were three years old . I may surely ask such questions . But you are right ; one must do your mother justice . She was certainly thinking of her second marriage . " " You have not forgiven her that ! " said the Countess , very gravely . " Have you ? " I asked , more lightly . " I do n't judge my mother . That is a mortal sin . My stepfather was very kind to me . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a great many times  --  your mother already received him . " My hostess sat with lowered eyes , saying nothing ; but she presently looked up . " She was very unhappy with my father . " " That I can easily believe . And your stepfather  --  is he still living ? " " He died  --  before my mother . " " Did he fight any more duels ? " " He was killed in a duel , " said the Countess , discreetly . It seems almost monstrous , especially as I can give no reason for it  --  but this announcement , instead of shocking me , caused me to feel a strange exhilaration . Most assuredly , after all these years , I bear the poor man no resentment . Of course I controlled my manner , and simply remarked to the Countess that as his fault had been so was his punishment . I think , however , that the feeling of which I speak was at the bottom of my saying to her that I hoped that , unlike her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If it was not , " she said , " I have forgotten it now . "  --  I wonder if the late Count Scarabelli was also killed in a duel , and if his adversary . . . Is it on the books that his adversary , as well , shall perish by the pistol ? Which of those gentlemen is he , I wonder ? Is it reserved for poor little Stanmer to put a bullet into him ? No ; poor little Stanmer , I trust , will do as I did . And yet , unfortunately for him , that woman is consummately plausible . She was wonderfully nice last evening ; she was really irresistible . Such frankness and freedom , and yet something so soft and womanly ; such graceful gaiety , so much of the brightness , without any of the stiffness , of good breeding , and over it all something so picturesquely simple and southern . She is a perfect Italian . But she comes honestly by it . After the talk I have just jotted down she changed her place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stanmer indeed said very little ; partly , I suppose , because he is shy of talking a foreign tongue . Was I like that  --  was I so constantly silent ? I suspect I was when I was perplexed , and Heaven knows that very often my perplexity was extreme . Before I went away I had a few more words tete- a-tete with the Countess . " I hope you are not leaving Florence yet , " she said ; " you will stay a while longer ? " I answered that I came only for a week , and that my week was over . " I stay on from day to day , I am so much interested . " " Eh , it 's the beautiful moment . I 'm glad our city pleases you ! " " Florence pleases me  --  and I take a paternal interest to our young friend , " I added , glancing at Stanmer . " I have become very fond of him . " " Bel tipo inglese , " said my hostess . " And he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She stood there resting her smile and her clear , expressive eyes upon me . " I do n't like to praise him too much , " I rejoined , " lest I should appear to praise myself ; he reminds me so much of what I was at his age . If your beautiful mother were to come to life for an hour she would see the resemblance . " She gave me a little amused stare . " And yet you do n't look at all like him ! " " Ah , you did n't know me when I was twenty-five . I was very handsome ! And , moreover , it is n't that , it 's the mental resemblance . I was ingenuous , candid , trusting , like him . " " Trusting ? I remember my mother once telling me that you were the most suspicious and jealous of men ! " " I fell into a suspicious mood , but I was , fundamentally , not in the least addicted to thinking evil . I could n't easily imagine any harm of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanmer is in a suspicions mood ? " " Well , I mean that his situation is the same as mine . " The Countess gave me one of her serious looks . " Come , " she said , " what was it  --  this famous situation of yours ? I have heard you mention it before . " " Your mother might have told you , since she occasionally did me the honour to speak of me . " " All my mother ever told me was that you were  --  a sad puzzle to her . " At this , of course , I laughed out  --  I laugh still as I write it . " Well , then , that was my situation  --  I was a sad puzzle to a very clever woman . " " And you mean , therefore , that I am a puzzle to poor Mr. Stanmer ? " " He is racking his brains to make you out . Remember it was you who said he was intelligent . " She looked round at him , and as fortune would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion . He was lounging back in his chair with an air of indolence rather too marked for a drawing-room , and staring at the ceiling with the expression of a man who has just been asked a conundrum . Madame Scarabelli seemed struck with his attitude . " Do n't you see , " I said , " he ca n't read the riddle ? " " You yourself , " she answered , " said he was incapable of thinking evil . I should be sorry to have him think any evil of me . " And she looked straight at me  --  seriously , appealingly  --  with her beautiful candid brow . I inclined myself , smiling , in a manner which might have meant  --  " How could that be possible ? " " I have a great esteem for him , " she went on ; " I want him to think well of me . If I am a puzzle to him , do me a little service . Explain me to him . " " Explain you , dear lady ? " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " She looked deep into my eyes for a moment , and then she turned away . 26th.  --  I have written nothing for a good many days , but meanwhile I have been half a dozen times to Casa Salvi . I have seen a good deal also of my young friend  --  had a good many walks and talks with him . I have proposed to him to come with me to Venice for a fortnight , but he wo n't listen to the idea of leaving Florence . He is very happy in spite of his doubts , and I confess that in the perception of his happiness I have lived over again my own . This is so much the case that when , the other day , he at last made up his mind to ask me to tell him the wrong that Madame de Salvi had done me , I rather checked his curiosity . I told him that if he was bent upon knowing I would satisfy him , but that it seemed a pity , just now , to indulge in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to put me out of conceit of our friend . " " I admit I am inconsistent , but there are various reasons for it . In the first place  --  it 's obvious  --  I am open to the charge of playing a double game . I profess an admiration for the Countess Scarabelli , for I accept her hospitality , and at the same time I attempt to poison your mind ; is n't that the proper expression ? I ca n't exactly make up my mind to that , though my admiration for the Countess and my desire to prevent you from taking a foolish step are equally sincere . And then , in the second place , you seem to me , on the whole , so happy ! One hesitates to destroy an illusion , no matter how pernicious , that is so delightful while it lasts . These are the rare moments of life . To be young and ardent , in the midst of an Italian spring , and to believe in the moral perfection of a beautiful woman  --  what an admirable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the brink and watch you . " " Your real reason is that you feel you have no case against the poor lady , " said Stanmer . " You admire her as much as I do . " " I just admitted that I admired her . I never said she was a vulgar flirt ; her mother was an absolutely scientific one . Heaven knows I admired that ! It 's a nice point , however , how much one is hound in honour not to warn a young friend against a dangerous woman because one also has relations of civility with the lady . " " In such a case , " said Stanmer , " I would break off my relations . " I looked at him , and I think I laughed . " Are you jealous of me , by chance ? " He shook his head emphatically . " Not in the least ; I like to see you there , because your conduct contradicts your words . " " I have always said that the Countess is fascinating . " " Otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak of I would give the lady notice . " " Give her notice ? " " Mention to her that you regard her with suspicion , and that you propose to do your best to rescue a simple-minded youth from her wiles . That would be more loyal . " And he began to laugh again . It is not the first time he has laughed at me ; but I have never minded it , because I have always understood it . " Is that what you recommend me to say to the Countess ? " I asked . " Recommend you ! " he exclaimed , laughing again ; " I recommend nothing . I may be the victim to be rescued , but I am at least not a partner to the conspiracy . Besides , " he added in a moment , " the Countess knows your state of mind . " " Has she told you so ? " Stanmer hesitated . " She has begged me to listen to everything you may say against her . She declares that she has a good conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's an accomplished woman ! " And it is indeed very clever of her to take that tone . Stanmer afterwards assured me explicitly that he has never given her a hint of the liberties I have taken in conversation with  --  what shall I call it ?  --  with her moral nature ; she has guessed them for herself . She must hate me intensely , and yet her manner has always been so charming to me ! She is truly an accomplished woman ! May 4th.  --  I have stayed away from Casa Salvi for a week , but I have lingered on in Florence , under a mixture of impulses . I have had it on my conscience not to go near the Countess again  --  and yet from the moment she is aware of the way I feel about her , it is open war . There need be no scruples on either side . She is as free to use every possible art to entangle poor Stanmer more closely as I am to clip her fine-spun meshes . Under the circumstances , however , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her meshes , why , after all , should I clip them ? It would really be very interesting to see Stanmer swallowed up . I should like to see how he would agree with her after she had devoured him  --  ( to what vulgar imagery , by the way , does curiosity reduce a man ! ) Let him finish the story in his own way , as I finished it in mine . It is the same story ; but why , a quarter of a century later , should it have the same denoument ? Let him make his own denoument. 5th.  --  Hang it , however , I do n't want the poor boy to be miserable . 6th.  --  Ah , but did my denoument then prove such a happy one ? 7th.  --  He came to my room late last night ; he was much excited . " What was it she did to you ? " he asked . I answered him first with another question . " Have you quarrelled with the Countess ? " But he only repeated his own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sit down and I 'll tell you . " And he sat there beside the candle , staring at me . " There was a man always there  --  Count Camerino . " " The man she married ? " " The man she married . I was very much in love with her , and yet I did n't trust her . I was sure that she lied ; I believed that she could be cruel . Nevertheless , at moments , she had a charm which made it pure pedantry to be conscious of her faults ; and while these moments lasted I would have done anything for her . Unfortunately they did n't last long . But you know what I mean ; am I not describing the Scarabelli ? " " The Countess Scarabelli never lied ! " cried Stanmer . " That 's just what I would have said to any one who should have made the insinutation ! But I suppose you are not asking me the question you put to me just now from dispassionate curiosity . " " A man may want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't help laughing out . " This , at any rate , is my story . Camerino was always there ; he was a sort of fixture in the house . If I had moments of dislike for the divine Bianca , I had no moments of liking for him . And yet he was a very agreeable fellow , very civil , very intelligent , not in the least disposed to make a quarrel with me . The trouble , of course , was simply that I was jealous of him . I do n't know , however , on what ground I could have quarrelled with him , for I had no definite rights . I ca n't say what I expected  --  I ca n't say what , as the matter stood , I was prepared to do . With my name and my prospects , I might perfectly have offered her my hand . I am not sure that she would have accepted it  --  I am by no means clear that she wanted that . But she wanted , wanted keenly , to attach me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should have been capable of giving up everything  --  England , my career , my family  --  simply to devote myself to her , to live near her and see her every day . " " Why did n't you do it , then ? " asked Stanmer . " Why do n't you ? " " To be a proper rejoinder to my question , " he said , rather neatly , " yours should be asked twenty-five years hence . " " It remains perfectly true that at a given moment I was capable of doing as I say . That was what she wanted  --  a rich , susceptible , credulous , convenient young Englishman established near her en permanence . And yet , " I added , " I must do her complete justice . I honestly believe she was fond of me . " At this Stanmer got up and walked to the window ; he stood looking out a moment , and then he turned round . " You know she was older than I , " I went on . " Madame Scarabelli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her mother asked me in an angry tone why I disliked Camerino ; for I had been at no pains to conceal my feeling about him , and something had just happened to bring it out . ' I dislike him , ' I said , ' because you like him so much . ' ' I assure you I do n't like him , ' she answered . ' He has all the appearance of being your lover , ' I retorted . It was a brutal speech , certainly , but any other man in my place would have made it . She took it very strangely ; she turned pale , but she was not indignant . ' How can he be my lover after what he has done ? ' she asked . ' What has he done ? ' She hesitated a good while , then she said : ' He killed my husband . ' ' Good heavens ! ' I cried , ' and you receive him ! ' Do you know what she said ? She said , ' Che voule ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No ; she went on to say that Camerino had killed Count Salvi in a duel , and she admitted that her husband 's jealousy had been the occasion of it . The Count , it appeared , was a monster of jealousy  --  he had led her a dreadful life . He himself , meanwhile , had been anything but irreproachable ; he had done a mortal injury to a man of whom he pretended to be a friend , and this affair had become notorious . The gentleman in question had demanded satisfaction for his outraged honour ; but for some reason or other ( the Countess , to do her justice , did not tell me that her husband was a coward ) , he had not as yet obtained it . The duel with Camerino had come on first ; in an access of jealous fury the Count had struck Camerino in the face ; and this outrage , I know not how justly , was deemed expiable before the other . By an extraordinary arrangement ( the Italians have certainly no sense of fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's second . The duel was fought with swords , and the Count received a wound of which , though at first it was not expected to be fatal , he died on the following day . The matter was hushed up as much as possible for the sake of the Countess 's good name , and so successfully that it was presently observed that , among the public , the other gentleman had the credit of having put his blade through M. de Salvi . This gentleman took a fancy not to contradict the impression , and it was allowed to subsist . So long as he consented , it was of course in Camerino 's interest not to contradict it , as it left him much more free to keep up his intimacy with the Countess . " Stanmer had listened to all this with extreme attention . " Why did n't she contradict it ? " I shrugged my shoulders . " I am bound to believe it was for the same reason . I was horrified , at any rate , by the whole story . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in continuing to see the man by whose hand her husband had fallen . " " The husband had been a great brute , and it was not known , " said Stanmer . " Its not being known made no difference . And as for Salvi having been a brute , that is but a way of saying that his wife , and the man whom his wife subsequently married , did n't like him . " Stanmer hooked extremely meditative ; his eyes were fixed on mine . " Yes , that marriage is hard to get over . It was not becoming . " " Ah , " said I , " what a long breath I drew when I heard of it ! I remember the place and the hour . It was at a hill-station in India , seven years after I had left Florence . The post brought me some English papers , and in one of them was a letter from Italy , with a lot of so-called ' fashionable intelligence . ' There , among various scandals in high life , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , famous for some years as the presiding genius of the most agreeable seen in Florence , was about to bestow her hand upon Count Camerino , a distinguished Bolognese . Ah , my dear boy , it was a tremendous escape ! I had been ready to marry the woman who was capable of that ! But my instinct had warned me , and I had trusted my instinct . " " ' Instinct 's everything , ' as Falstaff says ! " And Stanmer began to laugh . " Did you tell Madame de Salvi that your instinct was against her ? " " No ; I told her that she frightened me , shocked me , horrified me . " " That 's about the same thing . And what did she say ? " " She asked me what I would have ? I called her friendship with Camerino a scandal , and she answered that her husband had been a brute . Besides , no one knew it ; therefore it was no scandal . Just your argument ! I retorted that this was odious reasoning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a passionate argument , and I declared I would never see her again . In the heat of my displeasure I left Florence , and I kept my vow . I never saw her again . " " You could n't have been much in love with her , " said Stanmer . " I was not  --  three months after . " " If you had been you would have come back  --  three days after . " " So doubtless it seems to you . All I can say is that it was the great effort of my life . Being a military man , I have had on various occasions to face time enemy . But it was not then I needed my resolution ; it was when I left Florence in a post-chaise . " Stanmer turned about the room two or three times , and then he said : " I do n't understand ! I do n't understand why she should have told you that Camerino had killed her husband . It could only damage her . " " She was afraid it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover . She wished to say the thing that would most effectually persuade me that he was not her lover  --  that he could never be . And then she wished to get the credit of being very frank . " " Good heavens , how you must have analysed her ! " cried my companion , staring . " There is nothing so analytic as disillusionment . But there it is . She married Camerino . " " Yes , I do n't lime that , " said Stanmer . He was silent a while , and then he added  --  " Perhaps she would n't have done so if you had remained . " He has a little innocent way ! " Very likely she would have dispensed with the ceremony , " I answered , drily . " Upon my word , " he said , " you have analysed her ! " " You ought to be grateful to me . I have done for you what you seem unable to do for yourself . " " I do n't see any Camerino in my case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can find one for you . " " Thank you , " he cried ; " I 'll take care of that myself ! " And he went away  --  satisfied , I hope . 10th.  --  He 's an obstinate little wretch ; it irritates me to see him sticking to it . Perhaps he is looking for his Camerino . I shall leave him , at any rate , to his fate ; it is growing insupportably hot . 11th.  --  I went this evening to bid farewell to the Scarabelli . There was no one there ; she was alone in her great dusky drawing-room , which was lighted only by a couple of candles , with the immense windows open over the garden . She was dressed in white ; she was deucedly pretty . She asked me , of course , why I had been so long without coming . " I think you say that only for form , " I answered . " I imagine you know . " " Che ! what have I done ? " " Nothing at all . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a while . " I think you are a little crazy . " " Ah no , I am only too sane . I have too much reason rather than too little . " " You have , at any rate , what we call a fixed idea . " " There is no harm in that so long as it 's a good one . " " But yours is abominable ! " she exclaimed , with a laugh . " Of course you ca n't like me or my ideas . All things considered , you have treated me with wonderful kindness , and I thank you and kiss your hands . I leave Florence tomorrow . " " I wo n't say I 'm sorry ! " she said , laughing again . " But I am very glad to have seen you . I always wondered about you . You are a curiosity . " " Yes , you must find me so . A man who can resist your charms ! The fact is , I ca n't . This evening you are enchanting ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you . " She gave no heed to this ; she turned away . But in a moment she came back , and stood looking at me , and her beautiful solemn eyes seemed to shine in the dimness of the room . " How could you treat my mother so ? " she asked . " Treat her so ? " " How could you desert the most charming woman in the world ? " " It was not a case of desertion ; and if it had been it seems to me she was consoled . " At this moment there was the sound of a step in the ante-chamber , and I saw that the Countess perceived it to be Stanmer 's . " That would n't have happened , " she murmured . " My poor mother needed a protector . " Stanmer came in , interrupting our talk , and looking at me , I thought , with a little air of bravado . He must think me indeed a tiresome , meddlesome bore ; and upon my word , turning it all over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's five-and-twenty  --  and yet I must add , it does irritate me  --  the way he sticks ! He was followed in a moment by two or three of the regular Italians , and I made my visit short . " Good-bye , Countess , " I said ; and she gave me her hand in silence . " Do you need a protector ? " I added , softly . She looked at me from head to foot , and then , almost angrily  --  " Yes , Signore . " But , to deprecate her anger , I kept her hand an instant , and then bent my venerable head and kissed it . I think I appeased her . BOLOGNA , 14th.  --  I left Florence on the 11th , and have been here these three days . Delightful old Italian town  --  but it lacks the charm of my Florentine secret . I wrote that last entry five days ago , late at night , after coming back from Casa Salsi . I afterwards fell asleep in my chair ; the night was half over when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stood a long time at the window , looking out at the river . It was a warm , still night , and the first faint streaks of sunrise were in the sky . Presently I heard a slow footstep beneath my window , and looking down , made out by the aid of a street lamp that Stanmer was but just coming home . I called to him to come to my rooms , and , after an interval , he made his appearance . " I want to bid you good-bye , " I said ; " I shall depart in the morning . Do n't go to the trouble of saying you are sorry . Of course you are not ; I must have bullied you immensely . " He made no attempt to say he was sorry , but he said he was very glad to have made my acquaintance . " Your conversation , " he said , with his little innocent air , " has been very suggestive . " " Have you found Camerino ? " I asked , smiling . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " some day when you find that you have made a great mistake , remember I told you so . " He looked for a minute as if he were trying to anticipate that day by the exercise of his reason . " Has it ever occurred to you that you may have made a great mistake ? " " Oh yes ; everything occurs to one sooner or later . " That 's what I said to him ; but I did n't say that the question , pointed by his candid young countenance , had , for the moment , a greater force than it had ever had before . And then he asked me whether , as things had turned out , I myself had been so especially happy . PARIS , December 17th.  --  A note from young Stanmer , whom I saw in Florence  --  a remarkable little note , dated Rome , and worth transcribing . " My dear General  --  I have it at heart to tell you that I was married a week ago to the Countess Salvi-Scarabelli . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month after that it was all very clear . Things that involve a risk are like the Christian faith ; they must be seen from the inside .  --  Yours ever , E. S. " P. S.  --  A fig for analogies unless you can find an analogy for my happiness ! " His happiness makes him very clever . I hope it will last  --  I mean his cleverness , not his happiness . LONDON , April 19th , 1877.  --  Last night , at Lady H  --  - 's , I met Edmund Stanmer , who married Bianca Salvi 's daughter . I heard the other day that they had come to England . A handsome young fellow , with a fresh contented face . He reminded me of Florence , which I did n't pretend to forget ; but it was rather awkward , for I remember I used to disparage that woman to him . I had a complete theory about her . But he did n't seem at all stiff ; on the contrary , he appeared to enjoy our encounter . I asked him if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh yes , she 's in one of the other rooms . Come and make her acquaintance ; I want you to know her . " " You forget that I do know her . " " Oh no , you do n't ; you never did . " And he gave a little significant laugh . I did n't feel like facing the ci-devant Scarabelli at that moment ; so I said that I was leaving the house , but that I would do myself the honour of calling upon his wife . We talked for a minute of something else , and then , suddenly breaking off and looking at me , he laid his hand on my arm . I must do him the justice to say that he looks felicitous . " Depend upon it you were wrong ! " he said . " My dear young friend , " I answered , " imagine the alacrity with which I concede it . " Something else again was spoken of , but in an instant he repeated his movement . " Depend upon it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has forgiven me , " I said , " and in that case you ought to bear no grudge . As I have had the honour to say , I will call upon her immediately . " " I was not alluding to my wife , " he answered . " I was thinking of your own story . " " My own story ? " " So many years ago . Was it not rather a mistake ? " I looked at him a moment ; he 's positively rosy . " That 's not a question to solve in a London crush . " And I turned away . 22d.  --  I have n't yet called on the ci-devant ; I am afraid of finding her at home . And that boy 's words have been thrumming in my ears  --  " Depend upon it you were wrong . Was n't it rather a mistake ? " Was I wrong  --  was it a mistake ? Was I too cautions  --  too suspicious  --  too logical ? Was it really a protector she needed  --  a man who might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefit to believe in her , and was her fault only that I had forsaken her ? Was the poor woman very unhappy ? God forgive me , how the questions come crowding in ! If I marred her happiness , I certainly did n't make my own . And I might have made it  --  eh ? That 's a charming discovery for a man of my age ! ***
