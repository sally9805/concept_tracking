txt Capt . Eads and his counsel have been heard by a sub-committee of the Senate Committee on Railroads in support of the bill which gives a subsidy to the proposed ship railway across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec . E. J. Reed , a well-known engineer , of England , is in the city , and it is said that he will appear before the Congressional committee in support of this bill . Capt . Eads says he is very confident that his bill will become a law . The question is , he says , whether the railway will be built under American auspices or by British capital . He asserts that he received assurances while in Europe that the required sum of money could be raised in 60 days by a combination of English shipowners if he should decide to come to them for aid . He told them , he says , that he would not come to them unless the United States Government should refuse to assist him . He presents , therefore , to the United States Congress an alternative , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guarantee the interest at 6 per cent . for 15 years upon a capital stock of $50,000,000 , you will run the risk of surrendering the control of the ISthnnis of Tehuantepec into British hands . " His concession authorizes him to secure the aid of any foreign Government . It is urged by the supporters of the bill that not only British capitalists but the Government of Great Britain will give this aid if the United States declines to do so . It is also said that it Capt . Eads should succeed in forming a company of American capitalists , British capitalists would buy them out if the United States Government should refuse to guarantee what he asks . The assertion is made that the terms of the concession are such as to allow British owners . of the railway to pass British vessels at low rates and discriminate against the vessels of other countries . In short , Capt . Eads seems to occupy the position , not of a man who asks a favor , but of one who demands assist . ance and presents a disagreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . They say that the new railway line from California to New-Orleans will be able to make its rates so low that British freight vessels in the grain trade around Cape Horn will go out of the business , and that after these vessels have been driven away the railway company will make its rates so high that the grain-growers of the Pacific slope will be at the mercy of a monopoly . On the other hand , they declare that the construction of the ship railway will open a competing line which will prevent the Southern and Texas Pacific Roads from oppressing the producers . This argument leads Capt . Eads to believe that be will have the support of American farmers . He is on hand at the beginning of the session of Congress , prepared to spare no effort in the attempt to accomplish his purpose . Thus far , his sanguine expectations do not seem to be warranted by the sentiment of the body from which he must secure his subsidy , if he secures it at all , on this side of the ocean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
