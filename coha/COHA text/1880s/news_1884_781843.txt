txt It will , perhaps , be necessary to inquire whether N. L. Dins , who slew Capt . NUTT , of Uniontown , Penn. , and who was in turn slain by Capt . NUTT 'S son , has left any heir to his share of the vendetta before we can safely say that the acquittal of young NUTT concludes a dark and dismal tragedy . Dubs claimed to have dishonored the NUTT family . He flaunted his wickedness in the face of Capt . NUTT , and in an angry altercation killed that gentleman . There were no immediate witnesses of the killing , and no living man knows what steps led up to the homicide . There was strong presumptive evidence that DuKEs , who by his own showing , was already covered with dishonor , was the aggressor in the fight that ended with the death of the elder NUTT . To the amazement of all candid men , DuitEs was acquitted of any crime , and , in defiance of public opinion and decency , went out of court a free man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUKES sought safety in concealment for a time . He was hanged in effigy , and every man whose sympathies were with him was an object of popular scorn and hatred . For a time , it seemed as if DUKES wore the brand of CAIN , and that his life was in danger everywhere . When it was noised abroad that Capt . NUTT , who , in attempting to defend his daughter 's ' good name , had been shot down , had left behind him a son , it was probably felt that the double crime of DUKES would be expiated in blood . All this came to pass . Young Nurr , when DUKES finally reappeared , defiant and strong in his legal acquittal by the jury , lay in wait for the slayer of his father and the destroyer of his family 's peace and honor and slew him . NUTT , placed on trial as DuKEs had been , has been acquitted of murder . Why the jury in the case of DUKES cleared him is yet a mystery . Popular sympathy was all against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insure a verdict of " not guilty , " and , as we have seen , the result of the trial was hailed with indignation and surprise . But , in the case of young NUTT , it must be admitted that popular sympathy was so clearly on the side of the prisoner at the bar that his conviction would have been greeted with a burst of wrath not unlike that which was provoked by the acquittal of . DUKES . Young NUTT was recognized as the champion and defender of the assailed honor of his family . It is unlikely that any jury made up of average American citizens ? husbands , brothers , fathers  --  would have convicted young Nun ' of any crime . A shrewd lawyer , defending a man accused of murder committed under great provocation , will advance some specious plea by which each juror may justify to . himself a verdict of " not guilty . " Where public opinion , represented in the average jury , would be , satisfied by the clearance Of the accused , even the flimsiest pretext will suffice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason was temporarily upset by the sorrow and disgrace brought upon his family , and that in a spasm of insanity.he killed the betrayer of his sister and murderer of his father . This was a theory ample enough and strong enough for a willing and sympathetic jury . A slenderer plea would have served the same purpose . But the theory of emotional insanity deceives nobody . Probably not one of the jurors in the case accepted it in good faith . The defendant 's counsel touched the vital point in the matter when he said : " Never since the reign of CHARLES I. has the man who took the honor of his family in his hands and avenged it had the bonds of the law laid upon him . " This , and not a plea of mental aberration , is what the jury considered when they resolved to acquit young NUTT . That this is a miscarriage of justice no reasonable man will deny . It is an ingenious evasion of all forms of law . It sanctions the taking into one 's own hands the avenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lofty regard for the sanctity of human life and for the laws of the land , juries - will gladly avail themselves of any excuse to set free homicides whose offenses resemble that of young NUTT .
