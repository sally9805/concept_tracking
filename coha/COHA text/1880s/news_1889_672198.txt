txt The TIMES 'S Cable dispatch from London on the wheat market was telegraphed to this city and created considerable excitement among grain and commission merchants . The fact that the San Francisco market Is higher to-day than any other market in the world makes the condition of affairs still more interesting . While the wheat crop of the Pacific coast cuts an important figure in the markets of the world , there will be no attempt made by local capital to control the market . It can not well be done . This was proved several years ago , when the Nevada Bank people lost over $15,000,000 in the endeavor to control the wheat supply of the world . The Chronicle reporter interviewed a large number of local grain merchants upon the situation . It was generally conceded that the Pacific coast will be an important factor in the markets of the world during the present season . Charles B. Stone of Searles &; Stone said : " All of the markets throughout the world are weak except this one . We are paying nere to-day $1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we chartered ships to England and sold our wheat there . " William Dresbaoh , the veteran grain man , said : " Whether the American market will control that of Europe depends entirely upon the surplus crop of France and England . Row large the crop we will have here remains to be seen . The outlook for the market here is good . would not be surprised to see the English market go higher very soon . There are two important factors in the state of affairs . One is the markets of Chicago and New-York ; and the other what kind of weather there will be in Europe during the harvest months of July and August . " J. M. Gregory , the well-known merchant of California-street , said : " Merchants here anticipated nigher prices in Europe , and are paying higher prices for wheat than in any other market in toe country , and I think chances are that we will pay still higher prices . There is abundant opportunity for the American market to control the wheat supply of the world . The crop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tons . " George W. MoNear said : " The dispatch to TliE TIMES is very interesting . We have overestimated our surplus crop on this coast iu the coming harvest . Exports from the Pacific coast will probably be no greater , and probably not as much as last year . In explaining this statement I would say that last year we had a surplus of 200,000 tons , while this year we have barely enough to supply the local mills . at least until they can use new wheat . Last year we had one-third more tonnage on this coast to carry our wheat away than we nave at the present time . In consequence , if we had a large amount of wheat to spare we could not ship it abroad . Chili and the Argentine Republic will nave no surplus crop this year , and we already have orders on file nerd in ban Francisco for wheat for South American States . " It therefore looks as if England will look to the United States , Russia , and India for her supply . If the Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then it is reasonable to suppose that the United States will control the situation . This coast is large and an important tamer in American supplies . ust now the Eastern States are increasing their consumption , but not their production . We produce no more , but we consume less . "
