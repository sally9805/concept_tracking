txt FROM TRUSTS TO CORPORATIONS . Not long ago there was an attempt to unite all the saltmakers of this country in a kind of Trust , and the promoters of the scheme used for their purpose a corporation chartered under the laws of this State . It was under this charter that competition in the sale of salt was to be suppressed . At the time when that charter was procured the people of the State . through the agency of their Attorney General , were suing a corporation chartered in like manner because it had entered a Trust designed to prevent competition in the manufacture and sale of refined sugar . They had already obtained a judgment in that ease from Judge BARRETT , and were awaiting action upon an appeal . And yet the promoters of the salt combination had been able to procure a charter for the North American Salt Company , and it had been openly admitted in the prospectus of this Company or Trust that the intention of those who had made it was not only to prevent competition in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar Trust in England , to prevent the exportation of salt from England to this country whenever the price fixed by the combination here should be high enough to invite competition from abroad in spite of the tariff . The Cottonseed Oil Trust intends to substitute for its Trust organization a corporation chartered under the laws of New-Jersey , and the prediction is frequently made that the Sugar Trust will seek a corporate charter in this State . Would the people of the State of New-York have granted to the Salt Trust or the North American Salt Company a charter under which it could carry out the purposes named in its prospectus if the question had been laid before them and they had been asked to vote directly upon it ? We do not believe that the promoters of that organization could have procured their charter in that way . Would the people of the State , acting under the same conditions , grant to the managers of the Sugar Trust a charter to continue the Trust as a corporation Would they by direct vote give to the Trustees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business of all the absorbed corporations as it has been carried on since the Trust was formed , while they are suing one of those corporations for going into the Trust that would be covered by such a charter ? We do not think so ; but nevertheless it appears that such charters can lawfully be procured in this State . When a Trust takes on the corporate form it gives up some advantages that attach to the Trust plan . It ceases to be mysterious . It becomes less formidable to independent producers in the same field . These can measure accurately then the force of their great rival . It comes under the law , and must pay taxes and make reports . It is no longer a force striking at competitors out of the dark . Every branch factory of the central organization is revealed . There is no longer a semblance of competition among these factories to deceive the people and the independent manufacturers . There may still be a great aggregation of capital and competition may be suppressed in the same number of plants , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sugar Trust , for example . If it should take on a corporate form with its present capital in certificates retained in shares of stock , could it contend under favorable conditions with CLAUS SPRECKELS and his refinery in Philadelphia ? The property put into the Trust was appraised at about $15,000,000 , but it is capitalized at $50,000,000 . A corporation loaded with so much water would be badly handicapped in a fight with SPRECKELS , whose refinery carries no water but is capitalized at the sum actually expended . If there should be sharp competition between the Cottonseed Oil Trust , a a corporation , with a watered capital of $42,000,000 , and . the Southern Cottonseed Oil Company , with a capital very little in excess of the money actually invested , or with some other company with unwatered capital , the transformed Trust would work at a great disadvantage . The . Whisky Trust is oppressed and weighed down now by the enormous quantities of water in its certificate capital . Carrying more than seventy idle distilleries , it strives in vain to drive two or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dividend of only one-eighth of 1 per cent . a month , or 112 per cent . a year . So long as it was possible for a great Trust to gain important advantages in secret over independent producers in the same field by means of unfair and dishonest bargains with common carriers it was not impossible to declare comfortable dividends on a certificate capital watered three or four for one . But the day of large secret rebates has ' gone by , and now a capital watered three for one is not especially desirable in a Trust , except so far as it may serve the purposes of " insiders " who make their profits by manipulating the market price on the Exchange , or those of other " insiders " who enter the combination in order that they may unload their property upon the public . A capital watered three for one becomes much less desirable when a Trust intends to take on corporate form , but it is then not an easy matter to squeeze the water out with advantage to stockholders . The public may squeeze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of " insiders " who have not parted with their holdings .
