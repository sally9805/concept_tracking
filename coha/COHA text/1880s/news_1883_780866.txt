txt A remarkable story of tiaancial mismanagement and municipal : insolvency is told in a special dispatch to the Times from Altoona . Penn . It is almost impossible to get an Altoona city order cashed , and there is a strong belief among prominent business men that over $100,000 of the city improvement loan has been improperly and illegally issued . The whole loan amounted to 8150.000 . Of this amount $toma has been expended in sewers and other city Itonrovements . By act of April 18 , 1873 , the city was authorized to borrow from time to time a sum of money not exceeding $150,000. in amounts not exceeding $50,000 annually , to be applied to sewers and other permanent improvements , and to issue bonds therefor , redeemable at the pleas . uro of the city after 10 years and payable in 81 years from date , bearing 7 per cent . interest , pap able semi-annually. tinder this act authority it also given to the city to levy a opecial tax not excluding 4 mills on the dollar , to be set apart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest on the bonds and to the purchase of payment of not less than 3 per cent . of the out . standing principal ; after the 1st day of May , an amount equal to the interest on all bonds belonglug to the fund to be applied to the purchase vs Payment of the loan . The interest upon these bonds is payable on the 1st of July and January , and is $10,500 per year . Last July the eity failed to meet the interest on them and suit was brought by E. D. Haines &; Co. , the National Bank of Chester County , and the First National Bank of Chester County . Judgment was obtained and mandamuses were issued against the City Treasurer . About $1,700 has been paid on these mandamuses . Interest for January has also been allowed to go by dofault , and suits have been begun , to he heard at the April term of court , by all the foregoing creel. itors . It Is estimated that there is 9,000 now due for Interest and the costs of suits . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under which they were issued provided that there should not be more than $50,000 borrowed and expended each year , yet the first year about $110,000 of bonds were issued . The money received was spent in some way , but no one has yet been able to ascertain anything about the matter . When It was known that the money had been expended Councils made an effort to find. ; out to whom the excess of bonds was issued , but failed . An investigation was ordered , but as Councils bad not the power to compel the attendance of witnesses nothing was done . The whole loan was expended and illegally issued In less than two years . It now is thought that a fight will be made on the payment of all except the first $50,000 of the loan . The issue of the whole loan force ' upon the city the payment of a larger rate of interest than the annual taxation on the city improvement fund is prepared to meet . The assessed valuation of all taxable property In Altoona is about $2,000,000 . A tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of this amount is not collected . Three per cent . interest on 1 the bonds that the city will redeem after May 1 will be about $4,500 . It will be seen that the improvement tax to pay interest falls behind at the rate of more than $2,500 a year . As the 3 per cent . Interest on the redeemable bonds will be paid out of the tax collected on the 4 mina rate of the total valuation , the city of Altoona , after May 1 , will have $10,500 to raise , as well as $4,500 to redeem in bonds . All this must come out of the permanent improvement tax , ' which amounts to only $8.000 annually . Notwithstanding the fact that so much money has been expended on permanent improvements , Altoona hat fewer permanent Improvements to-day than any city of her size In the State . There is not a street or avenue in the whole city that is paved , and only two of them are partly macadamized . The lead . ing streets have sewers , badly constructed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into them . Every other financial department of the city is as badly demoralized as the permanent Imo provement fund , except the water fund , which it self-supporting .
