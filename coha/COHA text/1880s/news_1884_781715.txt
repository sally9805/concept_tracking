txt Mr. THACHER 'S bill to appoint a commission to investigate tenements and " slums " in New-York appears to be suggested by the commission lately appointed to conduct a like inquiry into the condition of the poor of London . As originally introduced , the bill named as investigators the President and the Chief Sanitary Inspector of the Department of Health , the Superintendent of Buildings , an ex-Health Officer of the Port , and two private philanthropists  --  one theoretical and one practical . To these names were added in the Senate those of the President of the German Taxpayers ' Association and of another citizen , presumably a general philanthropist . This commission would no doubt present an exhaustive essay on the deleterious effects , moral and physical , of the New-York tenement-house , but it may be doubted whether the report of such a. body would provide a practicable basis for legislation , which , of course , is the only justification for an appointment by the Legislature . All possible , improvemerits in the construction of tenement house which can properly be made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department or of the Building Dk : ) artraent . It is now the right and duty of the President of the Board of Health to make such suggestions for amendments to the building law as he deems proper for the protection of the public health , and of the Superintendent of Buildings to make like suggestions with reference to precautions against fire . We fail to see what good purpose can be answered by associating unofficial persons with them for the purpose of carrying the subject out of the province of legislation into that of general benevolence.
