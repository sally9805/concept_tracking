txt Among many articles on the tariff the revenue from which protects effectively no one , costs the Government time and labor , and only hurts the general interests of the country , are works of art . If they are made by Americans , they come in free ; if by foreigners under an American name , they pay nothing . But if a foreigner is the acknowledged maker , they pay 10 per cent . on the cost . Should the article be a copy of an antique sculpture , the tariff is 50 per cent. , while on bronzes and fine chinaware one must pay as high , if not higher . An American artist abroad , who is enjoying the museums and art schools of a foreign country , and exempt from many duties of a citizen in both hemispheres , claims the protection of the laws of the land in which he happens to be  --  such an artist can paint his pictures and send them home without charge from the Government , while his European fellow-workman is met by a demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justly consider , exorbitant . Without mentioning the exasperating incidental expenses which accompany the slow routine of our Custom-house , and frequently amount to as great a sum again as the direct Governmental tax , let us consider the bearings of that tax alone . Italy , in order.to secure some additional public benefit from the outflow of works of art , has hitherto levied a tax of 1 per cent . on exports of this kind . But the increasing trade with the United States , the multiplication of American artists at Venice , Florence , and Rome , and their activity in their profession , have called the attention of at least one representative of the Italian Parliament to the injustice of the position of Italian artists in relation to America . The Hon. UGOBALDO PERUZZI started the discussion last July . This gentleman ought to know something of the matter , since he is connected by marriage with Mr. W. W. STORY , the jurist , sculptor , and poet , who , makes Italy his home . Signor PERUZZI finds that the discrimination the United States exercises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disadvantage as regards American artists living in Italy that steps should be taken by the Italian Government to protect their workmen . It was proposed to levy an export tax of 10 per cent . on all works of art leaving Italy which came from the studio of an American artist as an offset to the 10 per cent . charged by our Government on Italian work imported into the United . States . Even this would not be a full and fair retaliation , because by the complicated ruling of our Treasury all sorts of art products , modern and ancient , are subjected to heavy taxes on one plea or another . Except at the cost of an expensive lawsuit the private citizen who finds himself overcharged and overruled by Custom-house officials has no redress : How much more helpless , then , is the foreign artist who sends his work to our country ? Retaliatory measures on the part of Italy are all very well as a means of calling attention to an injustice . But it is only making two wrongs instead of one ; the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cent . duty on art exports from Italy is false in principle ; our tariff is only more unjust . It is difficult to get at the correct cost of production of those ordinary articles of consumption on which a revenue can be collected with the least worry to the people . . But who is to decide on the value of statues , paintings , antiquities , and brie-D. - brae ? The best experts and ' antiquarians will differ inconceivably for the very good reason that , being articles of intellectual and esthetic value , these vary in value in accordance with the taste of each person . ? A. collector will give : a thousand dollars for a bit of china that another man would throw away . Art-dealers manage by a good deal of hocuspocus to maintain some scale of prices for the paintings of artists who are in the fashion ; but nothing is more fictitious or sooner reversible than the value of works of art . Hence it is impossible for Governments to levy taxes on such things , there being no human possibility that officials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ value . The income to the Government from this source is very little , and the expense of the tax is great . But does the tax protect any one ? If it did ten years ago , it does not now . The Americans abroad who have been training themselves in art are become too numerous and skillful to fear competition with Europeans to the extent of requiring of foreign importations to keep the workmen . here thoroughly alive to what is being done in Europe , so that if they grow slovenly or overweening in conceit , they can be brought . back sharply to a sense of their situation by seeing the better work of Europe snapped up by buyers while their own is neglected for the best of reasons . In Europe Americans work in competition with masters and fellow-pupils of foreign birth . Why should they not do the same at home ? It is not Italy only that makes the mistake which the United States carries to so absurd an extreme . Greece is doing incalculable harm to the world every year , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A peasant who finds a statue in . Greek soil must report it to the Government ; he can not sell it to a foreigner , nor can the foreigner export it as he pleases . The consequence is that when a peasant does find a statue too large to  --  conceal and easily transport he breaks off its head or arms and sells these di.gecta membra on the sly to some foreigner . Cases are known where the inhabitants of a certain village , fearing that the Police was about to make their houses a visit in search of antiques , threw all they had found into the sea . Thus mutilation and absolute loss of art-treasures result from the mistaken efforts of a Government that can not rise superior to money considerations in regard to things which are purely works of art . Of course , it will not do for Americans to throw stones at Greece and Italy when they live in glass houses themselves ; they have their own mistakes to rectify first ; after that they can point out to other nations the loss to themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which accrues from attempts to levy taxes on things whose value is chiefly , if not entirely , aesthetic .
