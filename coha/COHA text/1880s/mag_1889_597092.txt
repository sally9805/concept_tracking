F is to be hoped for the credit of humanity that the old philosopher was in error when he said that we feel a sad gratification even in the distress of our dearest friends . But , be that as it may , it is quite certain that those of our fellow-creatures whose lives have been burdened with sorrow command our respect and excite our interest more than the high and mighty . Belisarius , stricken blind , wandering , a beggar in tattered rags , and asking alms of the people he once led to victory , presents a figure that calls for our deepest sympathy ; while we can not shed tears over a dethroned monarch with a corner lot . By these reflections I am strengthened in the hope that I may not be tiring my reader with the continuous recital of our misfortunes , and that he will not grow as weary of them as we did . If he will but patiently wade a little farther through this " slough of despond , " I promise in the latter part of my narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our disastrous seasons were not exceptions . The country had been in a chronic state of theatrical bankruptcy since the panic of 1837 , and continued in it for many years . Actors often had to turn their hands to something else for a livelihood besides the profession . My father painted signs for a whole summer in Vicksburg , and our leading man manufactured genuine Havana cigars in the same studio . I often acted as " drummer , " and , when business was slow , would sally forth among the wharf boats to solicit orders . It is likely that some of the events I have recorded may not have followed in the order in which I have placed them , but I do not feel that this is of much importance . Accurate statistics , with dates , long rows of figures , and unimportant casts of plays , are somewhat tedious .

Mary 's death reduced our quartet to a trio , and I next found myself in the town of Grand Gulf , in the State of Mississippi , with my mother and sister . XVe were there awaiting the arrival of my half-brother , Charles Burke , who was somewhere in the interior of the State , with a small company of actors , struggling along from town to town . Our letters to him had crossed or miscarried ; so we were obliged to remain there for several weeks until we could hunt him up . There was no telegraph in those days , and postal communication was uncertain . The money had run out , and we were in a straitened condition , when , to our joy , my brother arrived . He burst like a ray of sunshine into the house , and we crowded about the dear fellow , smothering him with tears and kisses . It seems that his company was at Port Gibson , only eight miles away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had started at daylight , walking to Grand Gulf to meet us . After breakfast he went out for the purpose of hiring a wagon and team to take us on . This was soon done , and we started on our journey . We had got but four miles from the town when I observed my brother and the driver in close conversation . I saw that something was wrong . Presently the driver pulled up and the wagon stopped . My brother turned round and said : " Mother , I have made a bargain with this man to take us to Port Gibson for ten dollars . I have no money , and expected to pay him out of to-night 's receipts after the play . He says this arrangement will not do for him ; he seems unwilling to trust me , so he must be paid now or he will turn back .

Her eyes filled with tears , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing left us but to get out of the wagon and remain by the roadside until my brother should go back and make another trial . The rain came down , and we took shelter under a large tree , awaiting his return . My mother had once been one of the most attractive stars in America , the leading prima donna of the country , and now , from no fault of her own , was reduced to the humiliation of being put out of a wagon with her two children , in a lonely road in the far-off State of Mississippi , because she could not pay a wagoner the sum of ten dollars . This was so far the darkest hour we had 1 Copyright , 1889 , by JOSEPH JEFFERSON . All rights reserved . 184 // passed . About noon the sun shone bright , and shortly afterwards my brother appeared in sight , mounted on top of an ox-cart driven by an old negro . We were only four miles from Port Gibson , but it required as many hours to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel . We now entered upon a course of the most l ) rimitive acting , going from town to town and giving entertainments in the dining-rooms of the hotels . As there were no papers published in these small villages , there were no printingoffices , consequently no bills ; so flaming announcements of our arrival in a bold handwriting were displayed in the three important points of the town , viz. : the hotel , the post-office , and the barber-shop . It fell to my duty , being an adept with the brush , to write , or rather paint , these advertisements . The plays were acted in costume , but without scenery or curtain . The nightly receipts were small - just about enough to get us from place to place . Our objective point was the town of Liberty , Mississippi ; but there was some difficulty in getting there , as the distance was greater than we could accomplish in a day . A farmer who had been to the theater the night before for the first time in his life was so struck by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in and take us to his farm-house , about twenty-five miles distant . According to his suggestion we were to rest for a day , give an entertainment in his barn , and so go on to Liberty . " But , " said my brother , " you tell me there is no other house there but your own . What shall we do for an audience ? " " Well , " said the farmer , " all my family will come , to begin with , and there is a dozen or more on em ; then there s eight or ten farm-houses close by , and if one of your men will drive there with ray son and blow the horn they will all come , for there ai n't one on em ever seen a play before . I 11 insure you a full barn . " So the matter was settled , and we actually played in a barn , the house that we staid in being the only one in sight . It seemed in vain to look for an audience in such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the sun had gone down the full harvest moon rose , and by its dim light we could faintly see family groups of people , two and sometimes three on a horse , coming from all directions over the hill - now a wagon with a great load . Some of them walked , but all were quiet and serious , and apparently wondering what they were going to see . Those who have traveled through the Southern States will perhaps remember the kind of barn we acted in : there were two log houses joined together with an opening between them which was floored and covered in . The seats were arranged outside in the open air-benches , VOL . XXXIX. - 27. chairs , and logs . The double barn on each side was used for dressing-rooms and for making entrances and exits , while the opening was devoted to the stage . The open air was well filled , containing an audience of about sixty persons . Our enthusiastic admirer , the farmer , collected the admission fee , a dollar being charged and freely given . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Spectre Bridegroom . " The farmer had supplied us liberally with candles , so that the early part of the entertainment was brilliantly illuminated , but the evening breeze had fanned the lights so fiercely that by the time the farce began the footlights were gone . The little " flaming ministers " had all sputtered out , so " The Spectre Bridegroom " was acted in the moonlight . It was curious to watch the effect of a strong emotional play like The Lady of Lyons upon an audience that had never seen a drama before : they not only were much interested , but they became excited over the trials of the hero and heroine ; they talked freely among themselves , and , at times , to the actors . One old lady insisted that the lovers should be " allowed their own way , " and a stalwart young farmer warned the villain not to interfere again " if he knew what was best for him . " We continued traveling through the State of Mississippi , sometimes in wagons or on a stray stern-wheel steamer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where we had acted . As the spring opened the rainy season set in , and the roads became almost impassable . Fortunately at this time my mother received an offer for us to join the new theater in Galveston , to which place we proceeded , my brother and his wife going North to act under Mr. Burton 's management at the Arch street Theater , Philadelphia . PUDDING STANLEY . AT the termination of our Galveston season the company embarked on board a small stern-wheel steamer that wound its way through a narrow , crooked stream and landed us at the city of Houston . I say the company , but it was only a remnant of it , as most of its members , being weary of the hot weather and despairing of any more regular-salary days , had returned to the North . We acted for several weeks in Houston , but with a feeble kind of patronage that just enabled us to keep our heads above water ; still , the ever-hopeful disposition of the itinerant actor buoyed us up , and we struggled on in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time resolved ourselves into what was called a " sharing scheme , " dividing the profits , when there were any , *z5u rafa // with our salaries . First the board was paid for , then the rent , then the printing , then the orchestra  --  the latter always ready to strike at a bar 's notice ; the rest we shared . These uncertain dividends were looked forward to with much interest , for home was far away and difficult to reach . As the season approached its close and the disbanding of our company was under discussion , a new sensation occurred in the arrival of an old actor and ex-theatrical manager by the name of Stanley . This remnant of an earlier era had been upon the retired list for many years , and now suddenly burst upon us with enticing schemes to better our condition . I had never seen him before , but several of our company knew and recognized him as a veteran barn-stormer of the olden time . He had been living in San Antonio for many years , and having heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old war-horse within him was awakened , and disdaining the dangers of a long journey through the chaparral ,  --  for the country was at this time full of hostile Indians ,  --  he had ridden three hundred miles in the wild enthusiasm of an old manager-actor , thirsting for the revival of three-sheet posters and a high stool opposite that fascinating spot , the pigeon-hole of the box-office . Naturally , in the first flush of his arrival , laden as he was with flattering promises of double salaries and clear third benefits , we were in a delightful flutter of anticipation . His accounts of San Antonio and the surrounding country were dazzling . There had been no dramatic entertainment ever given there , the gold mines of Mexico were close at hand , and , in short , it seemed quite clear that our fortunes would be made if we concluded to embrace his offer . He further informed us that he was well known all through Texas , and that his popularity was second only to that of the late Davy Crockett ; that , under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetically expressed it , he kept a bar-room in conjunction with a fandango , a keno table , and a faro bank-by which means it seems he had endeavored to refine the depraved tastes of the citizens . Mr. Stanley 's figure was portly , so that his friends , in order to distinguish him from the other and less important Stanleys in town , bestowed upon him the title of " Pudding Stanley , " or " Pud , " as he was more briefly and affectionately called . As I have said , we were at first overwhelmed with his amazing description of our future Eldorado , but upon holding council to consider the situation dispassionately our ardor cooled . First came the dreaded journey of three hundred miles through a wilderness of chaparral inhabited only by jack-rabbits and hostile Indians . Our leading actor remarked that he did not mind jack-rabbits , but considered the Indians an impediment . He was a courageous man , too , upon the stage . I had seen him play the Chief Osceola , and scalp one " super " after another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with King Lear that " Nature s above art in that respect , " and while he reveled in being the hero of an artistic assassination , realistic effects of this kind were not to be thought of . Another reason for our not relishing the proposal was contained in the recollection of a really serious matter in connection with actors and Indians that had occurred in Florida during the Seminole war . It seems that a manager by the name of William C. Forbes had taken a theatrical company into the very jaws of the disturbance . The troupe acted at the different forts and garrisons along the line of battle , and on one occasion , while going from one military station to another , without an escort , it was attacked and roughly handled by the savages . Forbes and most of his people escaped , but two unfortunate actors were captured and butchered . The theatrical wardrobe belonging to the company fell into the hands of the Indians , who , dressing themselves up as Romans , Highlanders , and Shaksperean heroes , galloped about in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where Forbes and the more fortunate members of his company had fled for safety . Several of the Indians were afterwards taken , and as they were robed and decked in the habiliments of Othello , Ramlef* and a host of other Shaksperean characters ,  - -  for Forbes was eminently legitimate ,  --  their identity as the murderers was established , and they were hanged in front of the garrison . The recollection of this incident acted as anything but a stimulus to our wavering courage , and we took the liberty of mentioning to the ex-ranger that it was within the bounds of possibility that the warlike Comanches of Texas might have no more respect for the legitimate drama than the Seminoles of Florida , in which case history would inconveniently repeat itself . The tempter ridiculed our fears , looking upon us , I think , with a ranger 's contempt . He said there were a few Indians here and there certainly , but they were cowardly , and generally kept themselves concealed in the chaparral . On being cross-questioned as to why they concealed themselves in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but they are great cowards . " He said the safest plan would be for the entire party to keep together ; going all in one wagon , we would then exhibit " the full strength of the company , " and well armed with such theatrical weapons as we might // possess , there would be no danger . Theatrical weapons - just think of it ! The armory of a theater in those days consisted of two pairs of short broadswords , a half-dozen stuffed sticks , and a rusty flint-lock horse-pistol that always snap* ) ed once and generally txvice before virtue felt itself secure . A cold shiver ran down my back as I imagined myself facing a Comanche with an article whose uncertainty had on more than one occasion compelled the heavy villain to commit suicide with a table-spoon . It is needless to say that I had inwardly resolved not to go , and I think the entire company were of my mind . Of course we laid it all on the leading man , who had at least been bold enough openly to express @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley was of course disappointed , as he had looked forward , he said , not only to the renewal of managerial responsibility and importance , but to donning again the sock and buskin and acting with us . Upon this hint we suggested that if he really desired to act again , and would appear one night in Houston for our benefit , we should be proud to support him . If Ric/zezrd ILL could tempt him - we knew this to be his weak point - it was at his service . Of course at first he pretended to demur , saying that he had no wardrobe , and that it was so long since he had acted that he " really feared . " But he could not conceal an undercurrent of secret delight at the thought of again striding the stage . He consented . He was so well known in Texas that we felt quite sure , in securing his services for a joint benefit to the company , &amp;ur treasury would swell from its present slender dimensions and give us the means of returning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ histories were both interesting , as they covered a period when artistic , commercial , and military matters were curiously mingled . He had acted in the then far West under the management of Alexander Drake both in Louisville and in Cincinnati ; he had then drifted off into Texas , joining the rangers against Santa Anna ; then back again to the Mississippi , where he encountered the celebrated Chapman company , who had ingeniously fitted up a steamboat and converted it into a floating theater . This huge dramatic barge used to ply from one town to another on the Ohio , Mississippi , and Missouri nvers , giving theatrical entertainments at the various points where there were no theaters . The roving spirit again taking possession of him , he left the Chapmans and returned to Texas . The night was arranged for the benefit , and such was the popularity of the volunteer that tickets amounting to the capacity of the theater , and even beyond it , were sold without delay . As I before said , Richard III was his pet part ; and while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that he did not mind privately confessing that in the later scenes he drew his inspiration from the example of Edwin Forrest . Stanley now employed his mornings in walking as majestically ' as his ungainly figure would permit up and down the stage , gesticulating violently and roaring out the soliloquies of Richard ; and his afternoons in accumulating raw cotton , in order that the hump and the bandy-legs of the crook-backed tyrant might be properly deformed and traditionally disfigured . Our volunteer reminded me of an actor I once knew who used to wear upon the stage a red wig so like his own hair that whether he had it on or off there was no perceptible difference in his appearance . So with Stanley : his bandy-legs and round shoulders , even when unadorned , quite harmonized with the accepted idea of Gloucester 's deformity ; but , looking upon himself as an Apollo , our hero had piled such a mountain of cotton on his natural hump that it made " Ossa like a wart . " On the auspicious night the house was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their escorts , seeing that the audience were disposed to be turbulent , took them away , so that the friends and admirers of the star were unchecked in their noisy cat-calls and demonstrations . Law , order , and decorum were set at defiance . The friends of the old ranger had come for a frolic and evidently intended to have it . The placard of " No smoking " was totally disregarded . Pipes and cigars were vigorously puffed , and the house was so filled with smoke that one would have supposed that the battle of Bosworth Field had taken place before the opposing forces met . The weather was sultry , and the general heat , combined with the stifling atmosphere of a crowded house , ran the little box of a theater up to the temperature of an oven in full force . At the rise of the curtain the expectant audience was on tiptoe to greet their comrade . At the wing stood the sweltering Richard , absorbed in his character and embedded in cotton , and as he strode upon the stage the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowing low his acknowledgments he began the famous soliloquy . The performance proceeded quietly for a time , the silence being broken now and then by expressions of approval in complimentary but rather familiar terms . During the love scene with Lady Anize , her ladyship was warned by some one in the audience , who claimed to have an intimate knowledge of Richard 's private domestic affairs , that the tyrant had already two Mexican wives in San // Antonio . Nothing daunted at this public accusation of polygamy , " Pud " pressed his suit with ardor . The retired actor had not forgotten some of the old-fashioned tricks of the art , and would take the stage with tremendous strides from the center to the extreme right or left after making a point , thereby signifying to the audience that if they desired to applaud then was their time . " Off with his head ! so much for Buckingham ! " and away he would go . In one of these flights , being over-stimulated by excitement and applause , he nearly tumbled into the private box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a spermaceti chandelier and set him in a blaze of glory . He glared with indignation at the convulsed audience , being himself entirely innocent of the illumination until the unmistakable odor of burnt feathers warned him that his diadem was in danger . In the death scene , just as Ricluird expired , a voice , signifying that the game was over , shouted " Keno ! " This allusion to " Pud 's " commercial pursuits brought him to life , and as the curtain was descending he sat up and warned the interlocutor that he would " keno " him in the morning . IN MEXICO . THE declaration of war with Mexico caused a great stir in Galveston ; speculations were rife in all quarters as to the probable result from a commercial point of view . Of course no doubt existed as to the ultimate success of our side ; but the question as to how much was to be made out of it seemed to absorb the public mind . Our manager was a thrifty soul , and foresaw the prospect of good financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother was considerably alarmed lest I should be conscripted , and I was not a little uneasy on those grounds myself . In May , 1846 , we embarked on board a condemned Mississippi steamer for Point Isabel . This leaky old boat , crowded with soldiers , gamblers , and a few actors , feebly wended its uncertain way along the coast and arrived at its destination in about four days . Luckily , the sea was as calm as a mill-pond ; for if one of those dreadful cyclones so frequent in the Gulf had overtaken us , many good soldiers , indifferent gamblers , and bad actors would have found their way to the bottom of the sea , and these important reinforcements to General Taylor never would have put in an appearance . Point Isabel , on our arrival , was all bustle and activity . It was a flat , sandy , and uninteresting place , covered with tents and boiling over with military preparations . The battle of Palo Alto was fought on the 8th of May : these were the first guns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of opposing cannon ; it ended at sunset with victory for the American army . The next morning I saw the ambulance bringing in the wounded form of Major Samuel Ringgold , who died soon after . This celebrated hero introduced into this country the flying artillery , to the efficiency of which the success of the day was attributed . The Mexicans had r*treated only a few miles , and , being reinforced , gave battle the next day , and the memorable engagement of Resaca de la Palma was won by the gallant charge of Captain May at the head of his dragoons . Then came the bombardment of Fort Brown , and on the i8th of May the city of Matamoras was occupied by the United States army , with our gallant band of comedians bringing up the rear , elated at our military success . The manager took advantage of the distressed position of the town , and , by permission of the American commandant , occupied the old Spanish theater . Victory had crowned our arms ; so the soldiers , settlers , gamblers , ragtag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an army , like " greedy crows " that hover over the heads of the defeated party , " impatient for their lean inheritance , " were ready for amusement . Here we acted to the most motley group that ever filled a theater . But in the middle of September the trumpet blast sounded in our ears again ; the soldiers were ordered to march on to Monterey . The town was deserted and the theater closed . Our manager , seeing that all further hopes of their return had vanished , disbanded his company , and with all the cash he could collect , including our back salaries , " wandered away , no man knew whither . " Here I was left with my mother and sister , thrown on our own resources , which were very small , in a strange country , and among a people not at all on good terms with us . The only member of the company left besides ourselves was Edward Badger . He was my brother comedian and friend ; his father was the wellknown Alderman Badger of Philadelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a council of war to determine on our future movements . The soldiers had gone , but the gamblers remained ; and the brilliant idea occurred to us , that as we could no longer minister to their intellectual entertainment we might make something by furnishing them with internal comforts . So we boldly resolved to open a coffee and cake stand in their interest . We arranged to place the stand in a bar-room in the central part of Matamoras , the locality offering the best position for our commercial enterprise . The establishment was dignified by the high-sounding title of " The // Grand Spanish Saloon , " and consisted of a long room , with a low ceiling , having a counter , or bar , running the full length on one side , and a row of gaming-tables on the other , where roulette , keno , chuck-a-luck , and faro were industriously pursued with the usual integrity which generally attaches itself to these pastimes . The walls were beautifully whitewashed and the floor was well sprinkled with sand . In front of the bar and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sawdust , these being the cuspidores of the pioneers . From the ceiling were suspended chandeliers made of barrelhoops , tastefully covered with pink , blue , and white paper , cut in different patterns , in which candles were placed to illuminate the cheerful and tragic scenes that alternately occurred in this fascinating but dangerous place . Badger , after convincing the proprietor that the introduction of a stand for cake and hot coffee at one end of the room would not only add to the refinement of his establishment , but increase its custom by providing the patrons with refreshment during their hours of relaxation from business , came to terms with him . We were to furnish everything and give him ten per cent . of our gross receipts for rent , it being verbally understood that if either Badger or myself came to an untimely death at the hands of any of his attach*s the person so offending should be discharged from his service at once . Nothing could be more satisfactory than this arrangement , so I at once set about the decoration of our cafe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mexican woman , said to be an expert in the manufacture of coffee and pies . The construction of our stand was simple and effective ; a large dry-goods box on which two boards were placed so as to reach the barcounter made a permanent and secure foundation for the reception of our viands . The boards were tastefully draped and masked with Turkey-red reaching to the floor . Large sheets of white paper were spread over the top , and on the right , next the counter , stood a large and elaborate tin coffee-urn , and beneath it an alcohol lamp emitting a beautiful blue flame . This monument was surrounded by a dozen old cups and saucers , in which , placed at right angles , gleamed a corresponding number of shining spoons , giving a pure German silver flavor to everything they touched . A fat sugarbowl and an attenuated milk-pitcher completed the coffee service . Four flat pies , two pyramids of sandwiches , a box of cheap cigars tilted up on a brick , and a large plate of homemade Mexican cakes completed the assortment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some large , round , burnt-siennalooking cakes called mandillos . I think they must have been indigenous to the soil of Mex ico , for I rejoice to know that I never saw one anywhere else . They were sparingly sprinkled with dry currants , and glazed on top with some sticky stuff that never dried during the whole summer : if an unlucky fly lit on one of these delicacies his doom was sealed . I have no idea what they tasted like , for I never had the courage to try one ; nor did I ever know a customer who ventured on one for the second time . One gentleman - an epicure from Texas - said that he would not mind giving one a trial if he could be sure which were the currants and which were the flies . This kind of pleasantry we could afford to smile at , but when a ranger remarked on one occasion that any man who would sell such things ought to be shot , we decided - for the sake of our customers - that we would remove this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes were forthwith banished to the top shelf , well out of sight , and utilized as flytraps for the rest of the season . When our arrangements were first completed Badger and I stood with folded arms at the far end of the long room , contemplating the effect with pride and satisfaction . It was now about time for the doors to open . We were quite nervous and excited ; for , in the innocence of our natures , we expected a great rush from the public . Our spirits were somewhat dampened , therefore , to find that no one seemed to know or care anything about us or the new venture in which nearly all of our available cash was invested . As the day wore on , stragglers dropped in one by one ; blear-eyed gamblers , freshly shaved , with shaky hands and gloomy looks , called for their morning cocktail at the bar . Now and then we caught a stray customer : our coffee , clear and strong , was a great success ; and the pies did pretty well , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure . Our point now was to watch the public ; if an article was not in demand we discarded it at once , and offered another in its place . By these tactics , before the week was over , the cash returns were more than satisfactory . My partner and myself conformed to the regular business hours of the establishment : at about three o'clock A. M. the order to close was given and " Vamoose ! " was shouted by the stentorian lungs of the proprietor . The roulette ceased to revolve , the dice were discarded , the faro cloth was rolled up , and our alcohol lamp was extinguished . Those members of . the sporting fraternity who could stand on their feet reeled home ( ? ) , and those who could not were dragged along the sanded floor and deposited on the sidewalk ; the candles were blown out and the doors of " The Grand Spanish Saloon " were closed to the world . Badger and I would trudge to our // room arm in arm , carrying our money in a shot-bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patent " pepper-caster . " The dwelling-houses in Matamoras were generally one story high , built of brick , plastered , and painted yellow ; one door and an ironbarred window in front on the street , and the same at the back , leading to a courtyard which was used in common by the occupants of the house for washing , ironing , cooking , and eating . We occupied one of these . establishments . In the morning little tables , with white cloths , were brought out and set for breakfast in the open air . The different families would sit at them and drink their hot coffee , eat their fruit and bread , smoke their cigarettes , and talk away as gaily as if no war were going on . The courtyards were entered by a large gate , and hired out to passing caravans of muleteers or rancheros , who occupied the middle of the space . Here they also took their meals and sold their fruit , vegetables , chickens , and dry goods of cheap and gaudy-colored stuffs , Mexican blankets , sombreros @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely sight . The little houses surrounding it were all lighted up within , the doors wide open so that we could see the families , men , women , and children , knitting , smoking , dancing , singing , and playing cards - always for money ( everybody gambled in Mexico ) ; and groups of muleteers in the center were seated around their camp-fire , which would blaze and shed its light over the scene . I had a great fondness for this locality , for here I met my first love . Her mother was a full-blooded Mexican , but her father must have been pure Castilian , for the girl was not only beautiful , but her features were aristocratic . She had the prettiest little feet and hands that could be imagined . Her merry black eyes fairly danced and sparkled with brilliancy , and when laughing she would throw her head back in ecstasy , showing two rows of pearly teeth . Metta-that was her namewas as wild and graceful as a deer . I was quite in love with her at first sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guitar and smoke cigarettes I was entirely captured . She had that rich , olive complexion that one sees in a pale Key West cigar , and , like that article , was about half Spanish . Her great delight was to make a full half-dozen of her Mexican sweethearts jealous by flirting with me ; but as she spoke not a word of English , and I was entirely ignorant of Spanish , we could only make eyes and smile at each other . Perhaps this was all for the best , because had it been otherwise , I am afraid that , though I was only eighteen , my mother would have been astonished with a Mexican daughter-in-law before we left the country . Our business affairs were flourishing at the saloon , and but for a strong propensity that my speculative partner had for trying his luck at the side tables now and then , we should have made a small fortune . Of course there was a heavy risk of life and property in such a place , as the frequenters of the " Grand Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paraphrase an old saying , " when the rum was in , the knife was out . " Several times the firm had dodged under the counter to escape contact with a stray bullet , and on one occasion the offending coffee-urn had been fatally shot . I now divided my time between attention to commerce and learning the Spanish language from Metta , but I am afraid it was a case of pleasure before business . She was the most innocent , simple child of nature that I ever saw , and yet , with all her modesty , a perfect miniature coquette . She would jump for joy and clap her little hands together if she only could contrive to make any of her lovers jealous . The scowling brows of one of her native admirers , together with the liberal display of a small arsenal of unconcealed weapons encircling his waist , always gave me a disagreeable turn , and at these times I would insist on Metta 's not lavishing so much public attention on me . I never saw the fellow 's dark eyes glaring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engraving of the Spanish lady on a moonlight night smiling from her window on her favorite lover , and a melodramatic looking rival in the background peering around the corner and grasping a stiletto as big as a handsaw , ready to stab the accepted lover in the back . A noted character on the border line in those days , one Buck Wallace , was a frequenter of this place - a lump of good nature and kindness when unmolested , but if the demon in him was aroused he became a desperate and dangerous man . He was a Philadelphian by birth ; and as that was my native city , Wallace and I struck up a great friendship , though he was full thirty years my senior . He was an interesting felloxv , with a strange mixture of tenderness and ferocity . His life had been an adventurous and romantic one ; as a boy , he had served under Captain James Bowie , after whom the famous bowie-knife is named , and was with Davy Crockett at the fall of the Alamo . After the assassination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Philadelphia , and , as extremes meet , strangely enough married a beautiful young Quakeress . He now resolved to settle down and lead a steady life , but the City of Brotherly Love was a trifle too peaceful for his belligerent nature ; so , taking his young wife on ? is arm , he again sought the border , squatting on a ranch in the // heart of a wild and lonely spot on the banks of the Nueces . This river marked the fighting line between Mexico and Texas , so it was congenial soil for " Bully Buck , " as he was familiarly called , though I am afraid the friendly spirit of his gentle wife was often shocked by his deeds of daring . He used to talk to me of this sweet lady and their only child with tears in his eyes , for he was a loving savage . They had been cruelly murdered by the Comanche Indians during the absence of Wallace from his home . This crazed him for several months , and when he came to himself a morbid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that if Buck met a Comanche alone , it was all up with the redskin . His knowledge of the country made him of much importance at this time to the United States Government , by whom he was employed as spy , scout , ranger , and detective ; his bold nature won for him the admiration of his friends and the fear of his enemies . He had in his way educated himself , and was very fond of quoting poetry of the morbid and romantic order . Byron 's " Corsair , ** Poe 's " Raven , " and Scott 's Highland tales were special favorites with him ; but he had a thorough contempt for Cooper 's novels , and put no faith in the existence of " Boston Indians . " One evening- the last on earth for him , poor fellow - just as the candles were lighted and the games in the " Grand Saloon " were in full play , Wallace , without hat or coat and with his hair disheveled , rushed wildly into the room . He shouted to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for God 's sake , quick , or I m gone ! " Everybody started to his feet ; the man was so well known that the sound of his voice and his desperate appearance seemed to terrify the crowd . In the midst of the confusion three dark-looking Mexicans rushed into the room and began a furious attack upon XVallace . He was unarmed , and , seizing a chair , he fought desperately for his life . He felled the first man to the ground , but before he could turn he was stabbed to the heart by one of his other assailants and fell heavily to the floor ; the assassins , brandishing their knives , cleared a way through the crowd and escaped . This was the darkest tragedy I had yet seen , and that night , as I turned the matter over in my mind , I felt that however congenial this atmosphere might be for a Texan ranger , it was no place for a legitimate comedian . So I proposed to Badger that we should at once hunt up some Mexican having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was easily done ; the business was a thriving one , and the death of poor Wallace seemed to have made the place more popular . So we sold the good-will , divided our capital , and dissolved . I had to break the dreadful tidings to Metta that I must go away . I do not think she cared half so much for me as I did for her ; but when she realized the fact that I was about to " vamoose " she got up quite a little scene . Through our interpreter I told her I should soon make my fortune and return to her to claim her as my bride , and bear her off with the whole family - there were sixteen of them - to my own country . It was pretty hard to make her understand that there was any other country but the one she was living in : she had often wondered where I and all the other cruel people had come from to make war on her family , and always fancied that the little town where she was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Metta in Matamoras was like the minnow in the brook ; she - knew not of the sea to which the brook was flowing . ' ' The parting between Metta and myself was very affecting ; her mother and all her little barefooted brothers were weeping away in the Mexican tongue as I departed . In a month after that I had quite forgotten Metta , and the chances are that within a year she had allied herself to that animated arsenal the dark-eyed rival . MR . AND MRS . JAMES w. wALLAcK , JR . WE had a permit to leave Matamoras in one of the Government boats that was taking back wounded soldiers to Brazos Santiago . Many of the poor fellows were on board , and , having left various members of their bodies on the battlefields of Mexico , they were anxious to get what was left of them home as soon as possible . I was an eye-witness to much of the suffering ; the water , the climate , the blazing sun , and the drenching rain thinned their ranks with more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one they dropped off , and by the time we reached Brazos Santiago there were but few left alive . Here we left the Government steamer and took passage on a brig bound for New Orleans . I am not aware as to how attractive their places of business may be to the members of other professions , but when I was a youth the first place an actor sought out when he arrived in town was the theater . Actors seemed to be in love with their vocation and fluttered about the footlights , whether they had anything to do or not . I scarcely think that the attachment isso strong to-day , and there are many reasons , too , why it should not be so . At the time of which I write actors mixed but little with the public and seldom went into society . Salaries were small , so they could not afford expensive amusements , and I can not call to mind that there was a dramatic club in America . Now they have their yachts , their horses , their clubs , // and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the theater . It is not to be wondered at , then , that on our arrival in Nexv Orleans the brig we came in had scarcely touched the wharf when I leaped ashore and bought a morning paper to see what theater was open . At the St. Charles - still under the management of Ludlow and Smith - there was announced the " Tragedy of King Richard III . " from the original text , the stars being Mr. and Mrs. James W. Wallack , Jr. , who appeared as the Duke cj Glos/erand Queen Elizabeth , the evening 's entertainment concluding with the farce of " A Kiss in the Dark , " with the then rising young comedian John E. Owens as Mr. Fi//ibone . Of course I went at once to the theater . As I had acted there the season before , I knew all of the attaches and most of the company , and I naturally expected to be something of a lion , having just returned from the seat of war . In this , however , I was somewhat disappointed ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew more of the conflict than I did . That night I saw the performance . James XV . Wallack , Jr. , 1 was in those days at his best . Young , vigorous , and handsome , he was the most romantic-looking actor I ever saw ; there was a dash and spirit in his carriage , too , that was charming . I say he was at his best in those days , because in after years the acting of Macready , whom as an artist he idolized , had an unfortunate influence upon him , as he ultimately became imbued with the mannerisms of the English tragedian , which were so marked that they marred the natural grace of the imitator . All who remember Mrs. James W. Wallack , Jr. , will attest the force of her tragic acting . In the quality of queenly dignity I think she even surpassed Charlotte Cushman , though she lacked perhaps the spirit and fire of the latter . War usually increases the nightly receipts of the theater , but the struggle with Mexico seemed to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill would have been considered an attractive one under the usual condition of public affairs , the audience was small . The American Theater , then under the management of James Place , was not open , but the company was still in town , and there were as many actors as citizens in front . The play was finely acted but indifferently mounted , the armies of York and Lancaster being wretchedly equipped and quite limited as to quality and quantity . The faint and unmilitary efforts that they made to march with time and precision gave them anything but a warlike aspect . In keeping step there was a glaring difference of opinion , the pursuing army treading more upon their own heels than 1 So called to distinguish him from his uncle , who was the father of Lester Wallack. upon those of the enemy , and in the final collision there was a friendly tapping of tin spears on pasteboard helmets that told too plainly of a bloodless battle . But the really furious fight between Richard and Richmond made amends for the docility of the rank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not remember to have seen a stage combat fought with finer effect . JOHN E. OWENS . I HAD for the last year at least been buffeting about in barns and tents , so that anything like a legitimate production was a great treat . But my chief interest on this occasion was centered in the farce , and my thoughts were dxvelling on the approaching efforts of the rising young comedian - and why not ? Was I not a rising young comedian myself ? I certainly had reached that height in my own estimation , at least , and I felt a burning desire that a time should come when some newspaper would proclaim it for me as the New Orleans " Picayune " had that day announced it for Owens . At last he came , and certainly he conquered . As he entered briskly upon the stage , humming a sprightly song , I thought him the handsomest low comedian 1 had ever seen . He had a neat , dapper little figure , and a face full of lively expression . His audience was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and great flow of animal spirits capturing them and myself too - though I must confess that I had a hard struggle even inwardly to acknowledge it . As I look back and call to mind the slight touch of envy that I felt that night , I am afraid that I had hoped to see something not quite so good , and was a little annoyed to find him such a capital actor ; in short , I experienced those unpleasant twinges of jealousy that will creep over us during the moments when we are not at our best - though these feelings may occasionally produce a good result . In me , I know , it stirred up the first great ambition that I remember ever to have felt , and from that night of pleasure and excitement I resolved to equal Owens some day , if I could . CROSSING THE ALLEGHANIES . IT was now decided that my mother and sister should remain in New Orleans with some old friends while I went to join my halfbrother in , Philadelphia . He had been urging us for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrangements were made for me to act the second comedy to himself and W. E. Burton , then manager of the Arch street Theater . My mother was banker , and so had charge of the money . I took enough to see // me to Philadelphia , supposing that no accident would happen ; but before our steamer arnved at Wheeling the river was blocked with ice , and we were delayed over a week before wc could rcach the line of stages that crossed the Alleghany Mountains . Some of the old folks of to-day , who live only in the past and stolidly witness the iml ) rovements of the present , passing no remarks U*Ofl them except when there is an opportunity to condemn , are always preaching about the delights of the olden time and extolling the comforts of the stage-coach . I will describe , by way of contrast with travel of the l ) resent day , how the Alleghany Mountains were crossed in 1846 . It was midwinter when we arrived at Wheeling . Our steamboat was tied to the wharf about three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start at five no one thought of going to bed , so we wended our way along the frozen streets to secure through tickets to Philadelphia . The morning was pitch-dark and bitter cold - that damp , penetrating weather j ) iercing wraps and overcoats until it reached the very marrow in one 's bones . We got to the little " den , " by courtesy called the " office , " where we found a halftlozen more passengers equally damp , cold , and ill-natured with ourselves . There was a handftil of coal burning in a very small grate , about which were grou* ) ed the round-shouldered , unsympathetic people who were to be our fellow-travelers . They glanced up at us as we entered , and , closing up all the open space near the fire , said as plainly as they 1 Unless otherwise stated , the pictures in this article are from the collection of Thomas J. McKee . VOL . XXXIX. - 28. could without speaking : " You do n't get in here , we can tell you . You have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At one side there was a small table on which stood a large coffee-pot , some white cups and saucers , a plate of cold sausages ,  --  frozen stiff , - and an unattractive loaf of bread ; behind this banquet was a tall darky , leaning against the wall , and fast asleep . Here he remained undisturbed , not only because his refreshments were not tempting , but because we were given to understand that we could get a good breakfast twenty miles from Wheeling . At the appointed time the heavy old coach came up and we all climbed in . As our places were not designated on the ticket , we stowed ourselves in pell-mell , and I presume no one got the seat he wanted . A short way from town there was a long hill up which the horses toiled , so this gave the inmates of the coach time to settle themselves down for a quiet nap . One snore after another announced the accomplishment of this feat , and in a few minutes at least six out of the nine passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had so fine an opportunity to study the philosophy of snoring . A large , fat man opposite me had a short , angry snore ; at one time he snored so loudly that he woke himself up , and he had the impudence to glare about at the company as though he hoped that they would not make that noise again . The old lady who was crushing me up in the corner snored deeply and MRS . JAMES XX . WALLACE , JR . ( FROM A PHOTOGRAPH BY FREnERICKS. ) l JAXTOX XV . XXALLACK , JR . ( FROM A PHorG ( ; RAPH CX GURNEY. ) // contentedly . Some one off in a ( lark corner , whom I could not see , bad a genial way of joining in , as though be snored merely to oblige the passengers ; but the grand , original musician of the l ) arty sat opposite me . I never heard anything approaching him , either for quality or for compass . It was a back-action snore that began in a bold agihdo movement , suddenly brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle . As the coach steadily moved up the hill the band was in full play . The summit gained , there was a sharp crack of the whip , the horses started , and as everybody was jerked violently backward , the snoring gave place to oaths and pshaws and jolting about . As soon , however , as we got used to this sensation , the chorus began again ; and as I was quite overcome and tired , I joined in until the coach came to a full stop at the stable where the horses were to be changed . The sun now rose , and came in at all sorts of places , waking and blinding everybody . What a discontented and unhappy lot we were ! and how we all hated one another ! Breakfast at last ! Ah , hot coffee , ham and eggs , and buckwheat cakes ! The meal was not half over before we were a band of brothers . We could not do enough for one another , and all was harmony and peace . Of course under these conditions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in making the time pass agreeably . Two gentlemen pitted themselves against each other in telling funny stories . Their talents and qualities in this respect differed very widely ; one invariably began his anecdotes by telling the joke first and then relating the story , whereas the other told his tale in a capital way until he came to the point , and that he never could remember . The fat man sang a sentimental song about " My Mother , Oh , my Mother . ' His voice was not bad if he had only kept in one key , but his natural independence set all such trifles at defiance , and in his most extravagant wanderings he would look about with an expression of countenance which clearly admonished us not to give him any advice in the matter . Of course I was expected to contribute my share of amusement , particularly as it leaked out that I was a young actor ; in fact , I should have been offended if they had not pressed me . I sang a comic song about " The Good Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joining in the chorus . I followed this up with some bad imitations of Forrest and Booth . These seemed to give great satisfaction , the old lady exclaiming that the imitations were wonderful ; but as it afterwards turned out that she had never seen the originals , her criticism must be received with some caution . The day rolled slowly away , and as the darkness came on a mountain storm of snow and driving wind enveloped us . As we ascended the mountain the cold became intense . It was rather late in the night when we arrived at the supper station , as in consequence of the slippery state of the roads we were fully three hours behind time ; but the cheerful look of the dining-room with its huge blazing fire of logs repaid us for all the suffering we had endured . We found that a large pile of bricks was being heated for us in front of the firel ) lace : these comforting articles were intended for our feet in the coach , and nothing , not even the supper , could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aboard , we were again ready for our journey - more perilous now than ever , for , as we reached the summit of the mountain , the storm increased in its fury . At times we thought the stage would blow over ; the icy roads caused the horses to slip , and several times the leaders w ent down . It was a night to be remembered . A little after daylight we rolled into the town of Cumberland , the terminus of the stage line and the beginning of the railroad . Shivering and benuinbed with cold , we alighted and sought the hotel for warmth and shelter . The driver of the coach was frozen stiff and had to be assisted down from the box . Another hour on the road would have been fatal to him . Twenty-four hours of suffering and peril took I ii**I JOHN E. ( OVENS . ( Fso* A IEIOTOORAIO BY BACHRACH. ) // us from Wheeling to Cumberland  --  a journey now made in six , with a comfortable bed to lie on and a warm sleeping-car for shelter . MX @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was always delightful . We took the greatest pleasure in each other 's society , and he seemed never tired of making any sacrifices for my advancement , and , Xvhile we were both acting at the Arch , would often persuade Mr. Burton to cast me for parts far beyond my reach . At the end of the season Burke joined the Bowery Theater in Nexv York , and I was installed in his place at the Arch . I was destined to meet in this theater one of my oldest and dearest friends , Tom Glessing . ( Dear loin , as I xvrite your name how my thoughts run back to the olden time - not that we were ha* ) pier then in each others friendship , for it is a great comfort to reflect that throughout the many years we knew each other our affection never weakened . ) Tom was the scenic artist of the Arch street Theater. and noted for great rapidity in the execution of his work . The same generous nature that prompted him to lavish all he had upon his friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wasted more than he used , and bespattered everything and everybody , himself included . Such was the generosity of his double-pound brush , that it scattered benevolence in all directions , and woe betide his dearest friend if ever he came within the circumference of its bounty . His was the loudest and the heartiest laugh I ever heard . Nor had he any control over it , and often during the ( luiet scene of some play that was in l ) rel ) aration his boisterous roar of merriment would burst forth from the paint room and , echoing through the theater , upset the serious business of the play . At such times the stage-manager would have to assert his authority , and demand of Glessing that he should stop that " dreadful roar " in order that the rehearsal might go on . If he had a fault it was that he was a trifle mischievous , and his enjoyment of a practical joke , played on any of 1 From an article by Brander Matthews , entitled " The American on the Stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E. OWENS AS SOLON SHINGLE . " 1 // his companions , was delightful to behold : when he tried to tell of it he would laugh so immoderately that one could never understand half he said . Fortunately , none of his pranks resulted seriously , except sometimes to himself ; and when recounting some of the mishaps that had befallen him , in consequence of indulging too freely in his sport , he seemed to enjoy his own discomfiture quite as much as that of the other party . Practical jokers , like physicians , seldom take their own prescriptions with pleasure ; but Tom was an exception , and would even delight in being the victim of the game . I recall the first time we met in the paint room : he was hard at work , splashing in a turbulent ocean with angry billows breaking upon the rocks . The storm was very severe , and the artist must have had a narrow escape , for he was so bespattered with spray that he seemed to have been battling with the breakers . We were friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beginning . He had but one sorrow-it was a domestic one - and he bore it nobly , never uttering a word against those who had caused his unhappiness . Years afterwards he married again , and so happily that it repaid him for the trouble he had passed through in his youth . Gaiety became contagious in his presence , and cheerfulness followed in his wake . He dreaded to look upon the serious side of life , for his nature was so sympathetic that he suffered the pangs of others , and at the mere recital of human grief his eyes would fill with tears . He was fond of acting , and could n't act a bit , poor felloxv ; but it was delicious to hear him recount his failures . Mr. Burton had married Tom 's sister , and he and Glessing traveled together through the South on one of the comedian 's starring trips . In Natchez , Mississippi , the manager offered to give Tom a benefit if he could prevail upon Mr. Burton to play for him . This was arranged , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to deliver in front of the curtain , as a tribute of gratitude to a generous public . He had written it out , and had sat up all the previous night to commit it to memory . It began , " Being totally unprepared for the honor you have done me . " After rehearsal he walked out to the edge of the town , so that he could practice it in the open air , where he could elevate his voice without disturbing the citizens . On his way towards the woods he met a drunken Indian , who was staggering from side to side in the road , and flourishing an empty whisky-bottle at the white man in general and Glessing in particular . When any one is anxious to avoid a drunken man , by some strange fascination the intoxicated person invariably makes directly for him ; you may look the other way , or pretend to be unconscious of his existence , but it s of no use : he will introduce himself . The Indian was no exception ; for though poor Tom , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked up at the tops of the trees , the gentle savage would not be avoided . " Hey ! you white man , look me too . Me good Indian , good Indian . Yes , ah ? " said the red man . To which Tom assented at once , most emphatically : " Certainly , you are a splendid Jnjun ; you re as good-I may say you are the best Injun I ever saw . " " You think me drunk , eh ? " " Drunk ! " said Tom . " No . Let me hear any one dare to say you re drunk , and I 11 kill him . Give me that bottle and I 11 kill him with that . " " No ; me am drunk , " said the savage , glaring fiercely at Tom . " You may be a little drunk , but not much - just enough , eh ? " said Tom , desirous of agreeing to anything under the circumstances . The Indian became sullen and moody , as if brooding on the wrongs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it suddenly occurred to Tom that the United States Government , when the Indians got troublesome , always softened their anger by the bestowal of costly presents ; so , offering a dollar to the chief Tom bade him return to his wigwam and take some whisky home to his squaw and papoose . The offering was accepted , and had the desired effect . After two or three affectionate embraces they parted , and Tom got awayinthe opposite direction . Finding himself once more alone , and in a secluded spot , he began to go through his speech . He tried various methods , first the cheerful ; and , stepping forward with bright , jauntymanner , he raised hisvoice inahighkey : " Ladies and gentlemen , being totally unprepared for this honor . " On second thought , it appeared to him that his manner was a little too free and undignified , so he now assumed the grave and thoughtful . Placing one hand in his breast , and pulling his hair over his eyes , to give him a poetic and dreamy air , he paced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began again : " Ladies and gentlemen , being totally unprepared . " Just at this point he raised his eyes and observed the astonished heads of two farmers peering over the rails of a worm fence . He immediately gathered up his hat and manuscripts and started for the town at a brisk pace ; but remembering that the " good Injun " might be in ambush awaiting his return , he was forced to skirt the town for miles before he reached his hotel . He would go on by the hour and tell such // 97 stories , and was always the most pleased when he was the hero of them and placed in some absurd position . About this time I was haunted by a professional borrower . Just eighteen , and in the receipt of what was considered in those days a fair salary , I was a shining mark for his skill , though I was such easy game that I think he held me in slight contempt . But , for all this , he was crafty enough to impress me with the simplicity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been for fortune 's sport ! He was a dreadfully bad actor on the stage , but a star of the first magnitude in private life ; so much so that for many weeks he tortured and defrauded me with the ease and confidence of a master . Conventional beggars are as conventional as any other professionals . That time-honored custom of assuming a nervous and uncertain manner , as if this was the first time they were placed in such a position , is a favorite attitude with them ; while in reality they are cool and collected . My tormentor was an expert , and his costume quite a study for an amateur in the business . Although his ample shoes were full of gaping wounds , they shone with a high polish that any man might feel proud of ; and if his tall hat was a trifle weak , it had a gloomy , ruined-tower look that won him respect from strangers ; and his clothes were of a shabby black , just " sicklied o'er with the pale cast " of time . Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , clasping my hand warmly , and regarding me as if I was the one ray of light that illumined his gloomy path . I believe he once said these very words ; at all events he looked them , and at times I really thought I was . The first thing a sly old rascal like this does is to study the weak points of his victims ; and he knew mine better than I did . He had a large supply of tears that he could turn on at will , and after getting under a full headway of grief he would revolve slowly round and dry his eyes with his back to me . I used to imagine that he did this so that I might not observe him weep ; but since then I have thought differently of it . He knew perfectly well when salary day came , and would waylay me at the stage door . On these occasions he Tould assume a surprised and startled look , as if we had met WILLIAM B. BURTON AS " DOCTOR OLLAPOD . " ( FROM THR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // quite by accident ; and then he would exclaim , in a half-retrospective tone , " Dear me ! dear me ! it must be nearly a week since we last met . " It was just a week , to the minute , and he knew it , the villain ! At such times Tom Glessing would fairly revel in my cliscomfiture . If he saw that my tormentor had buttonholed me on the corner , he would delight in passing close to us with an " Ah , how are you ? At it auain eh ? " And on he would 0 go , fairly holding his sides with laughter , while my corkscrew , ' as Glessing used to call him , was drawing the dollar notes out of my pocket , one by one . The most provoking thing about the fellow was the air of patronage he assumed when negotiating a loan : in our early transactions he used to make me feel that he was doing me an immense favor by levying these little drafts on my slender income . He would begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had formerly felt for my father he would not demean himself by sinking so low . * put tip with this for some time , not o utofany charity , for I had gradually lost all respect or pity for him , but from a kind of fear . He had an overawing and at the same time despairing look that quite terrified me , and as lately he had hinted that the time was drawing near when he thought of trying his luck in the Delaware , I really feared he might commit suicide . I can hardly describe what I suffered from the l ) ersecutions of this man , and it was nothing but a sense of shame at being the dupe of such a low fellow that determined me to break my bondage and turn from him . When he saw that I made a bold stand against him he became abusive ; finding that this did not have the desired effect he lapsed into the dismal , whining and mourning over his crushed feelings , and lamenting his personal degradation . But I had discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to attempt further imposttire . Such men are to be found in all grades of life , and they are usually adroit and cunning fellows , attacking their victims right and left , and using just the sort of weapons that are the most difficult to parry . They lie in ambush for the innocent traveler , and suddenly pounce upon him with a well-told tale , so got by rote , and so often rehearsed , that they act the part of injured innocence to the life . If the victim be timid he is lost , for they recognize his nervousness at once , and browbeat him out of his benevolence . This vile weed  --  the borrower-grows and luxuriates in all the capitals of States and countries . The ever-changing soil of fresh visitation seems well adapted to nourish it . Sometimes women indulge in this practice , but not often ; you are at least safer with them than with the men , particularly if they are old . A feeble old mendicant generally uses her collection for some purpose that gives her comfort at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary , and they must and should have them ; but the man has many avenues through which he can filter your bounty-the gaming-table , the bar-room , and worse . WILLIAM E. BURTON . IF Mr. Burton was not at this time a fixed star , he was certainly a managerial planet of the first magnitude , and in this position was naturally surrounded by a number of small satellites that basked in the moonshine of his affection . These lesser lights seemed to gyrate in eccentric orbits , generally going out of their way to carry tales to their superior . Nothing is more distressing to the members of a stock company than to have spies set upon them who eavesdrop and report every little trifle to the manager . It is natural that the occupants of the dressing-room , and even of the greenroom , when the manager is not l ) resent , should now and then indulge in the WILLIAM E. BURTON AS CAPTAIN CUTTLE . " ( FROM A DAGUERREOTYPE BY MEADE BROTHERS AFTER S // harmless amusement of criticizing and even censuring the policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time between long waits , and , like Doctor Ollajod 's small dose of magnesia , does " neither harm nor good . " The tale-bearing element in Mr. Burton 's theater was fully organized under the generalship of one of the most ingenious informers that I have ever met with . If I do not speak affectionately of this gentleman , it is because I was at that time smarting under the effects of one of his secret-service reports to the Star-chamber , to which apartment I had been summoned on a charge of " contemplated desertion . " It seems that I had been incautiously bragging among my comrades in the dressing-room of a large offer I had received to leave the Arch and join Mr. Killmist at his theater in Washington , stating that I was shortly going to sen ( l in my resignation to Mr. Burton . I had also been abusing the management , both criticizing and conclemning its short-sighted policy ; anti though there was no stated reward offered for the exposure of such offenses , the informer was anxious to get me out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast for some of the good l ) arts that were already in my possession . I was ushered into the manager 's office by the call-boy , and stood there like a prisoner ready to be sentenced to the rack for daring to express my opinion of the " powers that be . " Mr. Burton sat in state at the farther end of a long table , supported on each side by his stage manager and the prompter ; this august tribunal frowned on me with a most discharging countenance as I stood before it . The scene as I look back at it seems comical enough , but just at that time it was a serious matter for me , as my l ) rospective engagement was not positively settled , and tinder the most favorable circumstances could not be entered upon short of two months , and a dismissal just at that time would have been financially inconvenient . The accusation of a " contemplated desertion " being made , I demanded the name of the informer . This being withheld , I declined to make any answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face will recall its wonderfully comical expression , even when he was serious ; but when he assumed a look of injured innocence the effect was irresistible . I did not dare laugh then , but I do enjoy it now when I think of it . The examination proceeded , and on the first question being again put I acknowledged the fact point-blank , stating also that being engaged for no stated length of time I intended to give the customary notice and to resign . The manager demanded to know on what grounds I presumed to take such a step without first consulting him . I told him that I had been offered double the salary I was then receiving . Upon his asking who made me worth " double the salary , " I replied that I was quite willing to admit that he did , anti proposed that he should give it to me . At this rather inipertinent remark he waxed wroth , and said I was not worth it , and never would be worth it , but that I had been insubordinate and disloyal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prevent my appearing at any other theater if I left him . There is no doubt that Mr. Burton thought that his denunciation and threats of an action would crush me , but he knew little of human nature , for I now went up at least one hundred per cent . in my own estimation . The very thought of being threatened with a lawsuit made me feel at least an inch taller . I , who up to the present time had thought myself of small consequence , threatened with an action for breach of contract It was delightful ; and I have no doubt that I drew myself up with much tlignity as I informed him that he could pursue whatever course he pleased in the matter-swaggering out of the room with the defiant air of a " heavy villain . " Of course quite a little knot of actors were waiting at the back door to hear the result of the trial and learn the verdict of the judge . When I informed them with a lofty pride that I presumed the affair would end in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never envied me before , they certainly did now . It was not CHARLES BURKE .

We might have dreaded a long vacation in the summer , or quaked at the rebuke of a dramatic critic , but the law ! So far as damages were concerned , we defied it ! The case , however , never came to trial ; for about a week after this the Washington theater was destroyed by fire , and I was only too glad to remain where I was without double the salary . As an actor of the old broad farce-comedy Mr. Burton certainly had no equal in his day , and his dramatic pictures of the characters of Dickens would have amazed the author if he had been so fortunate as to see them .

His entrance as Van Dunder , in the drama of " The Dutch Governor ; or , T would Puzzle a Conjurer , " was a comic picture so full of genius that it stamped itself indelibly on the mind , an effect never to be forgotten . The great stupid face was a blank . The heavy cheeks hung down stolidly on each side of a halfopened mouth ; the large , expressionless eyes seemed to look hopelessly for some gleam of intelligence . There he stood the incarnation of pompous ignorance , with an open letter in his hand . The audience swayed with laughter ; for , though he had not said a word , they knew that he had just received an important state document and could n't read it . As a manager he achieved much success , but met with some disastrous failures , not seemM* C.BURKE . AMERICAN COMEDIAN . ( FROM A LITHOGRAPH BY J. L.

The first deals with our own affairs , and , if pursued with honesty and industry , invariably leads to good results . The latter meddles with the business of other people , and generally brings about the downfall of the opposer . Burton was always temperate , and very industrious ; he had literary talent , too , as his contributions to " The Gentleman s *1agazine " ( which he edited ) will attest . Edgar A. Poe was also a contributor to this periodical , but he and Burton were always " at daggers drawn " ; they had a paper war for many months in Philadelphia , and splashed their angry ink at each other much to the amusement of the public . Poe lost his temper , and Burton , seeing his advantage , fired off his humorous artillery , so that the comedian got the better of the poet .

His humor on the witness-stand was quite equal to that of Sam Weller . On one occasion , while the actor was going through bankruptcy , an eminent lawyer in Philadelphia thought he detected a desire on Burton 's part to conceal some facts relative to a large sum of money that he had made during the production of the Naiad Queen. ** Rising with great dignity , and glaring fiercely at Burton , he demanded , " What became of that money , sir ? " The comedian looked him straight in the face ; then rising in imitation of an attorney , he replied , " The lawyers got it . " AN EFFORT IN GREEK TRAGEDy . DURING the first season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the production of a Greek tragedy , the " Antigone " of Sophocles . in a theater , as we have seen , there are apt to be two or three discordant spirits that criticize and condemn the course of the management , and I presume that most public institutions are honored by small private bands of conspirators ; so that on being confronted by this ancient drama in the greenroom we naturally shrugged our shoulders and wondered what Mr. Burton meant by it . This same sublime tragedy of " Antigone " had been freely translated and acted in Dublin at the Theater VOL . XXXIX. - 29 . Royal some forty years before . The audience was quite bewildered by this performance , and at the close of the play called for the author ; whether to applaud or to chastise him does not appear . The manager came forward to apologize for the absence of Sophocles , but promised faithfully to produce him if ever he allowed one of his plays to be acted under his management again . Notwithstanding that this Greek tragedy had always failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously unfortunate drama . It has been said that Mr. Burton was classically educated ; naturally he felt justly proud of his scholastic attainments , and having a desire to display them he selected the Greek tragedy as just the thing for its accomplishment . Apart from his undoubted claim to erudition , he had that wonderful stage tact and executive ability that thoroughly qualified him for the management of a theater ; so that whether he had drunk deep at the " Pierian spring " or not , he certainly had quenched his thirst at the public fountains , and refreshed himself at all those little intellectual brooks that flow along the roadside of an actor 's life . This kind of knowledge may be superficial , but it is most useful to an actor-manager . But to return to " Antigone . " During its rehearsals a marked change came over our manager . In arranging the lighter and more colloquial plays he was accustomed to be cheerful , and rather inclined to intersperse his directions with anecdote ; but now he assumed a dignity strangely at variance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been in the habit of associating his comical figure with Paul Pry and Je ; ; z Baggs , could scarcely be expected at this short notice to receive this change of demeanor with the same solemnity with which it was given . Of course we did not dare exhibit our irreverent feelings , for there is no doubt that had Mr. Burton detected the slightest attempt to guy either him or his new venture an immediate discharge of the offending party would surely have followed . Tom Glessing , myself , and several minor members of the company had got hold of some Greek quotations and would slyly salute one another in the classic tongue when we met at the theater in the morning , always , however , when the manager 's back was turned ; for if in his presence we had dared talk Greek we should certainly have walked Spanish . I was cast for one of the unhappy Chorus ,  - -  I think there were four of us ,  --  and when the curtain rose a more wretched looking quartet was never seen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither to our comfort nor to our personal appearance . We were crowned with four evergreen laurel wreaths , which bloomed unsteadily upon our heads , and // were done up to the chin in white Grecian togas . Mr. and Mrs. James W. Wallack , Jr. , were in the cast , and for their fine declamation and classic tableaux were much applauded ; but when we as the Chorus attempted to explain what it all meant the effect upon the audience was dreadful . The failure of this sublime tragedy caused Mr. Burton to be seriously out of pocket , as well as out of temper . He blamed first the public , then the unfortunate Chorus , and , finally , himself . In domestic matters I had good opportunity of forming my judgment of Mr. Burton , as we were for some time quite intimate , and I often visited him at his house . The affection he lavished upon his children was almost feminine in its warmth and gentleness . He had three lovely little tyrants , who managed him quite as well as he managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he delighted to walk with his lovely daughters and show them off . I have often met the group strolling hand in hand in Franklin Square on a fine Sunday morning in the spring , the pretty little girls , tastefully dressed , tossing their heads and shaking their curls in childish vanity with their portly parent looking proudly down upon them . The Arch , during the time I was under Mr. Burton 's management , had met with many of those vicissitudes that were so prevalent in theatrical ventures when the production of the " Glance at New York " struck the popular taste of that curious and uncertain element known as the " public . " The " public " means in reality nobody ; it is an elastic term ; we are indeed prone to call every one the public but ourselves . We wonder that the public can support this or that trashy entertainment , forgetting that we have been to see it once , and perhaps twice . " Life in London , " upon which the " Glance at New York " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when both lords and ladies went in crowds to witness the vulgarities of low life ; the knocking down of watchmen , the upsetting of an old woman 's apple stall , and the dancing of Dusty Bob and African Sal occupied the attention and delighted the audience of seventy years ago . Years before , Monk Lewis 's melodrama of " Castle Spectre , " a ghostly and ghastly piece of business , drew crowds of people , to the exclusion of the works of Shakspere , Sheridan , and Goldsmith . Nondescript actors , of the ranting and fantastic school , were in demand , while the Kembles and a host of great comedians were playing to empty benches . Likewise , we find Colley Cibber complaining that in his day the legitimate drama had fallen so low in the estimation of the public that he and his company of fine comedians were put aside and made subservient to the Italian singers and French ballet dancers that then flooded England . We must not always condemn the public of the present day for these curious characteristics which seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there may be a necessity for this seeming inconstancy , and it is quite possible that the mind requires now and then a change of diet as the stomach does ; the palate being satiated with rich and delicate viands often craves a little coarser food , if only to assist digestion . But to return to Mr. Burton and his new venture . The great success of the " Glance at New York " caused him to look in that direction himself . A full treasury had excited his ambition , so he proceeded to New York and purchased Palmo 's Opera House for the purpose of opening it as a comedy theater . He was an early riser , very industrious , and extremely temperate . These qualities , combined with energy and an inordinate ambition to lead , made him a formidable adversary for Mr. Mitchell , who was then in the very height of prosperity at the Olympic . This latter gentleman , like Mr. Burton , was a comedian and a manager of rare ability ; he had surrounded himself with an excellent company of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well chosen that the dramatic treats given at the " Little Olympic " became the rage and talk of the town . Mr. Burton saw this , and his desire for a dramatic battle urged him to oppose Mitchell , and this he did with much force and judgment , bringing to bear the heaviest theatrical artillery that New York had ever seen . When I say that these great guns consisted of William Rufus Blake , Henry Placide , W. E. Burton , John Brougham , Lester Wallack , Oliver Raymond , Lysander Thompson , and Charles Burke , I think that those who remember these extraordinary actors will fully agree with the statement . I do not think that Lysander Thompson and Charles Burke were with this company at this time , but they joined it afterwards . In the midst of this conflict between the managers Mr. Mitchell was stricken with paralysis ; this rendered the contest still more unequal , and the " Little Olympic " surrendered . To give some idea of the excellence with which Mr. Burton 's plays were cast , I may mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " produced at his theater with Blake as Afalvolia , Placide as the f*o4 Burton as Sir Toby Belch , Lester Wallack as Sir Andrew Aguecheck , and Miss Weston as Viola . I do not believe that this play has been acted with greater skill since Shakspere wrote it , although there is no denying that , with regard to scenic effects , costumes , ingenious stage-man- // agernent , and elaborate ornamentation , the Shaksperean productions of our own time far exceed those of the earlier revivals . Burton 's ambition to succeed in the various tasks he had set himself was strongly fortified by his quick apprehension and great versatility . He was at the same time managing the Arch street Theater in Philadelphia , the Chambers street Theater in New York , acting nightly , and studying new characters as fast as they came out . In addition to these proUessional duties , he was building a country residence at Glen Cove , writing stories for the magazines , and taking prizes at the horticultural shows for hot-house grapes and flowers . If his success and happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too great ambition ; this trait led him to oppose everything that came within range , and at times he would even go out of his way to search for a new antagonist . In a fit of excitement , brought on by some domestic shock , he was suddenly stricken doxyn , and never rose again . During his last hours he was lovingly attended by his daughters , who had grown up to womanhood , and I am told by one who was present that the parting with them touched the hearts of all who saw it . CHARLES BURKE . IT was a rare treat to see Burton and Burke in the same play : they acted into each other 's hands with the most perfect skill ; there was no striving to outdo each other . If the scene required that for a time one should be prominent , the other would become the background of the picture , and so strengthen the general effect ; by this method they produced a perfectly harmonious work . For instance , Burke would remain in repose , attentively listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally act as a spell upon the audience , who became by this treatment absorbed in what Burton was saying , and having got the full force of the effect they would burst forth in laughter or applause ; then , by one accord , they became silent , intently listening to Burke 's reply , which Burton was now strengthening by the same repose and attention . I have never seen this element in acting carried so far , or accomplished with such admirakle results , not even upon the French stage , and I am convinced that the importance of it in reaching the best dramatic effects can not be too highly estimated . It was this characteristic feature of the acting of these two great artists that always set the audience wondering which was the better . The truth is there was no " better " about the matter . They were not horses running a race , but artists painting a picture ; it was not in their minds which should win , but how they could , by their joint efforts , produce a perfect work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dying at the age of thirty-two , it is wonderful that Charles Burke left such an enduring reputation as an actor . I do not mean that his fame lives with the general public , but his professional brethren accorded to him the rarest histrionic genius . I have sometimes heard comparisons made between Burton and Burke , but they were so widely different in their natures and their artistic methods that no reasonable parallel could be drawn . Burton colored highly , and laid on the effects with a liberal brush , while Burke was subtle , incisive , and refined . Burton 's features were strong and heavy , and his figure was portly and ungainly . Burke was lithe and graceful . His face was plain , but wonderfully expressive . The versatility of this rare actor was remarkable , his pathos being quite as striking a feature as his comedy . He had an eye and face that told their meaning before he spoke , a voice that seemed to come from the heart itself , penetrating , but melodious . He sang with great taste , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more from intuition than from study ; and , as was said of Barton Booth , " the blind might have seen him in his voice , and the deaf have heard him in his visage . " Although only a half-brother , he seemed like a father to me , and there was a deep and strange affection between us . As I look back I can recall many social and professional sacrifices that he made for me , and my love for him was so great that if xve were absent from each other for any length of time my heart would beat with delight at his approach . It is scarcely fair to intrude upon the reader one 's domestic affections , but I am irresistibly impelled to write these words . And so they must stand .
