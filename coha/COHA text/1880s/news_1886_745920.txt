txt The appointment of " Fatty " WALSH as Warden of the Tombs Prison is a disgraceful performance , and it is an indication of what is to be expected as the result of the union of the Democratic factions in this city , whereby the respectable element of the party is utterly swamped . In condemning this appointment it is not necessary to go into particulars as to the past character and career of Mr. WALSH . A few years ago his record was certainly a very unsavory one . Latterly he has been conducting himself with as much decency as he is capable of , and is said to have been ambitious to retrieve his reputation and to be regarded . as a good citizen of the Sixth Ward , but lie has continued to be a pothouse politician of a low type and has had no respectable occupation . Three years ago he ran for Alderman in the Second District , and was beaten by Kiux by only one or two votes . It was fortunate for him that he was beaten , for if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he would have been one of the disgraced and indicted " boodle " Aldermen of the board of 1884 . Twice since then he has run for Alderman , but the last time was defeated by " PAT " DINNER , who is certainly no better than he . but who has more money and the advantage of running a liquor saloon in the district . This year WALSH aimed higher and aspired to go to Congress , and his friends believed ho was entitled to the nomination . In the exigencies of the Democratic union and the distribution of favors which it entailed he was loft out , and a respectable man was chosen . WALSH was now in the position of a pensioner on the party  --  one of those men who , according to the ethics of politicians of his stamp , must be taken care of . There seemed to be nothing that could . be done for him , unless he could be made Warden of the Tombs , and the politicians determined to give him that place . Naturally the union of the factions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defy decent public sentiment . Warden FINN was the only obstacle in the way . He had . had a number of years of experience , had made a fair record , and there were no charges against him on which he could be removed . So the Commissioners , of Charities and Correction determined to make a new place for him and created the entirely unnecessary office of Warden of the District Prisons to provide a sinecure for Mr. FINN and so get rid of him peaceably . There is no pretense that WALSH is fitted for the duties of Warden of the city prison , and the only purpose of making the changes , which involve a considerable increase of public expense , was to provide a place for him because he had . " claims " upon the politicians of the party . Wholly aside from the character of WALSH and the question of his personal fitness , the performance is a shameful one , but it is quite in keeping with the general administration of the Department of Charities and Correction . The department is an incongruous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nothing in common between the management of the public charities of the city and . the care of its penal institutions , but both are eminently branches of the public service which ought to be in the hands of men of high character , trained to their duties and devoted to the public well-being . They are the very last that ought to fall into the control of vulgar politicians , who will use them to provide an asylum for party heelers , but that is precisely the use that is made of them by the present commission , which is dominated by the influence of Mr. BRENIVAN , a Tammany leader of the most sordid type , whose sole claim to a responsible position in the public service rests upon his usefulness to the most corrupt political organization on the continent . But the Commissioners of Charities and . Correction have acted in this business only as a part of the united Democracy of the city , whose union was the baleful result of the bargain by which the highly respectable Mr. HEWITT was elected Mayor of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ county . Their action shows the confidence and boldness with which the politicians are ready to use the power which they owe to the strategy of Tammany Hall and . the craven submission of the County Democracy . Behind that power are the motives and purposes that have animated the same class of politicians from the time of TWEED , and they will use it to strengthen their hold upon the public administration of the city and to make the public service subservient to their own corrupt ends . Mr. HEWITT may feel confident that he can and . will , as Mayor of the city , resist the enormous pressure of the , power that put him in that office ; but if he succeeds he will have to exercise a vigilance , a keenness of perception , an energy and a firmness of action which he has given us no reason to expect . The action of Commissioners BRENXAN , PORTER , and SIMMONS in the matter of Warden FINN and " Fatty " WALSH is , only a samPle of what the politicians of the United Democracy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what wt- , the inevitable result of the surrender of n spectable Democrats and Independents 1 the designs of Boss CHOKER and . DIE POWER , and it is greatly to be feared tha the respectable character and virtuous tentions of Mr. HEWITT will be powerless t resist the corrupt forces , the only effectut barrier to which has been taken away .
