txt While during the lag twelve months there has been a shrinkage in stocks and railroad bonds , New-York City real estate has held its own ; in certain choice localities it has slightly appreciated in value . It is a noticeable fact that desirable real estate offered at public auction at a bona fide Executor 's sale brings together a good company of would-be investors , . who generally absorb the property offered at satisfactory , prices . As far as up-town lots are concerned , this statement was fairly demonstrated last month at the sale of 142 lots belonging to the estate of Gov . E. D. MoRGAN . Some very choice east and west side property was there disposed of . The prices obtained can be looked upon as fair indications of the present market value of vacant lots in those localities when sold under the hammer . At private sale , and on the same favorable terms , these lots would sell for at least 20 per cent . more.than they brought at auction . The Morgan sale also establishes the fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the same . Capitalists and builders prefer , for the most part , to invest in choice east side lots at going rates , though sites equally pleasant may be obtained on the west side for one-tenth , if not one-fifteenth , the cost . At the Morgan sale four lots on the south-east corner of Madison-avenue and Seventieth-street sold for $109,000 . . If the west side lots did not sell ' at prices entirely satisfactory to west side speculative holders , the prices paid will at all events leave to the buyers a handsome . margin for profit when the ardently desired and muchtalked-of west side " boom " puts in an appearance . Real estate is never active at this season of the year . From December to February is generally a dull period . Nevertheless , we find now that whenever a really choice piece of property is pressed on the market it is soon disposed of . We have a notable instance of this in the recent sale of the Stevens mansion on the south-west corner of Fifth-avenue and Fifty-seventh-street , which brought $600,000 cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This house . commenced in 1874 end finished in 1876 , was at that time the show house of the City- . Its estimated value , including land , when completed was about $400,000 . It will thus be seen that the investment has been a very profitable one for Mrs. ADELE L. S. STEVENS , the owner . The growth of the aristocratic quarter now tends very strongly northward along Fifth and Madison avenues above Sixtyfifth-street . The few vacant plots and lots on those avenues south of Seventyninth-street now offer the choicest sites for costly residences . In view of the rapid absorption of Madison-avenue lots for immediate improvement , real estate operators have , during the last two years , quietly bought up what was pressed for sale on that avenue and the streets adjacent thereto above Seventy-ninth-street . The most notable sale made in that locality for some time past was that of the whole block-32 lots  --  bounded by Ninety-sixth and Ninety-seventh streets , Madison and Fourth avenues , by , the Executors of the late Gov . WILLIAM BEACH LAWRENCE , to WILLIAM LALOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments have yet to be made before the property is transferred of record . It is understood that at least another well-known real estate broker and expert is interested in the purchase , which is likely to prove very profitable to the buyers . A good illustration of the down-town real estate situation was afforded by the auction sale on the 13th inst. made by order of the executors of the late JOHN SUYDAM . It 's a large extent the purchases made were for investment . The prices obtained'were very satisfactory . An old brick building , No. 189 Broadway , with lot 25.6 by 99.6 , sold for between $150,000 and $160,000 . The price paid represented the estimated value of the land alone , for the purchaser will demolish the building acid erect a costly first-class structure in its place . Excessive building has been checked , the mortgaging of realty nowhere is excessive . Choice real estate is in strong hands and more firmly held than at any time during the last four yeas . Recent sales of dwelling-house property in the fashionable up-town quarter have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Down-town property in good business localities is much sought after at rising prices by conservative capital . The certainty of the investment makes the value , and there is nothing so valuable or safe as a good piece of productive real estate . It can not be beared , watered , cornered , or wrecked , as can stocks and bonds . All JAY GOULD 'S efforts could not at all depreciate the actual marketable value of a single piece of City real estate .
