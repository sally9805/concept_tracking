txt Those who buy or rent new houses in this city should not fail to have the plumbing in them thoroughly examined by competent inspectors . Such , an examination is re-quired , not because the Health Department and its agents are guilty of neglect , but for the reason that the department is not able with the force at its disposal to subject all of the new plumbing in the city to inspection . Citizens must do something for themselves , and it is the work of the department in this field that shows what they should do . The Sanitary Engineer of the 30th ult. publishes the history of several recent prosecutions by the Health Department , in which plumbers were defendants . On June 10 , in the Court of Special Sessions , one HALPIN , a plumber doing business in Third-avenue , was prosecutedfor having violated the plumbing and- sanitary laws . He pleaded guilty , and was fined $200 . The work in question had been done in four private houses of special design in Ninety-seventh-street , near Eighthavenue . The inspectors discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fresh-air inlets were clogged , that the drain.had a fall of only three inches for the length of the house , that the hubs were open or badly calked , and that the work was bad in other respects . It should be borne in mind that these were costly houses , in which a buyer would not expect to find . bad plumbing . In another case the same plumber was fined $250 . The building was a tenement house designed for eleven families , and situated on One Hundred and First-street , near Ninth-avenue . The quality of the plumbing can be shown by the fact that the house drain had . not been carried to the sewer in the street . There was a pipe from the sewer to the area wall , and . the house drain extended to the front wall of ' the house , but no excavation had been made in the space between these walls . Here was a gap eight feet long , where the sewage was discharged into the soil . Joints throughout the house were open and . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive anv one who should look at them . When the discovery was made , there were already four famiLied in the house . But for the vigilance of the department eleven families would . soon have been exposed to conditions that breed disease . The gap in the house drain was worthy of BUDDENSLEIL The plumber would have been more severely punished . if he had not asserted . that the work had . been done under the direction of his partner , who died . before the job was uncovered . The Sanitary Engineer describes the work of two other plumbers who have recently been arrested . In one case the bad . plumbing was in twelve houses on the west side of Ninth:avenue , above One Hundred and . Fifth-street . In the other the defendant is held on account of work done in twelve houses on Madison-avenue , near One Hun dyed and . Twentieth-street , three or four years ago . He was at that time arrested and . fined . He promised to make the changes that were required , asserting that his workmen had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not kept his word . Something more than a fine is required for the punishment of such men . Many a plumber who has deliberately done such work as was exposed in these cases is really guilty of manslaughter .
