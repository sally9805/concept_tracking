txt " Then I say before the living God that I never saw such a check . " These were the words uttered in a loud voice , with uplifted hand , that cost the son . James B. Belford , of Colorado , $100 in the Criminal Court this afternoon during the progress of the star route trial . After Rerdell 's direct examination had been completed , about two weeks ago , Mr. Ingersoll examined tins in relation to Dorsey 's check-book and check-stubs . He drew from him the statement that there was a check drawn for $2,000 la favor of Mr. Belford and marked on the stub " charge to mail account . " Counsel for the Government interposed and objected , and at Mr. Merrick 's suggestion the examination in that direction was discontinued and the testimony in regard to Mr. Belford stricken out . Mr. Belford most emphatically and comprepensively denied that he had ever heard of such a check , or ever had any financial dealings with Dorsey . He endeavored to discover whether or not any such check had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found no trace of it . Since the day when the defense drew this stateanent from Rerdell Mr. Belford has been anxious to go on the witness stand so that he could repeat there the denial which he had Oven to the press . The defense began to put In their case to-day . and Mr. Belford was the Erst witness . Having been for several years the sole member of the House of Representatives from Colorado , he was examined as to the growth of that ' State and the necessity there for additional mail facilities in 1878 and 1879 . He had signed letters and indorsed petitions which had been used upon some of the routes mentioned in the indictment and these papers he identified . He declared that be had frequently called upon Brady while the latter was in the Post Office and urged him to multiply the mails for the people of Colorado . Ile defense in this way endeavored to show that Brady had granted increase and expedition in response to the requests of members of Congress and the people they represented . or some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of settlements in his State . At last Mr. Ingersoll asked : " Did you ever receive any money . or any check for any money , from S. W. Dorsey or any one of these defendants in consideration of what you did in this matter ? " Counsel for the Government objected , and the objection was sustained by the court . Mr. derrick directed the attention of counsel for the defense to the fact that what Rerdeil had ; aid about Mr. Belford had been stricken from the record . It was no part of the Governenents case , but had been brought out on crossexamingion . He suggested that the defendants should produce the check-book if they desired to show that Rerdell 's statement was Pot true . He predicted that many side issues trust ; be examined if the court should allow ' this matter to be investigated . " You had better let the matter rest , " said he . The Judge ruled that the defense could not be allowed to contradict Rerdeil in that way , having the check-stubs and account-books in their possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not on trial , and Rerdell 's testimony did not necessarily show that be had done anything wrong . The check knight have been drawn and he might never have seen it or the money . Mr. Ingersoll and Judge Wilson made many attempts to get in the question framed in some other way , but were unsuccessful . It is probable that they desired a contradiction of that part of Rerdell 's testimony as greatly as they desired to secure for Mr. Belford an opportuity to present his denial . The court said Mr. Belford could accomplish leis purpose by making an affidavit before a J ustice of the Peace . The testimony relating to him had been brought out by the defense , and was part of the defendants ' case . They could not contradict it by secondary evidence while they had the primary evidence  --  the *heck-stubs and books  --  in their possession . All this was very unsatisfactory to Mr. Belford . After further examination concerning the development of Colorado , a recess was taken . After the recess Mr. Belford identified two or three recommendations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently unimportant , was asked in cross-examination , and the witness stepped down . His manper had already convinced those who knew him that he was sorely disappointed and angryIsecause.he had been unable to testify about the check . Taking his hat in his hand , he walked down to the place where Mr. Ingersoll and other counsel for the defense were sitting . When he reached Mr. Ingersoll he turned and faced the court . I would like to ask the indulgence of the court and the courtesy of the bar , " said he , " to make a personal statement regarding a charge affecting my honor . " Mr. Merrick objected , saying that Rerdell 's statement had been drawn out by the defense and eliminated from the record upon his ! motion . Mr. Belford could make a statement to the country . " But it is not right , " continued Mr. Belford , raising his right hand and speaking in a husky voice , which showed his emotion , " to assassinate a man and refuse to allow him even to draw the dagger out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceedings of the court ought not to be interrupted in order to allow a witness , who happened to be a lawer , to step from the stand and then from the Ip lace occupied by counsel , say to the jury what the court had not allowed him to say while testifying as a witness . " Give me the poor privilege of making a statement , " appealed Mr. Belford excitedly , in a tone well known to those who have heard it upon the floor of the House ; " only give me that poor privilege . " The scene had become intensely dramatic . Every one in the court-room was leaning forward , or trying to force his way through the crowd to get a sight of the tall man with red flair and beard , who was standing boldly before the venerable Judge , with his head thrown back and his right hand outstretched in an appealing way . This man had been for five sears a Supreme Court Justice in Colorado . Judge Wylie became severe . " This is not a public meeting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a case judicially , and that is all we can do . " " Then I say , before the living God , " cried Judge Belford in great excitement , rising to his utmost height and thrusting his right band high in the air , " that I never saw such a check ! " He turned on his heel and began to walk toward the door . His declaration had taken all by surprise . For a moment there was confupion in the room . The Judge was astounded . Ile rapped upon his desk . " Come back here , Sir , " said he , sharply bring that man back here ; bring Mr. Belford here . " Judge Belford turned again and came back to the place where be had made his denial . " What did he say ? " asked Judge Wylie , loaning over his desk . Mr. Carpenter was understood to repeat the statement , but Judge Belford once more declared : " Before the living God , I never saw such a check . " " That is contempt of court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon you a fine of $100 , and you shall stand committed until h is paid . This is a degree of impertinence n d insolence which can not be tolerated . " " All right , " said Judge Belford defiantly . " I 'll pay it if it 's $500 . No man shall assassinate my character and leave me without remedy . " Mr. Ingersoll arose and tried to pour oil upon the troubled waters . He pleaded for Judge Belford . He urged the court to take into aceount the circumstances and remit the fine . " I appreciate the circumstances , " said Judge Wylie . Mr. Ingersoll described Judge Belford 's iniignation , and remarked that Judge Wylie would have gone as far . Judge Wylie said he had no right to use the Court as an illustration . Mr. Ingersoll having denounced Rerdell 's testimony as a falsehood , Mr. Merrick declared that Judge Belford 's statement was not a contradiction of it even if it wars a falsehood. which he would not admit . He again challenged the defense to produce the books @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have justice by demanding the books . Rerdell had not said that he saw the check paid , but that he saw the check and made the entry on the book . Mr. Merrick also said that he understood from something which had occurred during the recess that such a statement as that made by Judge Belford was contemplated . Mr. Davidge said he had talked with Judge Belford during the recess , and he presumed that eavesdroppers and Government spies bad been near at hand . Apparently forgetting that the defense had drawn out the testimony against Belford , he said that Belford had been outrageously and maliciously assailed . " As for the check-book , " said he , " the prosecution will get as much out of it as they desire before the end of the case . " Judge Wylie reviewed Judge Belford 's official career as showing his intelligence and his acquaintance with the rights of a court and the privileges of a witness . He must have known , he said , that the court could not grant the request which he had made . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . and the court could not remit the fine . " I have no personal feeling about this , " said the Judge , " but so long as I preside here I will ' vindicate the authority of the court . " The court then allowed Mr. Ingersoll to nay the fine by giving his check , and Judge Belford departed . Ex-Senator Teller , Secretary of the Interior , then testified as to the letters and petitions for increase and expedition which he had indorsed and filed and as to his personal requests that Brady should give the people of Colorado increased mail facilities . He did not testify so freely as at the first trial , and it was with some difficulty that Mr. Ingersoll drew out his opinions about the Government 's duty to furnish fast and frequent mails to little groups of persons in the far West without regard to the cost of service . He was led to describe the growth of Colorado and the extension of railways there . After a dispute about the production of papers for the use of the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following card ; To the Country : Rerdell testified that I gave J. B. Belford a cheek for $2.000 , and that that charge appears upon the books which he kept . I never gave Belford a check for one cent . There never was a transaction of any kind , name , or nature between Belford and myself . No such charge appears in any book of mine . No such check was ever given ; no person for Belford or for me ever transacted by my authority business involving 1 pent . The whole story is a vile , vicious . and cowardly falsehood , without a glimmer of truth upon which to build a mountain of perjury . I say this much , and at this time , for the reason that Belford himself was to-day denied the right to tell the truth from the same stand from which Rerdell uttered this falsehood.
