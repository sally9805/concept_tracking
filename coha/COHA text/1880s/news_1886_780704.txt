txt Congressman James M. Riggs , who represents the Twelfth Illinois District in the lower house , has failed of renomination , In the convention which met at Beardstown yesterday with a blare of brass bands and the certainty of a deadlock , Riggs was able only to control the four votes from Scott County , where he was born . and was considered hopelessly defeated , though the convention adjourned without making a nomination . There are eight counties in the district , and there were six candidates before the convention . George A. Anderson , of Adams County , and Scott IVike , who had captured Pike , Calhoun , and Cass Counties by clever manipulation of the preceding minor conventions , had each 23 votes . Henry C. Withers had the 11 votes of Greene County , which county " Jim " Ward said had always been loyal to the Democracy and ought to have a show now by having Withers nominated . Adam A. Goodrich carried Jersey County 's seven in his pocket , and John C. Teely clung to the six from Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of the candidates . This afternoon the convention nominated George A.Anderson , of Adams County , to succeed Representative Riggs . The district is about 6,000 Democratic , and Anderson will probably be the next Representative . The forenoon to-day was frittered away without any change in the result of yesterday 's voting. , the limit rule holding the representatives from each county together . On the two hundred and fifteenth ballot Greene County , which had been giving its 11 votes to H. C. Withers , broke up , giving 10 of its votes to Anderson and 1 to Woke . The unit rule Was knocked to pieces , but it took six more ballots to get the combinations straightened out and nominate Anderson . Thirty-eight votes were cast for him and 36 for Wike.
