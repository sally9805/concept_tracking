*OUT the ist of December , i86r , Mr. Lincoln , who saw more clearly than McClellan , then Generalin-Chief , the urgent necessity for some movement of the army , suggested to him a plan of campaign which , afterward much debated and discussed and finally rejected , is now seen to have been eminently wise and sagacious . He made a brief autograph memorandum of his plan , which he handed to McClellan , who kept it for ten days and returned it to Mr. Lincoln , with a hurried memorandum in pencil , showing that it made little impression on his mind . The memorandum and answer are so illustrative of the two men that we give them here in full , copied from the original manu-script : General McClellan returned the memorandum with this reply : I inclose the paper you left with me , filled as you requested . In arriving at the numbers given , I have left the minimum number in garrison and observation .

Johnston reports his " effective total " at this time as about 47,000 men-less than one-third what McClellan imagined it . Lincoln , however , did not insist upon knowing what the general 's " other plan was ; nor did he press further upon his attention the suggestion that had been so scantily considered and so curtly dismissed . But as the weeks went by in inaction , his thoughts naturally dwelt upon the opportunities afforded by an attack on the enemy 's right , and the project took more and more definite shape in his mind . Congress convened on the 2d of December , and one of its earliest subjects of discussion was the battle of Ball 's Bluff . Roscoe Conkling in the House of Representatives , and Zachariah Chandler in the Senate , brought forward resolutions for the appointment of committees to investigate and determine the responsibility for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order a permanent joint committee of three senators and four representatives to inquire into the conduct of the war . This action was unanimously agreed to by the House , and the committee was appointed , consisting of senators Wade , Chandler , and Johnson , and of representatives Gooch , Covode , Julian , and Odell . This committee , known as the Committee on the Conduct of the War , was for four years one of the most important agencies in the country . It assumed , and was sustained by Congress in assuming , a great range of prerogative . It became a stern and zealous censor of both the army and the government ; it called soldiers and If it were determined to make a forward movement of the Army of the Potomac , without waiting further increase of numbers , or better drill and discipline , how long would it require to actually get in motion ?

The remainder of the movable force on that side move rapidly to the crossing of the Occoquan by the road from Alexandria towards Richmond ; there to he joined by the whole movable force from north-east of the river , having landed from the Potomac just below the mouth of the Occoquan , move by land up the south side of that stream , to the crossing-point named ; then the whole move together , by the road thence to Brentville , and beyond , to the railroad just south of its crossing of Broad Run , a strong detachment of cavalry having gone rapidly ahead to destroy the railroad bridges south and north of the point .

It claimed to speak for the loyal people of the United States , and this claim generally met with the sympathy and support of a majority of the people 's representatives in Congress assembled . It was often hasty and unjust in its judgment , but always earnest , patriotic , and honest ; it was assailed with furious denunciation and defended with headlong and indiscriminating eulogy ; and on the whole it must be said to have merited more praise than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have seen , senators Chandler and Wade , representing the more ardent and eager spirits in Congress , had repeatedly pressed upon the Government the necessity of employing the Army of the Potomac in active operations ; and now that they felt themselves formally intrusted with a mandate from the people to that effect , were still more urgent and persistent . General McClellan and his immediate following treated the committee with something like contempt . But the President , with his larger comprehension of popular forces , knew that he must take into account an agency of such importance ; and though he steadily defended General McClellan , and his deliberateness of preparation , before the committee , he constantly assured him in private that not a moment ought to be lost in getting himself in readiness for a forward movement . A free people , accustomed to considering public affairs as their own , can stand reverses and disappointments ; they are capable of making great exertions and great sacrifices : the one thing that they can not endure is inaction on the part of their rulers ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some result of their exertions and sacrifices . December was the fifth month that General McClellan had been in command of the greatest army ever brought together on this continent . It was impossible to convince the country that a longer period of preparation was necessary before this army could be led against one inferior in numbers , and not superior in discipline or equipment . As a matter of fact , the country did not believe the rebel army to be equal to the army of the Union in any of these particulars . It did not share the strange delusion of General McClellan and his staff in regard to the numbers of his adversary , and the common sense of the people was nearer right in its judgment than the computations of the general and his inefficient secret service . McClellan reported to the Secretary of War that Johnston 's army , at the end of October , numbered 15o , ooo , and that he would therefore require , to make an advance movement with the Army of the Potomac , a force of 240,000 . Johnston 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ! It was useless to try to convince General McClellan of the impossibility of such a concentration of troops in front of him ; he simply added together the aggregates furnished by the guesses of his spies and implicitly believed the monstrous sum . It is worthy of notice that the Confederate general rarely fell into the corresponding error . At the time that McClellan was quadrupling , in his imagination , the rebel force , Johnston was estimating the army under McClellan at exactly its real strength . Axvare that his army was less than one-third as strong as the Union forces , Johnston contented himself with neutralizing the army at Washington , passing the time in drilling and disciplining his troops , which , according to his own account , were seriously in need of it . He could not account for the inactivity of the Union army . Military operations , he says , were practicable until the end of December ; but he was never molested . Our military exercises had never been interrupted . No demonstrations were made by the troops of that army , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a large mixed force . The Federal cavalry rarely ventured beyond the protection of infantry , and the ground between the two armies had been less free to it than to that of the Confederate army . There was at no time any serious thought of attacking the Union forces in front of Washington . In the latter part of September , General Johnston had thought it possible for the Richmond government to give him such additional troops as to enable him to take the offensive , and Jefferson Davis had come to headquarters at Fairfax Court House to confer with the principals on that subject . At this conference , held on the ist of October , it was taken for granted that no attack could be made , with any chances of success , upon the Union army in its position before Washington ; but it was thought that , if enough force could be concentrated for the purpose , the Potomac might be crossed at the nearer ford , Maryland brought into rebellion , and a battle delivered in rear of Washington , where McClellan would fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present , Johnston , Beauregard , and G. W. Smith , beginning with the last , how many troops would be required for such a movement . Smith answered " fifty thousand " ; Johnston and Beauregard both said " sixty thousand " ; and all agreed that they would require a large increase of ammunition and means of transportation . Mr. Davis said it was impossible to reinforce them to that extent , and the plan was dropped . It is hard to believe that during this same month of October , General McClellan , in a careful letter to // the War Department , with an army , according to his own account , of " 147,695 present for duty , " should have bewailed his numerical inferiority to the enemy , and begged that all other departments should be stripped of their troops and stores to enable him to make a forward movement , which he professed himself anxious to make " not later than the 25th of November , " if the Government would give him men enough to meet the enemy on equal terms . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high intelligence and physically brave , as McClellan undoubtedly was , must not be lost sight of . It furnishes the sole explanation of many things otherwise inexplicable : He rarely estimated the force inTimediately opposed to him at less than double its actual strength , and in his correspondence with the Government he persistently minimized his own force . This rule he applied only to the enemy in his immediate vicinity . He had no sympathy with commanders at a distance who asked for reinforcements . When Rosecrans succeeded him in western Virginia , and wanted additional troops , General McClellan was shocked at the unreasonable request . When William Tecumseh Sherman telegraphed that 75,000 men were needed to defend the Ohio line , and to make a forward movement into Kentucky , he handed the dispatch to Mr. Lincoln , who was sitting in his headquarters at the moment , with the remark , " The man is crazy . " Every man sent to any other department he regarded as a sort of robbery of the Army of the Potomac . All his demands were complied with to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not only in a material , but in a moral sense as well , the President gave him everything that he could . In addition to that mighty army , he gave him his fullest confidence and support . All through the autumn he stood by him , urging him in private to lose no time , but defending him in public against the popular impatience ; and when winter came on , and the voice of Congress , nearly unanimous in demanding active operations , added its authoritative tones to the clamor of the country , the President endangered his own popularity by insisting that the general should be allowed to take his own time for an advance . In the latter part of December , McClellan , as already stated , fell seriously ill , and the enforced paralysis of the army that resulted from this illness and lasted several weeks added a keener edge to the public anxiety . The President painfully appreciated how much of justice there was in the general criticism , which he was doing all that he could to allay . He gave himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military situation . He read a large num ber of strategical works . He pored over the reports from the various departments and districts of the field of war . He held long conferences with eminent generals and admirals , and astonished them by the extent of his special knowledge and the keen intelligence of his questions . He at last convinced himself that there was no necessity for any further delay ; that the army of the Potomac was as nearly ready as it ever would be to take the field against the enemy ; and , feeling that he could not wait any longer , on the ioth of January , after calling at General McClellan 's house and learning that the general was unable to see him , he sent for Generals McDowell and Franklin , wishing to take counsel with them in regard to the possibility of beginning active operations with the army before Washington . General McDoxvell has preserved an accurate report of this conference . The President said that he was in great distress ; to use his own expression If something were not soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair ; and if General McClellan did not want to use the army he would like to borrow it , provided he could see how it might be made to do something . In answer to a direct question , put by the President to General McDowell , that accomplished soldier gave a frank and straightforward expression of his conviction that by ' an energetic movement upon both flanks of the enemy - a movement rendered entirely practicable by the superior numbers of the Union army - he could be forced from his works and compelled to accept battle on terms favorable to us . General Franklin rather favored an attack upon Richmond , by way of York River . A question arising as to the possibility of obtaining the necessary transportation , the President directed both generals to return the next evening , and in the mean time to inform themselves thoroughly as to the matter in question . They spent the following day in this duty and went the next evening to the Executive Mansion with what information they had been able to procure , and submitted a paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time and means required to take the army to a distant base , operations could now best be ' undertaken from the present base substantially as proposed by McDowell . The Secretaries of State and of the Treasury , who were present , coincided in this view , and the Postmaster-General , Mr. Blair , alone opposed it . They separated to meet the next day at * o'clock . General Meigs , having been called into conference , concurred in the opinion that a movement from the present base was preferable ; but no definite resolutioji was taken , as General McClellan was reported as fully // recovered from his illness , and another meeting was arranged for Monday , the *3th , at the White House , where the three members of the Cabinet already mentioned , with McDowell , Franklin , Meigs , and General McClellan himseli were present . At the request of the President , McDowell made a statement of what he and Franklin had done under Mr. Lincoln 's orders , and gave his reasons for advising a movement to the front . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and made an apology for the position in which he stood . McClellan was not inclined to relieve the situation of any awkwardness there might be in it . He merely said , " coldly , if not curtly , " to McDowell , " You are entitled to have any opinion you please , " and made no further remark or comment . The President spoke somewhat at length on the matter , and General McClellan said very briefly " that the case was so clear a blind man could see it " and went off instinctively upon the inadequacy of his forces . The Secretary of the Treasury , whose sympathies were with that section of his party which had already lost all confidence in General McClellan , asked him point blank what he intended to do with the army , and when he intended doing it . A long silence ensued . Even if the question had been a proper one , it is doubtful whether General McClellan xvould have answered it ; as it was , it must have required some self-control for him to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buell in Kentucky must move first ; and then refused to answer the question unless ordered to do so . The President asked him if he counted upon any particular time , not asking what the time was - but had he in his own mind any particular time fixed when a movement could be begun ? This question was evidently put as affording a means of closing a conference which was becoming disagreeable if not dangerous . McClellan promptly answered in the affirmative , and the President rejoined , " Then J will adjourn this meeting . " It is a remarkable fact that although the plan recommended by these generals was exactly the plan suggested six weeks before by : - the President to McClellan , neither of them made the slightest reference to that incident . That Mr. Lincoln did not refer to a matter so close to his heart is a striking instance of his reticence and his magnanimity ; that General McClellan never mentioned it would seem to show that he thought so little of the matter as to have forgotten it . He seemed also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no reference to it in his report . He says , referring to this period : About the middle of January , upon recovering from a severe illness , I found that excessive anxiety for an immediate movement of the Army of the Potomac had taken possession of the minds of the Administration . The last words of the phrase refer not only to the President , but to Mr. Stanton , the new Secretary of War , who began as soon as he took charge of his department to ply the commander of the army with continual incitements to activity . All suggestions of this sort , whether coming from the Government , Congress , or the press , General McClellan received with surprise and displeasure , and the resentment and vexation of his immediate friends and associates found vent in expressions of contempt for unmilitary critics , which , being reported , only increased the evil that provoked them . He at last laid before the President his plan for attacking Richmond by the lower Chesapeake , which the President disapproved , having previously convinced himself of the superior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Generals McDowell , Franklin , and Meigs , who were ignorant of the fact that it was his . Further delay ensued , the President not being willing to accept a plan condemned by his own judgment and by the best professional opinions that he could obtain , and General McClellan being equally reluctant to adopt a plan that was not his own . The President at last , at the end of his patience , convinced that nothing would be done unless he intervened by a positive command , issued on the 27th of January his " General War Order , No. i . " He wrote it without consultation with any one , and read it to the Cabinet , not for their sanction , but for their information . The order directed that the 22d day of February , 1862 , be the day for a general movement of the land and naval forces of the United States against the insurgent forces ; that especially the army at and about Fortress Monroe , the Army of the Potomac , the Army of western Virginia , the army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo , and a naval force in the Gulf of Mexico , be ready to move on that day ; that all other forces , both land and naval , with their respective commanders , obey existing orders for the time , and be ready to obey additional orders when duly given ; that the heads of departments , and especially the Secretaries of War and of the Navy , with all their subordinates , and the General-in-Chief , with all other commanders and subordinates of land and naval forces , will severally be held to their strict and full responsibilities for prompt execution of this order . Four days later , as a necessary result of this general summons to action , a special instruction , called " President 's Special War Order , No. i , " was issued to General McClellan , commanding that all the disposable force of the Army of the Potomac , after providing safely for the defense of Washington , be formed into an expedition for the im // mediate object of seizing and occupying a point upon the railroad south-westward of what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the discretion of the General-in-Chief , and the expedition to move before or on the 22d day of February next . This is the President 's suggestion of December i , put at last in the form of a command . It would not have been characteristic of General McClellan to accept such an order as final , nor of Mr. Lincoln to refuse to listen to his objections and to a full statement of his own views . The President even went so far as to give him , in the following note , dated February 3 , a schedule of points on which he might base his objections and develop his views . Mv DEAR SIR : You and I have distinct and different plans for a movement of the Army of the Potomac - yours to be done by the Chesapeake , up the Rappahannock , to Urbana , and across land to the terminus of the railroad on the York River ; mine to move directly to a point on the railroads south-west of Manassas . If you will give me satisfactory answers to the following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : First . Does not your plan involve a greatly larger expenditure of time and money than mine ? Second . Wherein is a victory more certain by your plan than mine ? Third . Wherein is a victory more valuable by your plan than mine ? Fourth . In fact , would it not be less valuable in this , that it would break no great line of the enemy 's communications , while mine would ? Fifth . In case of disaster , would not a retreat be more difficult by your plan than mine ? Yours truly , ABRAHAM LINCOLN . This elicited from General McClellan a long letter , dated the same day , in which he dwelt with great emphasis on all the possible objections that could lie against a direct movement from Washington , and insisted with equal energy upon the advantages of a campaign by the lower Chesapeake . He rejects without argument the suggestion of an attack on both flanks of the enemy , on the ground of insufficient force , a ground that we have seen to be visionary . He says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is impracticable on account of the length of the line , and confines his statement to a detail of the dangers and difficulties of an attack on the Confederate right by the line of the Occoquan . He insists that he xvillbe met at every point bya determined resistance . To use his own words , he brings out , in bold relief , the great advantage possessed by the enemy in the strong central position he occupies , with roads diverging in every direction , and a strong line of defense enabling him to remain on the defensive , with a small force on one flank , while he concentrates everything on the other for a decisive action . Even if he succeeded in such a movement , he thought little of its results ; they would be merely " the possession of the field of battle , the evacuation of the line of the upper Poto mac by the enemy , and the moral effect of the victory . " They would not end the war , the result he seemed to propose to himself in the one decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own plan , he hopes by moving from his new base on the lower Chesapeake to accomplish this enormous and final success - to force the enemy either " to heat us in a position selected by ourselves , disperse , or pass beneath the Caudine forks . " The point which he thought promised the most brilliant results was Urbana , on the lower Rappahannock ; " but one march from West Point ,  --  on the York River , at the junction of the Pamunkey and the Mattapony ,  --  the key of that region , and thence but two marches to Richmond . " He enjoys the prospect of brilliant and rapid movements by which the rebel armies shall be cut off in detail , Richmond taken , and the rebellion brought to a close . He says finally : My judgment as a general is clearly in favor of this project o much am I in favor of the southern line of operations , that I would prefer the move from Fortress Monroe as a base - as a certain though less brilliant movement than that from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the assumptions upon which this letter was based have since proved erroneous . The enormous force which McClellan ascribed to Johnston existed only in his imagination and in the wild stories of his spies . His force was about three times that of Johnston , and was therefore not insufficient for an attack upon one flank of the enemy while the other was held in check . It is now clearly known that the determined resistance that he counted upon , if he should attack by the line of the Occoquan , would not have been made . General Johnston says that about the middle of February he was sent for in great haste to Richmond , and on arriving there was told by Jefferson Davis that the Government thought of withdrawing the army to " a less exposed position . " Johnston replied that the withdrawal of the army from Centreville would be necessary before McClellan 's invasion ,  - -  which was to be looked for as soon as the roads were practicable ,  --  but thought that it might be postponed for the present . He left Richmond , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to fall back as soon as practicable , and the moment he returned to his camp he began his preparations to retire at once from a position which both he and the Richmond government considered absolutely untenable . On the 22d of February he says : " Orders were given to the chiefs of the quartermaster 's and subsistence departments to remove the military property in the // depots at Manassas Junction and its dependencies to Gordonsville as quickly as possible . " The railroads were urged to work to their utmost capacity . The line of the Occoquan , against which McClellan was arguing so strenuously to the President , was substantially the route by which Johnston expected him , believing , like the thorough soldier that he was , that it would be taken , because " invasion by that route would be the most difficult to meet " ; and knowing that he could not cope with the Federal army north of the Rappahannock , he was ready to retire behind that stream at the first news of McClellan 's advance . Everything now indicates that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to move upon the enemy in his front in the latter part of February * or the first days of March , one of the cheapest victories ever gained by a fortunate general awaited him . He would have struck an enemy greatly inferior in strength , equipment , and discipline , in the midst of a difficult retreat already begun , encumbered by a vast accumulation of provisions and stores , t which would have become the prize of the victor . He would not have won the battle that was to end the war . That sole battle was a dream of youth and ambition ; the war was not of a size to be finished by one fight . But he would have gained , at slight cost , what would have been in reality a substantial success , and would have appeared , in its effect upon public opinion and the morale of the army , an achieveinent of great importance . The enemy , instead of quietly retiring at his own time , would have seemed to be driven beyond the Rapidan . The clearing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the capture of millions of pounds of stores , would have afforded a relief to the anxious public mind that the National cause sorely needed at that time , and which General McClellan needed most of all . j These facts , that are now so clear to every one , were not so evident then ; and although the President and the leading men in the Gov * The following extract shows that General McClelIan himself had some vague thought of moving at that time : " February came and on the i3th General i'IcClellan said to me , In ten days I shall be in Richmond . ' A little surprised at the near approach of a consummation so devoutly to be wished , I asked , ' What is your plan , General ? ' Oh , ' said he , ' I mean to cross the river , attack and carry their batteries , and push on after the enemy . ' Have you any gun-boats to aid in the attack on the batteries ? ' No , they are not needed ; all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty that will answer . ' I did not think it worth while to reply ; but made a note of the date and waited . The ten days passed away ; no movement , and no preparation for a movement , had been made . " From a memorandum written by Hon. S. P. Chase . Schucker 's " Life of S. P. Chase , " p. 446 . VOL . XXXVI. - i27. eminent and in Congress were strongly of the opinion that the plan favored by Mr. Lincoln and approved by McDowell , Meigs , and Franklin was the right one , it was a question of the utmost gravity whether he should force the General-in-Chief to adopt it against his obstinate protest . It would be too much to ask that any government should assume such a responsibility and risk . On the other hand , the removal of the general from the command of the Army of the Potomac would have been a measure not less serious . There was no successor ready at all his equal in accomplishments , in executive efficiency , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of his exasperating slowness , the President still entertained for him a strong feeling of personal regard . He therefore , after much deliberation and deep distress of mind , yielded his convictions , gave up his plan and adopted that of General McClellan for a movement by the lower Chesapeake . He never took a resolution which cost him more in his own feelings , and in the estimation of his supporters in Congress and in the country at large . He made no explanation of the reasons that induced this resolution ; he thought it better to suffer any misrepresentation rather than to communicate his own grave misgivings to the country . The Committee on the Conduct of the War , who were profoundly grieved and displeased by this decision , made only this grim reference to it : Your committee have no evidence , either oral or documentary , of the discussions that ensued , or of the arguments that were submitted to the consideration of the President , that led him to relinquish his own line of operations and consent to the one proposed by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , held in February , 1862 . This council , which , the committee say , was the first ever called by McClellan , and then only at the direction of the President , was composed of twelve general officers - McDowell , Sumner , Heintzelman , Barnard , Keyes , Fitz-John Porter , Franklin , W. F. Smith , McCall , Blenker , Andrew Porter , and Naglee The subsistence department had collected at Manassas Junction more than three million pounds of provisions . They had also two million pounds of meat at Thoroughfare Gap , besides large herds of cattle and hogs . This accumulation was against the wish and to the great embarrassment of General Johnston . II " Johnston 's Narrative , " pp. 98 and 99. t Mr. William Swinton , who habitually takes sides with McClellan against the President where it is possible , says on this point : " Had Johnston stood , a battle with good prospect of success might have been delivered . But had he , as there was great likelihood he would do , and as it is now certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the line of the Rapidan , his compulsory retirement would have been esteemed a positive victory to the Union arms . " Swinton , " Army of the Potomac , " p. 73. // ( from Hooker 's division ) . The first four voted against the Urbana plan ; Keyes only favored it on condition that the Potomac batteries should first be reduced . The rest voted for it without conditions . This was the council afterward referred to by Stanton when he said , " We saw ten generals afraid to fight . " * This plan of campaign having been definitely adopted , Mr. Lincoln urged it forward as eagerly as if it had been his own . John Tucker , one of the Assistant Secretaries of War , was charged by the President and Mr. Stanton with the entire task of transporting the Army of the Potomac to its new base , and the utmost diligence was enjoined upon him . Quartermasters Ingalls and Hodges were assigned to assist him . We shall see that he performed the prodigious task intrusted to him in a manner not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But in the mean while there were two things that the President was anxious to have done , and General McClellan undertook them with apparent good-will . One was to reopen the line of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , the other to clear out the rebel batteries that still obstructed the navigation of the Potomac . For the first , extensive preparations were made : a large body of troops was collected at Harper 's Ferry ; canal-boats were brought there in sufficient quantity to make a permanent bridge . General McClellan went to the place and , finding everything satisfactory for the operation , telegraphed for a large additional force of cavalry , artillery , and a division of infantry to rendezvous at once at Harper 's Ferry , to cross as soon as the bridge was completed , which would be only the work of a day , and then to push on to Winchester and Strasburg . It was only on the morning of the next day , when the attempt was made to pass the canal-boats through the lift-lock , that it was discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The general thus discovered that his permanent bridge , so long planned , and from which so much had been expected , was impossible . t He countermanded his order for the troops ; contented himself with a reconnaissance to Charleston and Martinsburg ; and returned to Washington , as he says , " well satisfied with what had been accomplished . " He was much surprised at finding that his satisfaction was not shared by the President . Mr. Lincoln 's slow anger was thoroughly roused at this ridiculous outcome of an important enterprise , and he received the general on his return in a manner that somewhat disturbed his complacency . McClellan went on in his leisurely way , H. , Diary . t Chase in his Diary said the expedition died oflockjaw. preparing for a movement upon the batteries near the Occoquan , undisturbed by the increasing signs of electric perturbation at the Executive Mansion and the Capitol , which answered but faintly to the growing excitement in the North . The accumulating hostility and distrust of General McClellan ,  - -  totally unjust as it affected his loyalty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the way that he thought best ,  --  though almost entirely unknown to him , was poured upon the President , the Government , and the leading members of Congress in letters , and conversations , and newspaper leaders . Mr. Lincoln felt the injustice of much of this criticism , but he also felt powerless to meet it , unless some measures were adopted to force the general into an activity which was as necessary to his own reputation as to the national cause . The 22d of February came and passed , and the President 's order to move on that day was not obeyed . McClellan 's inertia prevailed over the President 's anxious eagerness . On the 8th of March , Mr. Lincoln issued two more important General Orders . The first directed General McClellan to divide the Army of the Potomac into four army corps , to be commanded respectively by Generals Irvin McDowell , E. V. Sumner , S. P. Heintzelman , and E. D. Keyes ; the forces to 1 ) e left in front of Washington were to be placed in command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formed , to be commanded by General N. P. Banks . For months this measure had been pressed upon General McClellan by the Government . An army of 150,000 men , it was admitted , could not be adequately commanded by the machinery of divisions and brigades alone . But though McClellan accepted this view in principle , he could not be brought to put it into practice . He said that he would prefer to command the army personally on its first campaign , and then select the corps commanders for their behavior in the field . The Government thought better to make the organization at once , giving the command of corps to the ranking division commanders . The fact that of the four generals chosen three had been in favor of an immediate movement against the enemy in front of Washington will of course be considered as possessing a certain significance . It is usually regarded as a grievance by the partisans of General McClellan .

That any movement as aforesaid , en route for a new base of operations , which may be ordered by the General-inChief , and which may be intended to move upon the Chesapeake Bay , shall begin to move upon the bay as early as the i8th of March instant , and the Generalin-Chief shall be responsible that it moves as early as that day .

THOMAS , Adlutant- General* This order has always been subject to the severest criticism from General McClellan 's partisans ; but if we admit that it was proper for the President to issue any order at all , there can be no valid objection made to the substance of this one . Jt was indispensable that Washington should be left secure ; it would have been madness to allow General McClellan to take all the troops to the Peninsula , leaving the Potomac obstructed by the enemy 's batteries , so near the capital ; and the fixing of a date beyond which the beginning of the movement should not be postponed had been shown to be necessary by the exasperating experience of the past eight months . The criticism so often made , that a general who required to have such orders as these given him should have been dismissed the service , is the most difficult of all to meet . Nobody felt so deeply as Mr. Lincoln the terrible embarrassment of having a general in command of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every suggestion of advance with demands for reinforcements , who met entreaties and reproaches with unending arguments to show the superiority of the enemy and the insufficiency of his own resources , and who yet possessed in an eminent degree the enthusiastic devotion of his friends and the general confidence of the rank and file . There was so much of executive efficiency and ability about him that the President kept on , hoping to the last that if he could once " get him started " he would then handle the army well and do great things with it . MANASSAS EVACUATED . SUNDAY , the 9th of March , was a day of swiftly succeeding emotions at the Executive Mansion . The news of the havoc wrought by 4 919 the Merrimac in Hampton Roads the day before arrived in the morning , and was received with profound chagrin by the calmest spirits and with something like consternation by the more excitable . But in the afternoon astonishing tidings came to reverse the morning s depression . The first was of the timely arrival of the Monitor , followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monroe , by the news of her battle and victory . The exultation of the Government over this providential success was changed to amazement by the receipt of intelligence that the rebel batteries on the Potomac were already abandoned , and the tale of surprises was completed by the news which came in the evening that the Confederate army had abandoned their works at Manassas , retreating southward . General McClellan was with the President and the Secretary of War when this message arrived , and he received it , as might have been expected , with incredulity , which at last gave way to stupefaction . He started at once across the river , ostensibly to verify the intelligence , and in his bewilderment and confusion issued an order that night for an immediate advance of the army upon Centreville and Manassas . In the elaborate report by which he strove , a year after the fact , to shift from himself to others the responsibility of all his errors , occurs this remarkable sentence : The retirement of the enemy towards Richmond had been expected as the natural consequence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this course immediately on ascertaining that such a movement was intended , while it relieved me from the results of the undue anxiety of my superiors and attested the character of the design , was unfortunate in that the then almost impassable roads between our positions and theirs deprived us of the opportunity for inflicting damage usually afforded by the withdrawal of a large army in the face of a powerful adversary . This was the theory immediately adopted by himself , propagated among his staff ; communicated to the Prince de Joinville , who published it in France on his return there , and to the Comte de Paris , who after twenty years incorporated it in his history - that the enemy , having heard of his scheme for going to the Peninsula , through the indiscretion of the Government , had suddenly taken flight from Manassas . General McClellan asserts this in his report a dozen times ; he reiterates it as if he felt that his reputation depended upon it . If it is not true , then in the long contest with the President in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right and McClellan was wrong . The straightforward narrative of General Johnston , and the official orders and correspondence of the Confederate officers , show PLANS OF CAMPAIGN . // that there is not the slightest foundation for this theory of General McClellan 's . They show , on the contrary , that the rebel government , nearly a month before this , had concluded that Johnston 's position was untenable ; that Johnston had shared in the belief , and had begun his preparations to retire on the 22d of February ; that instead of " ascertaining McClellan 's intention to move to the lower Chesapeake , " he had been of the opinion that McClellan would advance upon the line designated by Mr. Lincoln , because it was the best line for attack and the most difficult for the rebels to defend ; that he knew McClellan 's enormous superiority in numbers and did not purpose to risk everything in resisting him there ; that on the 5th of March , having received information of unusual activity in our army in the direction of Dumfries , he gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He proceeded with the greatest deliberation , writing to one of his generals on the i5th , " McClellan seems not to value time especially . " His subordinates were equally convinced that the Confederate right was the object of the Union advance ; Holmes wrote in that sense to Lee on the i4th of March . Lee , who was then directing military operations in Richmond , answered him on the i6th , concurring in this view , recognizing the " advantages " of such a plan , and saying , " That he will advance upon our line as soon as he can , I have no doubt . " Until the *8th of March Johnston did not suspect that McClellan was not advancing to strike his right flank ; he then fell back behind the Rapidan , to guard against other contingencies . Even while ourvast army was passing down the Potomac he could not make out where it was going . So late as the early days of April , Jefferson Davis was in doubt as to McClellan 's destination , and Johnston only heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By the very test , therefore , to which Geneeral McClellan appeals in the paragraph quoted above , his conduct during the autumn and winter stands finally condemned . By their contemporaneous letters and orders , by their military movements in an important crisis , by their well-considered historical narratives , the Confederate government and generals have established these facts beyond all possibility of future refutation : that the plan for a direct attack suggested by Lincoln , and contemptu " Pollard 's History , Vol . I. , p. 184 , says : " A long , lingering Indian summer , with roads more hard and skies more beautiful than Virginia had seen for many a year , invited the enemy to advance . " " Johnston 's Narrative " says that the roads were practicable until the last of December . From the admirable monograph of Major-General A. S. Webb , Chief-of-Staff of the Army of the Poto ously rejected by McClellan , was a sound and practicable one ; it was the plan they expected and dreaded to see adopted , because it was the one easiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they saw the Army of the Potomac preparing to move , it was this plan alone of which they thought ; and they immediately gave up their position , which McClellan thought impregnable , as they had been for weeks preparing to do at the first intimation of a forward movement . The long delay of five months , during three of which the roads were in unusually fine condition , * during all of which the Union forces were as three to one of the enemy , remains absolutely without excuse . It can only be explained by that strange idiosyncrasy of General McClellan which led him always to double or treble the number of an enemy and the obstacles in his immediate vicinity . It is little blame to Confederate generals that they could not divine what General McClellan was doing with the grand army of the Union during the week that followed the evacuation of Manassas . No soldier could have been expected to guess the meaning of that mysterious promenade of a vast army to Centreville and Manassas , and back to Alexandria . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey with ease and celerity . The question why the whole army was taken has never been satisfactorily answered . General McClellan started away in too much confusion of mind to know precisely what he intended ; his explanation afterward was that he wanted the troops to have a little experience of marching and to " get rid of their impedimen/a . " He claims in his report to have found on this excursion a full justification of his extravagant estimate of the enemy 's force , and speaks with indignation of the calumnious stories of " quaker guns " which were rife in the press at the time . Every one now knows how fatally false the estimate was ; and as to the " quaker guns , " this is what General Johnston says about them : As we had not artillery enough for their works and for the army fighting elsewhere at the same time , rough wooden imitations of guns were made , and kept near the embrasures , in readiness for exhibition in them . To conceal the absence of carriages , the embrasures were covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns afterwards noticed in Northern papers . Without further discussing where the fault mac , entitled " The Peninsula , " we quote a sentence on this subject : " During all the time Johnston 's army lay at Centreville insolently menacing Washington . . it never presented an effective strength of over 50,000 men . With more than twice that number , McClellan remained inactive for meny precious weeks , under the delusion that he was confronted by a force nearly equal his own. ** // lay , the fact is beyond dispute that when the evacuation of Manassas was known throughout the country , the military reputation of General McClellan received serious damage . No explanation made at the time , and , we may add , none made since then , could account satisfactorily for such a mistake as to the condition of the enemy , such utter ignorance as to his movements . The first result of it was the removal of General McClellan from the command of the armies of the United States . This resolution was taken by the President himself ; on the i @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order known as " President 's War Order , No. 3 , " and in the evening called together Mr. Seward , Mr. Chase , and Mr. Stanton , and read it to them . It was in these words : PRESIDENT 'S WAR ORDER , No. 3 . EXECUTIVE MANSION , WASHINGTON , March II , 1862 . Major-General McClellan having personally taken the field at the head of the Army of the Potomac , until otherwise ordered he is relieved from the comlnand of the other military departments , he retaining command of the Department of the Potomac . Orde ; vd further , That the departments now under the respective commands of Generals Halleck and Hunter , together with so much of that under General Buell as lies west of a north and south line indefinitely drawn through Knoxville , Tenn. , be consolidated and designated the Department of the Mississippi , and that , until otherwise ordered , Major-General Halleck have command of said department . Ordered also , That the country west of the Department of the Potomac and east of the Department of the Mississippi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department , and that the same he commanded by Major-General Fr6mont . That all the commanders of departments , after the receipt of this order by them respectively , report severally and directly to the Secretary of War , and that prompt , full , and frequent reports will be expected of all and each of them . ABRAHAM LINCOLN . All the members of the Cabinet present heartily approved the order . The President gave his reason for issuing it while General McClellan was absent from Washington - a reason indeed apparent in the opening words , which were intended to take from the act any appearance of disfavor . The general 's intimate biographers have agreed that it was because the President was afraid to do it while the general was in Washington ! The manner of the order , which was meant as a kindness , was taken as a grievance . Mr. Seward advised that the order be issued in the name of the Secretary of XVar , but this proposition met with a decided protest from Mr. Stanton . He said there was some friction already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared that the act , if signed by him , would be attributed to personal feeling . The President decided to take the responsibility. * In a manly *J . H. , Diary . and courteous letter the next day , M cClellan accepted the disposition thus made of him . On the i3th of March , at Fairfax Court House , General McClellan called together the four corps commanders who were with him and submitted to them for discussion the President 's order of the 8th . The results of the council can not be more briefly stated than in the following memorandum , drawn up by the generals who took part in it : A council of the generals commanding army corps at the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac were of the opinion : I. That the enemy having retreated from Manassas to Gordonsville , behind the Rappahannock and Rapidan , it is the opinion of the generals commanding army corps that the operations to be carried on will he best undertaken from Old Point Comfort , between the York and James rivers , provided - First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Second . That the means of transportation , sufficient for an immediate transfer of the force to its new base , can be ready at Washington and Alexandria to move down the Potomac ; and Third . That a naval auxiliary force can be had to silence , or aid in silencing , the enemy 's hatteries on the York River . Fourth . That the force to be left to cover Washington shall be such as to give an entire feeling of security for its safety from menace . ( Unanimous . ) II . If the foregoing can not be , the army should then he moved against the enemy behind the Rappahannock at the earliest possible moment , and the means for reconstructing hridges , repairing railroads , and stocking them with materials sufficient for supplying the army should at once be collected for both the Orange and Alexandria and Aquia and Richmond railroads .

( Keyes , Heintzelman , and McDowell . ) A total of 40,000 men for the defense of the city would suffice . ( Sumner . ) These conclusions of the council were conveyed to Washington , and the President on the same day sent back to General McClellan his approval , and his peremptory orders for the instant execution of the plan proposed , in these words , signed by the Secretary of War : The President , having considered the plan of operations agreed upon by yourself and the commanders of army corps , makes no objection to the same , hut gives the following directions as to its execution : First , leave such force at Manassas Junction a*shall make it entirely certain that the enemy shall not repossess himself of that position and line of communication . Second , leave Washington entirely secure . Third , move the remainder of the force down the Potomac , choosing a new base at Fortress Monroe , or anywhere between here and there , or , at all events , move such remainder of the army at once in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ask an order more unrestricted , more unhampered , than this . Choose your own route , your own course , only go ; seek the enemy and fight him . Under the orders of Mr. John Tucker , of // the War Department , a fleet of transports had been preparing since the 27th of February . It is one of the many grievances mentioned by General McClellan in his report , that this work was taken entirely out of his hands and committed to those of Mr. Tucker ; he thus estops himself from claiming any credit for one of the most brilliant feats of logistics ever recorded . On the 27th of February , Mr. Tucker received his orders ; on the 17th of March , the troops began their embarkation ; on the 5th of April , Mr. Tucker made his final report , announcing that he had transported to Fort Monroe , from Washington , Perryville , and Alexandria , " 121,500 men , 14,592 animals , 1150 wagons , 44 batteries , 74 ambulances , besides pontoon bridges , telegraph materials , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ army of such magnitude . The only loss , " he adds , " of which I have heard is eight mules and nine barges , which latter went ashore in a gale within a few miles of Fort Monroe , the cargoes being saved . " He is certainly justified in closing his story with these words : " I respectfully but confidently submit that , for economy and celerity of movement , this expedition is without a parallel on record . " * The first corps to embark was Heintzelman 's ; he took with him from General McClellan the most stringent orders to do nothing more than to select camping-grounds , send out reconnaissances , engage guides and spies , " but to make no important move in advance . " The other forces embarked in turn , McDowell 's corps being left to the last ; and before it was ready to sail , General McClellan himself started on the ist of April , with the headquarters on the steamer Commodore , leaving behind him a state of things that made it necessary to delay the departure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the orders of the President it had been clearly stated that , as an absolute condition precedent to the army being taken away to a new base , enough troops should be left at Washington to make that city absolutely safe , not only from capture , but from serious menace . The pi*rtisans of General McClellan then , and ever since then , have contended that , as Washington could not be seriously attacked without exposing Richmond to capture , undue importance was attached to it in these orders . It would be a waste of words to argue with people who place the political and strategic value of these two cities on a level . The * The means by which this work was done were as follows : 113 steamers at an average price per day $215.10 i88 schooners at an average price per day 24.45 88 barges at an average price per day 14.27 capture of Richmond , without the previous virtual destruction of the rebel armies , would have been , it is true , an important achievement , but the seizure of Washington by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause . General McClellan was in the habit of saying that if the rebel army should take Washington while he was at Richmond they could never get back ; but it might be said that the general who would permit Washington to be taken could not be relied on to prevent the enemy from doing what they liked afterward . Mr. Lincoln was unquestionably right in insisting that Washington must not only be rendered safe from capture , but must also be without the possibility of serious danger . This view was adopted by the council of corps commanders , who met on the i3th of March at Fairfax Court House . They agreed unanimously upon this principle , and then , so as to leave no doubt as to details , three of the four gave the opinion that after the forts on the Virginia side were fully garrisoned , and those on the Maryland side occupied , a covering force of 25,000 men would be required . The morning after General McClellan had sailed for Fort Monroe , the Secretary of War was astonished to hear from General Wadsworth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had left him present for duty only i 9,000 men , and that from that force he had orders to detach four good regiments to join General McClellan on the Peninsula , and four more to relieve Sumner at Manassas and Warrenton . He further reported that his command was entirely " inadequate to the important duty to which it was assigned . " As General Wadsworth was a man of the highest intelligence , courage , and calm judgment , the President was greatly concerned by this emphatic statement . Orders were at once given to General E. A. Hitchcock , an accomplished veteran officer on duty at the War Department , and to Adjutant-General Thomas , to investigate the statement made by General Wadsworth . They reported the same night that it would require 30,000 men to man and occupy the forts , which , with the covering force of 25,000 , would make 55 , ooo necessary for the proper defense of the city , according to the judgment of the council of corps commanders . They confirmed the report of Wadsworth that his efficient force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight regiments away . They therefore concluded " that the requirement of the President that the city should be left entirely secure had not been fully complied with . " In accordance with this report the President directed that General McDowell 's corps should // not be sent to the Peninsula until further orders. * YORKTOWN . GENERAL MCCLELLAN arrived at Fort Monroe on the morning of the 2d of April . According to his own report he had ready the next day to move 58,000 men and ioo guns , besides the division artillery . They were of the flower of the volunteer army , and included also Sykes 's brigade of regulars , Hunt 's artillery reserve , and several regiments of cavalry . These were all on the spot , prepared to march , and an almost equal number were on their way to join him . He seemed at first to appreciate the necessity for prompt and decisive action , and with only one day 's delay issued his orders for the march up the Peninsula between the York and James rivers . The first obstacle that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. Magruder at Yorktown , which McClellan estimated at from 15,000 to 20,000 . Magruder says his force consisted of 11,000 , of which 6ooo were required for the fortifications of Yorktown and only *ooo were left to hold the line across the Peninsula , 13 miles in length . His only object was to delay as long as possible the advance of the National troops upon Richmond , and his dispositions were made to that end . If he had had troops enough , he says that he would have made his line of defense between Ship Point , on the York , and the mouth of the Warwick , on the James . But his force being insufficient for that purpose , he took up as a second line the Warwick River , which heads only a mile or so from Yorktown and empties into the James some thirteen miles to the south . Yorktown and its redoubts , united by long curtains and flanked by rifle-pits , formed the left of his line , which was continued by the Warwick River , a sluggish and boggy stream running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dammed in two places , at Wynn 's Mill and at Lee 's Mill ; and Magruder constructed three more dams to back up the river and make the fords impassable . Each of these dams was protected by artillery and earthworks . General McClellan was absolutely ignorant not only of these preparations made to receive him , but also of the course of the river and the nature of the ground through which it ran . He knew something of the disposition of Magruder 's outposts on his first line , and rightly con- * General McClellan made in his report an elaborate effort to explain away these facts . He claims to have left a force of 73,000 for the defense of Washington , including in the number all the troops under Dix in Maryland , under Banks in the Sbenandoah , all those at Warrenton , at Manassas , and on the lower Potomac. jectured that they would retire as he advanced . His orders for the 4th of April were therefore punctually carried out , and he seemed to have expected no greater difficulty in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force into two columns - Heintzelman to take the right and march directly to Yorktown ; and Keyes , taking the road to the left , to push on to the Half-way House in the rear of Yorktown , on the Williamsburg road . He expected Keyes to be there the same day , to occupy the narrow ridge in that neighborhood , " to prevent the escape of the garrison at Yorktown by land , and to prevent reinforcements from being thrown in . " Heintzeman went forward to the place assigned him in front of Yorktown , meeting with little opposition . Keyes marched by the road assigned him until he came to the enemy 's fortified position at Lee 's Mill , which , to use General McClellan 's words , " he found altogether stronger than was expected , unapproachable by reason of the Warwick River , and incapable of being carried by assault . " The discovery of this " unexpected " obstacle exercised a paralyzing influence upon the General-in-Chief . The energetic and active campaign that day begun was at once given up . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the line which Magruder 's little army of 11,000 men had stretched across the Peninsula , and he resolved upon a regular siege of the place . He began at the same time that campaign of complaint and recrimination against the Government which he kept up as long as he remained in the service . He always ascribed the failure of his campaign at this point to two causes ; first , to the want of assistance by the navy in reducing Yorktown , and second , to the retention of McDowell 's corps in front of Washington . If the navy had silenced the batteries at Yorktown and Gloucester , he contended , he could have gone up the Peninsula unchecked . This is unquestionably true ; it would be equally true to say in general terms that if somebody else would do our work we would have no work to do . He brings no proof to show that he had any right to expect that the navy would do this for him . It is true that he asked before he left Washington that the navy might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply the assurance that the navy would render him all the assistance in its power . The sworn testimony of Mr. Fox , the Assistant- But he does not deny the facts stated hy Wadsworth and confirmed by Hitchcock and Thomas . t In a letter on the 3d he wrote : " I hope to get possession of Yorktown day after to-morrow . " " McClellan 's Own Story , " p. 307. // Secretary of the Navy , and of Admiral Goldsborough , shows that nothing was promised that was not performed , and that the navy stood ready to give , and did give , all the assistance to the army which was possible . Mr. Fox said : Wooden vessels could not have attacked the batteries at Yorktown and Gloucester with any degree of success . The forts at Yorktown were situated too high , were beyond the reach of naval guns ; and I understood that General McClellan never expected any attack to be made upon them by the navy . Admiral Goldsborough 's evidence is to the same effect : he promised that the Merrimac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not ; he never heard that he was expected to cooperate with the army in attacking Yorktown ; he did everything that General McClellan requested of him . His orders from the department were clear and urgent , though general ; he was " to extend to the army , at all times , any and all aid that he could render " ; and he never refused to honor any draft that was made upon him . General McClellan pursued in this matter his invariable system . He asked for impossibilities , and when they were not accomplished for him he cherished it ever after as a precious grievance - like a certain species of lawyer , who in a case that he expects to lose always takes care to provide himself with a long bill of exceptions on which to base his appeal . The greatest of his grievances was the retention of McDowell 's corps , and his clamor in regard to this was so loud and long as to blind many careless readers and writers to the facts in the case . We have stated them already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ council of war of General McClellan 's corps commanders , called by himself , had decided that Washington could not be safely left without a covering force of 55,000 , including the garrisons of the forts . When he had gone , General Wadsworth reported that he had left only 19,000 , and had ordered away nearly half of these . Two eminent generals in the War Department investigated this statement and found it true , whereupon the President ordered that McDowell 's corps should for the present remain within reach of Washington . McClellan took with him to the Peninsula an aggregate force of over ioo , ooo men , afterwards largely increased . His own mormng * The discrepancy can not be accounted for . General McClellan 's official morning report of the s3th of April , four days after the date of the President 's letter , gives the following : " Number of troops composing the Army of the Potomac after its disembarkation on the Peninsula : Aggregate present for duty , 100,970 ; on special duty , sick , and in arrest , 4265 ; aggregate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yet with report of the *3th of April , signed by himself and his adjutant-general , shows that he had with him actually present for duty 100,970 . With this overwhelming superiority of numbers he could have detached 30,000 men at any moment to do the work that he had intended McDowell to do . But all the energy he might have employed in this work he diverted in attacking the Administration at Washington , which was doing all that it could do to support and provide for his army . The attitude of the President towards him at this time may be seen from the following letter of the 9th of April , in which Mr. Lincoln answers his complaints with as much consideration and kindness as a father would use towards a querulous and petulant child : Your dispatches complaining that you are not properly sustained , while they do not offend me , do pain me very much . Blenker 's division was withdrawn from you before you left here , and you know the pressure under which I did it , and , as I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you left , I ascertained that less than 20,000 unorganized men , without a single field battery , were all you designed to be left for the defense of Washington and Manassas Junction , and part of this even was to go to General Hooker 's old position . General Banks 's corps , once designed for Manassas Junction , was diverted and tied up on the line of Winchester and Strasburg , and could not leave it without again exposing the upper Potomac and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . This presented , or would present when McDowell and Sumner should be gone , a great temptation to the enemy to turn back from the Rappahannock and sack Washington . My official order that Washington should , by the judgment of all the commanders of army corps , be left entirely secure , had been neglected . It was precisely this that drove me to detain McDowell . I do not forget that I was satisfied with your arrangement to leave Banks at Manassas Junction ; but when that arrangement was broken np , and nothing was substituted for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it myself . And now allow me to ask , do you really think I should permit the line from Richmond via Manassas Junction to this city to be entirely open , except what resistance could be presented by less than 20,000 unorganized troops ? This is a question which the country will not allow me to evade . There is a curious mystery about the number of troops now with you . When I telegraphed you on the 6th saying you had over ioo , ooo with you , I had just obtained from the Secretary of War a statement taken , as he said , from your own returns , making so8 , ooo then with you and en route to you . You now say you will have but 85,000 when all en route to you shall have reached you . How can the discrepancy of 23,000 be accounted for ? * As to General Wool 's command , I understand it is doing for you precisely what a like number of your statements like these on file in the War Department , over his own signature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force amounted to only 8* , ooo ; and even this sum dwindled so considerably , as years rolled by , that in his article in Tux CENTURY , in May , // own would have to do if that command was away . I suppose the whole force which has gone forward for you is with you by this time , and if so , I think it is the precise time for you to strike a blow . By delay the enemy will relatively gain upon you - that is , he will gain faster by fortifications and reinforcements than you can by rehnforcements alone . And once more let me tell you it is indispensable to you that you strike a blow . I am powerless to help this . You will do me the justice to remember I always insisted that going down the bay in search of a field , instead of fighting at or near Manassas , was only shifting and not surmounting a difficulty ; that we would find the same enemy and the same or equal intrenchments at either place . The country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the present hesitation to move upon an intrenched enemy is but the story of Manassas repeated . I beg to assure you that I have never written you or spoken to you in greater kindness of feeling than now , nor with a fuller purpose to sustain you , so far as , in my most anxious judgment , I consistently can . But you must act . These considerations produced no impression upon General McClellan . From the beginning to the end of the siege of Yorktown , his dispatches were one incessant cry for men and guns . These the Government furnished to the utmost extent possible , but nothing contented him . His hallucination of overwhelming forces opposed to him began again , as violent as it was during the winter . On the 8th of April he wrote to Admiral Goldsborough , " I am probably weaker than they are , or soon will be . " His distress is sometimes comic in its expression . He writes on the 7th of April , " The Warwick River grows worse the more you look at it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked on the 5th for Franklin 's division , and on the ioth repeated this request , saying that although he wanted more , he would be responsible for the results if Franklin 's division were sent him . The Government , overborne by his importunity , gave orders the same day that Franklin 's division should go to him , and the arrangements for transporting them were made with the greatest diligence . He was delighted with this news ; and although the weather was good and the roads improving , he did nothing but throw up earth-works until they came . They arrived on the 20th , and no use whatever was made of them ! He kept them in the transports in which they had come down the bay more than two weeks - in fact , until the day before the siege ended . It is hard to speak with proper moderation of so ridiculous a disposition of this most valuable force , so clamorously demanded by General McClellan , and so generously sent him by the President . General Webb , the intimate friend and staff-officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Corps of Engineers was instructed to devise the proper arrangements and superintend the landing of the troops ; but , VOL . XXXVI. - 128. extraordinary as it may seem , more than two weeks were consumed in the preliminaries , and when everything was nearly ready for the disembarkation the enemy had vanished from the scene . . . . How long it would have taken the whole of McDowell 's corps to disembark at this rate . . . the reader may judge ; and yet for days it had been McClellan 's pet project , in connection with his plan of campaign , to utilize McDowell in just this manner as a flanking column . The simple truth is , there was never an hour during General McClellan 's command of the army that he had not more troops than he knew what to do with ; yet he was always instinctively calling for more . Mr. Stanton one day said of him , with natural hyperbole : If he had a million men , he would swear the enemy had two millions , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three . As usual with him , he entirely mistook the position , the strength , and the intentions of the enemy . He repeatedly telegraphed to Washington that he expected to fight an equal or greater force - in fact , " all the available force of the rebels " in the neighborhood of Yorktown . We have the concurrent testimony of all the Confederate authorities that no such plan was ever thought of . Magruder 's intentions , as well as his orders from Richmond , were merely to delay McClellan 's advance as long as practicable . His success in this purpose surpassed his most sanguine expectations . In the early days of April he was hourly expecting an attack at some point on his thinly defended line of 13 miles , guarded , as he says , by only *ooo men , exclusive of the 6ooo who garrisoned Yorktown . " But to my utter surprise , " he continues , " he permitted day after day to elapse without an assault . " At last , no less to his astonishment than to his delight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which meant a gain of several weeks for the rebel defense of Richmond , and absolute safety for the concentration of rebel troops in the mean time . It is now perfectly clear to all military critics not blinded by partisanship or personal partiality that McClellan could have carried the line of Magruder by assault at any time during the early days of April . From the mass of testimony to this effect before us we will take only two or three expressions , of the highest authority . General A. S. Webb says : That the Warwick line could have been readily broken within a week after the army 's arrival before it , we now know . General Heintzelman says , in his evidence before the Committee on the Conduct of the War : I think if I had been permitted , when I first landed on the Peninsula , to advance , I could have isolated the // troops in Yorktown , and the place would have fallen in a few days ; but my orders were very stringent not to make any demonstration . General Barnard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report of the campaign that the lines of Yorktown should have been assaulted : There is reason to believe that they were not held by strong force when our army appeared before them , and we know that they were far from complete . Our troops toiled a month in the trenches , or lay in the swamps of the Warwick . We lost few men by the siege , but disease took a fearful hold of the army , and toil and hardship , unrelieved by the excitement of combat , impaired the morale . We did not carry with us from Yorktown so good an army as we took there . The testimony of the enemy is the same . Johnston , so soon as he came to examine it , regarded the position of Magruder as clearly untenable : saw that McClellan could not be defeated there ; that the line was too long to be successfully defended ; that the back-water was as much a protection to one side as the other ; that there was a considerable unfortifled space between Yorktown and the head of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could at any time be turned by way of York River . Every one seemed to see it except General McClellan . He went on sending dispatches every day to Washington for heavier guns and more men , digging a colossal system of earth-works for gradual approach upon one side of an intrenched camp of no strategic value whatever , the rear of which was entirely open ; preparing with infinite labor and loss the capture of a place without a prisoner , the effect of which at the best would be merely to push an army back upon its reserves . Even so late as the *6th of April , an opportunity to break Magruder 's line was clearly presented to McClellan and rejected . He had ordered General W. F. Smith to reconnoiter a position known as Dam No. i , between Lee 's and Wynn 's Mills , where there was a crossing covered by a one-gun battery of the enemy . For this purpose Smith pushed Brooks 's Vermont brigade with Mott 's battery somewhat close to the dam , carrying on a sharp fire . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact controlled , the position opposite , finding it feebly defended . A young officer of Brooks 's staff ; Lieutenant Noyes , crossed the river below the dam , where the water was only waist deep , and approached within fifty yards of the enemy 's works . Returning after this daring feat , he repeated his observations to General Smith and to General McClellan , who had arrived on the ground and had ordered Smith to bring up his entire division to hold the advanced position occupied by Brooks 's brigade . Smith , who perceived the importance of Noyes 's intelligence , obtained permission to send a party across the stream to see if the enemy 's works had been sufficiently denuded to enable a column to effect a lodgment . Four companies of the 3d Vermont , numbering 200 men , under Captain Harrington , were ordered to cross the river , to ascertain " the true state of affairs . " They dashed through the stream , and in a few moments gained the enemy 's riflepits , where they maintained themselves with the utmost gallantry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great confusion by this bold and utterly unexpected movement . There were still several hours of daylight left , and another attempt was made to cross at the same point with a force no larger than Harrington 's , assisted by a diversion of an equal force at the dam above . But the enemy being now thoroughly aroused and concentrated , the crossing was not made . It appears from General Smith 's report that " no attempt to mass the troops of the division for an assault was made " ; the only intention seemed to be " to secure the enemy 's works if we found them abandoned ! " He adds : The moment I found resistance serious , and the numbers opposed great I acted in obedience to the warning instructions of the General-in-Chief , and withdrew the small number of troops exposed from under fire . " Thus , " says General Webb , " a fair opportunity to break the Warwick line was missed . " The importance of this incident may be best appreciated by reading General Magruder 's account of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the weakest part . If , instead of two hundred men , Smith had felt authorized to push over his entire division , the Peninsula campaign would have had a very different termination . The little that was done greatly pleased General McClellan . He announced the movement of General Smith in a somewhat excited dispatch to the War Department , which Mr. Stanton answered with still more enthusiastic congratulation . " Good for the first lick ! " he shouts ; " Hurrah for Smith and the one-gun battery " - showing the intense eagerness of the Government to find motives for satisfaction and congratulation in McClellan 's conduct . But there was no sequel to the movement ; indeed , General McClellan 's dispatches indicate considerable complacency that Smith was able to hold the position gained . General Webb says , " Reconnaissances were made , . . but no assaulting columns were ever organized to take advantage of any opportunity offered . " No congratulations or encouragements from the Government now availed anything with // McClellan . Struggling with a command and a responsibility too heavy for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind in which prompt and energetic action was impossible . His double illusion of an overpowering force of the enemy in his front , and of a government at Washington that desired the destruction of his army , was always present with him , exerting its paralyzing influence on all his plans and actions . In his private letters he speaks of Washington as that " sink of iniquity " ; of the people in authority as " those treacherous hounds " ; of the predicament he is in , " the rebels on one side and the Abolitionists and other scoundrels on the other . " " I feel , " he says , " that the fate of a nation depends upon me , and I feel that I have not one single friend at the seat of government " - this at a moment when the Government was straining every nerve to support him . The Confederates , as Mr. Lincoln had said , were daily strengthening their position by fortification and re*inforcement . On the 17th of April , General Joseph E. Johnston took command of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the arrival of Smith 's and Longstreet 's divisions amounted to about 53,000 men , including 3000 sick ; he places the force of McClellan at 133,000 , including Franklin 's division of 13,000 floating idly on their transports. * He did nothing more than to observe the Union army closely , to complete the fortifications between Yorktown and the inundations of the Warwick , and to hold his own forces in readiness for a movement to the rear . He kept himself informed of the progress of McClellan 's engineering work against Yorktown , as it was not his intention to remain long enough to spend an hour under fire . He did not expect to be hurried ; he had long before that given his opinion that McClellan did not especially value time . Every day of delay was of course an advantage , but " an additional day or two gained by enduring a cannonade would have been dearly bought in blood , " and he therefore determined to go before McClellan 's powerful artillery should open upon him . Seeing , as we now can , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is something humiliating and not without a touch of the pathetic in the contrast between the clear vision of Johnston and the absolute blindness of McClellan , in relation to each other 's attitude and purpose . While the former was simply watching for the flash of the first guns to take his departure , * His own force is correctly given . He only slightly exaggerates that of McClellan. t On the 23d of April , McClellan wrote to the President : " Do not misunderstand the apparent inaction here - not a day , not an hour , has been lost . Works glad of every day that the firing was postponed , but entirely indifferent to the enormous development of the siege-works going on in his sight , the latter was toiling with prodigious industry and ability over his vast earth-xvorks and his formidable batteries , only pausing to send importunate dispatches to Washington for more guns and more soldiers , forbidding the advance of a picket beyond specified limits , carefully concealing every battery until all should be finished , not allowing a gun to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , firmly convinced that when he was entirely ready he would fight and destroy the whole rebel army . Nearly one hundred heavy Parrott guns , mortars , and howitzers were placed in battery against the town and camp of Yorktown and its outlying works , only fifteen hundred or two thousand yards away . Against the opinion of his ablest staff-officers , McClellan kept this immense armament silent for weeks while he was continually adding to it . Barnard , Chief of Engineers , says , " We should have opened our batteries on the place as fast as they were completed . " Barry , Chief of Artillery , says : The ease with which the 100 and 200 pounders of this hattery Battery No. i were worked , the extraordinary accuracy of their fire , and the since ascertained effects produced upon the enemy by it , force upon me the conviction that the fire of guiis of similar caliber and power in the other batteries at much shorter ranges , combined with the cross-vertical fire of the thirteen and ten inch sea-coast mortars , would have compelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than twelve hours . General McClellan 's only reason for refusing to allow the batteries to open fire as they were successively finished was the fear that they would be silenced by the converging fire of the enemy as soon as they betrayed their position . That this was a gross error is shown by the Confederate reports . They were perfectly cognizant of the progress and disposition of his batteries ; the very good reason why they did not annoy him in their construction was that the Union lines were , to use Johnston 's words , " beyond the range of our old-fashioned ship guns . " A few experimental shots were fired from the shore batteries on the ist of May ; the effect of them convinced the Confederate general of the enormous surplus strength of the Federal artillery . The shots from their first volley fell on the camp of his reserve , a mile and a half beyond the village.t have been constructed that may almost he called gigantic , roads built through swamps and difficult ravines , niaterial brought up , batteries built . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parrott guns , 10 4j4-inch ordnance guns , i8 20-pounder Par How // long General McClellan would have continued this futile labor if he had been left alone , it is impossible to conjecture . If there was at first a limit in his own mind of the work to be done and the time to be given to it , it must have been continually moved forward until it passed out of sight . Up to the last moment he was still making demands which it would have taken weeks to fill . The completion of one work was simply an incentive to the beginning of another . Thus on the 28th of April ,  --  a week after Franklin 's arrival ,  --  at a time when Johnston was already preparing to start for Richmond , he telegraphs to Washington as a pleasant bit of news that he " had commenced a new battery from right of first parallel , " and adds : " Would be glad to have the 30-pounder Parrotts in the works around Washington at once . Am very short of that excellent gun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch at such a time smote upon the intense anxiety of the President . He answered in wonder and displeasure : " Your call for Parrott guns from Washington alarms me , chiefly because it argues indefinite procrastination . Is anything to be done ? " But the general , busy with his trenches and his epaulements , paid no regard to this searching question . Two days later , May i , he continued his cheery report of new batteries and rifle-pits , and adds , " Enemy still in force and working hard " ; and these stereotyped phrases last with no premonition of any immediate change until on the 4th he telegraphed , " Yorktown is in our possession , ** and later in the day began to magnify his victory , telling what spoils he had captured , and ending with the sounding phrases , " No time shall be lost . I shall push the enemy to the wall . " Johnston had begun his preparations to move on the 27th of April , and on the 3d of May , finding that McClellan 's batteries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet known to McClellan ,  --  he gave orders for the evacuation , which began at midnight . He marched away from Yorktown with about 50,000 men . General McClellan , by his own morning report of the 3oth of April , had in his camps and trenches , and scrambling in haste on board the transports that they had quitted the day before , the magnificent aggregate of I 12,392 present for duty , and a total aggregate of 130,378. rotts , 6 Napoleon guns , and 6 io-pounder Parrotts ; this not counting the batteries in front of Smith and on his left - *5 guns . I will add to it to-morrow night 5 30-pounder Parrotts , 6 20-pounder Parrotts , from * to 50 13-inch mortars , and-if they arrive in time - one 200-pounder Parrott . Before sundown to-morrow I will FROM WILLIAMSBURG TO FAIR OAKS . THE evacuation of Yorktown took General McClellan so completely by surprise that a good deal of valuable time was lost in hurried preparation to pursue the retiring enemy . Franklin 's division , after their fortnight of delay on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their boats . Says Webb : Several hours were consumed in having the commands properly provisioned for the march . The evacuation was discovered at dawn , and it was noon before the first column started in pursuit . Johnston by this time had taken his entire command to Williamsburg . Knowing that McClellan 's advance would soon reach him , lie made his dispositions at his leisure . He posted a strong rear-guard there under Longstreet to protect the movement of his trains . The Union cavalry under Sherman came into collision with this force about dark and was repulsed , losing one gun . The main body of the pursuing army came up during the night , under the command of Generals Sumner , Heintzelman , and Keyes . It is strongly illustrative of General McClellan 's relations with his corps commanders , that neither of these generals had any orders from him as to the conduct of the battle which was inevitable as soon as they overtook the enemy , and there was even serious doubt as to which among them was in command of the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command in his absence , but these orders had not been communicated to Heintzelman , who thought that he was to take control of the movement . There was some confusion of orders as to the roads to be taken by the different cornmands , in consequence of which Hooker came into position on the left of the line and Smith on the right . The contrary disposition had been intended . The morning of the 5th came with no definite plan of battle arranged . General Hooker , following his own martial instincts , moved forward and attacked the enemy at half-past 7 and was soon hotly engaged . He fought almost the entire rear-guard of Johnston during the whole forenoon . Heavy reinforcements thrown against him checked his advance and caused him to lose the ground he had gained . Hooker speaks in his report with much bitterness , not wholly unjustified , of the manner in which his division was left to fight an overwhelming force , " unaided in the presence of more than 30,000 of their comrades with arms in their hands , " and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain for any adequate explanation of this state of things . The whole day was bloody and expensive essentially complete theredouht necessary to strengthen the first parallel as far as Wormley 's Creek from the left , and probably all the way to York River to-morrow night . 1 will then be secure against sorties . " McClellan to Lincoln , April 23 . MS . With a force of three to one he was wasting weeks in defensive works . // and without adequate result . The heroism of Hooker and Hancock , and their brave troops , was well-nigh wasted . There was no head , no intelligent director , no understood plan . McClellan arrived late in the day and was unable to contribute anything to the result , although the cheers with which he was welcomed showed how fully he possessed the confidence and affection of his troops . He had not anticipated so early an engagement , and was spending the day at Yorktown to dispatch Franklin 's division up the river . Actual contact with the enemy , however , made , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair , which when he heard of it at Yorktown seemed to him a mere skirmish with a rear-guard , suddenly acquired a portentous importance when surveyed in the light of the bivouac at Williamsburg , amidst the actual and visible signs of a sanguinary conflict . His dispatch to the War Department , written at io o'clock the night of the battle , betrays great agitation , and his idiosyncrasy of multiplying the number of his enemy , as a matter of course , asserts itself . " I find General Joe Johnston in front of me in strong force , probably greater a good deal than my own . " After a compliment to Hancock he continues , " I learn from the prisoners taken that the rebels intend to dispute every step to Richmond . " One can only wonder what he expected them to say . " I shall run the risk of at least holding them in check here , while I resume the original plan . My entire force is undoubtedly inferior to that of the rebels , who will fight well . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue his retrograde march at daybreak , McClellan was nerving himself to stand the risk of holding his ground at Williamsburg , while he " resumed the original plan " of a movement by water . The next day , when he discovered that the enemy had moved away , leaving their wounded on the field of battle , his apprehension of attack subsided , but other difficulties rose before him . He telegraphed on the 7th to the Secretary of War that " until the roads improved both in front and rear no large body of troops could be moved . " Johnston had apparently no difficulty in moving his troops , which McClellan thought a larger body than his own . Reaching a place called Baltimore CrossRoads , Johnston halted for five days , and , after receiving intelligence of the evacuation of On the 6th of May the veteran General Wool sent this dispatch to the War Department , showing how his elders regarded at the time these jeremiads of the young general : " The desponding tone of Major-General McClellan 's dispatch of last evening more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undoubt Norfolk and the destruction of the Merrimac , apprehending an attack upon Richmond by way of the James River , he ordered his forces to cross the Chickahominy on the *5th . Two days after this the rebel army encamped about three miles from Richmond , in front of the line of redoubts that had been constructed the previous year . It was a time of great apprehension , almost of dismay , at Richmond . The Confederate President , and most of his cabinet , hastily sent their families to places of safety . Mr. Davis , whose religious feelings always took on a peculiar intensity in critical times , had himself baptized at home , and privately confirmed at St. Paul 's Church . There was great doubt whether the city could be successfully defended ; the most important archives of the Government were sent , some to Lynchburg and some to Columbia.t But General Johnston had reason to confirm his opinion that McClellan cared little for time . He remained several days at Williamsburg after he had ascertained that the enemy had disappeared from in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now transferred to Franklin 's front . On the 8th he telegraphed the War Department a story of 8o , ooo to 120,000 opposed to Franklin , but in full retreat to the Chickahominy . On the ioth he sends an urgent appeal to Washington for more troops , claiming that the enemy " are collecting troops from all quarters , especially well-disciplined troops from the South . " His own army will inevitably be reduced by sickness , casualties , garrisons , and guards - as if that of the enemy would not . He therefore implores large and immediate rednforcements in a tone which implies that the President could make armies by executive decree . " If I am not reinforced , " he says , " it is probable that I will be obliged to fight nearly double my numbers , strongly intrenched . " In face of a morning report of over ioo , ooo men present for duty he says : " I do not think it will be at all possible for me to bring more than 70,000 men upon the field of battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he never did , and it is to be presumed he never could , handle that many men at once . All his battles were fought piecemeal with a part of his force at a time . He still protested stoutly against the original organization of his army corps , and asked that he might be permitted to break it up or at least to suspend it . He disliked his corps edly considerably inferior to that of the rebels . If such is the fact , I am still more surprised that they should have abandoned Yorktown . " War Records. t J. B. Jones , " A Rebel War Clerk 's Diary , " en . tries of May 8 , May 10 , and May i*. // commanders , and naturally wished his friends to exercise those important commands . He blamed the corps organization for all the trouble at Williamsburg , and said , if he had come on the field half an hour later , all would have been lost . The President was greatly wounded by this persistent manifestation of bad temper , but bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sent an official order , authorizing McClellan to suspend temporarily the corps organization in the Army of the Potomac , and to adopt any that he might see fit , until further orders . At the same time he wrote a private letter to the general , full of wise and kindly warning . He said : I ordered the army corps organization not only on the unanimous opinion of the twelve generals whom you had selected and assigned as generals of division , but also on the unanimous opinion of every military man I could get an opinion from , and every modern military book , yourself alone excepted . Of course I did not on my own judgment pretend to understand the subject . I now think it indispensable for you to know how your struggle against it is received in quarters which we can not entirely disregard . It is looked upon as merely an effort to pamper one or two pets and to persecute and degrade their supposed rivals . I have had no word from Sumner , Heintzelman , or Keyes . The commanders of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but I am constantly told that you have no consultation or communication with them ; that you consult and communicate with nobody but General Fitz-John Porter and perhaps General Franklin . I do not say these complaints are true or just , but at all events it is proper you should know of their existence . Do the commanders of corps disohey your orders in anything ? When you relieved General Hamilton of his command the other day , you thereby lost the confidence of at least one of your best friends in the Senate . And here let me say , not as applicable to you personally , that senators and representatives speak of me in their places as they please without question , and that officers of the army must cease addressing insulting letters to them for taking no great liberty with them . But to return . Are you strong enough - are you strong enough even with my help - to set your foot upon the necks of Sumner , Heintzelman , and Keyes all at once ? This is a practical and very serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of the country are the same , and of course I only desire the good of the cause . General McClellan accepted the authorization with alacrity and the sermon with indifference . He at once formed two provisional army corps , giving Fitz-John Porter the command of one and Franklin the other . After leaving Williamsburg and joining his army at Cumberland , he reiterated his complaints and entreated for reinforcements that it was not in the power of the Government to send him . His morbid apprehension had grown to such an extent that on the 14th of May he telegraphed his conviction that he would be compelled , with 8o , ooo men , to fight r6o , ooo rebels in front of Richmond ; and begged that the Government would send him " by water " - he did not want them to come overland - " all the disposable troops , " " every man " that could be mustered . The President , anxious to leave nothing undone to help and encourage him , replied to these important demands first by a friendly private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shall do all I could and can to sustain you . I hoped that the opening of the James River and putting Wool and Burnside in communication , with an open road to Richmond , or to you , had effected something in that direction . I am still unwilling to take all our forces off the direct line between Richmond and here . He afterwards sent a dispatch through the War Department , of which the essential points are as follows : The President is not willing to uncover the Capital entirely , and it is believed that even if this were prudent , it would require more time to effect a junction between your army and that of the Rappahannock hy way of the Potomac and York rivers than by a land march . In order therefore to increase the strength of the attack upon Richmond at the earliest momeiit , General McDowell has been , ordered to march upon that city by the shortest route . He is ordered - keeping himself always in position to save the Capital from all possible attack-so to operate as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you are instructed to coi5perate so as to establish this communication as soon as possible , by extending your right wing to the north of Richmond , . . . but charged , in attempting this , not to uncover the city of Washington ; and you will give no order , either before or after your junction , which can put him out of position to cover this city . . . . The President desires that General McDowell retain the command of the Department of the Rappahannock , and of the forces with which he moved forward . Events as little foreseen by General McClellan as by the Government , and which had by him been declared impossible ,  --  the defeat of our forces in the Shenandoah and the movement of a large rebel force to the upper Potomac ,  - -  prevented the execution of this plan . But it is worthy of notice that immediately on the receipt of the President 's instructions , while he was waiting for McDowell to join him , General McClellan evinced no gratification at this compliance with his wishes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grievance of it ; he wrote a long and elaborate dispatch protesting against it , and asking that " McDowell should be placed explicitly under his orders in the ordinary way . " In his report , and in all his subsequent apologies for his campaign , he makes this positive assertion : This order rendered it impossible for me to use the James River as a line of operations , and forced me to establish our depots on the Painunkey and to approach Richmond from the north . This charge is an evident after-thought , and is no less lacking in adroitness than in candor . We will permit it to be answered by General // insula campaign , who is always the friend of McClellan , and his partisan wherever the writer 's intelligence and conscience allow it . He says : It is but repeating the proper criticisms made by other writers that General McClellan had frequently mentioned the Pamunkey as his prospective base ; that he made no representation to the Government , at the time , that he wished to he free to move by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the first three weeks of June , when he found that McDowell was again withheld from him , to follow the latter route . On one point there can be no question - that the position of his army , as already given , along the left bank of the Chickahominy from Bottom 's towards New Bridge , on May 20 , with the White House , on the Pamunkey , as the base of supplies , was one of McClellan 's own choice , uninfluenced by McDowell 's movements . It required ten days after the fight at Williamsburg for McClellan 's headquarters to reach Cumberlanci , on the south bank of the Pamunkey , and on the next day be established his permanent depot at the White House , near by . On the 2sst the army was brought together and established in line on the Chickahominy , the right wing being about seven and the left about twelve miles from Richmond , from which they were separated by two formidable barriers - the rebel army , and the river with its environment of woods and swamps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was first attacked . General McClellan began at once with great energy the building of several bridges over the stream , a work of special difficulty on account of the boggy banks , which made long approaches necessary . In this work , and in a voluminous correspondence with the President in regard to reinforcements , which we shall notice when we come to treat of those movements of Jackson 's in the valley that caused the division of McDowell 's force , he passed ten days ; he pushed the corps of Keyes and Heintzelman across the river , and retained those of Sumner , Franklin , and Porter on the north side . The monotony of camp life was broken up on the 27th of May by a brilliant feat of arms performed by Fitz-John Porter and his corps at Hanover Court House , where he attacked and defeated a rebel force under General Branch . The chief value of this battle was its demonstration of the splendid marching and fighting qualities of the troops engaged . General McClellan was greatly annoyed that the President did not seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his " Narrative , " while Pot diminishing the gallantry of Porter and his troops , or denying the complete defeat of Branch , treats it merely as an incident of Branch 's march under orders to join Anderson , which was accomplished 93 ' the same day at the point designated for this junction . There was no sequel to the fight . Porter and his victorious troops marched back to camp . On the 26th of May , General McClellan informed the President that he was " quietly closing in upon the enemy preparatory to the last struggle , " and that he would be " free to strike " on the return of Porter . But several days elapsed without the blow being struck , until the enemy , as usual , accelerated matters by himself striking . It had been for some time the intention of General Johnston to attack the Union army before McDowell should join it ; and learning , on the day of the battle of Hanover Court House , that McDowell was leaving Fredericksburg , he resolved at once to strike McClellan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we consider that the consolidated returns of the Army of the Potomac for the 31st of May showed an aggregate of 127,166 officers and men , of whom there were 98,000 present for duty , with 280 pieces of field artillery , and that General Johnston 's force amounted to about 6o , ooo effectives , we can not but think it was a fortunate circumstance for him that he did not attempt to carry this heroic plan into effect . At night , when he had called his general officers together for their instruction , Johnston was informed that McDowell 's force , which had been marching southward , had returned to Fredericksburg . He then abandoned his idea of attacking McClellan on both sides of the river , and reverted to his former plan of assailing with his whole force the two corps on the south bank as soon as they had sufficiently increased the distance between themselves and the three corps on the north . In this plan , as in the other one ,  --  and we shall see , farther on , that the same was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem to have taken into the account the possible initiative of General McClellan . He makes his plans entirely without reference to it , choosing his time for attack absolutely at his own convenience . He takes it for granted that he will be met with a courageous and able defense - but nothing more . The worst he has to fear in any case is a repulse ; there seems no thought of an offensive return in his mind . The Northern general , on the contrary , judged his adversary with more courtesy than justice . He evidently had no suspicion of Johnston 's intentions . At the moment that the latter was calling his generals together to give orders for the assault , McClellan was telegraphing to Washington : " Richmond papers urge Johnston to attack , now that he has us away from gun-boats . I think he is too able for that . " // Johnston 's purpose was finally adopted and put in action with great decision and promptitude . On the 3oth D. H. Hill informed him that the Federals were in force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Keyes 's corps was south of the river ; to which Johnston immediately responded by telling him he would attack the next morning . Within an hour or two his whole plan of battle was arranged . Orders were given to throw twentythree of the twenty-seven brigades of which the Confederate army consisted against the two corps of Heintzelman and Keyes. * The rest were to observe the river by the Meadow and New bridges . After the plan of battle was arranged , a violent storm of rain came on and continued most of the night . This was a welcome incident to Johnston , as it inspired the hope that the river might overflow its banks and sever the communication between the two wings of the Federal army . He did not permit the rain to delay him . The forces commanded by Longstreet and Hill attacked Casey 's division of Key es 's corps with great impetuosity , and in overwhelming numbers , about i o'clock in the afternoon . Keyes 's corps , supported by those of Heintzelman , defended their ground with gallantry and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great , and they gradually and sullenly gave way , retiring inch by inch , until , as night came on , they had been forced more than a mile and a half east of the position that they had occupied in the morning . The forces under G. W. Smith , accompanied by Johnston in person , whose duty it had been to strike the right flank of the Union army as soon as the assault of Longstreet and Hill became fully developed on the left , were delayed for some time on account of a peculiar condition of the atmosphere , which prevented the sound of the musketry from reaching from Seven Pines to the headquarters of Smith on the Nine-mile road . But about 4 o'clock , Johnston , having been informed of the progress of affairs in Longstreet 's front , determined to put Smith in upon the Union right flank , being by this time relieved of all fear of a reenforcement from the other side of the river . Fortunately for the Union cause , the forces immediately opposite this position were commanded by General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and generosity . He had been ordered , as soon as the firing began , to hold himself in readiness to move to the assistance of his comrades at Fair Oaks ; but he gave these orders a liberal interpretation , and instead of merely preparing to * In an article in THE CENTURY for May , 1885 , General Johnston changes this statement to " twenty-two out of twenty-eight brigades . " move he at once marched with two divisions to the two bridges he had built and halted them , with his leading companies at the bridges . In this manner an hour of inestimable advantage was saved . The swollen river soon carried away one of the bridges , and the other was almost submerged when the order came to Sumner to cross . Without delaying a moment on the west bank , Sumner marched through the thick mud in the direction of the heaviest firing and repulsed the attacks of Smith . This Union success was the result of Sumner 's straightforward anj unhesitating march . His appointment to the command of an army corps had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been treated by his commander with studied neglect and disrespect ; and this magnificent service was his only revenge . About 7 o'clock the Confederates met their severest mischance of the day ; General Johnston received at an interval of a few moments two severe and disabling wounds . The firing ceased , " terminated by darkness only , " Johnston is careful to say , before he had been borne a mile from the field . The command had devolved by seniority of rank upon General G. W. Smith . There was great confusion and discouragement in the rebel councils . Jefferson Davis found hope in the suggestion that " the enemy might withdraw during the night , which would give the Confederates the moral effect of a victory . " Early on June i the battle was renewed , and the Union troops reoccupied the ground lost on the day before . At 2 o'clock General Lee took command , and the battle died away by the gradual retirement of the Confederates . A great battle had been fought absolutely without result . The Confederates had failed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but their failure entailed no other consequences . The losses were frightful upon both sides : the Union army lost *ooo , and the Confederate loss was reported at something over 4000 , which is generally considered an under-statement . But there was this enormous difference between the condition of the two armies : the Union troops south of the Chickahominy , though wearied by the conflict , with ranks thinned by death and wounds , had yet suffered no loss of morale ; on the contrary , their spirits had been heightened by the stubborn fight of Saturday and the easy victory of Sunday . North of the river lay the larger portion of the army , which had not fired a gun nor lost a man in the action . It is hardly denied , at this day , by the most passionate of McClellan 's partisans , that the way to RichABRAHAM // mond was open before him on Saturday afternoon . It was his greatest opportunity . Jackson was in the Valley of the Shenandoah detaching from Lee an army of i6 , ooo men . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left wing , and had received more injury than he inflicted . Our right wing was intact ; the material for bridging the upper Chickahominy had been ready for three days ; the Confederate army was streaming back to Richmond in discouragement and disorder . Even so ardent a friend of McClellan as the Prince de Joinville writes : The Federals had had the defensive battle they desired ; had repulsed the enemy ; but arrested by natural obstacles which perhaps were not insurmountable , they had gained nothing by their success . They had missed an unique opportunity of striking a blow . If General McClellan had crossed his army , instead of one division , at the time that Johnston 's entire force was engaged at Seven Pines , * The repulse of the rebels at Fair Oaks should have been taken advantage of . It was one of those " occasions which , if not seized , do not repeat themselves . We now know the state of disorganization and dismay in which the rebel army retreated . We now know that it could have been followed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been no resistance to overcome to bring over our right wing . General Barnard Mr. William Henry Hurlbert , the translator of the Prince de Joinville 's work , who was in Richmond during , the battle , gives the following account of the condition of the Confederates on the morning of June I : They were in a perfect chaos of brigades and regiments . The roads into Richmond were literally coythe rout of the Southern army would have been complete and the way to Richmond would have been a military promenade. * But the next day and during the week that followed the enterprise assumed so many difficulties in his eyes that he could not have been expected to attempt it . The rains continued ; the sluggish river became a wide-spreading flood ; the ground , a mixed mass of clay and quicksand , afforded no sure standing-place for horse , foot , or artillery ; most of the bridges were carried away ; the army , virtually cut in two by the river , occupied itself in the arduous work of intrenching . General Lee , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely at ease in regard to an immediate attack upon Richmond , had leisure to devote himself to restoring the organization and morale of his army , and bringing from every side the reinforcements that he was to use with such effect a month later in the bloody contests from the Chickahominy to the James . ered with stragglers , some throwing away their guns , some breaking them on the trees , all with the same story that their regiments had been " cut to pieces - that the " Yankees were swarming on the Chickahommy like bees , " and " fighting like devils . " In two days of the succeeding week the provost-marshal 's guard collected between 4000 and 5000 stragglers and sent them into camp . Had I been aware on that day of the actual state of things upon the field , I might easily have driven in a carriage through the Confederate lines directly into our own camps . It was not indeed until several days after the battle that anything like military order was restored throughout the Confederate positions . Appendix , p @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
