txt At the close or the matin6e at the Syracuse Museum , given this afternoon by the Morosco &; Gardner Comedy Company , of New-York , Mrs. Morosco , whose stage name is Kitty Gardner , accosted Miss Ella La France , of this city , as she was passing toward the stage door and asked her if she would step into the lobby for a minute . as she had something to say to her . The last of the audience was just passing out . Without the least warning Miss Gardner furiously attacked Miss La France . The former is below the medium height , and is moderately fleshy . The agility with which she handled her little fists was astonishing , and before Miss La France recovered from her surprise the actress had made sad havoc with her hair and clothing . Miss La France is French and soon got her grit up to the boiling point . She proved the more muscular of the two , and it was only a few minutes before she was getting the best of the battle . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hand , and , as she alleges , hit her several severe blows on the head . After the battle had fairly begun the few bystanders soon became aware of what caused the trouble . It was a case of jealousy . Miss Gardner charged that Miss La France had been altogether too intimate with her husband . Mr. bilorosco , who is the manager of the company . Miss La France sought a Police Justice , and swore out a warrant charging Miss Gardner with assault and battery . The warrant was placed in the hands of an officer , who in company with Miss La France watched at the stage entrance of the theatre for the actress . When she made her appearance at 7:30 o'clock she was arrested and taken to Police Headquarters . It was so near the time for the curtain to rise that she was in a great deal of trouble . Mr. Morosco accompanied her . They did not have friends to bail the prisoner out , nor did they have sufficient funds to deposit for her appearance in court on Monday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was released . Her brother was not found . it is said he has left town . Miss La France says she had met Mr. Morosco only once , and that was in reference to joining his company .
