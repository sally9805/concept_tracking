txt For the first time in many years the landlords of New-York seem to be , for a season at least , at the mercy of their tenants . The annual rise in rents , which we have become almost as much accustomed to look for as for the trees to bud in Spring , has not been made this year , and save in a few exceptional cases good ten:ants have been retained without even a preliminary hint of an advance , while in some instances rents have been slightly reduced to induce occupants of houses to remain . For once the backbone of the landlord has been broken , and he appears in the guise of the suppliant for favor rather than the tyrant , which is his traditional character . As a result , tenants who are satisfied with their quarters have decided to remain where they are for another year , . and " moving day " presented a smaller . and less lively procession of . trucks - laden with household gods than usual . The landlords have proved wise in their day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a logic so stern that they could not resist it . The stagnation in business has placed it beyond the ' power of the ordinary tenant - to submit to the usual annual demand for an increase of rent , and had it been made thousands who will now retain their old homes would have been forced to move . Building in this city has been very brisk during the last year , and there are plenty of unoccupied houses and fiats awaiting tenants , so that any ordinary demand could be satisfied , while on the outer limits of Brooklyn , and especially in the Eastern District , are numbers of houses which can be rented at reasonable figures . The cholera scare , too , has been a not unimportant element in keeping rents stationary . The fear of an invasion of New York by the epidemic will undoubtedly . drive many families from the city this Summer , and no landlord of any judgment would add to the inducements of his tenants to fly to New-Jersey by advancing their rents . All things seem to have worked together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the tents of other men , and the result is great , rejoicing and little moving .
