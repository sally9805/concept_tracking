( Goes to bench , takes tin wash bowl , dips water out of barrel at corner of house while he speaks  --  soaps his hands with a piece of brown soap and mashing his face  --  after speaking and then comes to R. C. with one eye closed to keep out soap , drying hands and face with towel . ) FRANK H. No ? ( Sitting on R. edge of bench at well . ) JOSH .

JOSH ( reflectively , crossing to C. ) . I do n't know ;  --  I did have four or five months ago . Ai n't heard nothin ' from him since . FRANK H.

C.  --  about three feet L. of JOSH . ) JOSH . About a year ago now he was cashier in the Cheshire Bank in Keene a few miles from here . Well , it seems one day , a party of sharps from Boston went to Keene and went into the bank and when some of them were talking to Reub one of the mean sneaks got into the vault and stole a lot of money . FRANK H. He did ? JOSH . Gosh ! Yes . It all came out on the trial . Well , they pitched on to my boy and had him arrested right before a lot of visitors from Boston , on suspicion of robbing the bank ; but they let him go again pretty quick , I can tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I perty near froth . Charged with stealing something he did n't know no more about then the man in the moon . FRANK H. What a shame ! JOSH . I guess it was . And he felt it dreadfully , too . I do n't believe the boy had a good night 's rest since . He always imagined people p'inted at him and was downhearted and low-spirited so one day he packed his trunk and started for New York . FRANK H. So you think of going there to look for him , do you ? JOSH . I certainly shall . FRANK H. Why not go back with us ? JOSH . Gosh ! I will if my new boots are done in time . FRANK H. And I will assist you to look for your boy in every way I can . JOSH . Thank'ee , thank'ee . Now I am going to ask you something and I know you will laugh at me . FRANK H. Why should I ? JOSH . Because it is so foolish . ( Looking mysteriously to house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FRANK laughs . ) That 's right , laugh  --  I do n't blame you a mite . FRANK H. Why do you ask ? JOSH . Because I 've had ' em about my boy lately ,  --  so nat'ral that it almost seems as though they must be true . FRANK H. That is the result of constantly thinking of him ,  --  nothing more , believe me . JOSH . I hope not  --  I hope not . ( Enter RICKETY from house and comes down to R. of JOSH . ) RICKETY . Say , Uncle , Aunt Tildy says to ask you if you wo n't come in and cut some dried beef for supper . JOSH . Why , sartin . ( Rises . ) Wo n't you come in the house , young man ? FRANK H. ( rises . Takes chair and replaces it by well ) . No thanks  --  I 'll stop out here and look around if you have no objections . JOSH . Oh , no ; make yourself at home , I do n't care what you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ( Goes to steps , R. ) be careful about that ! Exits into house . RICKETY ( looking about mysteriously as she crosses to C. ) . Say , who be you anyway ? I did n't know you was comin ' . FRANK H. ( crossing to L. of RICKETY ) . No ? Then there must be something wrong about it , is n't there ? RICKETY . Oh , I do n't know . FRANK H. Well , I 'm Frank Hopkins and I am from New York . Now who are you ? RICKETY . Oh , well , I ai n't very bright , folks say . My name is Mary Ann Maynard , but they call me Rickety Ann . FRANK H. What for ? RICKETY . I do n't know  --  guess ' cause I had the rickets when I was little . FRANK H. Indeed ! RICKETY ( looking about before speaking ) . Say , do you know what ? FRANK H. No , what is it ? RICKETY . Well , I can climb a tree jest as good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Turns up stage as if to look for a tree . FRANK stops her . ) FRANK H. No , no !  --  I 'll take your word for it . RICKETY ( admiringly  --  surveying FRANK ) . Say , do you know you 're awful nice looking ? FRANK H. Thanks . RICKETY . Yes , you be . FRANK H. Say , Rickety Ann , have you always lived here ? RICKETY . No , I was borrowed out o ' the poorhouse jest to help Aunt Tildy while the visitors are here . But I guess I 'll never go back there any more . FRANK H. No ? RICKETY . Aunt Tildy says if I am a good girl I may stay here jest as long as I want to , and I 'm going to try and be good . Would n't you ? FRANK H. I certainly should . RICKETY . Say , you never lived in the poorhouse , did you ? FRANK H. No indeed . RICKETY . Oh , you would n't like it a bit , I bet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get half enough to eat only on prize days ! FRANK H. What do you get on prize days ? RICKETY . Well , on prize days the one that eats the most puddin' ' and milk gets a piece of pumpkin pie ; and that last time I eat the most puddin' ' and milk . FRANK H. And you got the pie of course . RICKETY . No ;  --  eat so much puddin' ' and milk could n't eat no pie . ( Cow bells heard off , up L. ) Oh , here comes the cows  --  I must go and drive them in the barnyard . ( Exit up L. , calling " Co boss , co boss , co boss , "  --  calling cows . ) FRANK H. ( crossing to R. ) . Good-bye .

FRANK in meantime is following her up returning the flirtation . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There , there ! That will do , young man ! Come and lift the tray out of my trunk . Exit in house . FRANK H.

C. and picks the stems from strawberries , which she has , from one pan to the other . ) MATILDA . Well , I guess I 'll pick the berries out here  --  little mite cooler than it is inside . ( Enter RICKETY from entrance , up L. ) RICKETY ( crosses stage to R. Singing ) . " Cy Prime had a wife but I guess he killed her , now I guess he 's comin ' over to court Aunt Tilda .

MATILDA ( looking archly at CY P. ) . Oh , I guess not ! CY P. ( hitching trousers and scraping ground with toe of boot ) .

I do n't travel on a train unless they run a sleeper . ( JOSH whistles low in surprise . ) They are better than common passenger cars  --  the trucks are wider and more comfortable and do n't come quite so near your head . JOSH . By gum ! It must be pretty risky business , ai n't it ? ( Music cue for sympathetic music pp. in orchestra . ) JACK ( with pathos ) . Yes .

And stop drinking ? JACK . Whew ! Say , old gentleman , that 's a corker , but I 'll try it . ( Rising and putting chair back by well then coming resolutely back to JOSH . ) JOSH . All right , sir  --  there 's a ten-dollar bill . ( Gives ten-dollar bill to JACK . ) It wo n't break me and it may make you . You can take a train and go as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be home in the morning . JACK . Ten dollars , eh ? ( Music stops . ) JOSH . Yes , sir . JACK ( reflectively and with wonder ) . Ten great big dollars ! Say , old gentleman , if you had set the dog on me it would have been more in my way . JOSH . Why , what good would that do ? JACK . Oh , no good ! It would seem more natural , that 's all . JOSH . I suppose so , poor fellow . JACK ( starts up stage to L. C. musingly ) . Go home , yes ! Stop drinking ? ( Returns to JOSH who still sits R. C. ) Say , old gentleman  --  ( Offering money to JOSH. ) you had better take this money back . I do n't honestly believe I can do as I have agreed . JOSH ( rising ) . Well , you can try , ca n't you ? JACK . Yes , I can try . JOSH ( putting hand on JACK 'S shoulder ) . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ai n't too late . JACK ( with determination ) . Well , I will !

Well , never mind  --  if he do n't profit by it , it wo n't be my fault . But I kind of think he will . A man who can express so much feeling at another 's misfortune must have a kind heart .
