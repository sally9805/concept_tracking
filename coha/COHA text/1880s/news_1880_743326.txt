txt Matthias Cronin of No. 226 West Eighteenth-street. of car No. 3 of the Twenty-third-street line , was arrested with 42 passengers on board , and his miserable brokendown horse ready to lie down and " quit . " At the Essex Market he pleaded that he did not mean to overdrive the animal , and that people thronged on the car without his consent . Throughout the entire day the Bleecker-Street Road maintained its reputation for over-crowding . On the ferries , the blinding storm of wind and snow , added to high water and a strong tide , greatly impeded navigation . The crowded boats moved slowly . and were landed with difficulty . Two men were required ' to handle the wheels on most of the lines , and extra precautions were taken against collisions . The Hoboken and Staten Island and other boats having long trips were detained , and their passengers going and coming were belated many minutes . The storm was especially severe on the Sound above Fort Schuyler , and the Fall River and Stonington boats did not arrive until after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a large fleet of smaller vessels lying at anchor above White-stone , unable to proceed from stress of weather . The task of cleaning BroadWay . lined . as it was with thick barricades of fast-freezing snow , and covered to the depth of from four to six inches with pounded snow and slush. was an Herculean one , and fully tested Capt . ' Williams 's abilities in the street-cleaning line . At an early hour he went over the ground in person , and laid his plans for the effectual removal of the vast mess , or the greater portion of it , before daylight . As early as 3 o'clock a brigade of men and carts from the up-town wards started in at Fourteenth-street. and commenced working downward . At 6:30 , as soon as the up-town rush had ceased , the main body under the personal supervision of the Captain , attacked the lower portion of the line from Bowling Green to Grand-street . At 9 o'clock 175 carts and 350 men were at work on Broadway- , and 30 carts and 60 men on Park-row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre of the street and ranged in piles along the gutters , from which they were gathered into the carts and taken to the various piers and dumps . At Pier No. 2 amid Harrison-street the watchman refused to allow the snow to be dumped , and the drivers had to take their loads to the regular dumping grounds higher up . Capt . Williams was assisted in his labors by Deputy Inspector . Plunkett and Commissioner . Much trouble was caused on the up-town avenues and on narrow cross-streets by the shoveling of snow back and forth from the railway tracks to the sidewalks , and from the sidewalks back to the tracks . In front of the Everett House and Clarendon rival gangs of laborers , in the employ of the hotels and railway companies , shoveled the snow on and of the tracks for hours without materially decreasing the amount on either . Among the cases of accidents reported at the hosnitals were those of W. C. Cotman , of No. 77 Suffolk-street , who fell and broke his leg in front of No. 445 Broadway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 121 Bleecker-street . An unknown young woman was picked un unconscious in the snow in front of the Post Office , and was taken to Chambers-Street Hospital . In Brooklyn several trees were blown down , and chimney-tops and tiles sent flying by the high wind . Long e . Island was swept fiercely by the gale on both the north and south shores , although the damage to shipping  --  thanks to the prompt warnings of the Signal Service  --  was comparatively slight . The surf at Rockaway was tremendous , and would have done much greater damage than it did had not the sweep of the gale been alongshore . The snow-fall amounted to 10 inches on a level , and blockaded the roads across the country . Trains on the Northport branch of the Long Island Railroad were delayed an hour and a half by drifts . On Staten Island the - early trains on the railway required two engines each to make headway through the drifts , and street-car travel was partially suspended . The gale was very severe in the Narrows . Pilot-boat No. 4 dragged her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wrecking Company 's dock at Stapleton . Steam-boat travel from Keyport and Sandy Hook was suspended during the height of the storm . Mails from the north-east , west , and south west , were all delayed . The Boston Shore Line train , due at New-York at 7:15 , was 1 hour and 30 minutes behind time : the early mail train on the Pennsylvania " Road was 2 hours late , and the mail over the same line , due at 11:30 A. M. , was four hours behind . The Hudson River mail . due at S o'clock . arrived at 10 , and the 11:30 train on this same line was delayed until 3 P. 111 . The S A. M. mail from Erie was belated an hour and a half , and the one on the Boston through line , due at 5:15 P. M. , arrived an hour later . The late mails were also delayed . The Eastern mail on the New-Haven Road . due at 11 P. M. , got in at 12 ; the Pittsburg mail on the Pennsylvania Central , due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pittsburg , due at 10:30 , until 12:05 . The New-York Central evening mail , due at 7:45 , was three- quarters of an ' ' hour late , and the second late mail on the same road , which should have arrived at 10:30 , did not reach New-York until 11:05 . The 10:30 Erie mail , from Buffalo and Cincinnati , was not in at midnight . The steamer Elm City , from New-Haven , did . not arrive at her dock until 4 P. M. yesterday . having encountered what the Captain called the heaviest storm and the narrowest escape on record . As a passenger tells the story , although moonlight on the Sound , it was so intensely dark that lights could not be seen , and the wind . blew so heavily that the fog-horns could not be heard . When off Sand 's Point , or near there , the steamer lost her reckoning , and the Captain expected momentarily that the vessel would strike . The passengers were accordingly all roused and ordered to dress themselves in anticiaation of possible disaster . Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . An anchor thrown overboard was dragged ; but another and heavier one was added to the weight of its fellow , and the vessel rested in mid-sea until morning . Fortunately , no accident happened , and the passengers were all landed safely at the pier yesterday afternoon , havine passed a night of suspense and terror that they will long remember .
