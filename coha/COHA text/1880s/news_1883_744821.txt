txt The evils of which Mr. PARTRIDGE Complained before the Senate committee are real enough . Whether 2,000 of his 3,000 fellowmembers of the Produce Exchange are gamblers we are not in a position to say , but that there is a great deal of gambling done there there is no doubt . That this diversion interferes somewhat with the normal distribution of products ; that it introduces much uncertainty and risk in the business of men engaged in legitimate distribution , and that it leads many of the speculators or " gamblers " into trouble , is certain . But on the one hand the evil consequences of speculation may be easily exaggerated , and on the other an attempt to prevent them by legislation might readily make them worse . Speculators may for a time interfere with the operation of the laws of supply and demand , or , as the Continental term more accurately defines it , the law of demand and offer , but they can do so only up to a certain point , and the greater their interference the sooner that point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ band of capitalists , has controlled 70,000,000 bushels of wheat since September , 1882 , hoarding it and holding it at prices above those at which foreign markets can be supplied from other countries , seems a very startling one . But , granting its truth , the process is akin to that of the farmer who holds his own crop for a year to take the chances of a rise in prices . The syndicate will not make a profit any more than the farmer if the prices they demand are really above those which the market can be supplied at . If the syndicate loses , it will have had to pay the farmers who raised the grain , exactly an the farmer , if he loses , has to pay his workmen beforehand . And the money in the one case as in the other must have been previously provided from the proceeds of former transactions . It is true that the syndicate enjoys the aid of credit , but so in most instances does the farmer , and with both the credit is only to be got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run , and with both the interest which must be met is one of the checks to undue risks . Whatever may be the consequences of such speculation , the law is powerless to control them . Mr. PARTRIDGE would have it made a penal offense for a man to deal in articles which ho does not own . How would he frame such an act so as not to make it a penal offense for a man to sell goods Which he has bought on credit , a merchant who had given his note , or a farmer who had pledged his crop as security to enable him to hold it ? He would find great difficulty in doing so ; but supposing that he could succeed , how would he get the law enforced ? We have had in this State and in several others laws making it illegal to lend money at above a fixed rate of interest , and this law was not left to the prosecuting attorneys and the Grand Juries to execute . The penalty was in the nature of a fine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most strongly interested in the collection. , He could refuse to pay , and in some States the principal and interest , in others the illegal interest , were forfeited by law by the lender to the borrower . The law was never executed . Millions of money were loaned in defiance of it at rates twice , and often ten times , as high as the law permitted . Of this indebtedness a great part was freely offered to the debtors if they would resist the violation of the law . They would not do so , simply because they could not afford it . A law more potent and penetrating than any statute interfered and practically nullified the statute . In the case of the law against speculation there would be far less chance for its enforcement , because that would depend on indictments , prosecutions , trials , and judicial decisions , and the motive would be wanting to set in operation all this elaborate and clumsy machinery , and to keep it to its work . Any attempt to do so would simply increase the risk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and would stimulate speculation . Mr. PARTRIDGE and the alleged small group of legitimate traders on the Produce Exchange would find when they had called in the complex and by no means efficient forces of legislation and the courts that their later state would be worse than their former .
