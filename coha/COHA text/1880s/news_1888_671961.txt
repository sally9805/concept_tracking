txt Alvin P. Hovey of the First District of Indiana would like to be the Republican candidate for Governor of his State and . may get the nomination if the Republicans permit ex-Gov . Porter to decline the honor . Porter 's doubts about Harrison 's ability to carry his own - State do not depress Hovey and be would jump at the chance of being elected . Col. C. C. Matson , also a member of the House of , Representatives , is a Democratic candidate . To interest the soldiers of the State , whom he assumes to be not all Republicans , lie made a speech a short time ago in which he claimed . for the Democratic Party the disposition to be as generous to the soldiers as the Republicans have been . Mr. Hovey , who is not a conspicuous man in the House , felt impelled to match Mr. Matson 's effort . Saturday be made a long speech , in which he said a great many things when he will probably admit were exaggerated statements and which he will not altogether believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Democratic Party , from the President down , is opposed to . all pension legislation . " He ventured to give a reason for Democratic support of the Mills bill , which has nut been offered before , and which ought to be known by the Senate before Mr. Allison , the tariff reformer of the Senate , brings in his substitute for the Mills measure . Mr. Hovey declared that he was against the Mills bill because , ' if passed , it would destroy all hope of pension legislation . If Mr. Allison is as good a tariff reformer as he was in 1870 , when he advocated a 20 per cent . reduction " all along the line , " his bill , if it makes any reduction of revenue , will be only less offensive to Mr. Hovey in degree than the Mille bill . Mr. Holman interrupted Mr. Hovey 's speech at a convenient moment to state that when the Democrats had attempted to give lanes to soldiers the bill passed by the Democratic House had been beaten by a Republican Senate . Mr. Hovey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tee President for vetoing the private pension bills pushed through Congress by hungry pension agents , and Mr. of New-Hampshire. in answer , brought forward some eloquent statistics . He showed that while during the last three . years of Republican control 191,221 pensioners had been added to the rolls , during the three years or Democratic control the number added was 359,459 . The Republican Administration in the three years before Cleveland came in had expenaed $183,393,000 in pensions , while the Administration of Cleveland in three years had expended $217,399,000 . President Cleveland during his three years of service has signed 1,264 pension bills , as against 1,524 signed by all the Republican Presidents from Lincoln to Arthur . Mr. directed some attention to the subject of the rebel , tags in the War Department and provoked Capt . Bouteile to utter a few words on his pet topic . There was a renewal ill the Senate to-day of the discussion of the fisheries treaty , when the august Republican Party was heard through Senator Riddleberger of Virginia . Riddleberger evidently wants to have a war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a belligerent speech knew the senior Virginia Senator as well as he is known by his collegues , his proposition for a third war with Great Britain will excite no more alarm than the publication of a hitherto undiscovered witticism by Artemus Ward . Mr. Riddleberger wisely waived the task of analyzing tile fisheries treaty , and expressed his willingness to stand by the opinion of its provisions pronounced by the attorney of the Eastern interests that are opposing a settlement of the dispute by diplomacy . The speech of Riddleberger can scarcely excite any other feeling than one of contempt for a party that can countenance so flippant and trumpery a discussion of such a serious problem . The speech of Mr. Morgan of Alabama which foi1 owed it ' was to the point , and it indicated distinctly the weakness of the Republicans in their position . He made a point in criticising their refusal to negotiate , while the Republicans are declaring that the time for negotiation has passed . declaring Hoar has just secured the appointment of a committee of Senators who are to enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of negotiation on points interesting Canada and the United States . In the course of a brief controversy with Mr. Everts , Mr. Morgan expressed ins willingness to join a party that would stand for the abrogation of the treaty of 1818 , and contend even in arms for the rights secured by the Revolutionary war , but lie expressed preference for dealing with the trouble by pacific means . He took up the majority report against the treaty to show how plainly a partisan feeling inspired the opposition to the agreement and endeavored to find out from the Republicans why they did not prove their ability to cope with the matter in controversy by amending the treaty . The fact is that the Senate Republicans are no more capable of offering reasonable amendments to the fisheries treaty than the House Republicans were to offer a reasonable substitute for the Mills Tariff bill . The motto of Mr. Edinunds and Mr. Hoar is : " Put the Democrats in a hole . " With that motto and a general " permit " policy to guide them , they are determined that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be irritation between Canada ana the United States . Representative John D. Long yesterday addressed the following letter to his constituents : WASHINGTON . Aug. 1 , 1888 . To the People . of the Second Cungressionat DS:drict of Massachusetts : Declining to be a candidate for renomination as a member of Congress , I thank you most sincerely for the confidence you have placed in me anti the great kinduess I have had at your hands . I feel deeply the generosity with which , since I entered political service in 1875 , 1 have been treated by all constituencies that have intrusted to me their interests . Nothing could be more cordial than their support , or more delightful than my relation with them . No man ever looked back on a more unbroken record in these respects . I am also glad to say that such public place as I have had came without money and without price , without obligation except the obligation of deserving the confidence of a constituency . and without solicitation at any time of any man 's help or favor or influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my services , which I have tried to render faithfully , were of a value that could not be easily replaced , I would still tender them . But nearly six years ' experience in the National House of Representatives convinces me that such is not the ease . and , preferring on personal grounds the independence and opportunities of private life while I can avail myself of them . I desire to retire from your service , but not . I trust , from that participation in public affairs which is the duty of a citizen in the ranks , and which he can often make more useful than if he held place . I therefore withdraw my name from the approaching convention . In taking this step I beg I shall not be misunderstood as in any way depreciating the dignity of a seat in Congress . It is a place for good , faithful work . Much of it is. indeed , in the line of looking after the local and personal interests at the national capital of nearly 200,000 people , but it also rises to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes be to your judgment , this is substantially a body of good and true men , especially zealous to promote what they believe to be the interests of the constituencies they represent . They are certainly the servants of the people , and I appreciate the accuracy of that designation when I witness the unflagging alacrity with which they discharge the innumerable calls of their masters , and thus give.a convincing illustration of the wisdom of basing tenure of office on good behavior . With the most sincere respect , and , remembering what my relations have been with you in so many of the pleasant fields of Massachusetts public.life. with warm personal regard and gratitude . I am very truly yours ; JOHN D. LONG . Secretary Whitney hits approved the report of the Board of Survey on the Atlanta , so far as it pertains to . the ordinary repairs required , which will cost about $23,000 to place the ship in a seaworthy condition , . but has still under consideration the recommendation that the Sickles steam-steering gear be replaced by Willianison 's . Capt . Bunco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes ; in for a share of the criticism . It is saictKUt he desires the present gear to be removed . because the escape . of steam from the engine , which is directly under his cabin , annoys him . It is said that the Sickles gear has served well its purpose on the Trenton for 14 years . This Make of gear was removed from the Lancaster for the same reason that it is alleged Capt . Bunco wishes it replaced . The escape of steam annoyed the Admiral . The other make , the engineers assert , can be placed in a smaller space and therefore need not be under the cabin , and for this reason the change is demanded . * Objection has been made to the assignments of the recent graduates of the navy . Their nominations as officers of the navy have not yet been forwarded to the Senate , and it is understood that the delay is occasioned by a protest from the Engineer Corps against commissioning one of the graduates , an Assistant ? Engineen This graduate . Cadet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Engineers , object to having their corps filled up with inefficient materiaL ? The law , however , requires that the surplus graduates , after va- The statues of Commodore Stockton and Gem Phil Kearny , New-Jersey 's contribution to the collection of representative men in the old Hall of Representatives , will soon formally be presented to and accepted by Congress . The Hon. William Walter Phelps received . a letter from Gov . Green asking that a day be set apart for the formal presentation and reception of the gifts . This letter will probably be laid before the House by Speaker Carlisle to-morrow , when Mr. Phelps will offer a concurrent resolution that Aug. 21 be named as the day for the ceremony of presentation . It is not wonderful that Senator Aldrich has been worn out with his work in attempting to prepare a Tariff bill that will suit Republicans who want a great deal of protection , as well as Republicans who do not want so much . Inn Aldrich has borne the greatest share of the troublesome task which is promising to break down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the making of a thoroughly satisfactory rate on steel billets . The steel rail men have the benefit of a rate of $17 per ton on steel rails , and will fight a proposition to reduce this to $14 . The duty on steel billets , of which a great many things are made , is $8 , and the manufacturers of steel billets have about persuaded the Senators to raise the duty to $10 20 . Mr. Moen of the well-known firm of Moen , Washburn &; Co. , has heard of this proposition . His firm not only makes wire out of steel billets and fences out of the wire , but it makes wire rod enough to sell to a great many small concerns that do not make wire . He does not want the duty raised , as the firm would be " ruined " if its opportunity to use the billets produced abroad was interfered with . The small concerns that draw wire only and make no rods are anxious to have the duty on wire rods reduced . This does not suit Moen , Washburn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Massachusetts manufacturers are in a " trust " to keep up the cost of rods and prevent access to foreign markets . The email concerns came here early , but it is doubtful if they secure a reduction of the wire rods duty in the face of such well-capitalized opposition as the Moen concern . The State Department is informed that the newly-appointed Minister Plenipotentiary from Persia to the United States will arrive at New York with his suite about the middle of August . His name is Hadji Hossein Kouli Khan Mohamed el Vesari.
