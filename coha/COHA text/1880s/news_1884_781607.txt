txt The consideration of military-bills which . are neither on the private calendar nor merged in the annual Appropriation bill is nowadays such a novelty that the House must have been startled last week to find that it had passed in rapid succession half a dozen of these measures . It remains for the Senate to do its duty by them , and though the session is approaching an end , most of them deserve the brief attention necessary for their enactment . The place of first importance we should assign to the House bill establishing a retired list for enlisted men . Under this bill a private or non-commissioned officer of the army or Marine Corps , after thirty years ' service , can , upon his application , be retired on three-fourths of his pay and allowance . This bill , which the House passed without opposition , would aid in checking desertions , encouraging re-enlistments , and raising the standard of discipline . A service which holds out as an inducement to a youth the prospect of retiring , at the age of 50 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly fail to be attractive . After men have once entered it the stimulus to re-enlist Will be-greater at the end of each successive term of enlistment . It may be supposed that the-expense of such . a retired list would be very large . This , however , is not the fact . There.are now only about fifty enlisted men in the . army who have served thirty years , and any additional expense upon the increase of this number would presumably be offset by the increased stability and efficiency of the service . There are now between 3,000 and 4,000 desertions every year . This drain from so small. = army represents great losses to the Government . The cost of recruiting , and of clothing , training , and transporting the recruits is very large . That there - would be less desertion and more re-enlistment  --  under such a law can not be doubted . It will allow the soldier , too , to pass his old age ' with hiSlamily , instead of being separated from them at the-Soldiers ' Home . The bill providing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and authorized allowances for property destroyed merits consideration , if only ix . order to substitute a general law for numerous special acts of legislation . The proper accounting officers of the Treasury may pay established claims giving - attention to five provisos  --  that the property was lost without the claimant 's fault , or that : it was shipped on an unseaworthy vessel by due authority , or that it was lost by the claimant 's attention to saving property of the United States simultaneously endangered ; that it was not lost in time of war ; that the compensation shall be limited by the Secretary of War to reasonable articles of personal property . Under such a law Congress would no longer occupy itself with Private HINES 'S trousers , over which its committees once labored so industriously , nor with the destroyed garments of Sergt. TREUNE , which have been legislated upon at the present session , after their owner has waited half a dozen years for redress : The House bill reorganizing the Inspector-General 's Department should become a law . This department now consists nominally of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LieutenantColonels , and one Major . In fact , however , nine other officers have to be detailed , from the line , so vast is the extent of the country occupied by the army . And hot only have the posts of the army been extended from ocean to ocean and from British Columbia to the Gulf , but , since April , 1864 , an inspection of military disbursements four times a year has been required of the department . Some years accounts aggregating nearly sixty million dollars are examined and verified . The House bill gives the department one Brigadier-General , two Colonels , two Lieutenant-Colonels , and six Majors , and it is believed that these eleven officers , with an aggregate annual pay of $33,500 , could perform the duties now assigned to fourteen officers , with an aggregate pay of $39,100 . The House bill to settle accounts of army officers who served during the rebellion , and to amend the articles of war in regard to the method of appointing courts-martial , may perhaps receive the Senate 's consideration . As to promotion in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed its own bill on that subject , and a conference ought to be able to make an acceptable compromise .
