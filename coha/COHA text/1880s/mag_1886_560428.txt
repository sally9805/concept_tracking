THE Unitarian Church of America is a body small in comparison with most of the other churches . It has no creed , imposed by authority , and the single statement , which all its members would agree to , is the statement that they would have no such formal dogmatic statement . Every member of this church is free to make his own formula of belief or conviction , or to make none . IPractically , however , the Unitarians are people who lay great stress on character . They would say that the essentials of religion are Faith , Hope and Love . This is what all communions say . But , while other communions have to spend much money and time , in maintaining against each other their ritual , their dog .. ma , or their method of government , this Unitarian Church , having no special ritual , no distinctive doctrine , and no authorized form of government , exists only to proclaim its gospel , and to bring in the kingdom of God , in the world . Ask what this gospel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hope , and Love , the elements of Eternal Life , as Paul described them . They are the Unitarian 's religion . Faith in a Father above himself ,  --  Hope in an Eternal Future , and Love for all the children of that Father . He organizes with others , that he may quicken his own Faith , Hope , and Love , and may extend Faith , Hope , and Love over the world , and he has no other object in his organization . I have been asked by the Editor of the NORTH AMERICA1*r REvIEW to say in a short article why I am a Unitarian . This means , why am I a member of the Unitarian Church of America , for there are many Unitarians , who have not connected themselves with it . There is a sense in which all Christians arc Unitarians . Dr. Hook , who was called the " high and dry " doctor of the Anglican Church , says in his Dictionary : " U*wrAI*t&amp;1*s . A title which certain heretics who do not worship the true God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who worship the one and only God do not hold the doctrine of the Divine Unity . Christians worship the Trinity in Unity , and the Unity in Trinity . " Dr. Hook is entirely mistaken in his historical statement , as in some others . In fact , the name Unitarian seems to have been first applied to the people in Hungary , who wished to harmonize all confessions , and held by the decrees for toleration formulated by the Convention at Thorde in 1563 . It would be interesting to know whether the word " Unitarius " occurs earlier in history . The Unitarian communion is as old as Christianity . The Unitarian Church believes in the present work of God in the world . The words , " Our Father " of the Lord 's Prayer , " Children of God , " " Sons of God , " in the New Testament , are not poetical phrases to these people , but expressions of the real divinity of human nature , to which all its improvement in the past is due , and from which indefinite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church has been called in ecclesiastical language , " the Church of the Holy Spirit , " so resolute are its writers to admit no authority in the past , which shall overrule the right of the present to examine every opinion , and to determine , in the present moment , the value of every law . This does not imply any disrespect to the mission of Christ , or the instruction of the Gospels , or the historic Church . The Unitarians are constantly charged with such disrespect . It is supposed that they will be " Antinomians , or lawless people . But in truth , as has been said , they lay very great stress on character , and , in practice , regard character as the test of religion . Having no formula of creed to offer as such a test , they have no way to judge of men but by their fruits , and they seek no other . It ought not be difficult to understand , philosphically , the position of such a communion regarding Christian history , or the Christian records . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence with man . As he is present " now , " he was present " then . " Respect for his present love does not involve disrespect for his older revelations , for if he was present " then , " he is present " now . " If , indeed , men were not quite besotted in their determmation to make God into a larger man , and to bind him with the restraints of time and place , it would be simply impossible for them to conceive of him as making one Revelation at one " time , " and another at another " time "  --  or to make more Revelation at // one " time " than at another . There is no " time " to the Infinite God . The creeds , even , are willing to admit this . If man would admit it , in their own common sense and common language , we should be spared many of the annoyances of men-made theologies . First , then , the Unitarian Church exists for the worship of God . But faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , like all other Christian people , the Unitarian Church believes in the immortality of man . It undertakes to manage life here on the plan and scale in which immortal beings can and should live . It is not enough to believe in immortality . Man must live as immortals live . And such faith in God and such expectation of immortality involve of course personal duty , and define man 's personal relation to other men . The Unitarian Church is seeking the coming of God 's kingdom . His kingdom will come , as men all recognize God as father . Their own brotherhood follows , of necessity . The Scripture texts therefore , again , are , for us , not exaggerated . " God has made of one blood all nations of men . " " Bear ye one another 's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ . " These texts state for the Unitarian Church the relation of man with man . And , indeed , here is the whole of the Unitarian religion , and , aa Unitarians believe , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hope of Heaven , Love of Man . When Paul named " Faith , Hope and Love , " as the abiding and eternal elements of life , the same for men as for angels , he was not speaking rhetorically . He meant that in these three may be found the full life of God 's children . I suppose it necessary , in the outset of my article , to make this statement of what the Unitarian Church is , because I know very well that half the readers of this article have never heard of that church  --  or if they have , have heard of it only in some smart fling in a controversial sermon , where Unitarians and Universalists are turned over to contempt , perhaps with " paynim hounds , " or perhaps with " publicans or sinners . " Why should there be any separate church to maintain these simple principles which belong to all Christian communions ? The answer is simple . The Unitarian Church exists simply to bring in the kingdom of God . It has nothing else to do . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heresy . It has no creed and can have no heretics . If a congregation wants a man to preach , // he will preach . If it does not come to hear him he must address the walls . The Unitarian Church never has to revise its platform . It has no platform to revise . It has none of the side occupations of the other churches . It simply has to bring in the kingdom of God , to make His presence and power clear to people who have not found Him , have not seen Him , or have not heard Him . This is no place to go into a discussion of the points of detail where Christians of this nineteenth century school , or of the Present Holy Spirit , differ from the theologies which took form between the fourth century and our own time . It is enough to say , that we regard the fixed old formulas of those theologies as always dangerous , and as often oppressive . The world grows . Its science advances because its knowledge advances . Religion , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same . But theology , which is the statement of what man knows and can tell of himself , of Heaven and of God , ought to be always new . It is because of the cramp or restriction , placed by meditEval theology on the thought and purpose of educated men , that educated and intelligent men speak sometimes with contempt , more often with doubt , and very often in denial of the Christian religion . A letter before me , from an accomplished scholar in natural science , in England , says frankly , " I have never been able to understand myself , how Christianity has ever survived modem astronomy and the study of comparative religion . " When I read this to a Unitarian , who has been educated in the Unitarian Church , and has known little or nothing of theological dogma , he can not understand it . " What in the world has modern astronomy to do with the religion of Jesus Christ I " ' he asks . But many a reader of these words will know perfectly well , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Dante , for instance , that this world was the center of creation , and the important part of it , that sun and stars were only convenient lights set to enlighten this world , and revolving daily about it , so long it was not difficult to believe that God once took a special human form , went and came in Palestine , and , if you please , died upon the cross . So long it was possible to think of him in a certain place ; to think of the Saviour as now " sitting at his side , " and to adopt in good faith many of the medis3val formulas of theology or Christology . But , in that sense , this is not possible now . When a man says // now that God was incarnate in Christ , he does not mean what the Church fathers of the middle ages meant . When , therefore , an amiable and well-meaning man , like Dr. Thomson , says that when Jesus Christ walked about Nazareth , he must have taken a peculiar interest in traveling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is simply ridiculous to men of this time . They know that Nazareth and its hills were formed by an Infinite Power , about **27;420;TOOLONG ; about whose nature there may be division . And they know that it is not in any fair sense of words that any one says that Jesus Christ , who walked in Nazareth , made those hills , any more than Mary , his mother , made them . When , therefore , any church of any communion ties up in its creed any statement which looks that way , such a man as writes this letter to me simply sets aside that church , as belonging to an era before Galileo . But the Unitarian Church makes no such pretensions . It worships God as the father of men . It is willing to say that Jesus Christ taught the world to worship God as the father of men . But God had been man 's father before Jesus Christ ; and many men in many lands , who never heard of Jesus Christ , tried to worship God as father of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or the study of comparative religion , brings no terror . It only brings more examples of the universal presence of that Spirit of Truth , which in the New Testament is called " the Holy Spirit . " It is , as has been said , to this Holy Spirit , always present with men because men are of the divine nature , that the Unitarian Church , from first to last , appeals . What we try for , then , in forming our churches , is religion , independent of theology . Let every man have such a theology as he likes . He may or may not make a statement as to the nature of God . He may or may not understand the nature of Christ . He may or may not know how to reconcile free knowledge in God with free will in man . All this is no affair of the Unitarian Church . For what we are eager about is religion , and not the / ology . A simple and provable theology certainly is a very good thing ; just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or of evolution , is a very good thing ; but religion , the life of man with God , or his infinite and immortal life , is a greater reality , and is the only reality for which our churches as churches stand and care . // We withdraw ourselves from the other organizations because they do not yet say this . Their leaders do not yet dare proclaim the severance from religion , of human opinion about God and man and Christ . When they do , they also will proclaim themselves Unitarians . The Unitarian Church consists of men and of churches who in practice make this distinction . We make it in our time , chiefly because the mediaeval theological armor worn by most of the church is so oppressive . It does not belong to this time . Literature will have nothing to do with it . Science will have nothing to do with it . History shows pitilessly that it came from very questionable origins ; and in practice it does not serve any purpose of to-day . Take the doctrine of total depravity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of America try to believe it to-day . They try to believe that nine-tenths of the human family are " incapable of good . " They can be made to say , on occasion , that nine-tenths of the human family , not having been converted , are " of their own nature inclined to evil , " and that therefore " every person born into this world deserves God 's wrath and damnation . " That is the Sunday theory  --  but if you meet these men Monday they hold no such theory . Every one of them asks a stranger the road-quito sure that he will tell the truth if he can-quite sure that he is not inclined of nature to lie . The people of this country have with great confidence trusted its whole welfare to universal suffrage . Christian men join cordially in that trust . They never would have done so had they really believed that all the voters , or nine-tenths of the voters , are " incapable of good , " or that they " deserve God 's wrath and damnation . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which only hampers the church . The Unitarian Church cuts loose from all such talk ; it will not puzzle young people or old people with it . It holds to religion , and it bids theology stand on one side . I doubt if it is necessary for me to give other illustrations . I think that illustrations of the cramp , as I called it , the hinderance and obstruction of theologies , which the churches carry as matters of sentiment and history , and not as matters of present conviction , have been presenting themselves , all along , to people who have read thus far in this paper . A statesman of some distinction , said to my brother , Charles Hale , some twenty years ago , // that the men in the pulpit must keep quiet about political matters . " They make us say we believe a lot of things that nobody does believe , and if we say that , they must keep themselves quiet about the affairs of the State . " This was , substantially , his declaration . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  mainly fed in colleges and " seminaries , " - to throw old things overboard in theology . The professors and historians feel as they might if you asked them to break some fine old stained glass windows , because the figures were out of drawing . " It is so venerable , " they say . " It is so in harmony with our traditions . " But they will find out , and are finding out , that the " Spirit of Truth " does not care much for traditions or venerableness . The children of God will be apt to assert the privileges of children of God . God is at hand . And His children are very apt , when they have once began , to confide in Him . The particular point where , in America , tbe mediaeval theology has given way most hopelessly in our time , is its horrible dogma about hell . That myth is too terrible for an intelligent , Godloving race of children of God to hold to , after they have any sense of their own rights and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ honor of leading the attack on this dogma , and they must have a noble satisfaction at seeing now that people have come to that last step of belief , in which they say they have always known it was untrue . * But the creeds maintain it still . No religious communion excepting the Unitarians and Universalists has dared to throw it over , as a bit of mere pagan addition to Christian truth . While the sects hold to it , they will remain so far parted from the simple church of the " Spirit of Truth . " And here I ought to say that there is no distinction , excepting those of history and organization , between the Unitarian and the Universalist churches of America . As organizations , they spring from two origins . I suppose it is fair to say that the Universalist churches are the direct and legitimate offspring of Calvinism . " If an infinite atonement were made , why should not all men be saved by it . " This was the pitiless question of its founders . * Louis Agassis says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement : 1 . That it is contrary to the Bible . 2 . That it has been announced before . 8 . That the people talking always believed it . // The Unitarian cburches of New England came from Arminianism . " We know salvation is free ! It is free for all men . " But these are distinctions of the past ,  --  are only of interest to historians . The two churches now , with different national organizations , stand , as I suppose , for just the same ideas . Another illustration of the wretched hamper of the creeds which naturally attracts attention now , is the difficulty of adjusting them to what men really know of the word of God in the world . A man is satisfied , for instance , that the nebular theory stands on good ground ,  --  that the presumption is in its favor . He need not , therefore , disbelieve that a present spirit is in all the motions and changes which that theory supposes . He may worship that Spirit-may give Him a name . He may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . But , when he goes to church , and is told by the preacher , that this Spirit made the world " by his Son , " or " through his Son " - he answers , at once , that this is not the present law-God in all life-which he has been told is the basis of religion . He says that the intervention of subordinate-or in any sense secondary powers-between the power which Is , and the movement which is to be explained-is a return to the spirit of heathenism , or of many gods . But I may as well stop in one place as another in enumerating instances where the mediaeval creeds , still existing in most churches , defy and stand in the way of the intelligent , conscientious well-informed convictions of to-day . But here , just at the year 1886 , there comes in a very curious temporary suggestion , which at this moment is an element of a good deal of importance when a man is asked why he is attached to the Unitarian Church . The suggestion is made on all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their medkevalism as fast as they can . The ministers preach it less and less . Only the ministers believe in it at all , it is often said . In substance the laymen* do not care for it . When one contends that Jesus Christ did not make the hills around Nazareth ; or that there is no eternal hell ; or that men are not totally depraved , we are told that he is merely attacking straw men . When we say that Faith , Hope and Love are the essentials , we are told that all churches hold to them . This statement of the laxity of all the medieval churches is well founded . // 238 THE NORTH AMERICAN RE VIE W The truth is that the whole method of religious communion has been changed in the last two centuries , and therefore the whole statement of the sects has been changed . Nobody knows this better than the professed theologians , and I need not spend a word in arguing it with them . To laymen , who do not pretend to be professed theologians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Imagine the minister of an Episcopal church asking one of his parisho*iers why he does not receive the sacrament . Imagine the reply , " Because I do not believe that Jesus of Nazareth is now sitting in Heaven awaiting the last day , with his flesh and bones and all that appertaineth to human nature . This is one of the articles of your church , and I will not pretend that I believe it . " We know perfectly well what the minister 's answer would be . It would be simply , " Do not distress yourself about that ; that is simply a matter of history . We print it in the prayer book as matter of history . At best , the language is obscure in all statements written iu another century . One man may interpret it in one way , and another in another , and a third may dismiss it without interpreting it at all . " Nor is such laxness at all peculiar to the Episcopal Church . I think the Methodist Church of America would receive me into its pulpit to-morrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it really believed that I regarded Jesus Christ as the Saviour of the world . Why ! even in the Catholic Church they are perfectly willing to waive the assumption of infallibility . Thus , in their infallibility , they have said , and still say that no man or woman shall read Milton 's Paradise Lost . But does anybody suppose that an intelligent Catholic hesitates to read Milton 's Paradise Lost ? Or if , having read it , he met the priest and asked for absolution for his sin , would this be anything but a joke ? So , I could name without difficulty fifty Unitarians who are now received to the communion of churches of stiff Calvinistic creeds , with the perfect understanding on the part of the persons who receive them , that they do not believe these creeds . Now all this means , simply , that the methods and statements of churches are wholly changed . The directors of churches once thought these things of the first importance . They do not think so now . They think they are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The truth is that the Christian church can no longer afford to play with this fol-de-rol of minute distinctions . // WHY AM I A UNITARIAN ? When a host is gathering for battle , the chiefs of its different corps do not discuss the figures of the embroidery on the jackets of the men . There are now many people , who are people of consideration too , who tell the church to her face that she is a venerable humbug ; that the church must prove herself good for something . There are many people who tell her ministers that there is no God , and no immortality . There are some there who say they know no distinction between right and wrong . There are so many of these people-intelligent and considerable people that she has to determine to attend to the essentials of her business and to let the non-essentials go . " It may be for years and it may be forever , " that she must give up the luxury of fooling with them . " The business of the Church of Christ is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she is not on the aggressive she is lost . " Like everything else in Heaven above or on the earth beneath , she will be judged by her fruits , and only so . To this general statement , every large-minded churchman of every communion consents . True , you would find men who did not assent , but they are " backward-looking sons of time . " They are not men of this age . They are specimens of another age , probably formed with care and difficulty in some medi*oval school of theology . The statement I have made would be agreed upon in spirit or for " substance of doctrine " by all broad churchmen of whatever communion . It is here that there comes in the very curious temporary suggestion now made to us on every side . Does not this show then that the Unitarian Church , as an independent or in any way a separate communion , is unnecessary ? If a Roman Catholic priest will excuse me with a laugh , from the commands of the Index ; if an Episcopal priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of history ; if a Presbyterian is willing to receive me to his communion table , nay to baptize my child , why should I be more careful about their consistency than they are ? Why should I not take them at their word ? " Let the dead bury the dead ! If these gentlemen are not annoyed by such relics of mediaeval darkness , why should I be ? " I put that question once to an intelligent and devoted preacher who was coming to us from an Orthodox pulpit . He answered it in a single sentence . He had given me a sketch of his last Sunday 's // sermon . Nothing more broad was ever preached by Martinean or Bellows or Savage . He had preached it to six hundred people in an Evangelical Orthodox church in Connecticut , and they seemed well pleased . I said , at once , " Why come to us then ? Stay with this people . We do not care a fig what they call themselves . Congregationa , lists or Unitarians-that is all one . Half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in fact the only purely earthly thing we carry . Stay where you are . Nothing can be more free than that is . " The poor man looked puzzled , for an instant , and then said , " Oh , you do not understand at all . Why ! I shalt have to pay for that sermon , now , all through four or five Sundays . For so long a time as that , at least , I must preach about Noah 's Ark , or Solomon 's Temple , or the fall of man , or the decrees , or some other bit of those things . It is not more than once in six weeks that I have the privilege of such audacious freedom as I enjoyed last Sunday . " When one asks who takes away his freedom , the answer varies . But it always is " they " who will not permit , whoever " they " may be . It is some " association " or " consociation , " some " synod " or " presbytery , " some newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some council of prelates which practically has the power of hindering this young man from saying in the pulpit of God 's house what be believes to be the truth of God . That clergyman 's statement of his unwillingness to be longer governed by " they " or by " them " was a sufficient answer to my question . We who are in the Unitarian Church choose to be where there is no such oversight or watchfulness . Unless a man will proclaim the best thing he knows , we do not want him to proolaim anything . We do not want any half-hearted utterances . We do not want any blinded leaders . Granting , however , that a preacher can not , in honor , preach in the pulpit of a church which holds to theories which he believes false , laymen are told that this is no concern of theirs . They do not want to preach . And it is in conformity with this view , that so many Unitarians now assist in the worship of churches , whose creeds belong hundreds of years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , however , certainly a great danger here . A man is expected to sit , or to kneel in a church where the ministrations , to a certain extent , have the ring of a mere function . That is to say , they are continued , week in and out , not because // anybody cares much for them now in this form , but because some one else arrayed them so a great while ago . Now , here , the whole question is , whether the service is a function , or whether it is genuine and spontaneous . I shall never forget the expression , almost of agony , on the face of a Catholic priest at Mayence , whose duty it was to repeat the Lord 's prayer thirty-five times in one hour , in a service called the " triginta . " He tried so hard to make the words real every time , and he knew the hypocrisy of the whole if they were not . I wonder if that poor fellow is in this world now . Now , if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good , nor anybody ; no , nor if he be a machine . For myself , I can attend the service of the Roman Church with pleasure and profit . I am no sectarian , and though that church is " first of schismatics , " I , who belong to the older church , can condone her heresy . If I find myself in a Catholic town in Europe , where there is no Protestant Church , I always go to worship with the Catholics . I can continue to do so , till the thing rings false . Perhaps the priest shrugs his shoulders when he talks to me in private of a miracle . Perhaps , because he knows I am a heretic , he makes to me confessions which he would not make standing in the pulpit . From that moment , I can not join in a service conducted by that man . Here , I think , all serious men would agree with me , be they clergymen or laymen . But why not carry that analogy farther ? What is the moral attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry shall not be pursued ? What is the attitude of the Roman Church , which publishes , every year , a list of books which shall not be read ? What is the attitude of the Methodist Church , which , within the year past , has been turning professors out of its Southern colleges , because they assented to the doctrine of evolution ? What is the attitude of the Episcopal Church , broad as it tries to be ? Does it believe in the " resurrection of the body , " in the sense with which common people take those words , in the sense of Michael Angelo 's picture of the Judgment ? When I asked an Episcopal minister that question , he said if I did not like the Apostles ' Creed , I. might take the Nicene-which says nothing about the resurrection of the body . What is the attitude of a church , which , while it claims all the advantages of a creed , offers you two , and tells you that you may pick and choose ? We understand entirely the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written creed . That is the position of the Unitarian Church . But , to have a creed when you want it , and not to have it when you do not want it  --  to have a creed in public , and not to have one in private-that is a different thing . When we find that in a church , we say the false ring affects the whole . How are we to train our children in such a church ? Are they to repeat the creeds or not ? Are they to repeat one or the other ? Are they to turn over to the end of the book and read the articles of religion ? Or are they to be told that these are only good for clergymen , and not for little boys and girls ? So of the position of Unitarians in a Presbyterian Church , generous as that church often is . We are told that we may safely worship with our Presbyterian brethren , and that they will not be hard on ns . They will not ask us to sign their articles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their Sunday School . They will ask us to contribute to their missions . We must , indeed , do this as men of honor , if we share in the advantages of their united worship . But what are the Sunday schools and missions to teach ? Why , we are asked to help to teach the doctrines of the Westminster Catechism . The Presbyterian Church has , at no time , squarely and above board , said that modern philosophy , modern literature , modern science , and , in a word , the whole modern world , repudiate those doctrines . We may , then , sit in the pews . We need not sing an offensive hymn . But does this business stop there ? No ! We are made partners in the guilt of that church , if we do what we are asked to do . Every time she refuses ordination to an honest man , simply because he does not believe in the eternal damnation of half mankind , we shall be made partners in what she is doing .
