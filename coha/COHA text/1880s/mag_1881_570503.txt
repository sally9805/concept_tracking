ARTICLE V-THE LIFE OF DR . CHARLES HODGE . The L*/* of Charles Elodge , D.D. , LL.D. , Professor in the Theological Seminary at Princeton , N. J. By his son , A. A. lODGE . New York : Charles Scribner 's Sons . 1880 . THE publication of a biography of Dr. Charles lodge is an event which has been expected ever since his death . He was the most distinguished leader and theologian of the Presbyterian Churcb , in that portion of it whose sympathies naturally turned towards the seminary at Princeton . For fifty-eight years he was connected with that institution as an instructor , and for at least one-half of that period was its most prominent and widely-known professor . During the greater part of his life , he was regarded as the ablest defender of the doctrinal system which he held . As a controversialist he had few equals in the country , and none among his own party . In his influence upon the minds of living ministers of the Gospel he had probably reached as large a number as any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own line , or even in any line , were better known in Europe . To pass over such a life without giving a record of its history to the world would have seemed to his admirers a violation of sacred duty , and to all a serious mistake . When the volume now before us , therefore , was given to the public , near the close of the last year , it was welcomed by many readers in various parts of the country . It has been perused , as we can not doubt , with great interest both by those who were once the theological adversaries of the distinguished professor , and by those who were his friends . It has left its own impression wherever it has been read . A brief review of it in the pages of the New Englander will not be out of place . Dr. lodge was born in the city of Philadelphia , on the 28th of December , 1797 . In the first two chapters of the biography , notes are given which he made himself with regard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . From the statements there made we learn that he was descended , on the father 's side , from a great grandfather , who lived in the north of Ireland , three of whose sons emigrated to this country . They were Presbyterians of the type of the region from which they came , and appear to have been godly men who were deeply interested in the welfare of the church . One of these sons , Andrew lodge , had fifteen children , the eighth of whom was Dr. Hugh lodge , the father of the subject of this memoir . Through the marriages of several of these fifteen children with members of distinguished families , a wide connection was established between the descendants of Andrew lodge and men who , in the following generations , became prominent in various walks of life . The lodge family seem to have resided in Philadelphia from the beginning , and to have been , in general , persons not only of social position but also of property . After the death of Professor lodge 's father , however , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother were greatly curtailed by the condition of public affairs , and the education of himself and his brother were secured only by great effort and sacrifice on her part . Sh6 was from Boston , of Huguenot ancestry , and of an honorable family . The son of these parents was born , therefore , of a worthy race . He had an inheritance of respectability , of piety , of mental vigor , and , we may add , of Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism . As his father died when he was only six months old , his education was , of course , wholly under the charge of his mother from his earliest life . The recollections of his childhood , which he committed to writing among the last words that he penned , are accompanied by expressions of his gratitude to her , and by words which many of us most joyfully repeat from the fullness of our own memory : " To our mother , my brother and myself under God , owe absolutely everything . To us she devoted her life . For us she prayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fact of his father 's death , probably , that his elder brother , who alone , of three children , survived to the time of his birth , became to him through life even more than a brother . He was only eighteen months older , but from early years was a kind of guardian and pro . // tector to the younger son ; a relationship which was modified , of necessity , as life passed on , but which developed into an uncommonly beautiful fraternal love and care even to old age . Of his school life , the notes of Dr. lodge give comparatively few recollections . He has a very kindly word for all his teachers , and seems from his account of himself to have been a boy of intelligence and studious habits , but one scarcely giving promise in those early years of the eminence of his subsequent career . That he might have better advantages in his preparation for college , and that his brother might begin his undergraduate course , his mother removed to Princeton in 1812 . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that place , as a member of the sophomore class . He graduated in September , 1815 , at the age of eighteen . Princeton College was , at that time , under the presidency of Dr. Ashbel Green , whose term of service began in the same month in which he became a student . As Dr. Green had previously been for some years the friend and pastor of his mother , young lodge was naturally brought under his influence . In the year of his entrance dpon the college course , also , the Theological Seminary at Princeton was founded . Dr. Archibald Alexander had just been inaugurated as the first professor , and naturally , in so small a community , all students of the college were affected in their opinions and character by a man of such peculiar power . It was , indeed , while he was finishing his school studies , that Mr. lodge was first brought to the notice of Dr. Alexander . The Doctor , one day , entered the school-room , and , to use the language of the notes , found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Although the result of the interview , if such it might be called , was not a very satisfactory one , inasmuch as he was unable to give the derivation of the Greek word for faUh , which the Doctor asked him , yet there must have been something to inspire interest in the boy on the part of the questioner , for , even from that hour , he seems to have cherished a fatherly and friendly regard for him . To this feeling on the part of the eminent professor , which grew stronger as years passed on , the boy , as he came to manhood , owed the entire career which was opened before // him . It is not often the case that an older friend does so much for one who is younger , or that a younger friend so fully justifies the opinions and satisfies the desires of the older . Dr. lodge became the colleague and helper of Dr. Alexander for many years . After the death of the latter , he succeeded him in his special work , and continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had believed in , to another generation . Perhaps no man ever lived more fully in another , by reason of his influence , than did Dr. Alexander in Dr. lodge . In college young lodge took a respectable position from the beginning , and at the end of the course he shared with one of his classmates the second honor of his class , and pronounced the valedictory oration . During his collegiate career his thoughts were especially turned towards the subject of religion , and in his Senior year he became a member of the Presbyterian Chnrch in Princeton . From the beginning of his Christian course , he seems to have felt himself called to the ministry as his work in life . After spending somewhat more than a year following his graduation in recruiting his health , he accordingly entered the Theological Seminary in November , 1816 . Here he devoted himself to the duties of the place , and was naturally brought under the more immediate influence of the two earliest professors of the institution , Dr. Alexander , who has been already mentioned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his life shows that the interest of Di- . Alexander in Mr. lodge was constantly increasing . Before the end of his Seminary course he seems to have been selected by both of the Professors as one who might well fill a chair in the school . The chair to which he was called a year after finishing his studies appears , however , to have been first offered to his college associate and life-long friend , John Johns , who afterwards became the Bishop of Virginia . As Mr. Johns decided that the call of duty for him was to enter the ministry of the Episcopal Church , he declined the offer . Mr. lodge was then immediately determined upon as the man for the place . The Professors presented a memorial to the Board of Directors , representing the need of an additional instructor , to whom should be assigned the teaching of the Hebi'ew and Greek of the Scriptures . The memorial was , in due course , // refer red to the General Assemby , and , after deliberation , that body passed a vote , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teacher for a year ; providing , however , that his salary should not exceed four hundred dollars . Mr. lodge was immediately employed , and his life 's work was thus begun . It was , indeed , a day of small things at Princeton . The Directors , at their first consideration of the proposal , felt that the funds at their command would not allow the two Professors the aid which they asked for . The further reflection upon the matter which was solicited from the great representative Assembly of the Church , led them only to take action for a single year , and to allow the outlay of a sum of money which now seems quite insignificant . After another year , the wisdom of that body only ventured to continue the appointment indefinitely , on a salary not exceeding the amount already named . And when , in 1822 , consent was given for the founding of a Professorship of Biblical and Oriental Literature , it appears to have been due to the fact that two of the classes in the Seminary had passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after graduation , sums amounting to eleven thousand dollars . When the young man " came into Princeton on horseback to prepace for his work , " as the biography expresses it , in answer to a proposal of this sort , it would seem that he must have already learned the derivation of the Greek word for fadli , which Dr. Atexander had vainly asked him for in his school-days , and not only so , but must also have had the virtue in exercise in its fullness . The new Professor 's experience , however , was not peculiar to Princeton in those days . There are men still in active service in some of our largest colleges and Universities , who could relate most interesting experiences in this regard , from their own personal history . In the more recently established institutions of the West such experiences have been almost universal* but they are not confined to them ; and if the unwritten record of theological schools , or , indeed , of scientific schools , could be made public , it would be found that the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of instruction , have oftentinies been summoned to a pecuniary burden , the bearing of which was essential to the continued life of the institutions . // We remember the impression which was made upon us , some years ago , when we read the record of the vote , by which our own predecessor in office was invited to this place . He was asked to be an instructor in sacred literature , with a salary of one hundred dollars for taking charge of the college library , and with permission to teach the Greek and Hebrew languages to such theological students as might be willing to receive his teachings at their own expense ! And , as for the vote even to which we ourselves responded more than twenty years ago , we should scarcely wish to record it here as a stimulus to young scholars in theology . It was such , we may say , as to carry us back over the times of controversy , and bring us into close sympathy with Dr. Hodge , as he rode into the quiet New Jersey collegiate town , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sympathy , which was so perfect in this regard , between the * ? rinceton professor and the theologians of New Haven had been equally perfect on his part towards them in respect to doctrinal views , he would have been relieved of many opinions which he stoutly defended . But the difficulty here may have been that he was riding , that afternoon , into the New Jersey village , and entering into a permanent association with Dr. Alexander , instead of coming into the clearer and more stimulating atmosphere of New England . Two months after his election as Professor , Mr. Hodge was married , on the 17th of June , 1822 , to Miss Sarah Bache , of Philadelphia . They immediately took up their abode in Prince . ton , and , within the following year , established themselves in their own house . The new professor seems , at first , to have been perplexed with the question , as to how he could carry on his studies and perpetual conversation with his young wife at the same time . But the difficulty resolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , by the exercise of a little common sense on both sides ; and the good doctor learned that most desirable lesson for students , to work in the midst of interrup. tions . We have no doubt that he found his wife 's presence , and what she said , quite as helpful to him as his books , and that his children , whom he afterwards allowed to run in and out of his room with all freedom , kept him in the enjoyment // and cheerfulness which otherwise he might not have known . At all events , he gained in the affection of his household what the volumes of his library , if he had been left to them alone , could never have bestowed . His wife died in 1849 , after twenty-seven years of happy union with him . Two years and a half afterwards his second marriage , to Mrs. Mary Hunter Stockton , took place . Mr. lodge devoted himself earnestly to the duties of his office from his first entrance upon it . It is interesting to notice what was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began in 1820 . The means at command for the study of Hebrew and Greek may be inferred from the fact that , as he says in one of his letters , he had no dictionary of the latter language except Schrevelius , and Dr. Alexander was only able in reply to recommend that of Schleusner . He struggled with the languages to the best of his ability , " feeling much difficulty in Greek , as almost all the students had been studying it for years , and some of them had taught it , but in Hebrew having more advantage of them . " For the purpose of studying the Hebrew as written with points , which was altogether unknown at Princeton in his seminary course , he repaired to Philadelphia for several months . He there had the opportunity to gain enthusiasm from a well-known and eminent teacher of the time . With lexicons and text-books , however , mostly or wholly in Latin , and with none of the valuable results of recent German scholarship , which were as yet things of the future , in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his department . It was creditable to him that he early saw the importance , and even the necessity , of securing greater advantages of preparation for his professorial duty than were afforded in this country . To take a course of study in Europe was , then , no small matter . In his case it involved a separation from his young family , and the sacrifice of a considerable part of his salary , in addition to the ordinary difficulties by which foreign travel were accompanied . His older colleagues , however , were wise enough to appreciate the desirableness , both for himself and the Seminary , of the step proposed , and , by the consent of ' the Board of Directors , he was enabled to accomplish his desire . His time abroad , after a few months in // Paris , was mainly spent in ilalle and Berlin . At the former place , he came under the instruction of Gesenius and others who were then the leading scholars in his own department . With Tholuck , who was at that time only about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly valued friendship . Neander was in the vigor of his powers at Berlin . B6ckh and Hengstenberg were also among his teachers , and many men of note , who have now passed away , were in active life , ready to give him their inspiring influence and high regard . In Germany , as always through life , he attached himself very closely to those into whose society he was thrown . The circle of his friends included , especially , the men who had broken away from the rationalism of the times and those who cultivated a piety more nearly resembling his own . From these he gained much strength in his Christian , as well as his intellectual , life . Especially from Tholuck , to whom many of our coun trymen were largely indebted even to his latest years , he received influences for good , the remembrance of which was long cherished . Two years of foreign life passed quickly away , and with many acquirements and much joy he returned to his home . Here he found his work opening to him more widely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ardor of a young scholar , and began a career which was to be one of great eminence and usefulness . The story of the life of a Professor involves , ordinarily , little of incident , and little to interest the common reader . Full of work , of enjoyment , of acquisitions for one 's self and of influence for those who come as pupils within its sphere , it moves on quietly and almost unnoticed by the world . For the fifty years which followed his return from Europe , this life in the case of Dr. lodge was , in its measure , what it is to other men . The successive classes of students came and went . They brought their own questions and their individuality to stimulate his thought . They offered the enthusiasm of their youth to be inspired and guided by his teaching . They gave him their affection and regard , and , as he advanced in life towards old age , their reverence . They very largely accepted his interpretations // of Scripture and his views of truth . There was much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In 1840 , or about eleven years after the close of his residence abroad , he was transferred to the chair of Doctrinal Theology , thus sharing the work of Dr. Alexander , to whom , as already stated , he became successor after the death of the latter . These eleven years constitute the portion of his life in which he was most fully given to the department of Biblical Literature . By the arrangement of studies , however , which existed at Princeton so long as he lived , the exegetical instruction in the Pauline Epistles seems always to have fallen to him . It is quite evident , even to his most sincere admirers , we suppose , and is acknowledged by his son , who writes his memoirs , that his mind was better adapted for doctrinal discussion than for the work of scholarly interpretation . But Princeton theology , so far as it looks to exegesis for its defense , would certainly lose its main strength , were his commentaries to be destroyed . He accordingly rendered most important service to his friends by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during those years previous to 1840 . The chief glory of his life , however , was gained after this date . From this time , he may be said to have moved forward steadily towards that leading position , not only in the Seminary , but in the Old School branch of the Presbyterian Church , which , after the decease of Drs . Alexander and Miller , his older colleagues ; he held even to the end . He had now come to the prime of life and the fullness of his powers . He was working in a field for which the peculiar faculties of his mind , as welt as his disposition , fitted him . People on all sides , in the wide section of country of which Princeton was the theological center , looked to him as the great defender of the faith . The watchtowers everywhere were coming to be manned by those whom he had trained to guard , and contend for , what he and they believed to be " the truth once delivered to the saints . " The announcementsof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted , more and more as yeal-s passed on , as coming from a fountain of wisdom . // But Dr. Ilodge was not merely a professor , limiting his life . and work within the circle of the Seminary students . He was a constant and vigorous writer for the press ; an author of widely used and highly valued volumes both in the department of Exegesis and in that of Systematic Theology ; a very prominent participator in the legislative assemblies of the Church and a controversialist surpassing in ability any contemporary of his own party . He thus had relations on every side to the public . He was known not only in the retirement of the scholar , but in the active life of the religious world . As in the case of many men of eminence , the reader of the biography is astonished at the amount of work which he accomplished . Even before his visit to Europe , and while he was under the pressure of studies in the earliest years of his professorship , he founded the Biblical Repertory , and took upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at first intended to be a " Collection of Tracts in Biblical Literature , " and for some time made up of translations and reprints of articles from foreign journals , became afterwards , as we all know , the fortress of Princeton Theology and of Princeton opinion on all great questions of Church and State . Dr. lodge was a constant writer for its pages , and certainly the articles of no contributor were marked by greater force or commanded more attention . More than one hundred articles are mentioned by the biographer , of which he was the authoi- . Probably , in the course of the forty-three years of his editorship , the actual number amounted to at least one hundred and fifty . At the period when the Quarterly was established , he was , at times , seriously hindered in his work by physical suffering , and , for some years after his return from Europe , the disease which afflicted him was so severe that he was confined to his house , even for a succession of months being compelled to remain in a reclining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carried on , without interruption , the instruction of his classes and all his literary enterprises . His discussions in the Repertory , afterwaids generally called the Princetor* Review , covered a great variety of topics . We find , among those which his son has enumerated , articles on Public Education , on Slavery , on the Oxford Tracts , on the Latest Forms of Infidelity , on the // Rights of Ruling Elders , on Civil Government , on Presbyterian Liturgies , on Inspiration , on Sunday Mails , on the question , What is Christianity ? and many others extending over a wide circle of thought , in addition to the very numerous ones , of a controversial character , in opposition to those within and , especially , without his own church , whose opinions on different subjects were contrary to his own . The two most important crises which have ever occurred in the Presbyterian Church in the United States , are the Disruption and the Reunion . Separated as these two great events were by the lifetime of a whole generation , Dr. lodge took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brethren at Princeton , he was , in both cases , of the party opposing the result which was finally secured . This has sometimes appeared to be a singular phenomenon , at least to those who were not fully acquainted with the history in all its minuteness . But it may be doubted whether there was not more consistency on the part of these gentlemen than has been supposed . It is worthy of notice , that the Reunion was brought about , very largely , by the efforts and influence of individual men who had gone out from New England ; whose education had been in its schools , and whose views , notwithstanding their entrance into the Presbyterian body , were still affected by the theological atmosphere in which they had previously lived . It was the result , also , in no small measure , of the fact that the principles and freedom of thought which have characterized New England had , in the course of years , quietly worked their way into the minds of great numbers of the younger ministry in both branches of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had appeared to the view of the Princeton theologians to be the worst this side of Unitarianism , had indeed , as they hoped , almost ceased to exist as the characteristic of any formidable party . But men of as clear insight as Dr. lodge , and men who had been as long engaged in the conflict as he had been , could not fail to see that the influence of these so-called heresies had become a part of the thinking of many even among their own professed followers ,  --  certainly of very many among the New School party . Men could not be // bound to Turretin , and the views which Dr. Alexander defended , as easily in 1867 as they were in 1837 . If the New School section of the Church were to be received again into full fellowship , might not the Old School section be infected by contact with them ,  --  - might it not be more difficult to keep the Old School section free from all admixture of evil ? The circumstances were changed in the passing away of thirty years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the course of the Princeton gentlemen in the crisis of 1837-8 , written years afterwards , Dr. Hodge states the position which they held . They believed that the " ministers and people who maintained the extreme type of error *4yled Taylornsrn " were " the cause of all the trouble . " Numbem-s of these , by reason of the Plan of Union , as it was called , had come into connection with the Presbyterian Church . The theologians at Princeton were as heartily opposed to them as any one could be . They fought their opinions then , and for forty years after that time . They proclaimed those opinions , on every possible occasion , in season and out of season , to be extreme heresy . If the New School party in 1837 had been all of this class , they would have been foremost advocates of disruption . But they did not regard New School men , as a body , as adopting Taylorism . They considered them , according to Dr. lodge 's own language , as " sound Presbyterians , although somewhat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this condition of mind , Dr. Hodge and his associates thought might be tolerated within the limits of orthodoxy . They would not therefore forcibly exclude this party , or rend the Church in order to be free of them . They would rather continue in fellowship with them , and use reasoning and persuasion only to bring them to a clearer vision of the truth . As for the " Plan of Union , " which was the indirect cause of the evils , they desim-ed that it might be abrogated ; as for " Taylorisrn , " which was the direct cause , they were ready to have all ministers holding and teaching it tried and excluded from office ; as for churches which had come into the Presbyterian communion with a New England influence of this sort , they insisted upon their reorganization upon another basis , or upon their excision by ecclesiastical authority ; as for that terrible // apparition so formidable always to the party of the by-gone ages , called " new measures , " they were as earnest as any one that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were prepared to join heart and hand with the extreme Old School men . They differed from the extremists only with regard to their attitude towards New School churches and ministers who were not Taylorites . Their course , as we look back upon it , seems to have been a politic one . At that time the union of the church might have been preserved , with only the excision of the so-called errorists , and gradually the influence of the Old School party might have gained upon the New School section . But , in 1867 , all was different . Dr. Taylor had died , indeed , and the Taylorite party might be thought to have died with him . But , though dead , the effect of his teaching and the influence of his thought were still a living power . Through the silent workings of great ideas , he was yet speaking to hundreds of minds in all sections of the church ; and to the New School party an advance movement had been given , which , as Dr. Hodge plainly perceived , made it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day had passed away , as we have already intimated , when the union could be attended by the overpowering influence of Old School views . The New School body had been too long in a freer atmosphere for this to be possible . If reunited now , the advancing party must , sooner or later , gain the victory ; or , to say the least , there could not but be great danger that they might gain it . The only course of safety , as well as of wisdom , for the Princeton gentlemen , was now to oppose a reunion of the two branches of the Church , as they had , years before , opposed the severing of the two branches . They moved onward in a straight line . The condition of things around them changed , and to the one who looked on from the midst of changing circumstances they seemed to be going backwards where they had gone forwards ; that was all . In the controversies in his own branch of the Presbyterian Church , which arose from time to time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he did in the case // of the Disruption question in 1837 . He was united in denominational and theological bonds with many men who believed only in the past ; men who scented danger in every new thought , and trembled for the ark of God as they heard even the faintest whisper of a deviation from their own opinions . They were mel ) , also , who pressed their ecciesiasticism to the utmost limits , and were ready to fulminate anathemas against all who did not altogether sympathize with themselves . It is certainly honorable to him , that he often ventured to oppose these men . He had the courage to contend against them , both in his writings and in the discussions in the General Assembly . Oftentimes , he was successful in securing the ends for which he labored . When he was unsuccessful , he still pressed for what he thought wisdom and right demanded , in all lawful ways . As we read his biography , we are struck with the liberality of his views on many of these subjects , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his church . Notwithstanding his inheritance of Scotch-Irish Presbyterianism , his education under Dr. Archibald Alexander , his thorough identification with the Old School Church , his controversies with opponents of the limited division of Calvinists to which he belonged , and his inborn and inbred fear of the spirit of progress in theology , he had a freedom of thought which was utterly unknown to such men as Dr. Thornwell and Dr. Robert J. Breckenridge . He was free , also , from their domineering and overbearing spirit . He was , therefore , on the freer side , oftentimes , in great questions of church action , where they , of course and by the force of their very nature and habits , took the narrowest views . If Dr. lodge had been born in New England , and had not looked back upon an unbroken line of Presbyterian ancestors , and had never known the influences which governed all his education , we do not presume to say what he might have been . But the story of his life impresses us with the conviction , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair consideration of New England views , as the minds of some of his contemporaries could not have done under any circumstances . He had a larger nature than theirs , and within the limited sphere which the Old School system permitted , he made the fact manifest . He was fettered by his // surroundings . He would have been a freer man had he been surrounded by a freer air . This , at least , is the view of him which his son 's memoir gives to us ; and we are glad to have this picture of him before those who knew him , mainly or wholly , in the region of theological controversy . Our space forbids us to discuss the questions which divided parties in the Old School Church ; and many of them , indeed , are now matters which have only an historical interest . But , as illustrating in some measure what has been said , we find Dr. Hodge stoutly contending against the immense majority of the General Assembly , who , in 1845 , voted that baptism administered by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also vigorously opposed ,  --  as vigorously as any New England Congregationalist could have done ,  --  the proposition of Dr. Breckenridge , in 1858 , to prepare a Chitrch Commentary on the whole Bible , under the direction of successive General Assemblies , which should accord with " the faith of the Word of God as briefly set forth in the standard of the Westminster be opposing this Assembly . " It is refreshing to see Dr llodo absurd and tyrannical scheme , and arguing " that it was unprecedented , and would be destructive of all liberty for any church to provide an authoritative explanation of all the Scriptures in detail . " " We could not hold together a week , " he says , " if we made the adoption of all its professions , * . e. , of the Westminster Confession , a condition of ministerial communion. ** Who can tell us the Church 's sense of the confession , *7 he adds ; " it is notorious that as to that point we are not agreed . " This , it will be remembered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , consequently , was while the Old School body were in the enjoyment of their orthodoxy unmingled and unimpaired . A consideration of these words , we may be permitted to suggest in passing , may well be commended to those prominent gentlemen in the Congregational Churches , who have recently been disposed to insist upon exact conformity , on the part of their brethren , in all minute points with the " historic faith of the fathers . " We find Dr. lodge , also , declaring his belief , that the total neglect of liturgies by the Presbyterian Church is a mistake , and that a liturgical book for many of the church services , if its use should be made optional and not // obligatory , " would answer a most important end . " And , in one of the greatest oratorical efforts of his life , he combated the views of Dr. Thornwell , who claimed that all the details of church government and church action are prescribed in the Word of God , and that " everything for which we can not produce a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " therefore , that the Church Boards as then organized were not to be allowed any longer existence . We wish that the noble words of his reply to this doctrine , as advocated by the Southern divine , might be written in every Congregational hall of Assembly and in every Congregational minister 's study . " This theory , " he says , " is in plain English nothing more than a device for clothing human opinions with divine authority ; the theory , that the law of God was made to forbid not only what it says , but what may be inferred from it . We grant that what a man infers from the word of God binds his own conscience . But the trouble is that he insists that it shall bind mine also . We beg to be excused . One man infers one thing , another a different thing from the Bible . The same man infers one thing to-day , and another thing to-morrow . Must the Church bow her neck to all these burdens ? She would soon be more trammeled than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church of old was measurably restricted by fetters which God himself imposed ; the plan now is to bind with fetters which human logic forges . This she will never submit to . ' The ringing voice of IDr . Taylor himself never protested against the doctrine here rejected in bolder and loftier tones than these . The pupils of Dr Taylor never learned the lesson that they had a right to draw their own inferences from the Word of God , without submitting to any human authority whatsoever , more clearly and fully than the General Assembly of Old School Presbyterianism was taught it . on this occasion , by Dr. lodge . And , however widely men who have breathed the free air of Congregationalism may differ from the theological views of either of these two eminent divines , those of them who have imbibed anything of a spirit similar to theirs will not mind the declarations , or the denunciations , if so it be , of any who would attempt to impose upon them their own inferences and opinions as the only " Thus saith the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subject of slavery , and the late Civil War , illustrate the advanced opinions which he held beyond many others in his Church . They were such as to call forth severe condemnation from excited partisans at the South . He was a thQrough supporter of the Union cause and the Government . By his pen and voice he did much to influence those who looked to him as a leader . We can not but feel , however , that he did not fully comprehend the whole question of slavery , and the impossibility of any compromise with the slave power , as some men in New England did . The place of his residence and the associations of his church were unfavorable to that sort of comprehension . He rose to the higher limits of opinion among the company with whom his lot was cast . If he did not rise to the highest limits possible , it may easily have been due to causes without rather than within himself ; causes over which he had little or no control . It is curious to read some of Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feelings changed from time to time , and how he had opinions in the earlier years of the struggle , which worthy men elsewhere held , but which he regretted afterwards as truly as they did . In common with great numbers of our northern people , he supposed , in 1862 , that McClellan was a great general , and that Stanton was incompetent for his office ; that the removal of the former from the chief command of the army was an injustice and an error , and that the latter gentleman , together with Lincoln himself , by " mismanagement had got everything into confusion . " He even seems to have doubted the wisdom and propriety of Lincoln 's first proclamation respecting emancipation , which made this an indispensable condition of peace . How strange all these things seem in the light of the present ,  - -  none of them more strange than the belief in the generalship of McClellan ! But it was only the few , who had appreciated the magnitude of the struggle from the beginning , who rose above these erroneous views , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North were slow to accept the Emancipation proclamation . Thousands , for years , regarded McClellan as the military man of the age , and thousands more would have continued to do so , except for the influence of his crushing defeat in the Presidential election of 1864 . At this time , Dr. // lodge , though retaining his high opinion of his merits , refused to vote for him , because he had come to see the wisdom of Lincoln , and because he feared the results of the accession to power of the Democratic party , which , ashe says , " has brought all these troubles and sorrows upon us . " When the war ended , he had learned to appreciate Lincoln fully , and to honor him as the hope and strength of the nation . His words , as he heard of the assassination , were : " My poor , poor country , what will become of thee ! " But we can not linger further upon the great questions and crises in which Dr. lodge bore a part . Suffice it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of the church , and was an active participator , both in his Review and on the platform , in every important movement . For more than forty years his words were weighty and powerful . They were listened to with great respect . It fell to his lot-as to very few others in the history of our country  --  to continue in his professorship for more than half a century . An interesting chapter of the Biography is filled with an account of his Semi-centennial anniversary . It must have been an occasion of great joy to him , as he saw hundreds of his old pupils returning to offer him the tribute of their affection and respect . More than twenty-five hundred students had been under his instruction . The institution had grown from its small beginnings when he entered it as a pupil , to a strong , vigorous , widely-known and noted Seminary , with abundant endowments and a secure future . His own life had been one of distinguished usefulness and of honorable fame . The joys of his home had been peaceful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seventy-four , he could look backward and forward with gratitude and hope . He was still in the full discharge of his duties and in the vigor of a ripe old age . We do not wonder that he speaks of the day as " the apex of his life . " The description of the calm progress of the closing years is told so affectionately and pleasantly by his son , that we cite a portion of it from one of the closing chapters . // " There is always something essentially pathetic even in the brightest and balmiest late autumnal day . To the eye of faith it is the season which prepares , after the interval of a short sleep in winter , for a new and more glorious spring . But to the eye of sense , it is , nevertheless , the end of the year . So was it with the autumn of his life . Though he was generally well , he was weak , and often very weary . Though he was beautiful , it was the wasting beauty of the fading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of his own mind . Though he reclined with an unwavering confidence upon a supernatural hope , his spirit and life were eminently natural . Though he had no fear , yet he had no desire to die . He looked beyond the world rather than rose entirely above it . His interest in all human things was genuine and strong , and his cheerfulness was never failing , yet often tinged with a pathetic 7istfulness , arising from an habit . nal sense of the imminence of his own departure . He delighted more and more in reminiscences of past events and persons . The friends of his early years were all gone , but their memory was very precious . The improvements which , during those last years were so extensively made in the buildings of the college and seminary , interested him exceedingly , and he was glad that he was privileged to see them before the final closing of his eyes on all earthly scenes . But his great delight was in his grandchildren . Two families of them lived in the same village with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arms of his great chair as his own children had done a generation earlier . All their smart sayings were reported to him , and repeated by him with the greatest zest . He knew and maintained all of their respective points of excellence and superiority with the zeal of a partisan . He was always on the alert in providing presents for them on all their anniversaries of birthdays and Christmas , and in selecting and despatching appropriate St. Valentines with a gleeful delight equal and like to that of the young recipients themselves . His love was faithfully returned by them all , and none , except the youngest , will ever forget the frequent and delightful occasions when all the resident family gathered with loving reverence around grandfather 's chair . Before he died he was for some years the oldest survivor of his entire family clan . Children and grandchildren , nephews , grand-nephews and cousins in various degrees looked up to him with affection and pride , and constantly cheered his last days by their visits , and testimonials of sympathy and reverence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dr. lodge died at the age of eighty . He had continued his full work nearly to the end , and , as he laid it aside , he had the satisfaction of seeing his eldest son chosen as his successor , as some years before he had seen a younger son appointed to the chair of New Testament Exegesis , which he had himself held in early life . The Seminary was passing to the care of another generation of his own family , and the theological system , which he had so long defended , was secure from change for the next succeeding years . His was , certainly , a long and happy life . // Of Dr. lodge as a controversialist , so far forth as he was related to those who opposed his doctrinal system , we do not propose to speak at length . The old battles are over , and it would be undesirable to renew them , if indeed it were possible . It is even undesirable to recall the remembrance of them . The biographer has wisely , as we think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with but brief allusions . His reference to those which were carried on with Dr. Taylor and his associates is limited almost entirely to a short footnote to a page on which an allusion is made to Dr. lodge 's first interview with that eminent New England Theologian . This note simply states , that " the polemic guns of the Prince . Ion Review were trained against Taylorism for forty years . " The results of these forty years of controversy are known , or can be judged of , by the world . If we may be permitted to express our own opinion on the subject , it is this : that the Princeton views gained no foothold whatever in New England , among those who were directly or indirectly within the region of Dr. Taylor 's influence , but that , on the other hand , the freedom of thought for which Dr. Taylor contended as the great end of his efforts , and the force of the opinions which he held , worked their way silently and indirectly , where his doctrines were not directly received , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is no longer what it was fifty years ago . But we are not disposed to fight over the old conflict which ended long since , nor do we wish to begin a new one as to the question which of the two leaders has , through his part in the conflict , most deeply affected the modes of thinking in theology to-day . We are not the heirs of Dr. Taylor 's opinions , or responsible for them . The late Dr. Popkin , of Massachusetts , is said to have replied to a lady , who inquired whether he was a Iopkinsian , " No , madam , I am not a llopkinsian , but a Popkinsian . " We are " Popkin. sians , " in this regard . Dr. Taylor taught his pupils and , so far as he had the power , he taught the world , also , that theologians have a right to do their own thinking and to call no man master . Most of his pupils learned this lesson . We think he started influences , which have greatly helped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of the Pres // byterian Church . If the successors and associates of IDr . Hodge do not agree with us as to this last point , we have no desire to disturb their minds by discussion . The " Popkinsian , " if we may use the term , does not thirst for controversy or enter upon it , unless some vital issue or some necessity calls for it imperatively . But , whatever may be true of Dr. Taylor 's influence in New Jersey , we think there can be little doubt as to the amount of effective impression produced by Dr. Hodge 's distinctive views in New England . We trust that what we are about to say may not lead the author of the biography either to feel that his volume was written to little purpose , in case it could produce such an impression on the mind of any reader , or to pity the want of clear apprehension which should render such a statement possible after perusing its pages . But we must confess , that , after our examination of the story of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we can not help feeling that , under the influence of another inheritence and education , he might have seen the truth as his opponents did . His nature , as we have already seen , was not fitted to the complete bondage , which others in the Old School Church loved . They might never have thought freely , even if the atmosphere which they breathed had been free . But he , if the opportunity had been given , might have been a free man . He had not , however , the courageous and bold spirit , in this respect , which Dr. Taylor and other New England leaders had . He could not have brought himself to break through the bounds of the system in which he was trained , and to form a new school in theology . He was , therefore , content to receive what had been handed down to him , and to defend it , with all his power , against every adversary . The dominion of Turretin and Dr. Alexander , as we have already intimated , controlled his mind to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review of his life , taking great satisfaction in the thought that he had never moved beyond the past . On two important occasions , one of them his Semi-centennial anniversary , when he was speaking to the great assembly of his pupils gathered from all quarters in his honor , he solemnly declared that no new idea ever originated in Princeton Seminary . It is scarcely possible // to conceive of a man with a genuine New England education rejoicing and grateful that , after spending fifty years in theological thought , he had never given lodgment in his doctrinal system to a single new idea . But here was this aged professor glorying in this statement before his admiring students , and not only before them but before the representatives of schools of learning of every name and every portion of the country . Wherever the truth was in the great conflict between the two , Dr. Hodge was , certainly , no bold explorer , no courageous advocate of new truth , no leader for the advancing Christian thought of the ages , like Dr. Taylor . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Apostle Paul ; and , for this reason , it may be , he failed to understand the great apostle in some of his teachings . It is doubtful whether any education or surrounding circumstances could have inspired him with this heroic boldness . But , had he lived in other regions and under less restraining influences , there is reason to believe that he might have moved beyond the limits of the system of which he is still , in his writings , so distinguished an advocate . There are two passages given in the Biography , which serve to illustrate the influences to which Dr. lodge was subjected , and which we may lay before our readers as accounting for what we have just said respecting him . One of them is in his own notes concerning his family and early life . He had a great-uncle , the brother of his paternal grandmother , whose name was Hugh M'Culloch . This worthy gentleman , the notes inform us , " was remarkable for the tenacity with which he held to his own opinions . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moves ; maintaining that it was contrary alike to his own observation and to Bible authority , as Joshua commanded not the earth , but the sun to stand still . " Dr. lodge adds : " His character is said to have been imbibed by our family . " The good doctor was not peculiar in having such an uncle . We ourselves have seen some " Uncle M'Cullochs , " within the circle of our own limited observation , whose " tenacity " was not the lca*t marked of their characteristics . We have also sometimes traced the quality as it seemed to have passed downward to nephews and gi-and-nephews* But the grand-nephews in New England have not had the power to // stand by the inheritance of antiquated opinions , as fully as they have in some of the less breezy regions of the country . They have usually been fearless enough to abandon all ideas of their predecessors , which have been found to rest on no more probable basis than the one , that the earth does not move , because they have never seen it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop moving . Dr. Hodge , evidently , did not accept his uncle 's view on this subject , but we notice , in his uncle , one of the influences which descended to him from the line of his Presbyterian ancestry ; and he lived where the past was all important . The other passage is found near the end of the volume , as the one just mentioned is near the beginning . In the course of his remarks at the Semi-Centennial , he said : " There recently resided in this village a venerable lady , as distinguished for her strength of character as for her piety . A sceptical friend once said to her , My dear madam , it is impossible that a woman of your sense can believe the story about the whale swallowing Jonah . ' She replied with emphasis : Judge , if the Bible said that Jonah swallowed the whale , I would believe it . " ' " I am not authorized to affirm , " Dr. lodge added , " that Dr. Alexander would say the same thing . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dr. Alexander is that under which Dr. lodge was introduced to theological opinion , and under which he continued , in a remarkable degree , thi-ough his whole career . With " Uncle M'Culloch 's " belief , " that the world does not move , " to start him in life 's pathway , and Dr. Alexander 's near approach to a readiness to believe , " that Jonah swallowed the whale , " to lead him along that pathway for thirty years or more , it is not surprising that , with all his greatness and goodness , Dr. lodge had not the peculiar courage for the acceptance of new truths , which has characterized some of the world 's heroes ,  --  for example , two whom we have already referred to-Martin Luther and St. Paul . The two great works of Dr. lodge , which he gave to the press , are his Systematic Theology , and his Commentary on the IRomans . They both show his ability as a thinker , and the peculiar character of his mind as affected by the circumstances // of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scholar or an exegete . He approached the work of an exegete from the prepossessions of doctrinal theology , - perhaps , unconsciously to himself . Probably he never freed himself from the undue influence which do*trinal theology had , as compared with exegetical study , when he was young . For these reasons , his commentaries can hardly have , hereafter , any very high reputation as exhibiting linguistic power . They will be resorted to , however , by those who would know the peculiarities of Princeton Theology , as will also his great doctrinal work . His style is so clear , and his power of setting forth his views and the arguments for them so great , that none can read his volumes without knowing fully what he held and why he held it . His works thus , will live for years-perhaps , for generations . In referring to his college course , Dr. Hodge speaks of one of the professors , Dr. Philip Lindsley , who afterwards became the president of two or three colleges at the West , as being the instructor of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an enthusiast in his department , and a lover of paradox ; and as he was extremely popular with the students , many of his sayings were naturally remembered . One of these is recorded in the following sentence : " He told our class that we would find that one of the best preparations for death was a thorough knowledge of the Greek grammar . " After examining certain portions of the Commentary on the Epistle to the Romans carefully and repeatedly , we trust we may be permitted , without offense , to say , that ,  --  however much this remark of the eccentric professor may have influenced other members of the class ,  - -  we are led to doubt whether its effect upon Dr. lodge could have been such as to induce him to give his whole mind to this particular preparation . It occurs to us , that he may , perhaps not unnaturally , have been unable to persuade himself of any direct and vital connection between the Greek language and a fitness for the life in which , as it has been held , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been , the remark was worthy of being recorded . // We end our Review here . Of Dr. Hodge 's methods as a teacher , those who read his Systematic Theology will gain some idea . Of his peculiar power in his religious addresses to the Seminary students , the Biography gives testimony , but no one , probably , who knows him only by the record here given , can appreciate fully what it was . Of the service which he rendered to his own Church , those who have watched the progress of its history for the past fifty years are best qualified to judge . These pages , however , will present to our readers enough , perchance , to make them disposed to read the volume of Memoirs for themselves . The story of the life is fitted to give all who thus read it a high idea of Dr. Hodge 's work , his ability , his kindliness of nature , his earnest Christian character , his honorable way of living . It is told by his son and successor at Princeton , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allusion to the old warfare , and much to that which was better and more beautiful . It is with the thought of the latter , and not of the former , that we have written .
