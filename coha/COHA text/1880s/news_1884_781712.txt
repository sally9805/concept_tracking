txt There is something saddening in the fate that has finally overtaken Mr. CHARLES DELMONICO , a man who , in his life-time , has ministered to the pleasure and has catered to the luxurious tastes of so many people . There is scarcely a corner of the Republic so remote or so ignorant of what is happening in the great and busy world as not to have some acquaintance with the name and the fame of the DELMONICO family . In obscure mining camps and in rude railway settlements in the far West one may see the name of this famed family of caterers and epicures emblazoned on the sign-boards of ambitious pretenders . There are in New-York many places where the bon , vivant , the epicure , and the man of fashion may find refreshment , good living , and social recognition of a certain sort . But it must be admitted that " Delmonico 's " has for years stood for all that is the best in culinary art , fashion , and wide popularity . CHARLES DELMONICO was the last male representative of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man of affairs , a fast friend , a liberal giver , and , above all , a discreet and sagacious convivial companion . His disappearance was a cause of mortification to many . His untimely , sorrowful , and unattended death is a pitiful ending to a life passed in brightness and good cheer . Mr. DELMONICO , naturally a strong , selfcontained , and resolute man , lost his mind in consequence of being burdened with many cares and much business and subjected to the daily din ? and worry of the large establishments which he managed . The mental strain was too great for him , and he gradually exhibited to those who knew him best a decay of mental power that should have been more alarming than it evidently was . . In this case the darkest fears have been realized , and the genial , companionable and generous host - of One of the most celebrated pleasure-haunted establishments in the world is found frozen stiff and stark by a country highway . The sharpness of the contrast of this man 's living and his dying needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those who knew Mr. DELMONICO , as well as those who knew of him , have already pointed the obvious moral of his doleful history . But we have now no , concern with any moral . It should , however , be " borne in upon " all those whose sorrowful experiences bring them into contact with persons of unsound mind that unceasing vigilance , even at the cost of the good-will and esteem of the infirm one , must be maintained . ' 1 Mr. DELMON- , ico resented any attempt to restrain him of his liberty . - But if he could have been kept under restraint . he would be alive to-day . It is easy to be wise after the event . But it is , nevertheless , lamentable that one of the best-known men in this great metropolis , who has ministered to the luxury and comfort of innumerablepeople , should have been left to perish miserably and alone in a wintry wilderness . This is the extreme of the irony of fate .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
