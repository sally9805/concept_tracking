txt Consternation fell upon travelers and tourists bound to California when , a few days ago , it was reported that a company of bandits had " raided " a train on the Central Pacific Railroad . The thieves , it was well known , had been engaged in many robberies in Utah , Idaho , and Nevada . They had finally swooped down upon a railroad train , and although held at bay by a daring and gallant express messenger , had carried dismay along the single line of rails over which the Central Pacific Railroad does its enormous business . Finally , Sheriff TURNER , of Provo City , Utah , accompanied by a picked company of detectives from Utah and Nevada , organized an expedition for the discovery of the stronghold of these robber barons of the frontier . The Sheriff 's party was reinforced , from time to time , and the fort or stockade of the bandits was finally found in the heart of the Antelope Mountains , a range of arid and rocky hills well remembered by every old Californian who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fort were two bandits who had probably been off on a reconnoitring scout . These the captain of the attacking party ordered to halt and throw up their hands , There was some demur , whereupon the Sheriff 's party opened fire , and after a brisk interchange of volleys , both brigands were severely wounded  --  one through the shoulder and the other through the leg . The wounded men were picked up by the attacking party , who retreated and went into camp two miles from the battle-field . On the following day , reinforced by another Sheriff and posse , the entire column moved against the robbers ' stockade . According to the rules of civilized warfare , a note demanding an unconditional surrender was sent to the intrenched party . The fort , or stockade , was admirably provided against assault , being surrounded by a stone wall pierced with loopholes for tiring purposes . But the besiegers were armed with giant-powder cartridges , which , being used as hand-grenades , would have battered down the strongest robber castle ever built . Accordingly , the brigands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several having been wounded during the preliminary parley . This puts an end to the organized barbarism that has so long defied the advance of civilization represented by the railway train and the star route postal service . The brigands , or such of them as are left alive , are under lock and key , and their stone fort in the Antelope Mountains is abandoned to the bats and owls , or , rather , let us say , to the horned toad and the skulking coyote . It seems that , after all , our boasted civilization lies only a short distance from the cruelty and lawlessness of the Middle Ages . The robber barons of olden times intrenched themselves amid mountain fastnesses , and when they beheld from their armed camps a company of merchants " slow pricking o'er the plain , " they swept down upon them , despoiling all and killing only those who made resistance . With all our vaunted progress , we have not got very far beyond the robber barons of medieval ages . The continent is not yet so densely Populated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their mountain strongholds and sweep down upon the peaceful and unsuspecting railway travelers who come and go . Haply , the cheerful optimist who lies back in his richly furnished palace car , careering through the desert wastes of Utah , and who fancies that the age of barbarism is passed because he is well fed , warmed , and carried on the wings of steam , may have a rude awakening . The track is torn up . The treasure car is looted , and armed brigands demand his money or his life . After all , DICK TURPIN and his gang may reappear at any time . Their dress and armament may have been changed . Their methods are the same on the Central Pacific as on Hounslow Heath . These robber barons plunder only the passing traveler . They take from him his gold , his valuables , and his unused revolver , and let him go his way , thankful that he has not been so indiscreet as to resist . Other robbers take the railroads . FRANK HAWLEY and RAS ANDERSON , with pistols and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " shell out " their cash and portables of value . The other robber barons train the courts and Receiverships upon the railway property , and so rob defenseless stockholders . What with corrupt Judges , venal law officers , and ingenious thimblerigging , the eminently respectable brigands who would faint at the smell of gunpowder accomplish even more than the rude brigands who , when they have looted a train-load of passengers and have shot an express messenger or two , have nothing more that they can do . In his Wall-street stockade , the biggest robber of them all may sit securely , like a spider in his web , boasting of his plunder and exhibiting to wonder-stricken visitors the contents of his strong boxes . He defies Sheriffs and Sheriffs ' posses . The protecting arm of the law is around him , and not a hair of his wicked head shall be harmed . The day of the robber baron is not over . He robs railroad passengers and railroad stockholders , as of yore . In the wilderness he employs dynamite , crow-bars , revolvers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ injunctions , Receiverships , and the multifarious chicanery of the courts .
