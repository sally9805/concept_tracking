THE popular idea respecting the Mormon people is well illustrated by the remark of a public man of superior intelligence and extensive reading who , when told that there were two sides to the Mormon question , asked , in apparent surprise , " What can they possibly say in defense of themselves and their system ? " In making this reply he but gave expression to the feeling of a very large class of people upon this question . He supposed he was familiar with all the evidence necessary to its proper understanding ; he had formed his judgment upon it , and had not thought there was a side to the case he had heard but little or nothing about . There is probably no subject which has been agitated so much as this , and concerning which less is really known . It is seldom that even among the intelligent and well read one can be found who can give a correct statement of the doctrines of the Latter-Day Saints , or " Mormons , " as they are called ; or who can explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are current respecting their religion , their organization , and their domestic lives are not derived from themselves , but from the writings and utterances of those who oppose them . When people who pride themselves upon the extent and variety of their information express surprise upon learning that the Mormon people believe in and revere the Old and New Testaments as the word of God , look for salvation through Jesus Christ , as the Redeemer of the world , and hold chastity in man as a virtue that should be maintained as rigidly as in woman , and that should be valued and cherished in both sexes as more precious than life itself , what must be the ignorance concerning them in other quarters ? A public man , well acquainted with the people of Utah , recently remarked that he had found himself almost looked upon with doubt , in circles where his veracity // would not be questioned , because he had ventured to say that they were not licentious ; that while they believed in plural marriage as practiced by the patriarchs , they were so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outside of marriage , that if they dared they would punish it with death . The misconceptions which prevail in the country concerning the people of Utah , their belief , and their attitude toward the Government , are principally due to the reports which have come from Utah itself . There are parties in that Territory who have labored incessantly to make the Mormon people odious to mankind . They have described them as offensive to all decency , as outraging all morals , as defying all law , as enemies to all established institutions . By cutting them off in this way from sympathy , they hoped to have them deprived of their political rights . In the paper entitled " The Political Attitude of the * the March number of the NORTH AMERICAN REvIEw , this is avowed as the necessary measure . The author of that paper is the editor of an anti-Mormon newspaper at Salt Lake City , who has recently been employed to ff11 that position , and whose residence in the Territory does not extend beyond a few months . As I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were so disposed , describe his characteristics and domestic relations with the same minuteness that he has mine . The description which he gives of the political attitude of the people of Utah has not for its basis either familiarity with them and their doctrines or a personal acquaintance with those whom he is pleased to call leaders . Aside from the report of an interview , said to have taken place between a traveling correspondent of a newspaper and a bishop ,  --  of the value of which as evidence I need say nothing ,  --  the paper is full of unsustained assertions , and its foundation is the gossip of the persons for whom he writes . It is his boast , I am informed , that he has never read the books of the people whose belief and teachings he attempts to explain . As he has evidently depended upon hearsay and the writings of others as prejudiced as himself for his ideas of the character of the system , so he has also for the characters of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young . He calumniates them without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says : " Universal experience and the thorough study of human nature incontestably prove that a truly superior man never is able to // perform any great work among his fellow-creatures without being himself first profoundly convinced . " Joseph Smith had deadly enemies . He had also devoted friends , who knew and loved him so well that they would have died for him . It was the grandeur of his character which made him so beloved . He had the courage of his convictions , and did all that mortal man could to prove to the world that he knew his teachings to be true-he died for them . That Brigham Young did not have a similar fate was not for the want of disposition on the part of the clique in Utah represented by this writer , but for the want of power . The man who had the courage and genius to Lad an expatriated people through a wilderness , the statesmanship to found a great commonwealth , and the truthfulness and probity to make his word among business men have the value of a bond , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranges himself in the ranks of the persecutors of the Mormon people ; and what persecutors ever painted the portraits of their victims in heavenly colors , or ever held up those whom they crowned with martyrdom as saints ? A romancing account is given of the working out of the details of the new church by Sidney Rigdon . At the time Joseph Smith organized the church in New York , Sidney Rigdon was the esteemed colleague of Alexander Campbell in the church known as Campbdllite or Christian . Seven months after , missionaries sent out by Joseph Smith met him in Ohio ; he became convinced of the truth of their doctrines , and was baptized . The object of the alarming talk about the political influence which is to be wielded by the Mormon people over an extensive region , unless severe measures of repression are speedily adopted , is very clear . Such a feeling has already been aroused at Washington that no person professing the faith of the majority of the people of Utah has been permitted for years to hold a federal office of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enact special legislation that would exclude them from all the local offices . The Territory and all its interests , the handling of its finances , and the management of its municipal , county , and territorial affairs are to be wrested from the control of the majority of the people . That they have retained the right to elect the delegate to Congress has been the cause of a large amount of unconcealed anger , and of no end of slander . Congress has been accused of setting a bad moral // example , because the delegate has not been unseated ; and toy bring home to it the necessity of thus vindicating itself , the story was fabricated that by his election Brigham Young had said he would thrust polygamy down its throat . As Brigham Young had been governor of the territory for eight y*ars , and a delegate who had been charged with having more than one wife had already sat in Congress for ten years , it is difficult to perceive what necessity there was for him to do this , and much less for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would do it . Whatever credit or discredit there may be connected with the nomination of the delegate referred to is due entirely to Hon. W. H. Hooper , whose own domestic relations have been always monogamic . The statement that the way the Mormon people of Idaho are to vote is dictated to them from Salt Lake City is without the least foundation in truth . The propriety of selecting the best men for office and the value of union at the polls has been the extent to which advice has been given . Stress is laid upon the assertion that they are swiftly peopling the agricultural valleys of the Territories . Deep-laid and treasonable designs are attributed to this movement . This is the very climax of envious jealousy ; for there are but few spots in their possession in Utah , or outside of it , that any other persons would have located upon prior to the improvements which they have put upon them . Outside of the Mormon people themselves , and those who have been of their faith , there are not twenty men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hon. J. G. Campbell , who was delegate from Arizona in the last Congress , informs me that he has for years been familiar with the spots in that territory on which the people from Utah have settled , and he never thought that white men could live there . He asserts emphatically that nov other white people would ever have attempted the cultivation of such lands , and their occupancy is viewed as an advantage by the surrounding inhabitants . As he informs me that they sustained his competitor , he has no political reasons for speaking in this way . In Idaho , the points where they live were supposed , when settled , to be within the limits of Utah , and taxes were collected and paid under that government . The establishment of the line between the two Territories demonstrated that they were outside of Utah . Past experience has taught that it would be imprudent for them to seek for rich and attractive // lands upon which to settle ; they have therefore kept in the poorer portions of the country , where they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them . Because of this they have been reproached with crowding into the recesses of the Rocky Mountains , to be exclusive and to keep aloof from the rest of mankind and the light of civilization . No reports , probably , have obtained more general circulation concerning these people than that they are disloyal and foreign . One object in the continued circulation of these reports is to create the impression that unless some speedy remedy is applied , republican institutions will be overthrown in a territory of the United States . The article on " The Political Attitude of the Mormons " sets forth the foreign character of the system in these words : " Almost all the leaders are of foreign birth . The Mormon Church is a foreign kingdom , hostile in ali its features to a republican form of government ; it is guided and controlled by foreigners , and depends upon foreigners and the children of foreigners for future expansion and power . " This statement is broad and sweeping , and one should be sure of its truth before making it . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described there is a presiding council known as the First Presidency , consisting of three persons . These and the eleven apostles , - there being a vacancy of one ,  --  and the two counselors of the late president of the church , number sixteen . Of these twelve were either born in New England or are the children of New England parents ; two are of Virginia parentage , and two only were born out of the United States , and one of these has been in the country about fifty years and the other about forty years . One of the most important bodies of elders in the church is the Seventies . There are seven who preside over them . They are all Americans by birth , and all , excepting one , of old New England families . The valleys where the Mormons live are divided into what are known as stakes ,  --  what some denominations would call conferences . Over each of these there is a president , who , in all spiritual matters , takes the lead and direction of affairs . He presides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentytwo in all . Of these eighteen are Americans , whose parents were Americans ; four were born out of the United States , but two of them came to this country in their childliood . The presiding bishop of the church has two counselors ; they also are // Americans . If the term " leaders** can be applied to any persons in tliat church , it can be to those I have enumerated . The recent census develops another fact which may be interesting in this connection : that of the several Territories and States which have a larger proportion of foreign-born citizens than Utah , two of the States in which the writer of this statement last resided have a much larger percentage of foreignborn people than Utah . Not only are the leading men mostly of American birth and parentage , but in their families there are but few foreign-born women . The women of Utah who trace their descent from the early settlers of the continent and are proud of their ancestry are quite numerous . Probably in no part of the United States , outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendants of New England ancestry in proportion to the whole population . There is a reason for this . The church was organized in New York ; and , for a number of years afterward , and while it was passing through some of the most severe ordeals of persecution , its converts were mostly from New England and the Middle States , there not having been so many converts from the Southern States at that time . In " The Political Attitude of the Mormons , " we are told that it was " oneness , slavish obedience to masters , and entire prostitution of free and popular government , " which caused the expulsion of the Mormons from the places where they first settled . The truth is that the " frenzy " of which it speaks was aroused in Western Missouri , here they early settled , by designing men circulating the charge that they were " Yankees and Abolitionists . " The foreign-born people in Utah are of the liberty-loving races of Europe , and are generally conscientious , God-fearing people , having the courage to follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of their Bibles ; but industrious , honest , and virtuous ; good citizens themselves , and the element to produce a race of faithful , loyal freemen . The teachings from the platform and in the schools have been that the men who framed the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution , and who took part in the councils and battles of the Revolution , were especialiy inspired and sustained by the Almighty ; and that those instruments are the foundations upon which stable government for ali time , upon this continent , must rest . Joseph Smith , whom they look upon as a prophet , taught this ; and since his day , others have constantly repeated the // teaching . Persecution never weakened their attachment to the principles of free government , and when they fled as religious exiles to the Rocky Mountains they did not forget they were American citizens . They hoisted the Stars and Stripes , and announced their determination to live under the Constitution of their fathers . But they claimed for the Constitution powers which others did not think it possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its governor , they held that the Federal Government , by virtue of the Constitution , had the power to protect and re-instate its citizens in their rights . Martin Van Buren , when appealed to as the chief executive , thought differently . The State was sovereign , and could not be reached ; and he replied : " Your cause is just ; but we can do nothing for you . " The people claimed then , as now , for the Con. stitution , that it was designed to protect the humblest citizen in every right of liberty and of worship that did not disturb good order or interfere with the peace and happiness of others . There have been officials in Utah who have acted as though the exhibition of enmity toward the people was the chief qualification for office there , and the manifestation of friendship or kind . ness was a disqualification . And the results have too frequently justified this view . No charge against an official there has been so effective in procuring his dismissal as that of being kindly disposed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in staving off charges than for the official to allege that he was disliked and feared because of his active hostility against the Mormon people and their system . The recent " high treason " of the governor of the Territory in " strangling the sovereign power and stifling its voice , " is a case in point . It is this disregard of the rights and will of the people that has weakened confidence in officials . Governors and judges have been retained in office because they were hostile to the people ; and others have been dismissed because they were friendly to them . " He who seeks equity must do equity . " The people could not entertain respect for those who would treat them as though they were a foreign and subjugated race ; and this , and no more , has been the extent of the disloyalty of which they are accused . They have been averse to prospecting for and opening mines ; for they knew the train of evils that would follow their development . Every person was at liberty to do as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not because the people // desired to be poor and ignorant that they did not wish a change such as mining would bring . For many years after the settlement of Utah , not a liquor or a gambling saloon existed in the Territory . An unprotected woman could walk every road in city or country , by night or day , without hearing a word of insult or witnessing a gesture of disrespect . That unhappy being whom Lecky calls " the eternal priestess of humanity , blasted for the sins of the people , who appears in monogamic lands as the perpetual symbol of the degradation and sinfulness of man , " did not exist in the valicys of Utah , for prostitution was unknown . The average duration of school days in all the States and Territories per year is 126.8 , while in Utah it is 146 ; it stands eleventh in this respect in the list . Of a school population , nearly two years ago , of 34,929 , there were 66 per cent . enrolled . At that time there were ' 373 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . The text-books are principally those used in the other parts of the republic . Schools there have received no aid from the parent government . Standard journals and magazines are welcomed in every household . The character of their own journals is ridiculed because one of them recommended more earnest prayer and more faithful observance of commandments as a means of deliverance from diphtheria ; but , as the medical profession itself fails to check the ravages of this disease , it is not easy to perceive why they should be sneered at for recommending this when , in the presence of sickness and calamity , governors of States set apart days to fast and pray . It is not very fashionable in these days to have faith in prayers ; but the Mormon people share the views of John Wesley ( Sermon xciv. ) , where he , speaking of the primitive church , says : " This was the real cause why the extraordinary gifts of the Holy Ghost were no longer to be found in the Christian church , because the Christians were turned heathens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " From the time when travel across the continent to California commenced , it has been a constant custom in Utah to invite ministers of repute , of every denomination , who were passing through , to preach in the various places of worship . There is scarcely a Sunday during the summer season that one or more visitors do not address , by invitation , some one of the numerous // Sunday-schools . Besides Sunday-schools , where the Old and New Testaments and other works are taught , there are " mutual improvement associations " for the young people of both sexes in every village in the territory . In the interest of these schools and associations , magazines are published . These are not the evidences of a disposition to neglect education , to shrink from the light of intellectual day , or to avoid any encounter that will bring out truth in stronger relief . Nearly twenty-four years ago a company of emigrants was attacked and killed at Mountain Meadows by Indians , assistedat least a part of the time-by whites . This dreadful massacre occurred at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there has been an unceasing effort on the part of some to hold all the people accountable for its perpetration . John D. Lee , one of the principal actors in this tragedy , was tried by a Mormon jury . On the testimony of Mormon witnesses , they brought in their verdict of murder in the first degree . At that trial , the then United States district-attorney said : " He had been engaged constantly during the past three months in sifting facts and everything related to or connected with the massacre , and that he had come there for the purpose of trying John D. Lee , because the evidence pointed to him as the main instigator and leader , and he had given the jury unanswerable documentary evidence proving that the authorities of the Mormon Church knew nothing of the butchery till after it was committed ; and that Lee , in his letter to Brigham Young , a few weeks after , had knowingly misrepresented the actual facts relative to the massacre , seeking to keep him still in the dark and in ignorance . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on earth in any case ; nothing had been kept back , and he was determined to clear the calendar , but he did not intend to prosecute any one lured to the Meadows at the time , some of whom were only boys , and knew nothing of the vile plan which Lee originated and carried out for the destruction of the emigrants . " Notwithstanding this testimony , and every denial of the people , this massacre has been constantly cited as an incontrovertible proof that in Utah the people are ready to commit any crime upon persons not of their faith ; and even the stage has been prostitated to give wider currency to the atrocious slander . Yet members of Government surveying parties , and numerous others who have traveled through that Territory , bear ample testimony to the remarkable security of life and property there , and the universal kindness and hospitality of the people . In no // other Territory or State is human life held more sacred than it is there . The whole foundation of the charge about " blood-atonement " is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commit murder , adultery , and other gross crimes should be executed ; and , as they do not believe in hanging , one of their early laws gives the criminal convicted of murder the privilege of electing the mode of execution . Chief Justice White , of Utah , who stood in the front rank of his profession in his own State , in a charge to a grand jury , whose attention he drew to polygamy , expressed the results of observations there . He said : " I have not , nor do I propose , to enter upon a discussion of the morality or immorality of polygamy , practiced by a people who in other respects are law-abiding , moral , and upright . With the ethics of the subject neither you , as grand jurors , nor I , as a Court , have anything to do . I do not utter the language of prejudice , nor treat lightly or derisively the Mormon people or their faith . No matter how much I differ from them in belief , nor how widely they differ from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testing them and it by a standard which the world recognizes as just-that is , what they have practiced and what they have accomplished  --  and they deserve higher consideration than ever has been accorded to them . Industry , frugality , temperance , honesty , and , in every respect but one , obedience to law , are with them the common practices of life . This land they have redeemed from sterility , and occupied its once barren solitudes with cities , villages , cultivated fields , and farm-houses , and made it the habitation of a numerous people , where a beggar is never seen , and alms-houses are neither needed nor known . These are facts and accomplishments which any candid observer recognizes and every fair mind admits . " The book which contains the doctrine of the church , and which is esteemed as the word of God , and binding upon them by its members , is of itself a complete refutation of the assertions that the religion of the people prompts them to commit crime , to cling to ignorance , to disregard authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laws of the State , or to yield to priestly domination . The following are a few extracts : " Behold , the laws which ye have received from my hand are the laws of my Church , and in this light shall ye hold them forth . " " And that law of the land which is constitutional , supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges , belongs to all mankind , and is justifiable before me. * ' " Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom ; seek learning even by study , and also by faith . " // " And study and learn and become acquainted with all good books , and with languages , tongues , and people . " " Whatever principles of intelligence we attain imto in this life , it will rise with us in the resurrection ; and if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another , he will have so much the advantage in the world to come . " " Thou shalt not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this world nor in the world to come . " " Thou shalt not lie ; he that lieth and will not repent shall be east out . " " No power or influence can or dight to be maintained by virtue of the priesthood , only by persuasion , by long suffering , by gentleness and meekness , and by love unfeigned . " Respecting government , this book says : " We believe that governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man , and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them . " " We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside , while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments . " " We believe that every man should be honored in his station ; rulers and magistrates as such , being placed for the protection of the innocent and the punishment of the guilty ; and that to the laws all men owe respect and deference . " As to the statement that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts if it were admitted as a State , the experience of the merchants and others who went there in early days and made fortunes , contradicts it . To give color to this allegation , however , the statement is made that it was attempted to tax the gross product of mines twenty per cent. , and that a bill to that effect was only prevented from becoming a law by the veto of the governor . This is emphatically denied to me by one who is familiar with all the revenue bills which have been introduced into the Assembly or passed ; but a bill was vetoed in which land claims and mining claims were made taxable as well as other real property . This was not an unusual provision , for in most of the States and Territories which contain mines such property is taxed as realty , and mining products are taxed much higher than in Utah . The impression is very prevalent that the legislative assembly of Utah has the whole power of enacting the local legislation of the Territory . Yet the truth is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor can absolutely veto all legislation which does not suit him ; and , in addition , Congress can revise or repeal any law . So , too , // it is alleged that the Government is unable to convict persons in Utah who are charged with the crime of bigamy . This is urged as a good cause for depriving the people of the right of sitting upon juries . The court records of the Territory , I am credibly informed , show that convictions have been had in every case tried there for that crime ; and certainly , under the peculiar system of impanding juries , there need be no difficulty in obtaining indictments . In the public mind , the system of plural marriage in Utah is often*onfounded with bigamy . But that crime , as usually committed , inflicts grave wrong upon innocent parties . A man marries a woman ; he afterward deserts her and marries another . From the first he conceals his intention to marry again . From the second he conceals the fact that he already has a wife . Both are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is not the patriarchal marriage of the Latter-day Saints . Strange as it may sound to many people , the same high sense of duty animated the Mormon people to accept the doctrine of plural marriage , and to practice it , which prompts men and women to perform extraordinary acts of religious devotion in other directions . Had they believed celibacy to be the will of heaven , both sexes would have adopted it , in many instances at least , with more willingness than they did plural marriage . They had all the prevalent traditions respecting a man in these days having more than one wife , or more than one woman being married to one man . How then , it may be asked , came they to surrender to this doctrine and practice ? Because they became convinced that it was a revelation and commandment from the Lord , and that the redemption of the race from the evils which abound in modern society required them to accept it . The expression of one leading man respecting his own feelings upon this subject will illustrate those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a doctrine had been revealed , he more than once wished , he said , when he sawthe hearse go byto the cemetery , that he was its occupant , for he could see the avalanche of opprobrium that would descend upon himself and the entire people when it became known that they believed in such a doctrine . To have gone to the stake for his religion would have been more easily and freely performed . In Utah , plural marriages were contracted for many years when there was no law prohibiting them . For years after the // law was passed making it a crime , the opinion was not uncommon among lawyers that the law was violative of the first amendment to the Constitution . These marriages exist , and under them children have been born . But it is demanded that they shall be broken up ; and men are denounced in ferocious style because they do not comply with this demand . How shall this be done ? This is a practical question , and must be met in a practical way . These contracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the understanding that the union was for time and all eternity . Shall the husbands throw off the wives and children obtained under such circumstances and leave them to bear alone all the consequences which the opinion of the world would inflict ? The men of Utah are not such scoundrels and poltroons as to commit such a crime against heaven and humanity as this . There can be no greater mistake than to suppose that sensualism is at the foundation of this system of marriage . For , were that the motive , the responsibility , trouble , and expense of marriage and its fruits need not be incurred . Its gratification can be reached in ways cheaper and very much more popular . The idea in Utah is that every woman should have the privilege of marrying , if she wishes to be a wife and mother , and there should be no unmarried element for lust to prey upon . As the late census shows that the male sex predominates , if all men would marry , of course there could be no plural wives , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aipect of this system of marriage which makes it hateful to many well-meaning persons . They can tolerate defects in morals better than defects in doctrine . Two hundred years ago , John Locke commented upon the fact that there was a class of people naturally more eager against error than against vice . Comte mentions the preference of dogmas by the same class to moral truths , and Kant also alludes to the same peculiarity . In these days , a man can escape much censure for being pliant in his morals if he is inflexible in his orthodoxy . Reformers have often learned this to their cost . Still , charges of immorality were used as effectively against them as against the primitive Christians . It was not those who , in popular estimation , were virtuous and saint-like who were crucified , decapitated , and burned . The complaint is made that the Mormon people are a solid // phalanx . If so , the outside pressure has contributed to make them such . It has had the effect to hoop them up , to force upon them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone their virtues have been acknowledged* There have been those who , representing them as like Chinese , would treat them as Chinese . More than once they have had printed forms of petition sent to churches everywhere , for the signatures of congregations ,  --  many of whom knew less about the real condition of Utah than they did about the antipodes ,  --  asking Congress for legislation that would disfranchise the people there and deprive them of every function of citizenship , except that of paying taxes for others to expend , if not to squander . If the Mormons hold themselves aloof from the Gentiles and are exclusive , as has been charged , the fault is not with them . A clique , composed of a few men , frame the canons to govern Gentile society in Salt Lake City . One of the most stringent of these is that there must be no social intercourse with Mormons generally . Those who violate this are tabooed , and if they persist , they are called * A person may break the entire decalogue with lighter . consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held over visitors also as a punishment for treating Mormons with the courtesy due to citizens . The highest civil and military officers of the Government have not escaped the name , the buly offense of the army dignitary being that he said the Mormons had some , and were not undeserving of credit for their patient toil . A man reaches the condition of " Jack-Mormon** when he ventures to express such sentiments . For one , I am content to have this policy of proscription applied in Utah so far as its effect upon the rising generation is concerned . When a line of demarcation is so sharply drawn as it has been for years between those who profess a certain faith and those who do not , and young people are forced to elect to which class they will belong , those who have pluck and the higher qualities well developed will cast their lots with their persecuted friends , and endure all the consequences which such a decision brings , while the cowardly and the selfish may gravitate to the side which promises them ease and popularity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die for their principles need fear the effect of violence and unjust treatment upon them . If their convictions are profound , persecution solidifles them and evokes sympathy for their cause from those not of // their faith . Their constancy excites admiration , creates an interest in their doctrines , and adds converts to their ranks . This has always been the effect of persecution where it stopped short of extermination . The liberty which followed the edict of Nantes did more to check Protestantism in France than the previous denial of rights and even persecuting war itself . Catholic and Protestant writers alike testify that Protestants diminished during those peaceful times ( " diminuoient en nombre et un cr4dit pendant la paix " ) . Henry III . hated them so much that he excluded them from all positions in the government . Henry IV . took a more liberal view . He decided that violence or the withholding of rights was not a legitimate means of correcting schisms in religion . He chose men for office for their abilities without regard to their religion . This drew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government . They felt gratitude toward , and took interest in , that authority which employed them . I do not say that such a policy on the part of our Government toward the people of Utah would result similarly . But it has not been tried . Inflammatory appeals are made to the country to prevent it or any other kind policy being tried . The administration is urged to adopt a treatment which would be more in violation of the Constitution and all republican principles of government than the acts themselves against which the rigor of the law is invoked . Free-born men are to be deprived of all rights as citizens , and to be governed as Indians , insane , and minors ; and yet it is admitted that they are " in their daily lives peaceable , industrious , frugal , and courteous " ; and that their system has in a decade " waived some of its atrocities .

St. Augustine said ( Lib. xxii. , contra Faustum , cap . 47 ) : " It is objected against Jacob that he had four wives * ; to which he answered , " which , when a // custom , was not a crime . " And the learned Grotius , speaking of such marriages ( B. I. , c. ii. , sec. 17 ) , said that " when God permits a thing in certain cases , and to certain persons , or in regard to certain nations , it may be inferred that the thing permitted is not evil in its own nature .

Surely before thunder-bolts of wrath are launched upon them they should have time to unlearn these views , and the interpretation they have given to the teachings of Jefferson , Madison , and other founders of the republic , respecting " the Jew and the Gentile , the Christian and the Mohammedan , the Hindu and infidel of every denomination , " being protected in the fullest enjoyment of religious liberty , and the practices , as in their own case , flowing therefrom .
