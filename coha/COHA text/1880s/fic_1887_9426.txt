The author begs to state that this is a legitimate Comedy . It is a legitimate Comedy because it is in four acts , and farce-comedies are always in three . Its presentation will doubtless result in crippling as many per night as does the average farce-comedy , but remember that it is four acts and that it has a plot . It may be agreed that it is not a strong plot , that it is not a particularly interesting plot , but , on the other hand , it is a modern and unassuming plot , and it may serve the purpose of giving some slight coherence to the proceedings . However , the author is not strenuous on the subject of his plot . If , when the agony is over , it has been found that the characters , scenes , and incidents have been presented in an amusing fashion , the author will be satisfied , and have no feeling regarding anything that may be said about the plot .

We only know that thirty thousand dollars of the bank funds has mysteriously disappeared . I 've trusted the affairs of the bank so much to Mr. Labaree that I really do n't know much about its business and that 's why I got this Boston lawyer to come down and help investigate it . Deac .

The City Lawyer , Napier Keene There are things about the practice of the law that must be very fascinating to the fair sex . For instance , a lawyer often has twelve men in a box , and they ca n't get away , and they have to sit and listen as long as he chooses to talk . Dot .

The Minister 's Sister , Dot Bradbury Yes , and they do n't seem to do much else but tell stories about her . They 're running to our house all the time with them , but John does n't believe a word they say against her . Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene I suppose not . Dot . The Minister 's Sister , Dot Bradbury Why , they 've tried to get Deacon Tidd , who is the committeeman that engages the teachers , to take the school away from her !

Mr. Keene , is this another of your jokes ? Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene I was never more serious in all my life . Ned . The Bank Teller , Ned Olcott Why , he 's president of the bank !

The City Lawyer , Napier KeeneFollows him My dear boy , there never was anybody above suspicion except Caesar 's wife , and I 've no doubt she was very plain ! Ned . The Bank Teller , Ned OlcottIndignant This is an outrageous action , and whoever has been guilty of it shall answer for it to me ! You do n't believe uncle did it , do you ? Sits L. of table Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier KeeneLeans on table C. Ahem ! Just briefly review the evidence . It seems , according to your uncle 's own statement , that he remained in the bank on the night of the robbery after Mr. Labaree , the cashier , left it , as he often did . He had , he told Mr. Labaree , occasion to go into the safe to get some private papers , and not having his key with him , asked Labaree to leave his key , which Labaree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the possession of your uncle . It is admitted by your uncle that the bonds were in the safe then , as Labaree called his attention to them . When he left the bank he says he locked the safe and the bonds were in it ; he also locked the outer door which fastens with a combination lock , the secret of which is known only to your uncle and Labaree . The next morning Labaree could n't get into the safe till your uncle brought over the key and then the bonds were discovered to be gone . Ned starts to speak But the locks had not been tampered with . The safe had been opened by somebody who knew the secret of the combination and had the key to the inner door . Who was it ? Ned . The Bank Teller , Ned OlcottRises and crosses But I ca n't believe it was my uncle . There must be some explanation to this . Could n't it have been Laba  --  well , I wo n't accuse him . But what motive could uncle have ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Napier Keene The books of a certain broker in Boston show heavy losing speculations in his name . Ned . The Bank Teller , Ned Olcott But could n't his name have been used by somebody else ? Me ? Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene Time will tell . Ned . The Bank Teller , Ned OlcottSeated R. of table Oh , Mr. Keene , my uncle is an old man and this will kill him . Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene I 'm very sorry , but I do n't see any way to help it . They 'll come to arrest him this morning . Labaree has obtained the warrant and taken it to Deacon Tidd to serve . Ned . The Bank Teller , Ned Olcott Labaree ? I see it all . It 's his plot to disgrace our family and ruin me with Annie Grey . I am the one at whom this cruel blow has been aimed , but my uncle shall not be made to suffer on my account . Enter Nora and Dot Nora and Dot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So good-by . Enter Deacon .

Consistency , my dear Miss Bradbury , is a jewel . Dot . The Minister 's Sister , Dot Bradbury So I 've heard . Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene And yet they say  --  women love jewels . Dot . The Minister 's Sister , Dot Bradbury Does it ever occur to you when you are going to make one of these very sharp remarks against my sex that your mother was a woman ? Keene .

Dot appears relieved But I 'm beginning to think I ought to have one . I need a wife to tell me when I 'm making a fool of myself . Dot . The Minister 's Sister , Dot Bradbury Would n't the lady lead a very monotonous life ? Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier KeeneRises ; looks at Dot before speaking Perhaps so , but she 'd enjoy it .

At any cost , whether he is guilty of robbing the bank or not , he must be brought back a free man . Can it be done ? Is he guilty ? Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene I am not sure he is not . Remember what I say is in confidence . John bows Ned told me after the arrest that he confessed to save his uncle . John . The Clergyman , Rev. John Bradbury And his uncle is the guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I  --  Well , it 's hard to say . I have my own theory concerning the case . Somebody else must have had a key to that safe . There 's one thing about it that 's rather funny . If the squire did the job , it shows he knows a man 's got to have money if he runs for office , for the robbery took place on the night of the day he was nominated for councilor . John . The Clergyman , Rev. John BradburyRises excitedly That day ? Then Ned is not the robber ! Crosses L. Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene No ? Why ? John . The Clergyman , Rev. John Bradbury He was a delegate to that convention at Newport that day . We both stayed there that night and as the hotel was crowded occupied the same room and came home together on the morning train , arriving a few minutes after the robbery was discovered . Keene .

The City Lawyer , Napier Keene To her ? John . The Clergyman , Rev. John Bradbury There is a person that I know who is suffering very much on Ned 's account . It is for her sake I take so great an interest in the affair . May I not say to her that she need fear nothing ? If she is patient , she may see Ned again , safe and free ? Do let me relieve the poor girl 's anxiety ! Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene Say that much if you like , but nothing more . John . The Clergyman , Rev. John Bradbury Thank you . There 's no doubt we can clear Ned ? Keene . The City Lawyer , Napier Keene Your testimony will do that . Crosses L. Nora enters C. John crosses to her Nora .
