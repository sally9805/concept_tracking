txt The fight against the ring that has for some years misconducted thenffairS of Hudson Comity , N. J. , gives every indication of being a very determined one . The Deniocratic reformers who nave undertaken it realize what serious work they have in hand , and are going into the campaign with coolness and set purpose . The ring men , on the other hand , are constantly giving new cause for indignation . The Republicans , just at present , appear to occupy an uncertain position , some of them having awakened to the idea that in the fight they may possibly win a local victory themselves . But the 5,000 Democratic majority in Hudson County makes the prospect of any such victory rather poor . The movement naturally has an important bearing on the State campaign . Trie new committee has not indorsed the candidacy of Gov . Abbott , and a proposal to do so was laid on the table at a meeting a week ago . All the men in the movement are Demobrats , and they will follow their natural bel4 if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking of their purposes in that respect at present , and the one clear fact about it seems to be that they regard their local affairs of paramount importance . At present the new movement is exerting itself to secure the possibility of an honest election . This will not be an- easy matter , especially as honest elections have gone out of fashion in Hudson County . A law was passed by the Legislature in 1888 authorizing municipal bodies in cities to appoint election officers . and requiring that these officers shall consist of two Democrats and two Republicans at each polling place . It is understood that the Jersey City Board of Aldermen does not regard this law ae bind-ing and the Corporation Counsel . Assemblyman Edwards , has formulated an opinion that the appointments may be made under an old law . Inasmuch as the law of 1888 repeals all former statutes ou the subject . Coungel Edwards 's opinion is condemned by the new-movement men , but it is expected that the Board of Aldermen will adopt it , and appoint , throe of their own men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meantime the new committee is preparing to fight such a move . A meeting of the Now General Committee was held in Roche 's Hall , Jersey Pity , last evening , Chairman William Starr of Hoboken presiding . One of the most important things it dia was to receive a report from the committee appointed at a previous meeting to wait on the Board . of Aldermen and get a- hearing relative to the division of the city into voting ' precincts . The Aldermen held a special meeting on the subject on Thursday night and the committee was on hand , but got no hearing . Not only that , but it was entirely unable to learn on what lines the Aldermen proposed to divine the city . A measure was brought in making the division , and part of one section of it was read , when somebody moved ' that the further reading be dispensed with and the . measure adopted . Tne motion was carried , although the Aldermen voting . for it admitted that they did not know its contents . Not one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outlines of his own voting precinct after the board had taken the vote . But one Alderman bald . he knew who drew the measure , and that was enough . When the Jersey City papers were published yesterday It was hoped to find the outlines of the new voting precincts described , but the papers gave no information on the , subject . The consequence was that no one outside the ring headquarters knew yesterday how the city had been divided by the Aluermen on Thursday night . Some statements about the division got out yesterday , however , which showed It to be a most outrageous one . It was learned that the Third Assembly Distriet , when is one of the smallest in time county , had been divided.into sixteen precincts , while the Second District , with a much larger vote was divided into eight precincts , and the Seventh , which is also large , was divided into four precincts . The divisions are so made that some persons in the heart of the city will have to go half a mile to vote . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 voters , . although a law passed ' last Winter forbids such a division as shall put more than 300 voters in a precinct . The new-movement men do not fully understand this manoeuvre , bus are satisfied that it is apart of a plot for the manipulation or suppression of a part of the vote . The ring men would not make so absurd a division without some purpose . The General Committeemen last night detided that their primaries should beheld Oct 9 . It was also decided to provide speakers for a mass meeting on Saturday , Oct. 5 . Other steps were also taken in the direction of carrying on the war with vigor . Many meetings will be held and circulars will be sent oat . Men engaged in the new movement denohnee the Hudson County- ring as worse than the Tweed ring ever was . The Tweed ring , they say , gave the citizens of New-York somethiug for the money it took , and , moreover , It spent that money freely and made times lively . . The Jersey ring , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sordid as they are unscrupulous . They provide for themselves and care for nothing else .
