THIRD PAPER : FROM THE ROCKIES TO THE CASCADE RANGE . I TAKE U* the thread of the narrative of north-western travel , which the reader may have followed in previous numbers of this magazine , at Missoula , a little trading town of perhaps eight hundred inhabitants , prettily situated on a plateau facing Hell Gate River , a few miles above its junction with the Bitter Root . South of Missoula , within rifle-shot , is the entrance to the great Hell Gate Cafion ; westward across the angle formed by the two rivers rises the huge , dark wall of the Bitter Root Mountains , higher here , and more picturesque , than the main range of the Rockies , which are half concealed by the grassy swells of the foot-hills on the east . Lo-Lo Peak , the loftiest and most individual mountain of the Bitter Root chain , is covered with snow all summer ; its altitude must be about ten thousand feet . North-west of the town the valley is broad enough for cultivation for a distance of twenty miles , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A range for which there is not even a local name rims the valley on the north . One summit , called Skotah Peak , is a perfect pyramid in form . This cloud-compassed landmark we shall not lose sight of in three days ' travel . Up the Bitter Root Valley there are farms scattered for sixty miles . The valley is warmer than any other in Western Montana , and the small fruits and some hardy varieties of apples are grown . Herds of horses and cattle feed on the slopes of the mountains . Grain and potatoes are grown by irrigation , and the valley is a source of food-supply for military posts and mining-camps . Hogs are fattened upon peas and wheat , and the flavor of a Bitter Root ham is something altogether unique and appetizing . In June the bitter-root plant , from which the valley gets its name , covers all the uncultivated ground with its delicate rose-colored stars . The blossom , about as large as a wild rose , lies close upon the earth . The long , pipestem-like root is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looks like macaroni , and it is by no means unpalatable when cooked with a little salt or butter , or eaten raw . The squaws dig it with long sticks , and dry it for winter food . Another root , also a staple in the aboriginal larder , is the camas , which loves moist prairies , where it flaunts its blue flowers in the early sumlner . In June , when the camas is ready to gather , even the most civilized Indian on the Flathead reservation feels the nomadic impulse too strong to resist . He packs his lodge upon ponies , and starts with his family for some Camas prairie , where he is sure to meet a numerous company bent on having a good time . The picturesque features of life in a Western Montana town like Missoula are best seen as evening approaches . Crowds of roughly clad men gather around the doors of the drinking-saloons . A group of Indians , who have been squatting on the sidewalk for two hours playing some mysterious game of cards of their own invention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the street , which is already decorated from end to end with similar relics of other games . Another swings a baby upon her back , ties a shawl around it and herself ; secures the child with a strap buckled across her chest , and strides off ; her moccasined feet toeing inward in the traditional Indian fashion . She wears a gown made of a scarlet calico bed-quilt , with leggings of some blue stuff ; but she has somehow managed to get a civilized dress for the child . They all go off to their camp on the hill near by . Some blue-coated soldiers from the neighboring military post , remembering the roll-call at sunset , swing themselves upon their horses and go galloping off ; a little the worse for the bad whisky they have been drinking in the saloons . A miner in blue woolen shirt and brown canvas trousers , with a hat of astonishing dimensions and a beard of a year 's growth , trots up the street on a mule , and with droll oaths and shuffling talk , offers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel piazza . No one wants to buy , andy after provoking a deal of laughter , the miner gives his ultimatum : " I 'll hitch the critter to one of them piazzer posts , and if he do n't pull it down you may have him . " This generous offer is declined by the landlord ; and the miner rides off , declaring that he has not a solitary four-bit piece to pay for his supper , and is bound to sell the mule to somebody . Toward nightfall the whole male population seems to be in the street , save the busy Chinamen in the laundries , who keep on // sprinkling clothes by blowing water out of their mouths . Early or late , you will find these industrious little yellow men at work . One shuffles back and forth from the hydrant , carrying water for the morning wash in old coal-oil cans hung to a stick balanced across his shoulders . More Indians now  --  a " buck " and two squaws , leading ponies heavily laden with tent , clothes , and buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jaw is the ordinary halter and bridle of the Indians . These people want to buy some article at the saddler 's shop . They do not go in , but stare through the windows for five minutes . The saddler , knowing the Indian way of dealing , pays no attention to them . After a while they all sit down on the ground in front of the shop . Perhaps a quarter of an hour passes beforeethe saddler asks what they want . If he had noticed them at first , they would have gone away without buying . Now the great event of the day is at hand . The cracking of a whip and a rattle of wheels are heard up the street : the stage is coming . Thirty-six hours ago it left the terminus of the railroad one hundred and fifty miles away . It is the connecting link between the little isolated mountain community and the outside world . No handsome Concord coach appears , but only a clumsy " jerky " covered with dust . The " jerky " is a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As an instrument of torture this hideous vehicle has no equal in modern times . The passengers emerge from its cavernous interior looking more dead than alive . A hundred able-bodied men , not one of them with a respectable coat or a tolerable hat , save two flashy gamblers , look on at the unloading of the luggage . The stage goes off to a stable , and the crowd disperses , to rally again , largely reinforced , at the word that there is to be a horse-race . Now the drinking saloons-each one of which runs a faro bank and a table for " stud poker " - are lighted up , and the gaming and guzzling begin . Every third building on the principal business street is a saloon . The gambling goes on until daylight without any effort at concealment . In all the Montana towns keeping gaming-tables is treated as a perfectly legitimate business . Indeed , it is licensed by the Territorial laws . Some of the saloons have music , but this is a rather superfluous attraction . In one a woman sings popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a banjo . Women of a certain sort mingle with the men and try their luck at the tables . Good order usually prevails , less probably from respect for law than from a prudent recognition of the fact that every man carries a pistol in his hip-pocket , and a quarrel means shooting . The games played are faro and " stud poker , " the latter being the favorite . It is a game in which " bluff " goes farther than luck or skill . Few whisky saloons in Montana are without a rude pine table covered with an old blanket , which , with a pack of cards , is all the outfit required for this diversion . The main street of the frontier town , given up at night to drinking and gambling , by no means typifies the whole life of the place . The current of business and society , on the surface of which surges a deal of mud and drift-wood , is steady and decent . There are churches and schools and a wholesome family life . From Missoula my route led @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and across a forest of firs , pines , and tamaracks , down into the valley of the Jocko River , where the agency of the Flathead Indians is established . These are the Indians with whom General Garfield made a treaty in 1872 . A portion of them lived in the Bitter Root Valley , and the negotiations conducted by Garfield were to induce them to remove to the reservation . Most of the chiefs signed the treaty , under the persuasive influence of a promise of five thousand dollars a year for ten years ; but Charlo , the head chief , refused . He , with about three hundred followers , still lives on the Bitter Root , subject to no agency and receiving no annuity or other form of government gratuity . These Indians have farms and stock-ranges which they hold separately , not by any legal title , but by agreement among themselves . The Flathead reservation contains about i , 5oo , ooo acres of land , and is inhabited by less than twelve hundred Indians and halfbreeds , belonging to the Flathead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traversed it for its entire length of sixty miles along the Jocko and Pend d'Oreille rivers . Allowing only four persons to a family the area of the reservation amounts to five thousand acres for each family living upon it , a pretty liberal allowance when it is remembered that a white family can get only one hundred and sixty acres from the Government . Much of the reservation is mountain land of no value save for the timber on it , but there is ten times as much fine valley and grazing land as the Indians can *make any use of . As a rule the Indian reservations take the best part of the Western country . They are absurdly large . Nearly half of Montana is Indian territory to-day . Five or six thousand Blackfeet , Gros Ventres and Piegans hold a country north of the Missouri River as large as the State of Pennsylvania ; two thousand Crows occupy a region south of the Yellow- // stone equal in area to the State of Massachusetts , and twelve hundred Flatheads , and people of allied tribes , possess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Connecticut . The Flathead agency is under the control of the Catholic Church , which supports a Jesuit mission upon it and has converted all of the inhabitants to at least a nominal adhesion to its faith . At the mission are excellent schools for girls and boys , a church , a convent , and a printing-office which has turned out , among other works , a very creditable dictionary of the Kalispel or Flathead language . The agent , Major Ronan , has been in office over five years , and with the aid of the Jesuit fathers has been remarkably successful in educating the Indians up to the point of living in log houses , fencing fields , cultivating little patches of grain and potatoes , and keeping cattle and horses . The Government supplies plows and wagons , and runs a saw-mill , grist-mill , blacksmith shop and threshing machine for their free use . There is no regular issue of food or clothing , but the old and the sick receive blankets , sugar , and flour . Probably nine-tenths of these Indians are self-sustaining . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country ; but these manage to pick up a living by hunting , fishing , and digging roots , and sell ponies enough to buy blankets , tobacco , and powder . But even the best civilized , who own comfortable little houses with plank floors and porcelain door-knobs got from the Government , like to keep their canvas lodges pitched , and prefer to sleep in them in summer time . Farming is limited to a few acres for each family , but herding is carried on rather extensively . Thousands of sleek cattle and fine horses feed upon the bunch pastures along the Jocko and the Pend d'Oreille , on the Big Camas Prairie and by the shores of Flathead Lake . Many years ago , at a social gathering in Washington , the late President Garfield , then in the early part of his career in Congress , delivered a little extemporaneous address on the Indian question , in which he argued that the first step from barbarism toward civilization for all wild people was the pastoral life , and said that the Indian should be taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was afterward a source of much satisfaction to him to learn that the tribe he visited in 1872 had become excellent herdsrnen , and had already begun farming operations . Probably there is no better example of a tribe being brought out of savagery in one generation than is afforded by the Flatheads , and their cousins , the Pend dOreilles . Much of the credit for this achievement is no doubt due the Jesuit fathers , who , like all the Catholic religious orders , show a faculty for gaining an ascendency over the minds of savages , partly by winning their confidence by devoting themselves to their interests , and partly , it may be , by offering them a religion that appeals strongly to the senses and superstitions . These Indians boast that their tribe never killed a white man . They are an inoffensive , child-like people , and are easily kept in order by the agent , aided by a few native policemen . Life and property are as secure among them as in most civilized communities . With them the agency system amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbandry , and giving aid only when urgently needed . It does not , as upon many reservations , undertake the support of the tribe by issuing rations and clothing . Instead of surrounding the agency with a horde of lazy beggars , the it distnbutes Indians over the reservation and encourages them to labor . It ought to result in citizenship and separate ownership of the land for the Indians . Many of them would now like deeds to the farms they occupy , but they can not get them without legislation from Congress changing the present Indian policy . Practically they control their farms and herds as individual property ; but they have no sense of secure ownership and no legal rights as against their agent or the chief . Some of them complain of the tyranny of the native police and of the practice of cruelly whipping women when accused by their husbands of a breach of marriage vows ,  --  a practice established , it is charged , by the Jesuits ; but in the main they seem to be contented and fairly prosperous . Among them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to Hudson 's Bay Company servants or French Canadians-fine-looking men and handsome women these , as a rule . They are proud of the white blood in their veins , and appear to be respected in the tribe on account of it ; or perhaps it is their superior intelligence which gains for them the influence they evidently enjoy . Shiftless white men , drifting about the country , frequently attempt to settle in the reservation and get a footing there by marrying squaws ; but they are not allowed to remain . The Indians do not object to their company so much as the agent . The Kootenays ( was the name originally Court- ; wz F ) , of whom there are a few lodges on the Flathead reservation , have strayed over the line from the British territory . They // do not take to the civilizing processes in force around them , and are great vagabonds and beggars , frequently wandering off with their dogs , ponies , squaws , and lodges to camp near some town and subsist on what they can pick up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One of them expressed his feelings to the agent 's wife the other day by saying plaintively : " My throat is thirsty for sugar , and my heart is hungry for fifty cents . " The Jocko Valley is one of the prettiest of the minor valleys of the Rocky Mountain system . It was all a green , flowery meadow when I traversed it in the month of June . Its width is about ten miles and its length perhaps thirty . Low , wooded mountain ranges surround it . That on the east is broken by the main branch of the stream , and through the rift can be seen the main chain of the Rockies  --  a mighty mass of crags and cliffs and snow-fields thrust up among the clouds . For thirty miles after the Jocko joins the Clark 's Fork of the Columbia , called by most people in this region the Pend d'Oreille River , the main river is bordered by narrow green bottoms and broad stretches of grassy uplands rising to the steeper inclines of fir-clad mountains . Herds of horses are occasionally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some thrifty Indian or half-breed , or the canvas lodge of a family that prefers the discomforts and freedom of savage life to the comforts and restraints of a local habitation . The first night out from the agency was spent at the hut of one of the queer characters that hang about Indian reservations ,  --  a shiftless white man , who pays for the privilege of ferrying travelers across the river by taking the Indians over free . He lives in a dirty one-room hut . In response to a suggestion about supper , he declared that he would not cook for the Apostle Paul himself , but added that we were welcome to use his stove , and could take anything eatable to be found on the premises . His bill next morning was seven dollars-one dollar , he explained , for victuals for the party , and six for ferriage . A wagon-box offered a more inviting place for a bed that night than the floor of the ferryman 's cabin . In the evening , after the old man had put a party of strolling Flatheads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid no toll , he sat on a log , and , encouraged by the gift of a cigar and a cup of whisky , told of his adventures in the Far North-west when he was a Hudson 's Bay Company 's man , and had a squaw wife in every tribe he visited . Another day 's travel brought us out of the Flathead Reservation , and at the same time to the end of the wagon road and of the open country . The road did not , like one of those western highways described by Longfellow , end in a squirrel track and run up a tree , but it stopped short at a saw-mill on the river*s edge , where a hundred men were at work cutting logs and sawing bridge timber for the railroad advancing up the gorge eighty miles below . In that day 's journey we passed the Big Camas Prairie-not the one Chief Joseph fought for ; that lies far to the west , in Idaho , across the Bitter Root Mountains . There are many camas prairies , big and little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in being fertile green basins among the mountains , in whose moist soil the camas plant flourishes . This was , perhaps , fifteen miles broad by twenty-five long-all magnificent grazing land . We passed an Indian village of a dozen lodges , the doors of the tents shaded by arbors of green boughs , under which sat the squaws in their red , green , and white blankets . On the plain fed herds of horses , and among them Indian riders galloped about seeking the animals they wanted to lariat for the next day 's hunting expedition . With the end of the wagon road came the question of further transportation . Between North-western Montana and the settlements in Northern Idaho and Washington Territory there is but one road  --  the old Mullan road  --  and that is impassable before the middle of July , because of the high water in the mountain streams . The most practicable way of getting to the other side of the huge wall of the Bitter Root Mountains and the Qzeur d'Alenes , their northern extension , is to go around them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is the route surveyed for the Northern Pacific Railroad , whose engineers sought in vain for a pass that could be surmounted , and reluctantly turned the line northward , making a considerable d*tour . A trail runs through the dense forest along the river from the little saw-mill town of Weeksville to the end of the railroad , working southward up the valley from Pend d'Oreille Lake ; and getting over it is only a matter of rough riding with a pack-train and three nights ' camping in the solitudes of the woods . In some places the mountains , walling in the swift river , are too precipitous for even a bridle-path to cling to their sides . Then you scramble up to their summits , dragging your beast after you ; but the climb is rewarded by magnificent views of the snowy ranges to the westward , the somber forest of pines , firs , and larches filling all the narrow valley , and the winding river far below looking like a canal , so regular is the outline of its banks . The great Pend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pan-handle of Idaho into Eastern Washington is by no means forbidding and melancholy , when once you are in its depths . It is all a vast flower-garden . There is scarcely a square foot of the ground , save in the dark recesses along the courses of the small streams , which does not bear a blossom . You can gather handfuls of wild roses , without dismounting , almost anywhere along the trail ; the white three-leaved Mariposa flower abounds ; the quaint moccasin flower displays its clusters of dainty white slippers ; there are patches of wild sunflowers , and a dozen other varieties ; the service-berry bushes bear blossoms like the English hawthorn ; festoons of light green moss hang from the branches of the trees ; white clover makes the air fragrant , and scores of unnamed flowers brighten the glades . The woods are a pasture-field as well as a garden . Rich grasses grow luxuriantly . Our horses , turned loose every evening , found feed enough to keep in good condition for the hard work of the journey . Deer were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinnamon and black bears were often found on the trail , and one day a wolf trotted across the path . The country abounds in game , and will one day , when the railroad makes it accessible , be a favorite resort for hunters , who will take home as trophies of their prowess , antlers of elk and deer , heads of the white mountain goat , and the huge , uncouth mountain sheep , and skins of bears , wolves , foxes , and badgers . There are plenty of speckled trout in the swift , cold streams that dash down from the mountain gorges to the river , and the least experienced fisherman has no difficulty in catching them with , any sort of bait , so ignorant are they of the tricks of the angler . Nor is the forest altogether lonely . Occasionally a pack-train is met , or a party of pedestrians , tramping with blankets , provisions , and frying-pans from the settlements or railroad camps west of the mountains to those in the mountain valleys , and sleeping a ! fresco wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in no way dangerous . Indeed , there is no danger in any of the country I traversed on my north-western pilgrimage , to a traveler who minds his own business and keeps out of drinking dens . Almost everybody I met had a big pistol strapped to him ; but I carried no weapon of any kind , and never once felt the need of one . In Montana every traveler carries his bed , whether he depends upon hoofs or wheels for locomotion , or on his own legs . Even the tramp who foots it over the prairies and through the mountains , pretending to look for work , but really on a summer pleasure tour , subsisting upon the country , has a pair of dirty blankets or an old quilt slung by a rope across his shoulders . The sleeping equipment of a traveler who can afford to pay some attention to comfort , consists of a buffalo robe and two pairs of blankets . With these , and perhaps a rubber poncho , he is prepared to stop wherever night overtakes him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pine floor to spread his buffalo upon , but ready to camp out under the stars . Along the stage roads one is rarely more than twenty miles from a house of some kind , but no one expects beds . The ranchman does not ask his guests if they would like to go to bed ; he says : " Well , gents , are you ready to spread your blankets ? " Camping and traveling in the forest was a delightful experience , spite of rain and fatigue ; but no one of our party was sorry one morning to be met on the river 's bank by an engineer , who brought a package of letters , and the information that the camps of the Chinese graders on the railroad were just across the river , that there was a wagon-road to the end of the track , and that he had a skiff and two rowers to set us across the turbulent current . We had traversed the whole distance ( six hundred miles ) between the ends of the railroad , which are advancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains . The news that we should see a locomotive that very day was received with enthusiasm . It meant beds , baths , clean clothes , newspapers , telegrams , napkins , silver forks , and a hundred other things never noticed or appreciated until out of reach . We rearranged our luggage , bestowed our bedding upon the half-breed Indian , the Kentucky negro , and the white lad , who jointly managed the pack-train , got over the river , and were soon driving through the camps of three thousand Chinese laborers . It was Sunday , and work on the grade was suspended . The canvas town swarmed with men . Some were having their heads shaved , others were combing and winding their pig-tails ; others , stripped to their waist , were enjoying a sponge bath . One man was on his knees going through some religious ceremony over a chicken before dissecting it for the pot . There were Chinese stores , Chinese restaurants , and Chinese gaming tents . For fifteen miles the woods were literally full of Mongolians . Not a feature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the necessity of working in mud and dust , they wear American boots . Their basket hats , blue blouses , and loose trousers are sup- // plied by Chinese merchants , and a large portion of their food-their rice and dried fish , and all their sweetmeats and dainties-comes across the Pacific . The road was lined with Chinamen driving fat hogs to the camps to be slaughtered for the Sunday dinner , or carrying bundles and boxes , and boards for tentflooring , suspended to bamboo poles , balanced on the shoulders in the exact style of the pictures on the tea-chests . The Chinese laborers on the railroad earn one dollar and sixteen cents a day , and are hired by gangs of forty from agents of the Six Companies in San Francisco . The usual estimate of the effectiveness of their labor is that three Chinamen are equal to two white men ; but the superintendent of construction on the railroad asserts that he prefers the Chinese , man for man , to such white labor as can be had on the Pacific coast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Landing , a grotesque and hideous town of tents and shanties clinging to the hill-side , among the pines ,  --  a town subsisting on the wants and weaknesses of the working men , and flaunting in their faces facilities for all the coarser forms of vice . Across the river from this pandemonium of frontier dirt , drunkenness , and debauchery , is another transient railroad town , where the engineers and overseers live , with their wives and children in clean tents , prettily embowered with evergreens . A swift ride of six miles down the rapid stream , in a yawl pulled by two stout oarsmen , brought us to a waiting train , and twenty miles by rail around the shores of Lake Pend d'Oreille , to the raw pine village of Sand Point , standing with its feet in the swollen waters of the lake , completed the day 's journey . Lake Pend d'Oreille is of such irregular shape that I will not attempt to guess at its length or breadth . Perhaps it is three or four times as large as Lake George , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heart of a vast forest . A foreign comparison for its bold , rocky precipices and snow-flecked peaks would best be found in the K6nigsee of the Bavarian Alps ; but no comparison could do justice to the mosquitoes that dispute the occupancy of its shores with the railroad workmen . These pests have their one virtue , however . They draw off their forces at dark , and do not resume their attacks until daybreak . Out of the woods next day , leaving the lake and the mountains behind and running across green plains past a few feeble beginnings of villages , with here and there a potatopatch or a wheat-field ; past herds of horses fattening on the tall bunch-grass , past pineclad hills and swift , cold trout streams , to Spokane Falls , a budding town that hopes to grind the product of the new wheat region of Eastern Washington , and thus become the Minneapolis of the Pacific Coast . Its ambition in this direction rests upon the falls of the Spokane River , a superb water-power and a superb picture , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three separate falls of about thirty feet , and then uniting its transparent green waters , plunges down a sheer descent of sixty feet , throwing up steaming columns of spray . Some small milling and wood-sawing industries have already grown up here , and the town , though barely two years old , counts twelve hundred inhabitants , and is clean , orderly , and respectable beyond the attainments of most new settlements in the North-west . North and north-west of it lies a good farming country just beginning to attract population . Southward is a belt of rocky forest land seven miles wide , and beyond that begins the high , grassy , billowy plateau that skirts the bases of the Cceur d'Alene , Bitter Root , and Blue Mountains for two hundred and fifty miles , with an average breadth of fifty miles , and constitutes the most productive new wheatfield in the United States . To see this wonderful new granary of the far West I went just an hour 's journey farther by rail to Cheney ( an energetic , successful village in the pine forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently shown his sensible appreciation of the honor by giving it ten thousand dollars for a school-building ) , and then traveled southward by vehicles of one sort and another for five days , visiting the towns of Colfax , Moscow , Lewiston , Pomeroy , Dayton , and Walla-Walla . The immense grain and pasture country of Eastern Washington , lapping over a little into Idaho on the east and into Oregon on the south , is a region so peculiar in its natural features and its climate that it can be compared with no other . The well-worn simile of a sea in a storm might be applied to its surface , and would describe the fluid-like irregularity of the shape of the green hills ; but the hills are ten times as high as the longest Atlantic storm waves . Their soil is a deep rich brown loam , with a basaltic foundation and a small admixture of alkali  --  the best possible grain-producing compound . Slcipes , crests , and deep , narrow valleys are alike fertile . In its natural state the whole face of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild sunflowers , the sunflower plants growing separately among the grass at intervals of three or four feet . There is no timber save alder and willow along the streams , and a little stunted pine in the slopes of the profound depressions // made by the longer water-courses . Lumber for building and rails for fences must be hauled from the mountains . This is the only serious drawback the settlers of this new region have to contend with , and it will soon be modified when the roads building by the Oregon Railway and Navigation Company reach the mountains . Cedar posts will then be easily obtained , and the barbed wire , so much used of late in the prairie States , will take the place of fence-rails . The southern portion of the region around Walla-Walla and Dayton is tolerably well settled , and driving over its dusty roads , one is rarely out of sight of neat farm-houses , orchards , and fields of wheat and barley . In the northern portion nine-tenths of the land lies open , and much of it is still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here the little , unpainted , oneroom houses show that the people are just beginning , with small means , to open new farms . Life seems narrow and dreary in one of these shabby board boxes , without shade or shrubbery , and with no prospect but the grass and the sunflowers on the steep hillsides ; but give the new settler a few years ' start , and he will have a painted house of three or four rooms , a good barn , a garden , and a young orchard and ten acres of growing forest-trees planted and cared for , in order to obtain an additional quarter-section of land under the Timber-culture Act . His fields of wheat , flax , and barley will be thrown like mantles of green and gold over the surrounding hills , and his herds of cattle and horses will graze for miles around . Attracted by a pretty farmstead , which contrasted strikingly with the bare board shanties I had passed during the morning 's ride , I stopped one day to ask for dinner  --  a repast never denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Ohio , and their farm and house showed how much comfort can be got by industry , taste , and thrift in this newest of all the new farming regions of the United States . There was a neat grassy dooryard in front of the pretty house , and back of it a garden with currant and raspberry bushes , strawberry beds , and young cherry trees . An orchard of plums and hardy apples covered a neighboring slope , and a plantation of box-alders was growing near the big barn to make a wind-break . The table was soon spread in the living-room , and the company was increased by the arrival of a rosy-cheeked daughter- " first of the hive to swarm , " explained the mother-who came with her husband from a farm near by which he had just " taken up . " The land of my host probably cost him nothing five years ago . With the improvements he has put upon it , he counts it worth twenty dollars an acre . Different parts of the region I am describing have local names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names when taken from the Nez-Perc6 Indian language ,  - -  such as the Palouse Country , the Alpowa Country , the Assotin Country , and the Pataha Country ; common-place or ugly , like most frontier names , when invented by the settlers , like Pine Creek , Thorn Creek , Deadman 's Creek , and Hangman 's Creek . Snake River , running north until it receives the Clearwater at Lewiston , turns sharply to the west and cuts this region across about midway of its length . This powerful stream , broad , rapid , and turbid , flows in a bare , basaltic crevice two thousand feet below the general level of the country it drains . Where thirty bushels of wheat to the acre are an average crop , and fifty not an extraordinary one , and there is never a failure of a crop , the settler , even though the price be only fifty cents a bushel , soon gets forehanded . While his crops are growing , his herds are increasing on the wide , natural pastures . Horses thrive out of doors the year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it prudent to lay by a little winter fodder for cattle , and for this purpose sow a mixed crop of wheat and oats to cut green , or harvest the volunteer crop of wheat which comes up on unplowed stubble fields . A horse will paw the snow off the dry bunch-grass and shift very well for himself ; but when there is a deep snowfall , a steer seeks a hollow in the hills and stands there till he dies . The energetic farmer in this region , I have said , soon gets a fair share of the comforts of life about him . There is one class of settlers , however , who seem never to get beyond the bare-board-cabin period ; they are the Missourians . Population in Montana , Idaho , Washington , and Oregon is divided into two distinct elements  --  the Missourians and the people from other States . It is marvelous how many pioneers the half-settled State of Missouri has sent to the farther West , and equally marvelous is the faculty of inertia they display as to progress in civilization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by instinct , constantly emigrating to newer countries , and yet he lacks the energy to build a comfortable house , or cultivate a good crop , or put a serviceable fence around his land . Bayard Taylor once remarked upon the hostility of the Missourian to trees . His house stands in the glaring sun . If nature has provided a tree near by he cuts it down . Probably the reason is that he is too lazy to go far for wood , and consumes the // timber nearest at hand to broil his bacon and bake his corn pone . There are , it is only fair to say , a few active , competent people from Missouri in the towns of the North-west , but the rural population from that State is a dead weight upon any section they inhabit . It is a common saying in all the Western territories , that the left wing of " Pap " Price 's army , after the Rebel defeat at Pea Ridge , never stopped running until it got beyond the Rocky Mountains . This saying has some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the battle , and , returning home , put their families and valuables on wheels and crossed over the plains with ox-teams to the newly discovered mining gulches of Idaho , Montana , and Oregon . The dispersion of Price 's army can only partly account , however , for the large population of Missouri origin to be found on the Pacific slope and in the Rocky Mountains . We must give these peculiar people , whom Col. John Hay has put into literature in his Pike County Ballads , credit for a deal of enterprise and hardihood in getting a long way off from their birth-place . Though satisfied with poor living , alleviated only by tobacco and whisky , they are good movers . At Colfax , a busy Jittle town squeezed into a mile of the crevice of the Palouse River Valley , I saw a large number of Spokane and NezPerc6 Indians , gorgeously arrayed in scarlet , yellow , and green . They were on their way to some rendezvous where they have an annual picnic and horse-race , and were spending a few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars apiece , and drinking up all the essences in the drug-stores in lieu of whisky . There is a heavy penalty for selling liquor to an Indian . The law is broken by stealth , but the red man can not always find a white brother willing to take the chances of imprisonment for half a dollar , so he is obliged to fall back on essences . It is a common mistake in the East to suppose that the Indians are confined upon their reservations . They roam over the white man 's country pretty much as they please , but jealously keep the white man out of their territory . They are the aristocracy of the West : " they toil not , neither do they spin . " Life is a continual excursion and holiday . With their Government blankets and annuities , and the proceeds of the sale of their ponies , the men are quite independent . They have money to buy fine felt hats , and feathers at the millinery stores to stick in them , and they are great consumers of vermilion paint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense . The squaws get only a very moderate amount of the finery and paint ; as with birds , the male sports the fine plumage . The tall , well made " bucks , " arrayed in green blankets , red leggings , and white felt hats stuck around with feathers and tinsel , stalk about the streets of the frontier towns , looking scornfully upon the white people who work for a living , and no doubt regarding them as poor creatures . The climate of the high , hilly plateau drained by Snake River and its tributaries is peculiar . The winters are about as cold as those of Maryland or Southern Ohio . There is some snow , two or three weeks of sleighing , perhaps , a few cold snaps , and a good deal of mild , open weather . In the summer the days are clear and hot , and the nights so cool that a pair of blankets are needed for comfort . Hot nights are unknown . Rain falls in light showers through June , but after that time there are three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grain being threshed in the fields as soon as cut . There is a great difference , however , between the climate of the uplands , where the elevation is twenty-five hundred feet above the sea , and that of the deep , sunken river valleys . In going down from the plateau into the Snake River Valley at Lexviston , you seem to pass in an hour from the summer temperature of Maine to that of South Carolina . Never have I seen a more singular and striking landscape effect . than that which suddenly burst into view one evening as I came out on the edge of the plateau above the junction of the Snake and Clearwater rivers . I had been traveling for sixty miles that day , up hill and down , among grain and flax fields and great sweeps of open bunch-grass country , the Cceur dAlene Mountains ahead , now and then a farm-house in a hollow , and for a noon halt the smart , growing village of Moscow , just across the Idaho line ,  --  not conscious any of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country ,  --  when toward sunset the ground suddenly disappeared in front of my horses ' heads , and there , two thousand feet below , in almost sheer descent , lay a little checker-board of a town at the meeting of two magnificent rivers . It was Lewistonthe houses mere white specks in a mass of foliage , the brown country brightened here and there by a square of green grain-field , rising in ridges to the Craig Mountains . How to get down into the warm nether region of water and verdure , where the town lay seemingly within a stone 's throw , was a problem that appeared difficult , but was easily enough solved by a half-hour 's fast drive down a zigzag road cut in the cliff side . With its rows of tall poplars and its groves of fruit-trees , Lewiston looks from the steep mountain road like some French // village on the Maine or the Meuse , and the illusion is heightened as you approach , by the sign " Hotel de France " on a cream-colored building half hidden by shade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferry on the dusty business street , bordered by mean little one-story wooden buildings . Yet the place is one of the most attractive of all the frontier towns , from the abundance of foliage and the pretty door-yards , with their lush turg and their shrubbery and flowers ,  --  rare adornments in this raw , utilitarian West . The heights one descends to reach the town from the country north of the Clearwater and the Snake , viewed from the valley , are bold , bare mountains of basaltic rock scantily covered with dry herbage . Their creased and bulging slopes , strangAy colored in all shades of brown , have a fantastic appearance , and when their singular hues are brightened by sunset tints they look like the paint-and-canvas creation of the brain of some opium-eating artists rather than like real mountains of nature 's own make . Lewiston lies in Idaho , just across the line , and here the North Idaho question is sure to be put before the visitor . The mountain range , which at the end of the shank of the leg-of-mutton shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east , and leaves three good agricultural counties along its base . These counties have no relations with the other settled regions of Idaho except an enforced political one ; and they demand separation and annexation to Washington , with which they are identical in their business interests and the character of their country . A range of mountains eighty miles across , and passable only by an Indian trail , divides them from South Idaho , and they are forced to make a d6tour of six hundred miles through Washington and Oregon to reach the territorial capital at Bois6 City . All their lines of communication with the rest of the world lead by river and road across an artificial boundary traced on a map by a meridian line to the towns of Washington and Oregon . Their reasonable request is , that when Washington is admitted as a State they be joined to it . The only opposition to this plan comes from the politicians of South Idaho , who do not want to lose the taxes on the seven thousand prosperous people inhabiting the northern counties . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this region , Moscow with nearly a thousand , and half a dozen little budding towns living on trade with the grain farmers and stock-raisers . The eastxvard indentation in the mountain chain is thirty miles deep , and is drained by the Clearwater and its tributaries . The richest portion of it is called the Potlatch country . 871 Right across it lies the Nez-Perci Reservation , which the Lewiston people are eager to have broken up . Wherever there is an Indian reservation the white settlers near by want it abolished . They look upon the Indian as a cumberer of the ground , and would order him to move on if they could . The NezPerc6s are tolerably well advanced in civilization . One of them has sold eight thousand dollars ' worth of horses and cattle this year . There are seventy houses on the reservation , but the occupants pitch their lodges close by , and would doubtless relapse into a nomadic life if the Government did not constantly encourage them to till the soil and look after their stock . These Nez-Perc*s look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel in Lewiston , and his manner of feeding was , if anything , a trifle less greedy than that of some of the white guests . It was the cousins of these same tamed barbarians , however , who , under Chief Joseph , refused to go on the reservation , cut the throats of the wives and children of the settlers on the Cottonwood , and massacred Lieutenant Raines and his thirteen soldiers . The Nez-Perc6 war was the tragedy of North Idaho , and the people are never weary of reciting this epic of the frontier , with its scenes of heroism and horror . It would be folly for the Government to bring back Joseph and his exiled band to the reservation . Their lives would not be safe from the wrath of the relatives and neighbors of the murdered settlers . South and west of Lewiston the good arable country sweeps around by the base of the Blue Mountains to Walla-Walla , a distance of ninety miles . The whole fertile belt of East Washington , I have said before , may roughly be measured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is all fertile , and amazingly fertile too . There is absolutely no waste land in it , save on the steep slopes of the Snake River Cai*on . It is sparsely settled as yet , but immigrants are steadily streaming in , and it will soon contain a dense agricultural population . It is a better grain country than even Eastern Dakota , the average yield being considerably larger . Besides this magnificent farming belt , all parts of which are alike in their general characteristics of elevation , hilly surface , and uniformly productive soil , East Washington contains two other fertile regions : the Big Bend country , lying in the sweep of the Columbia-an extensive plain just beginning to attract settlers  --  and the Yakima country , a series of narrow valleys on the eastern slope of the Cascade Mountains . I have not visited either of them . Both are said to be good stock and wheat sections . // In traveling through the country south of Snake River ( Lewis River , the people of Lewiston insist that it should be called , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City fighting each other at a distance of three miles for the honor and profit of the county-seatship of the new county of Garfield , and passed a night in the older and larger town of Dayton , snugly seated among elms and willows in a bend of the Touchet River . It is bustling and prosperous . My journey next took me to WallaWalla , largest and handsomest of all the East Washington towns . Doubtless the name of Walla-Walla brings no suggestion to the minds of most readers in the far-away East , save of a rude frontier settlement . Yet the place luxuriates in verdure and bloom , and many of its shady streets , bordered by pretty houses , with their lawns , orchards and gardens , would be admired in a New England village , while the business streets would do no discredit to an Ohio town of half a century 's growth . In the homes of well-to-do citizens one finds the magazines and new books and newspapers from New York , Boston , and Philadelphia , and discovers that they manage to keep abreast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent people on the Atlantic slope . The town has five thousand inhabitants , but in its importance as a center of trade and social influences it represents an Eastern town of many times its size . There is barely a trace of the frontier in the manners of the people , and none at all in their comfortable way of living ; yet they are thousands of miles from New York by the only route of steam travel . A fairer or more fertile country than that which stretches south and east of Walla-Walla to the base of the Blue Mountains one might travel more than five thousand miles to find . In June it is all one immense rolling field of wheat and barley dotted at long intervalsfor the farms are large - with neat houses , each in its orchard of apple and peach trees . The mountains rise in gentle slopes to snowflecked summits . Over the wide plain move tall , tawny cloud-like columns of dust , in size and shape like water-spouts at sea . From the foot-hills scores of these singular formations may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still . If the reader has followed me in my notes of travel through " The New North-west " in this and previous numbers of this magazine , he will observe that the whole country traversed through the northern tier of territories from Eastern Dakota to Washington is a habitable region . There will be no break in the line . No alkali and greasewood desert lies across the path of settlement , to make a blank space in future maps and divide the civilization of the North Pacific coast from that of the nearer North-west . This is an important fact for the statesman and sociologist to consider in their forecasts of the progress of the American Republic , and the development of the new American race now in process of amalgamation from diverse elements of Puritan and Southerner , Teuton , Celt , and Scandinavian , African , Mongolian , and Red Indian . The two coasts of the continent will be tied together by a broad band of continuously populated country , reaching from the Red River of the North to the mouth of the Columbia . Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there by the bivouacs of the advance guard of the approaching army of settlers . In the course of over six hundred miles of travel between the two ends of the Northern Pacific Railroad I slept under a roof every night , save when on an Indian reservation , or in the great forest on the Clark 's Fork of the Columbia . Sometimes the roof was that of a herdsman 's hut , or the shanty of an engineer party , but always there was shelter to be found for the night by rightly planning the day 's journey . For the entire distance every square mile of the country is valuable either for farming , stock-raising , or timber-cutting . There is absolutely no waste land between the well-settled region of Dakota and the new wheat region of Washington Territory . Even on the tops of the Rocky Mountains there is good pasturage ; and the vast timber belt enveloping Clark 's Fork and Lake Pend d'Oreille , and the ranges of the Cabinet and Cceur d'Alene Mountains is more valuable than an equal extent of arable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the treeless regions on both sides of it in Montana and Washington . Save on the ranges of the Rockies and their outlying groups and spurs , the country is practically destitute of good timber all the way east to the pine forests of Minnesota , and westward there is a wide stretch of bare hills and plains to the foot of the Cascade Range .
