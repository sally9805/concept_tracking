txt The Legislature of this State has been in. session three weeks . , It is about two weeks since the standing committees of the Assembly were announced and all the machinery of legislation was put in working order . And vet there has been next to nothing accomplished or put in the way of accomplishment . Each week the members of the two houses come straggling in at Albany on Monday from their homes and from their private " business and desire " ? for " every man has business and desire such as it is "  --  and in the evening there is a slimly attended session at which nothing is done . There is always an adjournment from Friday to Monday , and the members begin scattering off again on Thursday night , practically reducing Friday to a " dies non . " Three days a week virtually cover the real working-time of the Legislature . Last Friday Mr. VAN ALLEN , of this City , offered a resolution in the Assembly requiring a sitting every day in the week , except Sunday , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was promptly defeated by the votes of the Democratic majority . In objecting to the resolution Col. MURPHY stated that there was not business enough to justify the Legislature in sitting six days in the week . This admission has a peculiar significance . If there is nothing for the Legislature to do , the obvious course for it to take is to wind up at once and adjourn without day . If there is anything for it to do , it should address itself to business , dispatch its work , and disperse in a seemly and becoming manner . As much , and possibly more , can he done in six days of one week as in six days spread over two weeks . There is no force whatever in Col. MURPHY ' s objection , except on the supposition that it is to serve the purpose of the members , or of the party to which the majority belongs , to prolong the session , whether there is anything to be done or not . There is unquestionably a number of matters upon which an intelligent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few weeks , but there is ' nothing with which the body now at Albany is likely to deal that needs to occupy much time . We see no prospect of any useful effort to make a further revision of the tax laws . There is no important action called for with reference to railroads until the Commission law has been put into effect and begins to develop results . It is desirable that something should be done for the reform of municipal government in our large cities , but there is no sign of earnest effort in that direction , and it is extremely doubtful if this Legislature is fit or competent to deal with the subject . It certainly gives no indication of it thus far . The things that really need to be done are few and simple , and might as well be disposed of promptly . It is plain enough that it there is work for the Legislature to do and if it is competent to do it , there is no excuse for wasting time and dragging along with three lazy days ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is capable of doing it can accomPlish all the sooner by attending to busi- ness . There is but one reasonable inference from the defeat of Mr. VAN ALLEN 'S resolution and the attitude of the majority on the question of doing a week 's work in a week , and that is that the Legislature is either incompetent or has nothing to do , and therefore ought not to be in session . It is furnishing a very strong argument in favor of biennial sessions . All that really needs to be done now might as well have been done last year , and , with the exception of those few neglected things , all that will be done could as well wait until next year . Now that the Legislature is in session , it should make the Congressional apportionment , which ought to have been made a year ago ; it should make adequate provision for increasing the water supply of this City ; it should deal in a prompt and decisive way with the truculent pretensions of the elevated railroads , and it should make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done as well for two years as for one . The more important tasks , for which it is exhibiting neither aptitude nor capacity , are of the kind that involve no occasion for annual sessions . The fact that the Legislature meets every year indeed facilitates and encourages the continual postponing of the heavier and more important duties , and the result is that there seems to be very little prospect of ever getting them done . A programme might be suggested for this Legislature whereby it could win no small degree of credit , probably the highest degree it is capable of attaining . Let it resolve to devote six days a week industriously to disposing of its few pressing duties and reach a final adjournment by the end of February , and let it wind up by proposing a constitutional amendment , for which the people have long been ready , providing for biennial sessions after its final adoption . The important and somewhat difficult work of framing sensible tax laws and a good scheme of municipal government can wait until we have a Legislature disposed to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own incapacity and laziness.
