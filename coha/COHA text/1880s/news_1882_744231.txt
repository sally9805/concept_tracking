txt A bill was passed in the House to-day which repeals all discriminating duties imposed upon certain imported goods p.rc , ' " : eti east of the Cape of Good Hope when ported from places west of that Cape . The bill , as originally introduced from the Ways and Means Committee by Mr. Kelley , provided for the removal of the discriminating duty of 10 per cent . on tea and coffee produced east of the Cape in the possessions of the Netherlands , and imported from places west of the Cape . It had been ascertained that the discriminating export duties imposed by the Government of the Netherlands in favor of direct shipments from its colonial possessions to Holland had been removed , and therefore , in accordance with the treaty of 1853 , it was necessary that the United States should reciprocate . But , when the bill reached the Senate , that body amended it so as to include the discriminating duties imposed upon the products of other countries east of the Cape , as well as of the Netherlands colonies , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concurred iu the action of the Senate . The annual amount collected by means of discriminating duties has been about $300,000 . The bill , as passed , simply repeals section 2,501 of the Revised Statutes . The original object of the law was to give a preference to American vessels loading in China for ports in the United States . Since the completion of the Pacific Railroads and the Suez Canal , there is no necessity for such a law , for vessels come directly from China to San Francisco , and our vessels for the East do not go around the Cape . The duty was imposed on goods Produced east of the Cape , which were brought to this country from Europe , and not directly from Asia to this country . The law goes into effect Jan. 1 1883.
