COLONIALISM IN TIlE UNITED STATES . S.E.C. NOTHING is more interesting than to trace , through many years and almost endless wanderings and changes , the fortunes of an idea or habit of thought . The subject is a much - neglected one , even in these days of sweeping and minute investigation , because its inherent difficulties are so great , and the data so multifarious , confused , and sometimes contradictory , that absolute proof and smooth presentation seem well-nigh impossible . Yet the ideas , the opinions , even the prejudices of men , impalpable and indefinite as they are , have at times a wonderful vitality and force . The conditions under which they have been developed may change , or pass utterly away , while they , mere shadowy creations of the mind , will endure for generations . Long after the world to which it belonged has vanished , a habit of thought will live on , indelibly imprinted upon a race or nation , like the footprint of some extinct beast or bird upon a piece of stone . The solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fierce struggle of eight hundred years with the Moors . The theory of the Lord 's day peculiar to the English race all over the world is the deeply branded sign of the brief reign of Puritanism . A certain fashion of thought prevailed half a century ago ; another is popular to-day . There is a resemblance between the two , the existence of both is recognized , and both , without much consideration , are set down as sporadic and independent . We have all heard of those rivers which are suddenly lost to sight in the bowels of the earth , and , coming as suddenly again to the surface , flow onward to the sea as before . Despite the vanishing , it is always the same river . Or the wandering stream may turn aside into fresh fields , and , with new shapes and colors , seem to have no connection with the waters of its source or those which finally mingle with the sea . it is exactly so with some kinds of ideas and modes of thought , - those that are wholly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and are forgotten in a few years , or which are still oftener the creatures of a day , or an hour , and die by myriads , like the short-lived insects whose course is run between sunrise and sunset . The purpose of this article is to discuss briefly certain opinions which belong to the more enduring class . They are sufficiently well known . When they are mentioned every one will recognize // them , and will admit their existence at the period to which they belong . The point which is overlooked is their connection and relationship . They all have the same pedigree , a marked resemblance to each other , and they derive their descent from a common ancestor . My intention is merely to trace the pedigree and narrate the history of this numerous and interesting family . I have entitled them collectively Colonialism in the United States , a description which is more comprehensive than satisfactory or exact . In the year of grace 1776 , we published to the world our Declaration of Independence . Six years later , England assented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have been striving ever since to make that independence real and complete , and that the work is not yet entirely finished , are not , perhaps , equally obvious truisms . The hard fighting by which we severed our connection with the mother country was in many ways the least difficult part of the work of building up a great and independent nation . The decision of the sword may be rude , but it is pretty sure to be speedy . Armed revolution is quick . A South American , in the exercise of his constitutional privileges , will rush into the street and declare a revolution in five minutes . A Frenchman will pull down one government to-day , and set up another to-morrow , besides giving new names to all the principal streets of Paris during the intervening night . We English - speaking people do not move quite so fast . We come more slowly to the boiling point ; we are not fond of violent changes , and when we make them we consume a considerable time in doing it . Still , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an affair of a few years . We broke with England in 1776 , we had won our victory in 1782 , and by the year 1789 we had a new national government in operation . But if we are slower than other people in the conduct of revolutions , owing largely to our love of dogged fighting and inability to recognize defeat , we are infinitely more deliberate than our neighbors in altering , or even modifying , our ideas and modes of thought . The slow mind and ingrained conservatism of the English race are the chief causes of their marvelous political and material success . After much obstinate fighting in the field , they have carried through the few revolutions which they have seen fit to engage in ; but when they have undertaken to extend these revolutions to the domain of thought , there has arisen always a spirit of stubborn and elusive resistance , which has seemed to set every effort , and even time itself , at defiance . By the treaty of Paris our independence was acknowledged , and in name and theory was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conflict , that of ideas and opinions . True to our race and to our instincts , and with a wisdom which is one of the glories of our history , we carefully preserved the principles and forms of government and law , which traced an unbroken descent and growth from the days of the Saxon invasion . But while we kept so much that was of inestima-. ble worth , we also retained , inevitably , of course , something which it would have been well for us to have shaken off together with the rule of George IlL and the British Parliament . This was the colonial spirit in our modes of thought . The word " colonial " is preferable to the more obvious word " provincial , " because the former is absolute , while the latter , by usage , has become in a great measure relative . We are very apt to call an opinion , a custom , or a neighbor " provincial , " because we do not like the person or thing in question ; and in this way the true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But coloniaI* // ism is susceptible of accurate definition . A colony is an offshoot from a parent stock , and its chief characteristic is dependence . In exact proportion as dependence lessens , the colony changes its nature and advances toward national existence . For a hundred and fifty years we were English colonies . Just before the Revolution , in everything but the affairs of practical government , the precise point at which the break came , we were still colonies in the fullest sense of the term . Except in matters of food and drink , and of the wealth which we won from the soil and the ocean , we were in a state of complete material and intellectual dependence . Every luxury , and almost every manufactured article , came to us across the water . Our politics , except those which were purely local , were the politics of England , and so also were our foreign relations . Our books , our art , our authors , our commerce , were all English ; and this was true of our colleges , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners . There is no need here to go into the details which show the absolute supremacy of the colonial spirit and our entire intellectual dependence . When we sought to originate , we simply imitated . The conditions of our life could not be overcome . The universal prevalence of the colonial spirit is shown most stron*ly by one great exception , just as the flash of lightning makes us realize the intense darkness of a thunder-storm at night . In the midst of the provincial and barren waste of our intellectual existence in the eighteenth century there stands out in sharp relief the luminous genius of Franklin . It is true that Franklin was cosmopolitan in thought , that his name and fame and achievements in science and literature belonged to mankind ; but he was all this because he was genuinely and intensely American . his audacity , his fertility , his adaptability , are all characteristic of America , and not of an English colony . He moved with an easy and assured step , with a poise and balance which nothing could shake , among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and princes and courtiers , unmoved and unawed . He was strongly averse to breaking with England ; but when the war came lie was the one man who could go forth and represent to Europe the new nationality without a touch of the colonist about him . He met them all , great ministers and great sovereigns , on a common ground , as if the colonies of yesterday had been an independent nation for generations . His autobiography is the corner-stone , the first great work of American literature . The plain , direct style , almost worthy of Swift , the homely , forcible language , the hum or , the oh servation , the knowledge of men , the worldly philosophy of that remarkable hook , are fair liar to all ; but its best and , considering its date , its most extraordinary quality is its perfect originality . It is Americaii in feeling , without any taint of English colonialism . Look at Franklin in the midst of that excellent Pennsylvanian community ; compare him and his genius with his surrounding , and you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America in those days , and how thoroughly men were saturated with it , than in any other way . In general terms it may he said that , outside of politics and the still latent democratic tendencies , the entire intellectual life of the colonists was drawn from England , and that to the mother country they looked for everything pertaming to the domain of thought . The colonists in the eighteenth century had , in a word , a thoroughly and deeply rooted habit of mental dependence . The manner in which we have gradually shaken off this dependence , retaining of the past only that which is good , constitutes the history of the decline of the colonial spirit in the United States . As this spirit existed everywhere at the outset , // and brooded over the whole realm of intellect , we can in most cases trace its history best in the recurring and successful revolts against it , which , breaking out now here , now there , have at last brought it so near to final extinction . In 1789 , after the seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war , the United States government was established . Every visible political tie which bound us to England had been severed , and we were apparently entirely independent . But the shackles of the colonial spirit , which had been forging and welding for a century and a half , were still heavy upon us , and fettered all our mental actior . The work of making our independence real and genuine was but half done , and the first struggle of the new national spirit with that of the colonial past was in the field of politics , and occupied twenty-five years before victory was finally obtained . We still felt that our fortunes were inextricably interwoven with those of Europe . We could not realize that what affected us nearly when we were a part of the British Empire no longer touched us as an independent nation . We can best understand how strong this feeling was by the effect which was produced here by the French Revolution . That tremendous convulsion , it may be said , was necessarily felt everywhere ; but one much greater might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all resembling the excitement of 1790 . We had already achieved far more than the French Revolution sought or accomplished . We had gone much further on the democratic road than any other nation . Yet worthy men in the United States put on cockades and liberty caps , erected trees of liberty , called each other " Citizen Brown " and " Citizen Smith , " drank confusion to tyrants , and sang the wild songs of Paris . All this was done in a country where every privilege and artificial distinction had been swept away , and where the government was the creation of the people themselves . These ravings and symbols had a terrific reality in Paris and in Europe , and so , like colonists , we felt that they must have a meaning to us , and that the fate and fortunes of our ally were our fate and fortunes . A part of the people engaged in an imitation that became here the shallowest nonsense , while the other portion of the community , which was hostile to French ideas , took up and propagated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England and with English opinions . Thus we had two great parties in the United States , working themselves up to white heat over the politics of England and France . The first heavy blow to the influence of foreign politics was Washington 's proclamation of neutrality . It seems a very simple and obvious thing now , this policy of non-interference in the affairs of Europe which that proclamation inaugurated , and yet at the time men marveled at the step , and thought it very strange . Parties divided over it . People could not conceive how we could keep clear of the great stream of European events . One side disliked the proclamation as hostile to France , while the other am proved it for the same reason . Even the Secretary of State , Thomas Jefferson , one of the most representative men of American democracy , resisted the neutrality policy in the genuine spirit of the colonist . Yet Washington 's proclamation was simply the sequel to the Declaration of Independence . It merely amounted to saying , We have created a new nation , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and European politics are none of our business , and we propose to be independent of them and not meddle in them . The neutrality policy of Washington 's administration was a great advance toward independence and a severe bldw to cob . nialism in politics . Washington himself exerted a powerful influence against the // colonial spirit . The principle of nationality , then just entering upon its long struggle with state rights , was in its very nature hostile to everything colonial ; and Washington , despite his Virginian traditions , was thoroughly imbued with the national spirit . He believed himself , and insensibly impressed his belief upon the people , that true nationality could only be obtained by holding ourselves aloof from the conflicts and the politics of the Old World . Then , too , his splendid personal dignity , which still holds us silent and respectful after the lapse of a hundred years , communicated itself to his office , and thence to the nation of which he was the representative . The colonial spirit withered away in the presence of Washington . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamilton . He was not born in the States , and was therefore free from all local influences ; and he was by nature imperious in temper and imperial in his views . The guiding principle of that great man 's public career was the advancement of American nationality . He was called " British " Hamilton by the very men who wished to throw us into the arms of the French republic , because he was wedded to the principles and the forms of constitutional English government , and sought to preserve them here adapted to new conditions . lie desired to put our political inheritance to its proper use , but this was as far removed from the colonial spirit as possible . Instead of being " British , " hamilton 's intense eagerness for a strong national government made him the deadliest foe of the colonial spirit , which he did more to strangle and crush ont than any other man of his time . The objects at which he aimed were continental supremacy , and complete independence in business , politics , and industry . In all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so he assailed it by his reports and by his whole policy , foreign and domestic . So much of his work as he carried through had a far-reaching effect , and did a great deal to weaken the colonial spirit . But the strength of that spirit was best shown in the hostility or indifference which was displayed toward his projects . The great cause of opposition to Hamilton 's financial policy proceeded , undoubtedly , from state jealousy of the central government ; but the resistance to his foreign policy arose from the colonial ignorance which could not understand the real purpose of neutrality , and which thought that Hamilton was simply and stupidly endeavoring to force us toward England as against France . Washington , Hamilton , and John Adams , despite his New England prejudices , all did much while they were in power , as the heads of the federalist party , to cherish and increase national selfrespect , and thereby eradicate colonialism from our politics . The lull in Europe , after the fall of the federalists led to a truce in the contests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renewal of war the old conflict broke out . The years from 1806 to 1812 are among the least creditable in our history . The federalists ceased to be a national party . The fierce reaction against the French Revolution drove them into an unreasoning admiration of England . They looked to England for the salvation of civilized society . Their chief interest centred in English politics , and the resources of England formed the subject of their thoughts and studies , and furnished the theme of conversation at their dinner tables . It was just as bad on the other side . The republicans still clung to their affection for France , notwithstanding the despotism of the empire . They regarded Napoleon with reverential awe , and shivered at the idea of plunging into hostilities with any one . The foreign policy of Jefferson was that of a thorough colonist. // He shrank with horror from war . He would have had us confine ourselves to agriculture , and to our flocks and herds , because our commerce , the commerce of a nation , was something with which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had us exist in a state of complete commercial and industrial dependence , and allow England to carry for us and manufacture for us , as she did when we were colonies , weighed down by the clauses of the navigation acts . His plans of resistance did not extend beyond the old colonial scheme of non-importation and non-intercourse agreements . Read the bitter debates in Congress of those years , and you find them filled with nothing but the politics of other nations . All the talk is saturated with colonial feeling . Even the names of opprobrium which the hostile parties applied to each other were borrowed . The republicans called the federalists " tories and a " British faction , " while the federalists retorted by stigmatizing their opponents as jacobins . During these sorry years , however , the last in which our politics bore the colonial character , a new party was growing up , which may be called the national party , not as distinguished from the party of state rights , but as the opposition to colonial ideas . This new movement was headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Quincy Adams , the brilliant group from South Carolina , comprising Calhoun , Langdon Cheves , and William Lowndes , and at a later period by Daniel Webster . Clay and the South Carolinians were the first to push forward the resistance to colonialism . Their policy was crude and ill defined . They struck out blindly against the evil influence which , as they felt , was choking the current of national life . They were convinced that , to be truly independent , the United States must fight somebody . Who that somebody should be was a secondary question . Of all the nations which had been kicking and cuffing us , England was , on the whole , the most arrogant , and offensive ; and so the young nationalists dragged the country into the war of 1812 . We were wonderfully successful at sea , but in other respects this war was neither very prosperous nor very creditable . rrhe treaty of Ghent was absolutely silent as to the objects for which we had expressly declared war . But the real purpose of the war was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded it . We had proved to the world and to ourselves that we existed as a nation . We had demonstrated the fact that we had ceased to be colonies . We had torn up colonialism in our public affairs by the roots , and we had crushed out the colonial spirit in our politics . After the war of 1812 our politics might be good , bad , or indifferent , but they were our own politics , and not those of Eu rope . The wretched colonial spirit which had belittled and warped them for twenty-five years had perished utterly , and with the treaty of Ghent it was buried so deeply that not even its ghost has since crossed our political pathway . Besides being the field where the first battle with the colonial spirit was fought out , politics then offered almost the only intellectual interest of the country , outside of commerce , which was still largely dependent in character , and very different in its scope from the great mercantile combinations of to-day . Religious controversy was of the past , and except in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in progress , there was no great interest in theological questions . When the constitution went into operation the professions of law and medicine were in their infancy . There was no literature , no art , no science , none of the multifarious interests which now divide and absorb the intellectual energies of the community . In the quarter of a century which // closed with the treaty of Ghent we can trace the development of the legal and medical professions , and their advance towards independence and originality . But in the literary efforts of the time we see the colonial spirit displayed more strongly than anywhere else , and in apparently undiminished vigor . Our first literature was political , and spral ) g from the discussions incident to the adoption of the constitution . This literature was concerned with our own affairs , and aimed at the foundation of a nation . It was therefore fresh , vigorous , often learned , and thoroughly American in tone . Its masterpiece was the Federalist , which marks an era in the history of constitutional discussion , and which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After the new government was established , our political literature , like our politics , drifted back to provincialism of thought , and was absorbed in the affairs of Europe ; but the first advance on the road to literary independence was made by the early literature of the constitution . To this period , between the years 1789 and 1815 , Washington Irving , our first eminent name in literature , belongs . This is not the place to enter into an analysis of Irving 's genius , but it may be fairly said that while in feeling he was a thorough American , in literature he was a cosmopolitan . His easy style , the t*nge of romance , and the mingling of the story-teller and the antiquarian remind us of his great contemporary , Walter Scott . In his quiet humor and gentle satire , we taste the flavor of Addison . In the charming legends with which he has consecrated the beauties of the hudson River valley , arid thrown over that beautiful region the warm light of his ima* i nation , we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manner we perceive his historical taste and his patriotism in the last work of his life , the biography of his great namesake . But he wrought as well with the romance of Spain and of England . He was too great to be colonial ; he did not find enough food for his imagination in the America of that day to be thoroughly American . He stands apart , a great gift from America to English literature , but not a type of American literature itself . lie had imitators and friends , whom it has been the fashion to call a school , but he founded no school , and died us he had lived , alone . He broke through the narrow trammels of colonialism himself , but the colonial spirit hung just as heavily upon the feeble literature about him . In that same period there flourished another literary man , who was far removed in every way from the brilliant editor of Diedrich Knickerbocker , but who illnstrated by his struggle with colonialism the strength of that influence far better than Irving , who soared so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , independent , with a rude but surprising knowledge of philology , revolted in every nerve and fibre of his being against the enervating influence of the colonial past . The spirit of nationality had entered into his soul . He felt that the nation which he saw growing up about him was too great to take its orthography or its pronunciation blindly and obediently from the mother laud . It was a new country and a new nation , and Webster determined that so far as in him lay it should have linguistic independence . It was an odd idea , hut it came from his heart , and his national feehin* found natural expression in the study of language , to which he devoted his life . lie went into open rebellion nomust British tra ( ltion. lie was snubbed , laughed at , and abused . He was regarded as little better than a madman to dare to set himself up against Johnson and his successors . But the hardheaded New Englander pressed on* and finally brought out his dictionary , - a great work , which has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his general theory mistaken ; his system of changes has not stood the test of time , and was in itself contradictory but the stuhhorn battle which he fought for literary independence and the hard blows he struck should never be forgotten , while the odds against which he conten ( led and the opposition he aroused are a ( lmirable illustrations of the overpowering influence of the colonial spirit in our early literature . What the state of our literature was , what the feelings of our few literary men , and what the spirit with which Webster did battle all come out in a few lines written by an English poet . We can see everything as by a sudden flash of light , and we do not need to look further to understand the condition of American literature in the early years of the century . In the waste of barbarism called the United States , the only oasis discovered by the delicate sensibilities of Mr. Thomas Moore was in the society of Mr. Joseph Dennie , a clever editor and essayist , and his little circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this connection are those in the epistle to Spencer , beginning ,  --  " Yet. , yet , forgive me , 0 ye sacred few , Whom late by Delaware 's green banks I knew ; which describe the poet 's feelings toward America , and his delight in the society of Mr. Dennie and his friends . But the feelings and opinions of Moore are of no moment . The really important passage describes not the author , but what Dennie and his companions said and thought , and has in this way historical if not poetic value . The lines occur among those addressed to the Boston frigate when the author was leaving halifax : - " Farewell to the few I have left with regret ; May they sometimes recall , what I can not forget , The delight of those eveninbs , - too brief a de-light , When iii converse and song we have stol'n on the night ; When they ye asked me the manners , the mind , or the mien Of some bard I had known or some chief I lied seen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Whose name had oft hallowed the wine-cup they poured . And still , as with sympathy humble hot true I have told of each bright son of fame all I knew , They have listened , and sighed that the powerful stream Of America 's empire should l ) CS5 like a dream , Without leaving one relic of genius , to say How sublime was the tide which had vanished away ! ' * The evils apprehended by these excellent gentlemen are much more strongly set forth in the previous epistle , but here we catch sight of the men themselves . There they sit adoring Englishmen , and eagerly inquiring about them of the gracious Mr. Moore , while they are dolefully sighing that the empire of America is to pass away arid leave no relic of genius . Jn their small way they were doing what they could toward such a consummation . It may be said that this frame of mind was perfectly natural under the circumstances ; but it is not to the purpose to inquire into causes and motives ; it is enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more than average taleti ts arid education ; not geniuses , like Jrving , but clever men , forming one of the , steeped to the eyes in colonialism , and they fairly represent the condition of American literature at that time . They were slaves to the colonial spirit , which bowed before England and Europe . They have not left a name or a line which is remembered or read , except to serve as a historical illustration , and they will ultimately find their fit resting-place in the foot-notes of the historian . With the close of the English war the United States entered upon the second stage of their development . The new era , which began in 1815 , lasted un // til 1861 . It was a period of growtjii not simply in the direction of a vast material prosperity and a rapidly increasing population , but in national sentiment , which made itself felt everywhere . Wherever we turn during those years , we discover a steady decline of the colonial influence . Politics were wholly national and independent . The law was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the annals of English jurisprudence . Medicine began to have its schools , and to show practitioners who no longer looked across the sea for inspiration . The Monroe doctrine bore witness to the strong foreign policy of an independent people . The tariff gave evidence of the eager desire for industrial independence , which found practical expression in the fast - growing native manufactures . Internal improvements were a sign of the general faith and interest in the development of the national resources . The rapid multiplication of inventions resulted from the natural genius of America in that important field , where it took almost at once a leading place . Science began to have a home at our seats of learning , and in the land of Franklin it found a congenial soil . But the colonial spirit , cast out from our politics and fast disappearing from business and the professions , still clung closely to literature , which must always be the best and last expression of a national mode of thought . In the admirable Life of Cooper , just published , by Professor Lounsbury , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly and so exactly that it can not be improved . It is as follows - " The intellectual dependence of America upon England at that period is something that it is now hard to understand . Political supremacy had been cast off , but the supremacy of opinion remained abs*olutely unshaken . Of creative literature there was then very little of any value produced ; and to that little a foreign stamp was necessary , to give currency outside of the petty circle in which it originated . There was slight encouragement for the author to write ; there was still less for the publisher to print . It was , indeed , a positive injury , ordinarily , to the commercial credit of a bookseller to bring out a volume of poetry or of prose fiction which had been written by an American ; for it was almost certain to fail to pay expenses . A sort of critical literature was struggling , or rather gasping , for a life that was hardly worth living ; for its most marked characteristic was its servile deference to English judgment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penitential examination of the reviews of the period to comprehend the utter abasement of mind with which the men of that day accepted the foreign estimate upon works written here , which had been read by themselves , but which it was clear had not been read by the critics whose opinions they echoed . Even the meekness with which they submitted to the most depreciatory estimate of themselves was outdone by the anxiety with which they hurried to assure the world that they , the most cultivated of the American race , did not presume to have so high an opinion of the writings of some one of their countrymen as had been expressed by enthusiasts , whose patriotism had proved too much for their discernment . Never was any class so eager to free itself from charges that imputed to it the presumption of holding independent views of its own . Out of the intellectual character of many of those who at that day pretended to be the representatives of the highest education in this country , it almost seemed that the element of manliness had been wholly eliminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom no obstacles thwarted and no dangers daunted , the New World was also to give birth to a race of literary cowards and parasites . " // 621 The case is vigorously stated , but is not at all overcharged . Far stronger , indeed , than Professor Lounsbury 's statement is the commentary furnished by Cooper 's first book . This novel , now utterly forgotten , was entitled Precaution . Its scene was laid wholly in England ; its characters were drawn from English society , chiefly from the aristocracy of that favored land ; its conventional phrases were all English ; worst and most extraordinary of all , it professed to be by an English author , and was received on that theory without suspicion . In such a guise did the most popular of American novelists and one of the most eminent writers of fiction of the day first appear before his countrymen and the world . If this were not so pitiable , it would be utterly ludicrous . The most melancholy feature of the case is that Cooper was not in the least to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action was regarded by every one as a matter of course . In other words , the first step of an American entering upon a literary career was to pretend to be an Englishman , in order that he might win the approval , not of Englishmen , but of his own countrymen . If this preposterous state of public opinion had been a mere passing fashion it would hardly be worth recording . But it represented a fixed and settled habit of mind , and is only one example of a long series of similar phenomena . We look back to the years preceding the Revolution , and there we find this mental condition flourishing and strong . At that time it hardly calls for comment , because it was so perfectly natural . It is when we find such opinions existing in the year 1820 that we are conscious of their significance . They belong to colonists , and they are uttered by the citizens of a great and independent state . The sorriest part of it is that these views were chiefly held by the best educated portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , who had cast out the colonial spirit from their politics and their business , and were fast destroying it in the professions , was sound and true . The parasitic literature of that day makes the boastful and rhetorical patriotism then in the exuberance of youth seem actually noble and fine , because , with all its faults , it was honest , genuine , and inspired by a real love of country . Yet it was during this period , between the years 1813 and 1861 , that we began to have a literature of our own , and one which any people could take pride in . Cooper himself was the pioneer . In his second novel , The Spy , he threw off the wretched spirit of the colonist . The popularity of this story broke down all barriers , and it was read everywhere with delight and approbation . The chief cause of the difference between the fate of this novel and that of its predecessor lies in the fact that The Spy was of genuine native origin . Cooper loved and knew American scenery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the prairie and the ocean , and his genius was no longer smothered by the dead colonialism of the past . The Spy , and those of Cooper 's novels which belong to the same class , have lived and will live , and certain American characters which he drew will likewise endure . He might have struggled all his life in the limbo of intellectual servitude to which Moore 's friends consigned themselves , and no one would have cared for him then or remembered him now . But with all his foibles , Cooper was inspired by an intense patriotism , and he had a bold , vigorous , aggressive nature . He freed his talents at a stroke , and giving them full play attained at once a world-wide reputation , which no man of colonial mind could ever have dreamed of reaching . Yet his countrymen , long before his days of strife and unpopularity , seem to have taken singularly little patriotic // pride in his achievements , and the well bred and well educated shuddered to hear him called the " American Scott ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because it was a piece of irreverent audacity toward a great light of English literature . Cooper was the first , after the close of the war of 1812 , to cast off the colonial spirit and take up his position as a representative of genuine American literature ; but he soon had companions , who carried still higher the standard which he had raised . To this period , which closed with our civil war , belong many of the names which are to-day among those most cherished by Englishspeaking people everywhere . We see the national spirit in Longfellow turning from the themes of the Old World to those of the New . In the beautiful creations of the sensitive and delicate imagination of Hawthorne , the greatest genius America has as yet produced , there was a new tone and a rich originality . The same influence may be detected in the wild fancies of Poe . We find a like native strength in the sparkling verses of Holmes , in the pure and gentle poetry of Whittier , and in the firm , vigorous work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emerson , destined to achieve a worldwide reputation . A new school of historians appears , adorned by the talents of Prescott , Bancroft , and Motley . Many of these distinguished men were far removed in point of time from the beginning of the new era . They all , however , belong to and are the result of the national movement , which began its onward march as soon as we had shaken ourselves clear from the influence of the colonial spirit upon our public affairs by the struggle which culminated in " Mr. Madison 's war , " as the federalists loved to call it . These successes in the various departments of intellectual activity were all due to an instinctive revolt against provincialism . But , nevertheless , the old and time-worn spirit which made Cooper pretend to be an Englishman in 1820 was very strong , and continued to impede our progress toward intellectual independence . We find it clinging to the lesser and weaker forms of literature . We see it in fashion and society and in habits of thought , hut we find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion . This was a universal failing . The body of the people showed it by hitter resentment ; the cult tivated and highly educated by abject submission and deprecation , or by cries of pain . As was natural to a very young nation , just awakened to its future destiny , just conscious of its still undeveloped strength , there was at this time a vast amount of exuberant self-satisfaction , of cheap rhetoric , and of noisy self-glorification . There was a corresponding readiness to take offense at the unfavorable opinion of outsiders , and yet an eager curiosity to hear foreign opinions of any kind . We were , of course , very open to satire and attack . We were young , undeveloped , with a crude , almost raw civilization , and a great inclination to be boastful and conceited . Our English cousins , who had failed to conquer us , bore us no good will , and were quite ready to take all the revenge which books of travel and criticism could afford . It is to these years that the Marryats and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American Notes , belong . Most of these productions are quite forgotten now . The only ones which are still read , probably , are the American Notes and Martin Chuzzlewit : the former preserved by the fame of the author , the latter by its own merit as a novel . There was abundant truth in what Dickens said , to take the great novelist as the type of this group of foreign critics . It was an age in which Elijah Pogram and Jefferson Brick flourished rankly . It is also true that // 623 all that Dickens wrote was poisoned by his utter ingratitude , and that to describe the United States as populated by nothing but Bricks and Pograms was onesided and malicious , and not true to facts . But the truth or the falsehood , the value or the worthlessness , of these criticisms are not of importance now . The striking fact , and the one we are in search of , is the manner in which we bore these censures when they appeared . We can appreciate contemporary feeling at that time only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can hardly comprehend fully what we find , so completely has our habit of mind altered since those days . We received these strictures with a howl of anguish and a scream of mortified vanity . We winced and writhed , and were almost ready to go to war , because English travelers and writers abused us . It is usual now to refer these ebulhitions of feeling to our youth , probably from analogy with the youth of an individual . But the analogy is misleading . Sensitiveness to foreign opinion is not characteristic of a youthful nation , or at least we have no cases to prove it , and in the absence of proof the theory falls . On the other hand , this excessive and almost morbid sensibility is a characteristic of provincial , colonial or dependent states , especially in regard to the mother country . We raged and cried out against adverse English criticism , whether it was true or false , just or unjust . We paid it this unnatural attention because the spirit of the colonist still lurked in our hearts and affected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road to intellectual and moral independence , but we were still far from the goal . This second period in our history closed , as has been said , with the struggle generated by a great moral question , which finally absorbed all the thoughts and passions of the people , and culminated in a terrible civil war . We fought to preserve the integrity of the Union ; we fought for our national life , and nationality prevailed . The grandeur of the conflict , the dreadful suffering which it caused for the sake of principle , the uprising of a great people , elevated and ennobled the whole conntry . The floodgates were opened , and the tremendous tide of national feeling swept away every meaner emotion . We came out of the battle , after an experience which brought a sudden maturity with it , stronger than ever , but much graver and soberer than before . We came out self-poised and self-reliant , with a true sense of dignity and of our national greatness , which years of peaceful development could not have given us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature of our mental condition before the war had disappeared . It had vanished in the smoke of battle , as the colonial spirit disappeared from our politics in the war of 1812 . Englishmen and Frenchmen have come and gone , and written their impressions of us , and made little splashes in the current of every-day topics , and have been forgotten . Just now it is the fashion for every Englishman who visits this country , particularly if he is a man of any note , to go home and tell the world what he thinks of us . Some of these writers do this without taking the trouble to come here first . Sometimes we read what they have to say out of curiosity . We accept what is true , whether unpalatable or not , philosophically , and smile at what is false . The general feeling is one of wholesome indifference . We no longer see salvation and happiness in favorable foreign opinion , or misery in the reverse . The colonial spirit in this direction also is practically extinct . But while this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health is good , and is also true of the great body of sound public opinion k the United States , it has some marked exceptions ; and these exceptions consti // tute the lingering* remains of the colonial spirit , which survives , and shows itself here and there even at the present day , with a strange vitality . In the years which followed the close of the war , it seemed as if colonialism had been utterly extinguished . Unfortunately , this was not the case . The multiplication of great fortunes , the growth of a class rich by inheritance , and the improvement in methods of travel and communication all tended to carry great numbers of Americans to Europe . The luxurious fancies which were horn of increased wealth , and the intellectual tastes which were developed by the advance of the higher education , and to which an old civilization offers peculiar advantages and attractions , combined to breed in many persons a love of foreign life and foreign manners . These tendencies and opportunities have revived the dying spirit of colonialism . We see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually increasing in this country . During the miserable ascendency of the Second Empire , a band of these persons formed what was known as the " American colony , " in Paris . Perhaps they still exist ; if so , their existence is now less fla* , rant and more decent . When they were notorious they presented the melancholy spectacle of Americans admiring and aping the manners , habits , and vices of another nation , when that nation was bent and corrupted by the cheap , meretricious , and rotten system of the third Napoleon . They furnished a very offensive example of peculiarly mean colonialism . This particular phase has departed , but the same sort of Americans are , unfortunately , still common in Europe . I do not mean , of course , those persons who go abroad to buy social consideration , nor the women who trade on their beauty or wits to gain a brief and dishonoring notoriety . These last are merely adventurers and adventuresses , who are common to all nations . The people re ferred to here form that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no doubt , who pass their lives in Europe , mourning over the inferiority of their own country , and who become thoroughly denationalized . They do not change into Frenchmen or Englishmen , but are simply disfigured and deformed Americans . We find the same wretched habit of thought in certain groups among the rich and idle people of our great Eastern cities , especially in New York , because it is the metropolis . These groups are for the most part made up of young men , who despise everything American , and admire everything English . They talk and dress and walk and ride in certain ways , because the English do these things in those ways . They hold their own country in contempt , and lament the hard fate of their birth . They try to think that they form an aristocracy , and become at once ludicrous and despicable . The virtues which have made the upper classes in England what they are , and which take them into public affairs , into literature and politics , are forgotten . Anglo-Americans imitate the vices or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all this were merely a passing fashion , an attack of Anglo-mania or Gallo-mania , of which there have been instances enough everywhere , it would be of no consequence . But it is a re currence of the old and deep-seated malady of colonialism . It is a linen descendant of the old colonial family The features are somewhat dim now and the vitality is low , but there is nc mistaking the hereditary ( 1ualities . Th people who thus despise their own land and ape English manners , flatter them selves with being cosmopolitans , whe ' in truth they are genuine colonists petty and provincial to the last degree . We see a like tendency in the sam* limited but marked way in our litern tnre . Some of our cleverest and bes fiction has been largely devoted to study // ing the character of our countrymen abroad ; that is , either denationalized Americans . or Americans with a foreign background . At times this species of literature resolves itself into an agonized effort to show how foreigners regard us , and to point out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ satirizes the denationalized American . The endeavor to turn ourselves inside out in order to appreciate the trivialities of life which impress foreigners unpleasantly is very unprofitable exertion , and the Europeanized American is not worth either study or satire . Writings of this kind , again , are intended to be cosmopolitan in tone , and to evince a knowledge of the world ; they are in reality steeped in colonialism . We can not but regret the influence of a spirit which wastes fine powers of mind and keen perceptions in a fruitless striving and a morbid craving to know how we appear to foreir , ners , and to show what they think of us . We see also men and women of talent going abroad to study art and remaining there . The atmosphere of Europe is more congenial to such pursuits , and the struggle as nothing to what must be encountered here . But when it leads to an abandonment of America , the result is wholly vain . Sometimes these people become tolerably successful French artists , but their nationality and individuality have departed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school of etching , which has arisen in New York ; the beautiful work of American wood-engraving ; the Chelsea tiles of Lowe , which have carried the highest prizes at English exhibitions ; the silver of Tiffany , specimens of which were bought by the Japanese commissioners at the Paris Exposition , are all strong , genuine work , and are doing more for American art , and for all art , than a wilderness of over-educated and denationalized Americans who are painting pictures and carving statues and writing music in Europe or in the United States , in the spirit of colonists , and bowed down by a wretched dependence . There is abundance of splendid material all about us here for the poet , the artist , or the novelist . The conditioas are not the same as in Europe , but they are not , on that account , inferior . They are certainly as good . They may be better . Our business is not to grumble , because they are different , for that is colonial . We must adapt ourselves to them . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in art or literature ever has been , or ever will be , of any real or lasting value which is not true , original , and independent . If these remnants of the colonial spirit and influence were , as they look at first sight , merely trivial accidents , they would not be worth mentioning . The range of their influence is limited , hut it affects an important class . It appears almost wholly among the rich or the highly educated in art and literature ; among men and women of talent and refined sensibilities . The follies of those who imitate English habits belong really to but a small portion of even their own class . But as these follies are contemptible , the wholesome prejudice which they excite is naturally , but thoughtlessly , extended to all who have anything in common with those who are guilty of them . In this busy country of ours the men of leisure and educa. tion , although increasing in number , are still few , and they have heavier duties and responsibilities than anywhere else . Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand the energies of such men . To the country which has given them wealth and leisure and education they owe the duty of faithful service , because they , and they alone , can afford to do that work which must be done without pay . The few who are imbued with the colonial spirit not only fail in their duty , and become contemptible and absurd , but they injure the influence // and thwart the activity of the great majority of those who are similarly situated , and who are patriotic and public spirited . In art and literature the vain struggle to be somebody or something other than an American , the senseless admiration of everytbing foreign , and the morbid anxiety about our appearance before foreigners have the same deadening effect . Such qualities were bad enough in 1820 . They are a thousand times meaner and more foolish now . They retard the march of true progress , which must be here , as elsewhere , in the direction of nationality and independence . This does not mean that we are to expect or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in art , literature , or society . Originality is thinking for one 's self . Simply to think differently from other people is eccentricity . Some of our English cousins , for instance , have undertaken to hold Walt Whitman up as the herald of the coming literature of American democracy , merely because he departed from all received forms , and indulged in barbarous eccentricities . They mistake difference for originality . When Whitman did best , lie was nearest to the old and well-proved forms . We , like our contemporaries everywhere , are the heirs of the ages , and we must study the past , and learn from it , and advance from what has been already tried and found good . That is the only way to success anywhere , or in anything . But we can not enter upon that or any other road until we are truly national and independent intellectually , and are ready to think for ourselves , and not look to foreigners , to see what they think . To those who grumble and sigh over the inferiority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Englishman , as they prefer such authority . Mr. Herbert Spencer said recently , " I think that whatever difficulties they may have to surmount , and whatever tribulations they may have to pass through , the Americans may reasonably look forward to a time when they will have produced a civilization grander than any the world has known . " Even the Englishmen whom our provincials of to-day adore , even those who are most hostile , pay a serious attention to America . That keen respect for success and anxious deference to power characteristic of Great Britain find expression every day , more and more , in the English interest in the United States , now that we do not care in the least about it ; and be it said in passing , no people despises more heartily than the English a man who does not love his country . To be despised abroad , and regarded with contempt and pity at home , is not a very lofty result of so much effort . But it is the natural and fit reward of colonialism . Members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to examine the sources of the colonial spirit , and to trace its influence upon our history and its gradual decline . rrhe study of a habit of mind , with its tenacity of life , is an instructive an ( 1 entertaining branch of history . But if we lay history and philosophy aside , the colonial spirit as it survives to-day , although curious enough , is a mean and noxious thing , which can not be too quickly or too thoroughly stamped out . It is the dying spirit of dependence , and wherever it still clings it injures , weakens , and degrades . It should be exorcised rapidly and completely , so that it will never return . I can not close more fitly than with the noble words of Emerson - " Let the passion for America cast out the passion for Europe . They who find America insipid , they for whom London and Paris have spoiled their own homes , can be spared to return to those cities .
