Pollster George Gallup , who covers the public opinion beat for 122 newspapers , * had a hot pre-convention argument last week . His opponent was Charles Michelson , former Democratic publicity chief . Their dispute was over the value of polls . <P> White-haired Mr. Michelson singled out Dr. Gallup 's poll , which reported that 61% of the U.S. people thought that the Government erred in taking over Montgomery Ward . Wrote Michelson ( for North American Newspaper Alliance ) : " As there are involved knotty questions over which the lawyers will be wrangling clear up to the Supreme Court , the acquirement of so definite a result comes near to being miraculous . Incidentally , is n't there a question of whether this does not come close to things the courts could hardly permit ? . . . <P> " That brings up another thought as to the worth or unworth of polls . Most Congressmen are poignantly sensitive to the views of their constituents . Their elections depend on maintaining their popularity . ... It would be idle to assume that they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philosophy ) Gallup found Michelson 's opinions " based upon a complete misconception of aim and method . " Said the pollster : " The people may not be fully informed on all the complexities of any given issue . But that does not stop them from having opinions . . . . Mr. Michelson ignores a point which undoubtedly he knows well , which is that opinions are subject to change and so are political tides . " <P> Were jurists in the case of Montgomery Ward likely to be affected by the poll ? Dr. Gallup thought not . Were Congressmen swayed ? Dr. Gallup declared that " all wise Congressmen take public opinion into account in deciding how they shall vote . " <P> <P> *For news of a Roosevelt v. Dewey poll , see U. S.
