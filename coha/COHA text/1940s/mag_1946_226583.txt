THE SCARLET TREE ( 381 pp. ) - Sir Osbert Sitwell-Little , Brown ( $3.50 ) . <P> <P> Sir George Reresby Sitwell of Renishaw was an extraordinary man . He spent money like water , dabbled in medieval lore , invented a musical toothbrush that played Annie Laurie . In a milder way , his wife , Lady Ida , was extraordinary too . Though she invented nothing , she also spent money like water ( she once paid a large price for a pig said to be psychic ) , as befitted a daughter of the Earl of Londesborough and a descendant of the royal Plantagenets . <P> Sir George and Lady Ida had three children . Edith , the eldest , is the sad-looking , six-foot , sixtyish spinster now renowned for her exotic garb , her exotic prose , her " glittering plinths of jacynth " poetry . The elder son and successor to the title is Osbert : traveler , memoirist , novelist , literary crony of the King &; Queen . The younger son is Sacheverell , amateur of baroque art , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vol . II of Osbert 's autobiography , covering the period of his seventh to 17th years ( 1899-1909 ) . Like Left Hand , Right Hand ! ( TIME , May 15 , 1944 ) , it is a combination of acute filial impiety , antique sentence structure and genuine literary skill . If anyone else had dared publish half its secrets , the Sitwell trio would have screamed with rage , summoned their solicitors and sued with a vengeance. * As it is , The Scarlet Tree is by no means the spectacular Sitwell history that may some day be written , but it is a family album with portraits in the best Sitwell style , and a precious , corrosive , amusing record of a swaddled &; sheltered Victorian-Edwardian childhood . <P> The Little Sitwells . That childhood was so sheltered , so beset with nurses , governesses , tutors and eccentric relatives , that it is no wonder the three little Sitwells , grown up , confuse heredity- " that fragile scarlet tree we all carry within us " - with an extraordinary environment . Edith as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nose-shaper , and was forced to swing herself dizzy on rings and parallel bars . <P> Sir George , when not off resting in Italy or planning new marble fountains for the Sitwell estate in Derbyshire , would give Osbert earnest paternal lectures : " Unless you learn to play ping-pong properly , you can never hope to be a Leader of Men . " Sacheverell was ruled by governesses and tutors to within an inch of his life . At four he was examining the architecture of Kensington Palace ; at ten he was writing letters about Umbrian vases , Turkish armor , Stone Age remains . <P> Sousa on the Stomach . Sacheverell looked , says his brother , much as Henry VIII must have looked as a child : " broad face , green eyes and tawny hair . " Edith was already " gothic " in aspect , gawky , nervous , dressed in expensive but " disfiguring " garments . She was nagged eternally by her mother , who was " always cruelly finding fault with her in front of other people . " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vomited on hearing John Philip Sousa conduct his brass band in London 's Albert Hall .
