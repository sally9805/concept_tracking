The fortitude of the 38% of Australian population who have weathered 14 drouths in 56 years , can best be illustrated by a true story . ? A stranger rode into a cattle station far out on a drouth-stricken range where scrub trees stood on their bare roots man-high in the air , while the wind blown sand filled the dry water tanks and banked against outbuildings . Clouds were gathering . A bearded weatherworn man and a young boy came out of the house to greet him . " Looks like rain , " remarked the traveler , " That ought to please you . " " Well , I 've got used to the drouth , but I wish it would , for my little boy 's sake . " " Why for the - - boy 's sake ? " asked the stranger , puzzled . " ' Cause he 's never yet seen it rain .

" " Seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waterings so great , far out in the interior , that even the 1200 mile long government maintained stock routes have not penetrated areas as large as the Argentine Pampas . Although the magnitude of cattle station operations of Kidman days has passed , there still exist individual holdings in the Kimberley and North Queensland of 25 to 30 thousand head where it takes from four to six months to round-up the ranges ? ranches as large in area as from Los Angeles to Bakersfield , spread-out from Santa Barbara to Mohave.  | Even as late as 1.927-30 , Sydney Kidman controlled 107,023 square miles of Australian stations . During that drouth period , he lost 6000 horses ; 100,000 sheep and 120,000 cattle valued at $7,500,000 . Faith in a country and fortitude to stay with a treacherous investment , after losing 35,000 head in 1902-03 ; 85,000 in the drouth of 1914-18 , leaves Sir Sydney Kidman as an outstanding example of the character of men who have made Australia . Their gambling instinct against odds , is self evident , where 120,000 of them congregate at the Melbourne Cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they play their favorites , taking their losses with a smile . ON THE SCARRED face of this age-old continent , are promiscuous welts which once were towering mountains that Father Time had disintegrated with tools of wind , torrents and erosion , depositing the debris on the huge salty blotches that were once inland seas of fresh water . Intermittent creases are but the remnant of ancient rivers silted , dammed and covered in the leveling process of time . Mineral salts , freed in the milling , preserved in its briny salt lakes and plains , the prehistoric life that graces the museums of Australia today . Nature then spread a cool covering of trees , shrubs , grass and flowers to protect the raw earth-flesh from the sun , and with her mothering hands , sprinkled the vegetation with sky dews . While mother nature was nursing Australia 's new topography , there crept out from caves and crevices , the lesser animal life that had escaped the transformation . Birds , beasts and black men known no where else in the whole world . Plants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land as new resources for mankind . So , the civilized white man found Australia . This is the interlude picture formed on the mindscreen from library reading , museums , zoos , and a personal survey from Sydney to Perth . The reels that follow unfold the glamour and romance , daring and adventure , tragedy and conquest , incident to the development of the livestock industry , as it is today in Australia . That innate desire in man 's heart to be the first to try the new , to be a leader rather than a drag , to be the finder , explorer and developer of new grass ranges hid far back in Never-Never Land where only wild men lived , drew a quota of hardy virile men of English , Irish and Scotch stock . Innoculated with a similar ambition to the grizzled prospector in search of gold and silver , these pioneers of the frontier cast their lives with fate in the quest for water and feed . Rough trails , not unlike the windings of water courses , came into existence , through reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim tracks , there trickled small bunches of breeding stock to be planted on the oases spotting the great inland , like small islands in the sea . Water , feed and freedom , the three main factors of fecundity , made the stock multiply like flies . The parent stock grew into lowing contented herds with bellowing , bluffing bulls each heralding his reign in a specific kingdom . Unhampered by disease , full paunched , each-dayfattened-steers lounged in contentment , chewing cuds of juicy , free feed . Through them , came the pioneer 's reward for his sacrifice of the " abundant life " of the  | cities . Herds of fat steers back-tracked their grand-sires , while their owners visioned larger trail-herds and better cattle from the profits invested in better bulls . Dim tracks grew into broad stock routes , each year reaching deeper into the livestock haven . Stockmen , on the outskirts of habitation , measured their potential financial losses in not having sufficient stock to use the virgin feed . Twenty thousand head were on.the trails for two years before reaching North Queensland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and horses had broken the trail , to divide the responsibility with the defenseles calves , of feeding the wild Dingo.t At the height of this pastoral prosperity , the heavens went on a strike and refused to deliver rain . Intermittent rivers ceased to function . Permanent water holes dried up . Millions of livestock bawled and bleated from parched throats . Feed shriveled to the roots to be whipped loose by angry winds and tramped into tinder by thirstmad thousands . Owners were helpless to escape the catastrophe with stock-route waterings of the long desert stretches wiped off the map . Billibongs* and bogholes were plastered with stinking carcasses where dingos and birds of prey held carnival feasts . Before rain again wet the parched land , it had been refertilized by the putrid herds of the brave pioneers . Nature had challenged man 's ingenuity with her meteorological prank , in this new land of opportunity . The t " Ausies " tackled the stock water problem through their highest and most efficient agency ? the government . When the heavens began again to make rain de-Footnote  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurance of continued service was given the freeholder . Therefor they must prepare for an un-rainy day . Geologists showed that the clouds had been delivering water for untold centuries in quantities that had produced rivers navigable in other countries . Where had it gone ? It must be stored . I f needed water would not come continuously from above , the undaunted Ausie decided he would prospect for it from below . So the government found its first artesian water in 1885 at 1600 feet deep . This discovery of underground water opened up new range areas and resurrected those denuded by the drouth . Artesian belts of a million acres were tapped by bores , more than half of the area being in the rich grass lands of Queensland . Along the stock routes that served in lieu of railroads the government sank wells at convenient drives where huge tanks conserved the flow and long troughs of clear water quenched the thirst of dusty , famished herds . Eight thousand , four hundred wells ? some flowing , some pumped , some brackish , some hot , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her economic income . With the assurance of a reliable water supply along the stock routes , new blood and new capital flowed into the " back o ' beyond . " Now , droves of stock sheep that could produce 120% increase a year , snailed their way inland via convenient government water stations , to usurp the best watered ranges , forcing the cattle to distant feed . The productiveness of the country and the fecundity of the stock , with seasonable rains feeding the willing rich soil that veneered sand and claypan , soon restocked the range . Dormant grass seeds , stock-brush and mulga ,  | responding intuitively to nature 's caresses of sunhine and rain , again clothed the naked earth with a carpet of green . Jarrah , Leopold and mypoll trees , whose posts will last a lifetime , put on fresh foliage , where the lyrebird mimicked the deserts sounds and the bower bird built its play house , while the kookaburra or laughing jackass ridiculed with his idiotic laughter . Wambats , wallabies , kangaroos and the 5 foot high emu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the few that had survived its ravages , began to show up more plentiful in their favored haunts . Down on the east coast , some years gone by , a fence burned down that held rabbits which the owner had imported for domestic use , as rabbits were unknown in Australia . A few escaped into the brush . Now , 1000 miles inland , their progeny were mingling with the native wild life , and one pair will have a litter every three months , who in turn propagate . A composite word-picture of an Australian drouth embodying the fourteen since 1880 , is mild to those outstanding ones of 1902-3 ; the World War period ; and that of 1927-30 . During the years following 1902 , one million cattle and fifteen million sheep perished in Australian drouth stricken districts . Notwithstanding his chain of stations reaching from North Queensland to New South Wales with the drouth creeping down from the north , driving the fittest before it like a slow consuming fire , Kidman lost 85,000 head of cattle in the World War drouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle had to trail out from them 15 miles to scant feed where they  | would stay two days . After returning to water , when they again attempted the trip to feed , mime miles was as far as they could reach , which meant the end , for from there back to water , the range was bare as a floor . The drouth of 1927-30 combatted men who had enlisted all the help of modern science and machinery , combined with lessons learned from previous drouths , leading back to the eighties . Concentrated stock foods , trucks , artesian wells , modern packing plants to absorb forced liquidation of livestock , were factors that helped to conserve , but other agencies of destruction crept into the industry that were cutting tap roots while investors were treating the limbs ? absorbed in the effect , but blind to the cause . During each of the preceding drouths , Mother Nature had been relieved of her clothing with nothing replaced in times of prosperity . Her generosity was repaid with greed ; timber denuded for fence posts ; mulga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one station employing 30 men for two consecutive years ) ; overstocking of ranges , 450,000 sheep on one holding . When the feed reached the stage of growth of production equaling the grazed consumption , millions of sharp hoofs chiseled the sod into sawdust consistency . The next desecration was to grub out the roots . All the while that the range manipulators were engrossed in their own individual herds of horses , cattle and sheep , taking all they could eke from the overworked ranges and putting nothing back in its place , an unclaimed horde ranged at will , consuming 25% of the forage , and the rabbits multiplied faster than sheep .  | Three hundred and fifty million acres of this inland empire could claim no permanent flowing streams at elevations from 1000 to 2000 feet where the average rainfall was as low as 6% inches a year . The boring of a well was a heavy expense but when rightly linked to surface waterholes on a range , it was possible to control a 100 , - 000 acre range by conserving the feed within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carrying capacity of the range decreased , due primarily to overstocking , but further abated by the slaughter of the mulga through human agencies , and ring-barking rabbits which even stripped sprouts that sprung up in the wake of the ruthless axe . Myriads of hoof-prints on " sheeped-out " ranges not only disced the dry earth into powder but they laid out paralleling thin trails down which coursed surface water in freshet rains that gave land 's worst enemy , erosion , a foothold for all time . The lacerated skin of the earth , like that of man , takes time , care and patience to heal . Denied lateral support , it crumbles , disintegrates , to be whisked away in powdered dust by every transient wind . Through grass-roots , nature protects the land and recuperates her soil . They are the delicate nerves that give the earth-skin a healthy glow . Broken down , nothing short of a. long rest period will heal the wounds . Man 's new " dust bowl " east of the Rockies , shows that the dry-lander may be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Australia 's repeating drouths consistently reduced the carrying capacity of its stock range , first 20% then  | 40% , advancing in its ratio until some stations lost 60% of their efficiency , while others were put on five year rest periods and some entirely abandoned . The first bushman to locate on these abandoned stations a life-time ago , found a winding stream-bed where floods had left deep waterholes , and long treelined lagoons with waving stock-feed sodded up to their banks . Reaching back to the distant sand-ridges were plains and mesas of Mitchell , Flinders , bundle-bundle and many varieties of grasses blending into the blue , salt and cotton bush , topped by the taller mulga . From the first location of this cow-haven down through the tragic years the story had been one of its desecration by man , beasts , rodents and the elements . Man 's temporary needs slaughtered the tree-life ; his greed , the sod . Cycles of rabbit hordes alternated or combined with 14 drouths to complete the dismal picture . In Queensland alone ? which is larger than any country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than the state of Kansas . First to disappear from the pastoral landscape , were the native trees so wisely distributed by nature as shade and shelter . Gradually the axe ate them down for fence posts , corrals , crude houses , until a protracted drouth demanded the sacrifice of the remainder , to feed starving sheep and cattle with the tender branches . With the coming of the rains , nature 's innate resistance threw up succulent sprouts to reforest the land , but close-cropping sheep and ring-barking , ravaging rabbit hordes refuted her efforts . Like the bleak ragged ridges and mesas of our wes-  | tern range states , only weather-worn stumps mark the cemetery of nature 's departed beauty . The next to fall to man 's greed was the sod where the hungry flocks grubbed it down to the ground then disced it out with their hoofs , while millions of rodent teeth cut out the roots below . Robbed of its clothing of brush , trees and grass , a merciless drouth-sun sapped the thirsty earth of its scant moisture leaving its powdered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridges and mesas across the lowlands , persistent winds gathered sand and silt and powdered dust into red , yellow and grey clouds that fogged the sun and hid landmarks . Wind-power was engaged in an immeasurable leveling project that carried the lightest of its load as far as 700 miles . Following each of these heavy blows , the stationhands discovered that even permanent waterholes were more shallow from both above and below ? evaporation , and silting that sealed the ground waters from coming to the surface . Then surface waterings dried up , framed in wool and hide of mired stock that died in the silt . Even when the flood came after a drouth siege , the havoc of wind , hoofs and rabbits had created a condition , leading to disaster . Torrential rains cut great gashes in the unprotected land , rolling muddy silt-laden torrents into the nowshallow waterholes leveling them with debris and carcasses of perished stock , burying for all time the living water . The drouth-winds had built sand-ridges across  | dry stream beds that served as checks so high that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand ridges wind-gaps broke through where the currents whittled out passes , leaving trees standing man-high on bare roots , while down in dry stream beds horses dug holes four feet deep with their pawing hoofs ( where they knew water once existed ) sucking the scant seepage to hold on to life . The thin top soil that had accrued through the decayed vegetation of ages , melted into the sheep trails that grew into eroded gullies as the unfettered storm waters cut their way to the lowlands . Blown or washed off the claypan lands , it left a seared scar where vegetation would root no more . The time eventually came with extended drouths and drifting sands working off-shifts with erosion , when the old stream beds were filled-up level with the banks , forcing succeeding waters to find new channels . In a man 's lifetime the pastoral haven had retrogressed to a desert waste of claypan and sand dunes , where the only living things were crows and dingos that had survived on the carnage . ( Let us hope that the Taylor Range Bill will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the dry farming craze started so well on the way . ) PESTS : ? With the early settlement of Australia also came the diseases and pests of mankind to harass human and animal life in the new land . The diversity of the country in climate and topography ; the immensity of areas only inhabited by the wild Aborigines who kept no records of time and its hap-  | penings ; scarcity of water over trackless wastes ; no navigable rivers as a means of transportation inland : were conditions that left the early explorer on his own selfreliance . Inland districts were so inhospitable that even whole expeditions were lost , leaving no trace of their fate . Lone prospectors ventured in , never to return . Into this great unknown wandered a few rabbits and rats from the colonized coast line to swarm back in later years like bats from the Carlsbad Caves . Rabbit scourges became a national menace costing the government unknown millions to combat . Rat hordes came out of this wilderness to eat dogs and cats , gnaw animal legs and devour saddles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning found only the iron attachments to mark their resting-place . Burned , battered and scarred , from sun , wind and erosion , there followed in the wake of these enemies of vegetation a new imported curse which crept into the best grass land , building a barrier to man and beast as it spread . As the Russian Thistle seeded over our tramped-out western range , so spread the prickly pear or tree cactus in the heart of the Australian grazing land . It gloried in the bleaching sun and dared the twisting winds to wreck its foliage . Man 's greed had stripped Mother Nature of her verdure suit of soft sod and grass and shrubs , then left her to the fury of the elements . Attributed to " have a cure for every ill " the wise old dame put on a thick robe of spines and thorns hung with yellow and red flowers that fruited into pink jewels with the seasons . Beneath , the.earth-skin began to heal . Grass-roots  | found a footing . Decayed vegetation enriched the soil . Erosion struck a barrier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to old Mother Earth . Within the labyrinth of this spined fortress , wild birds found a retreat to lay their eggs and rear their young , safe from hawks and eagles , wild-cats and the fierce dingo . Even the slithering snakes dared not venture in . Each year the stockman found this barrier throwing out a new line of defense into his territory not unlike barbed-wire entanglements that sprang up in the night to enlarge No Man 's Land . Again he appealed to the efficiency and the finances of his government to save him from the spined leprosy that was spreading over his land . For his greedy eyes had spied the matted grass protected from his sheep by spined sentinels that let sunshine and rain filter in , but kept his hungry flocks without . Then came the entomologist , and through his scientific knowledge of insect life , sought an antidote for nature 's cunning . Soon the cactus forest found strangers in their midst . Two ? a male and a female by the name of cochineal ; tiny insects that bred like flies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spine to find a nest for its myriads of eggs . Like yellow fever germs that board a new ship in the morning and leave it crewless by night , so deadly were the pyrolid and cochineal immigrants that but two placed on a cactus tree melted it to dust . Through the agency of these two small insects , the cactus forests of Australia are blending to the plain again . In the native gastrolobium plant , three feet high  | with oval leaves one-half by two and one-half inches , the Australian stockman found an enemy more deadly to livestock than the rattlesnake is to man . Scattered promiscuously over the vast ranges and along the stock routes , this plant of deadly poison has taken its toll from the days of camel caravans down through the years to the present day , for one leaf will kill a camel or a cow . Unlike the rattlesnake , it lurks beside the trail to tempt a hungry beast , giving no warning of its fatal presence . Throughout the vegetable kingdom of the world , are found plants that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Virginia fly-trap that tempts an insect into its bowl , then trips a trap door . However , Australia comes forth with the crowsfoot or screw-weed that surpasses them all . The seed pod , two inches long , is equipped with screw thread on one end that will rotate through a sheep 's pelt until it reaches the inner flesh , where it gets its nutrition from the blood capillary system . The back of a sheep 's carcass has the appearance of having received a load of bird-shot while the sheep-pelt is punctured into a sieve . These seed pods will lie dormant on the ground through drouth but any moisture that touches them will bring the two inch straws to life . Three mothlike wings 1% inches long unfold from the stem and start rotating until the screw takes hold in the soil . I n ten minutes time the pod stands upright with the screw end imbedded in the earth ready to germinate roots . This pest is the horror of the sheepmen , as it ruins the pelt and is fatal to its owner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steer off the interior ranges of Australia weighs seven hundred lbs. , on the office wall of the Watkins Meat Company of Melbourne , hangs a photograph of a six year old roan Durham steer that weighed twenty-eight hundred and forty lbs. , and dressed eighteen hundred and twenty lbs .. as an example of what can be grown on its grasses . RECORD COW . I n their tardy start for a world record , in the annals of livestock competition , New South Wales sprung a surprise when they produced " Melba Fifteen " a Durham milch cow who gave thirty two thousand five hundred and twenty-two lbs . of milk , which contained one thousand six hundred and fourteen lbs . of butter fat , in twelve months . The fact that one sixth of Australia 's cattle are in the hands of the stock-farmer being bred for milk products , accounts for the tall figures of 226 , - 000,000 lbs . of butter exported each year . HORSES . They raise a good horse in Australia and his tenure of service seems long-lived for Australia has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be an anniversary day when one of its deep water-bores strikes an oil strata . Now , unlimited brown coal serves as industrial fuel . Figures sometimes make strange facts . With our dethroned horses , due to motorized farms , the U.S. still has more horses than Australia and Argentine combined : United States ? 11,637,000 ; Australia and Argentine ? 11,622,641 . Long freight teams of oxen and horses drag the wool clip along the sandy tracks where the auto would bury its wheels . When the rainy season comes on , the  | teams become marooned where they happen to be caught . The bottom goes out of the roads . There 's horse lore in the Ausie . The whole population are race fans . A national institution that embodies all of the enthusiasm that we combine in baseball , football , horse racing and the speculation of the Stock Exchange included . Its the universal sport of both sexes with the Melbourne Cup Day heading the social calendar of the year . Busy businessmen of Brisbane fly down and return at night . The isolated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole check , the scrubwoman her last six-pence on the result of the Cup Race . If you wish to contact an Ausie , just ask him some horse-history question . Seeing that you are an uninformed American , he comes back at you with his lovable smile and you get the whole history , like reading a book . Show interest ? and he will take you back to Carbine the " George Washington " of Australia 's horse history , who in 1890 made the mile in 1:42 and the two miles in 3:28% . Then comes the wonder horse ? Phar Lap ? . " Have you seen him ? " he inquires eagerly . Should your answer be " no " , he will go on . " Do n't miss it . He is up in the museum mounted under glass . A sorrel over 17 hands high whose long sloping shoulders crowd his weather to the middle of his back . " Then in a tender voice of affection , " That horse had a human brain and pride ! When they rode him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would prick his ears forward , raise his head high and look the cheering crowd over , enjoying the applause like a matador who had just killed a bull . While  | the Trump , the little light bay that just won the cup and came in next to last today , does n't know what its all about . " Unfortunately for the Ausies pride , Carbine and Phar Lap were both foaled in New Zealand . The sodded racetrack and steeplechase races ? the bookies by the hundreds on soap boxes calling their odds , are engrossing features of an Australian race course . Features of Australia not directly connected with the live-stock industry , but nevertheless interesting to one in the mood to see the country , are a few of the following : GOLD . " Gold is where you find it " holds as true in Australia as in South Africa where the famous Johannesburg Reef was found on the rolling prairies . Contrary to the supposition of the average layman who looks for massive mountains , towering rock cliffs , or gouged-out gorges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in unexpected places like the mulga flats of Coolgardie and the grassy rolling hills of Bendigo . From its mines has come a unique gold in accordance with other strange things in Australia . The Australian gold has a different color from other continents ; a lighter richer yellow . The " Welcome Nugget " weighed two thousand , two hundred and seventeen oz. or nearly one hundred and eighty four lbs , while the " Welcome Stranger " still larger was worth fifty thousand dollars , but the largest found , the " Holterman Nugget " weighed six hundred and thirty lbs . It came from New South Wales .  | TREES . Peculiarly Australian are the acacia , over four hundred varieties of the " gum " or eucalyptus ; the jarrah that is immune to the white or termite ant ; lignum vita so heavy that it sinks in water like a stone , while now comes word of an Australian tree that is taller than the sequoia . But the greatest curiosity of life in Australia is the platypus that looks like a bird having a duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and tail , that lays eggs and suckles its young . In the Botanical Gardens in Melbourne those things indigenous to Australia are collected in floral , arboreal and water life , where the tourist may see them collectively instead of traveling over the vast continent , as the climate of Melbourne is very temperate and snow is unknown . There is a fascination about the country and its people that lingers on , long after details of other places have slipped the mind . SHEEP . The importance of the sheep industry to Australia can best be appreciated when it is known that they furnish one-fourth of the world 's wool , while the commonwealth and its island neighbor , New Zealand , have more sheep than the combined holdings of South Africa , the United States and the Argentine . ( The fact that the Argentine has five million more sheep than cattle , makes it a world factor on wool markets . ) To reach an 8% lb. fleece as an average for all Australia it has taken half a century of good breeding jealously guarded , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merino stud stock . " Old David " ; a  | merino ram , cost $25,000 , to help produce a fleece that had seven suits of clothes in it . It is difficult to conceive of one commodity like wool constituting one fifth of the national income of a country the size of Australia , and having one third of its population in some way tied to the sheep industry . Loyalty to the sheep and wool industry can be no better exemplified than by Ausies , who wear its product in the day time and sleep on wool pillows at night ; feed England its neat mutton and eat the " cheesey gland " ones at home . These gland abscesses are more prevalent in sheep that have been sheared , so " roast lamb " is far more appetizing on an Australian bill of fare , after you have once seen a " cheesey mutton . " This abscess is found to be more prevalent where the wool grows short , or in the pelt 's wrinkle , where the rapid shearer nips the pelt with his shears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shearing work , but when the operator begins to strive for the 245 head record , those sheep become potential " cheesies " from the clips taken out of their pelts . Burs , or any laceration of the flesh starts this abscess which grows with the sheep . Nature hedges it in with a tissue holder , similar to cheesecloth on a cheese . Export inspectors condemn those afflicted . This lump is cut out but the carcass is used in local consumption . Nine out of ten served on the home market are of the export cutback . While cattle made it possible for sheep to occupy the new ranges of Australia , it has been an ungrateful legacy . The quicker returns on sheep due to early maturity date , with wool and mutton incomes each year , has  | resulted in eight sheep to one cow as the ratio today . This ratio will increase when a sheepman can reap $8.00 profit from an ewe in ten months through a lamb and a fleece . This monetary return on a smaller investment in less time , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eighth of Australia , there to fight black men , climate , crocodiles and fever . Over in the Kimberley district , it crowds a cattleman to make a $ 12.00 profit on a six year old steer . It 's a far cry from the early days when Momba Station , New South Wales carried 450,000 head of sheep , where today the average sheepran 's holding is 5000 head . In order for an American from our West , to form an opinion of the opportunity for cattle ranging on the vast areas of Australia , one has the Government Bulletins and statistics as a foundation . In accord with the Ausie 's national characteristic frankness , the agricultural and livestock agents , cattle buyers and inspectors , give gladly of their time , data and experience . Their splendid libraries afford books of local and authentic writers who have vividly recorded the history of the conquest of the pastoral wealth from the aboriginal wilderness . Through them a panoramic picture grows before the mind , showing the hardships , privations , self denial and sacrifices endured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drouths and floods ; wind and scourges , the pioneer 's inland progression . While the interior salt marshes are yielding to science the skeletons of previously unknown sloths , ten  | feet high , waterless deserts are bleaching the bones of pioneer Bushmen who ventured in never to return . There are records of whole herds of steers following receding rains so far out into the vast desert sandhills until they perished for want of permanent water ; of early exploring expeditions completely lost without a revealing clue of their fate . These are samples of the reading to be found in the Australian libraries . However , actual contact with the riders , and owners of the cattle stations in operation today , brings one upto-date with the Bushman 's woes . Customs of the range , laws that govern them , hired help and equipment , cost of production and markets , poison feed and diseases , are important factors that enter into the every-day life of the Bushman that are more interesting to a prospective investor .

I n considering an industry as important as the livestock industry in a country as large as Australia , one could devote an entire book to the subject , so in this " once over " are assembled only facts , figures , and impressions similar to evidence submitted to a jury . Major conclusions can be summed-up in the following .. The ratio of sheep to cattle will increase with the years , due to more profit , less time , smaller investment . 2 . Drouths , erosion and pests have marked the ranges for all time . Sand dunes and dust bowls exist on  | vaster areas and more serious than those in the United States . 3 . Lack of a close profitable market will suppress cattle raising in the Kimberley. 4. 12,000 miles to England ( a month and a half on water ) embarrasses the chilled-beef market . 5 .

No over-populated-scare to force inland development in a changing world intent on the " more abundant life . " Australia , larger than the United States , has sixty-two percent of six and a half million population living in the city environments . POPULATION . With all its many intriguing features spread for 3100 miles from Sydney to Perth on the west coast , there is no characteristic of Australia that is as interesting as its people . Isolated for a century from the mother tongue , with no less than 8000 miles of salt water between , an enviable white race have added their prestige to the Caucasian branch of the human family .

For a vacation ( holiday ) away from the strenuous life of the Bush , the State of Victoria offers a congenial playground . Not unlike Southern California in topography it enjoys all the variety of products and amusements conducive to vacation-time .

The short , stout , round-faced , even-featured , lymphatic species of more recent immigration from the British Isles , predominates in the more menial walks of life , oftimes  | with a Cockney dialect . This type use a soft " a " and " o " speaking rapidly in a high tone , making it very difficult to understand them until your ear becomes accustomed to the voice and inflection . For staying , they say " styne " ; rain ? ryne . The other type that predominates is tall with keen eyes and sharp features . The full cupid lips are cast in a hidden smile that bespeaks conviviality . Their mouth is not a gash which spreads to a grin when amused , but an organ of chiseled beauty that intuitively interprets their five senses ; expressive eyes , prominent chin , healthy athletic bodies , glowing complexions which the changing climate breeds , are factors that brand the Ausie as a super-race . The sidewalks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ route from " here ? there " as each pedestrian seems to have a destination in mind . Straightbacked and chin high , their sprightly steps show that they are living in a world which they like . They are the generations that followed the early pioneers , who have taken the raw material of a new land and converted it into orange groves and farm lands , factories and smelters , have dredged harbors and built beautiful cities on their shores . On their clean , busy streets , there is no foreign huckster 's cry , nor babble of alien tongues ; no sidewalk solicitors to harangue you into their shops , or taxi drivers who hound your footsteps ? no yellow , brown or black men . Why ? Because the Ausie does not allow any one but a white man to land on their wharfs . Their slogan is " WHITE AUSTRALIA . " Where the thermometer registers 130 degrees in  | North Queensland , white men garner the cotton and sugar cane crops . Mother Nature shows her influence in moulding the character of the Ausie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scotch , Irish and English blood divorced from caste and title , she taught in her school of experience that ability and not heritage , worth and not wealth , made the man . According to their mentality and thrift , white men found their place in society without surrendering gentility in servitude . Talent , self-reliance and resourcefulness found an open road to ambition with the raw material of Australia at their command , where no formula had yet been written to convert the natural resources to wealth . Climate and seasons were reversed : flora and fauna were mostly strange and unknown in the British Isles , the home of their fathers : an open field for the ingenuity and research of free white men to explore . Out of this freedom grew a psychology of life peculiar to Australians . " When Nature wants to make a man , And tame a man , And fame a man , She sets a challenge for his spirit , Draws it higher when lie 's near it ? Makes the jungle , that he clear it ; Makes the desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So doth Nature make a man . " - MORGAN  | PERSONALITY . Australian history is adorned with the names of men who found fame in nature 's hard school , through hardships and self denial , drouths and depressions , that tempered their wills to accept no defeat . It is a rich , rare brand of pride when a genteel lady can scrub a cafe floor on her knees and show no humiliation ; a waiter tip gives offense and suggests servitude ; and no Australian blacks another man 's shoes . " Let no man beat you being clever , " must be the Ausies Golden Rule when four " thank yous " pass over the counter in buying and selling a package of cigarettes . The Ausie is known as " a hard drinker and good gambler " but he packs his liquor well , never forgetting to be a gentleman . Add to this , a man of quick decision , both courteous and obliging , who considers it a personal compliment when you patronize his business , with no thought of " high-pressure " salesmanship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one ever tried to sell me anything ! I had to sell myself , " was a friend 's version of their personality . Bushman hospitality makes you feel you have been adopted into the family . Far out in the livestock kingdom , they grow hungry for contact with the outside world . Hospitality in cow-land holds in all climes . WOMEN . One of the greatest revelations of Australia are the women . They hold an economic philosophy that courts no perquisite by reason of sex . Women stand on an equality with men in business . They take men 's jobs asking no favors , without surrendering their feminine charm .  | Bar-matrons and bar-maids challenge the " hunting instinct " of the male which leaves a bartender polishing glasses , while the " women-run " institution is rushed to keep steins full . Under certain conditions , bar-maids are licensed for life , so a grey-haired waitress in the publounge is not uncommon , while the wrinkled jeweldecked matron who presides over the cash-register , has lived beyond her three score and ten .

Only hotels are licensed for sale of liquor , where bedrooms off of foyers became bars . Kalgoorlie and Perth have red-light districts that smack some of our Old West , but the denisons are white . All of the hotels we stopped at in Australia were in the hands of women who showed efficiency in catering to the traveling public . They foster a genteel frankness that is fascinating to a foreigner . Courteous without a menial effect ; obliging through sincere interest ; entertaining with the personality peculiar to their sex ; complacency bereft of haughtiness , establishes a comradeship without effort . The last hotel at which we stopped in Australia had 82 guest rooms ; was managed by three girls from 19 to 26 years of age . There the waitresses were also the chambermaids , handling efficiently the two roles . ( The rate was optional according to the American or European plan ) .

Your cup of tea was placed at your bedside as she backed out with a smile .  | THE BUSHMAN " DOWN UNDER " in the overgrown island that claims 800 sections in area more than the United States , is a Union of men , known as the Bushmen . In their parlance he is our " cobber " ( partner ) in the handling of livestock on the range ; a contemporary of the vaquero , the cowboy and the gaucho . A pianist is a musician , so is a violinist , but each has his special technique ? they are men who have a genius for music . Likewise with men who follow the range as a livelihood in all countries where cattle are raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each has devised means and measures , and a language peculiar to his environment . As rhythm and time are common to all musicians ? the foundation of their art which music demands to perpetuate its existence ? so does the contact with nature in the raw on the ranges demand adherence to certain fundamentals of character . The wide open spaces intuitively breed a code in a man 's heart ? freedom of action and thought , where he rules a small kingdom all his own , builds for individuality . Nature is the architect . Frills are left off . Pretense and sham are tabooed . Nature wears no veneer . Schooled in first-hand problems to be solved by self-reliance and resourcefulness , fostering courage and tolerance , generosity is the natural outcome of isolation where penurious dealings have no market . Obligations have enhanced values where neighbors  | are scarce and a friend is a fortune . The joy of giving obliterates the money value of the gift . It comes from the heart without appraisal . The loyalty of the range men of all cattle countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friendly acts , respected obligations , a keen sense of right and wrong , and justice . Wherever you go throughout the immense distances of Australia , in the cities , hamlets or farms , the reputation of the Bushman holds to the code written in the hearts of men of the wide-open spaces of all climes . The technique of the Bushman differs widely from that of the Americas . The foundation stock came from a different temperament , their range language from a different root . Spaniards first landed cattle on North America in Mexico and later on the pampas while Governor Phillips landed seven head in Australia nearly three centuries later . So , was born the Bushman of British stock to inaugurate the herdsman 's technique , and establish for all time , names , terms and expressions ; equipment , methods and customs ; frugality , thrift and moneymindedness ; all different from the carefree , reckless , temperamental Spaniard , playing to the limelight with cattle as a pawn , while the sturdy British and Scotch held the pound note as the ultimate goal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a fundamental meaning forming a range language noticeably deficient in idioms . The Scotch herdsman transplanted his terms and phrases in the new soil of unlimited areas to be adapted as the range language of immense holdings . A paddock  | grew into a pasture of a possible 1000 sq . miles ; a herd of steer became a mob of bullocks ; a corral ? a stockade ; cow-ranch  --  a cattle station ; the home ranch ? the homestead ; roundup ? cattle muster ; cow-trail ? a pad ; town ? a township ; saddle-horse equipment ? the gear ; pack outfit ? the plant ; bill-of-sale ? receipt ; bread ? tucker ; talltales  --  gibber ; teapot ? billy ; blanket-role ? swag ; partner  --  cobber . Mulga , mallee , quandong , joey , billabong , balmy , shandrydan , gin , lubra , brumby , micky , coloabah ? are but a few other terms that a cow-puncher must learn on the great stations of Australia . Colloquial terms vary in its diversified ranges scattered over an area larger than the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Commonwealth . In the early days , the cattle king 's exploitation of the new livestock heaven , over-stocking , rat and rabbit scourges , drouth , wind and erosion , devastated many of the vast ranges . Cattle ranches of 40,000 to 100,000 head and sheep stations of 450,000 head with markets 600 to 2000 miles away by trail , were not uncommon . The handling and trailing of these vast herds over mulga brush and desert sand , through wet seasons and extended drouths , with the heavens for a covering and Mother Earth a bed , a man of iron was born into the cow fraternity to be christened the Bushman . The topography of Australia had much to do in developing his technique . Having only one river of any length or volume of water and it only navigable for a short season , left the geography of the immense area streaked with mountain barriers , chains of sandhills , barren deserts , salt lakes and claypan . These , with a  | universal shortage of reliable stock water , cut grass and brush feeding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where individuality reigned and where nature 's barriers served as fences . One hundred thousand head of cattle all in one brand with the market 2,000 miles away via trail and boat ; food supplies and wearing apparel hauled in once a year in some instances costing 10c a pound for delivery ; 400-600 miles to a Doctor ; the dingo ( Australian wolf ) and the wild black men , ( who ate plump young girls as a relish to the white man 's beef ) reckoned in the budget ; marooned in wet spells ; starved-out in seven years drouth ; bleached human skeletons on the deserts ; mushroom graveyards in malaria districts ; rat hordes that covered the land like locusts ; rabbit scourges that ate the grass , dug up the roots and ring-barked the trees , leaving the fertile land to join-up with the adjacent desert ? are a few of the courses which the Australian Bushman took in Life 's school . And still ? having graduated from this category of vicissitudes , ? he greets you with clear eye , firm grip and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tells you the thought of the dole has never entered his heart with that big , back country of hidden resources yet to conquer . The Bushman still clings to the muly saddle introduced from the Fatherland . Roping on the range belongs to the Americas and he will not imitate . " A bulldogger " is weak in the head ? the trusted stock whip brings cattle to the stockade ( corral ) where the " broncho " does the work in hand . The Bushman 's rope horse wears a collar . His " snubbing post " is an exclusive Australian institution  | where 60 branded calves an hour is a fair record . When a crew of seven men can brand a calf a minute , including the operation of the man with the knife , tolerance must gain new disciples from the vaquero , gaucho and cowboy . Through different methods , each arrives at the same conclusion in the same length of time . When the sides of a corral are not used two short panels of fence are built in the center of the corral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round poles for rails and double round posts at the intersection , thus leaving a slot between the center posts , one being shorter than the other , with the rails flush with the post 's top . With the lariat hooked to the " broncho 's " collar , the animal is roped around the head and the rope-horse is ridden behind the fence panel with the roper drawing the rope taut on the top rail which guides the head rope into the slot with the collared horse drawing the animals head up to the apex of the broad " A " shute , holding him there through collar power and friction on post until the off front and hind legs are roped . These ropes are dallied on the lower rails pulling the victim close to the panel when head-rope slack is quickly given by the horse , and the roped animal jerks backward automatically throwing himself , with the leg rope men snubbing the caught legs close to the rail . A " flanker " jumps on its head and helps in the earmarking process while the brander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and another broncho snakes in his victim . Big " mickies " ( mavericks ) oft-times put up a fight with ropes off , but this snubbing post is a real protection for men on the ground . Lubras , ( young black women )  | follow the branding crews and feast on the " Rocky Mountain Oysters " while the young aborigine help in the mustering and branding for their food and scant clothes . The " plant " is a product of the immense holdings and distances , where cow-camps are few and far between . A Bushman 's home moves with him on the four legs of a packhorse with a faithful dog as its guardian at lonely camps where wild aborigines might surprise them . The tea " billy " supplants the America 's coffee-pot . Tea is the universal drink and the introduction to Australian hospitality . The " gear " is an unpretentious outfit considering the life that the Bushman spends with it . It has sprouted a miniature swell-fork but no indication of a horn or pommel for a hand-hold , has yet appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muly . McClelland iron stirrups dangle on their straps like counterweights placed to balance the leather pad which serves as a saddle . Glue seems the only solution if the cowpuncher expects to stick in it . Saddle shops exhibit none of the stamped designs or silver-mounted frills and conchas that constitute the well-dressed of the elite of the western range and rodeos . Practiced Bushmen can cut the ashes off of a cigarette or crack a blue-fly on a drags ' horn , with his 16 ft. bullwhip , or use it as a substitute for fire-crackers on a holiday . Like all cattle countries , Australia has its small owner who preys on the big musters . A husky Scotchman was ' seeing the town " and taking his whiskey straight when he said . with a roguish smile and an eye  | twinkling in sunburnt surroundings : " I have one cow now 16 years old that has averaged two calves a year since she was born , and ithers not quite so good . " " How about the big mickies ? " " Nae , nae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raise them gentle and broad . " He has just sold 50 head of beef that would balance his budget for a year . He carried his liquor well , never ceasing to be a gentleman , the two prides of the real Australian Bushman . Seventy years have seen the rise and the decline of the Bushman 's paradise . Like the vaquero , cowboy and gaucho , he will soon be but a memory . His ever-present enemies ? sheep and man 's greed ? have crowded him to the semi-tropical northern eighth of the vast continent , where ticks , plura-pneumonia , walk-about disease , alligators and wild black aborigines. combined with prohibitive marketing conditions , will harass him to the end . Man 's greed has unbalanced nature , now too late to retrieve . Over-stocking of ranges , destruction of the mulga ( in one instance of 30 men being employed for two years in chopping down the mulga growth to keep livestock alive ) have invited the desecrator of beauty and natural resources to a protracted festival of destruction . Hot winds blew away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning sands exposed to erosion . Long established water holes and their fringe of trees were buried beyond recall . Their only virtue was in hiding the carcasses clustered there . When as high as 6076 of the carrying capacity of a range disappeared , the Bushman 's " heyday " had passed  | its zenith . Then , he began to live in memories . Memories of the days of opportunity when a shrewd Scotch boy ran away from home with five shillings as capital to become a Bushman and eventually the Australian cattle king , owning 100 Cattle Stations of 125,000 square miles , or larger area than the combined states of Kansas and Missouri , or the British Isles . Sadly , the romance and glamour , the song and story of the Spanish Grande does not pertain in the Bush , to establish the type for posterity .  | ANYONE HAVING a desire to investigate this sparsely settled continent , after having read the preceding pages , will save time and expense by directing their attention to Northeast Queensland . Larger than any country in Europe except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devoted to livestock . In this immense area , there are 350,000,000 acres without permanently flowing streams and ( on only 10% of it ) underground stock-water has been developed . Even then , permission must be obtained from the Government to sink a deep well . The bureaucracy of Australia is divided into 187 separate commissions which regulate every human activity with superfluous laws . Even a prospector must pay for a permit to hunt for hidden mineral wealth in the vast unsettled domain of Australia . Zealous laws to protect potential possessions suppress a free-hand in discovering possibilities . Lawmakers desiring to levy a tax at every opportunity , have reached a degree of efficiency found in few countries . On Queensland 's 670,500 square miles are close to 50% of the cattle of Australia . The Great Divide sweeping down in a crescent from Queensland 's northern peninsula toward Brisbane , holds back the endless plain of rolling grassy hills where contemporary cow-towns of Dodge City type still hold sway .  | The million people of Queensland ? spread north and south for 1300 miles ? have clung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the comforts of life , while 900 miles inland , the howling dingos serenade the lonely " jackaroos " serving their apprenticeship to some day become station managers . Carrying from 6% inches of rainfall a year in its southeast corner to 150 inches in the tropical north , intermediately we find a plain plateau country with from 15 to 30 inches of rain , and a mean temperature of 85 degrees summer ; 60 degrees winter and about ten varieties of stock grasses . The best of these grass lands at Winton are under sheep control , but north and west from there , authorities claim a worthwhile cattle country , presumably left to the cowman by reason of the depredations of the dingo on sheep . Winton grazing land is worth around $1.50 an acre . The richest grazing land and the largest pastoral town in Australia is claimed for Longreach , southeast of Winton with a population of 4000 . LONGREACH is surrounded by 36,000 square miles of rolling black soil plains that are the most consistent grass lands of Queensland , worth from $1.50 to $3.00 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it has become a great sheep center . CLONCURRY , about 150 miles northwest of Winton and 500 miles by rail from the seaport of Townsville , has a population of 2000 ; rainfall of 18.28 inches ; temperature 66 to 86 degrees .  | With a ratio of close to five sheep to one cow , the surrounding range offers as good an opening for a small cowman as is available , considering other desirable qualifications . Founded in 1880 , it had its first train in 1910 . Mining and livestock give the district dual income . It is the " wireless base " or mother station for the Treadle Radio Short-wave Transmitters , that is an Australian institution covering a 500 mile radius . This invention with a tread similar to a bicycle , enables the isolated stock stations to converse with each other , but its main claim to fame is the inception of the flying doctor who covers 20,000 miles a year from Cloncurry through calls sent in by this bicycle radio . Through the mother station messages can be relayed to other parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is 500 miles from a doctor , it is not long until a plane with a bed swoops down out of the sky , to take him to all the comforts of a city hospital . The flying doctor is within radio touch of the settlement , as far inland as Alice Springs in central Australia , and Birdville in the southwest corner of Queensland . Cloncurry , being the railroad center of short lines reaching inland , makes it an important shipping point for Townsville Port , or even Rockhampton , but for cattle destined to Sydney , a stock route winds its way for 1200 miles to the Metropolis . Trail herds still patronize the overland route . Burketown on the Gulf of Carpentaria , has a temperature of from 70 to 84 degrees , and a rainfall of 30 inches , that insures fine Flinders and Mitchell grass  | on its rolling prairies , still so wild that only cattle range . One hundred and thirty-six thousand acres of this land has been proven , over a 30 year test and study , to be practically drouuth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lack of transportation facilities and communications with the industrial centers , still keep this section of Queensland in the cattleman 's column , where immense cattle stations exist . A monthly steamer from Brisbane , and an auto once a week from the terminus of railroad from Townsville , constitutes their contact with the outside world . Even this stage may be out of commission during the wet season from November until April . CAMOOWEAL about 200 miles south of Burketown and a similar distance from Cloncurry , has a population of 200 , being the center of an exclusive cattle country of open rolling plains , Flinders and Mitchell grass , making it an important cattle center of the east end of the Barkley Tablelands , dividing the watersheds of Lake Eyre and the Gulf of Carpentaria . This section of North Queensland , lying south of the Gulf between 17 and 23 degrees South Latitude , offers the most inducement to one interested in an Australian cattle range . Choice of climate ceases to be a prerogative in Australia , if sheep are to be eliminated from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity go to a semi-tropical country where the wet season creates isolation .  | In a country so big and untenanted , where the neighbors only a hundred miles apart , gossip of an evening over their short-wave pedal radio , it is possible to conceive of cattle being stolen . Like many other strange idioms of Australia , it is called " duffing . " An instance is recorded of two men stealing 300 head off the ranges of the large " cattle run " . The cattle were overtaken and returned to the range , while the " duffer " had to ride 1000 miles to Darwin to be tried in court , where he drew five years imprisonment . Brands and earmarks are recorded in the Australian states , and many show from their design , that some office clerk who had never put a brand on a hide , devised them . Blotched-brands would be unavoidable , which is a menace in a hot country where blow flies breed . Queensland is endowed with 93 species of snakes , of which 68 or nearly 75% are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small death adder to one of the largest poisonous snakes in the world , stretching out close to ten feet . Due to its extreme length that reaches into the Tropics , Queensland produces a diversity of crops from sugar cane and pineapple to wheat and corn but its cotton production monopoly of Australia produces a biproduct of cottonseed cake that is a vital factor in concentrated stock-food in times of drouth . The fattening of beef cattle in the sense of the system of our corn states , has no analogy in Australia . However , they have coined a term called " cattlefarmer " for the man who buys feeder cattle in the backcountry , then trails or ships them to fattening grass-areas.  | This process may take a year or two years of shifting to choice feed , over a vast area that eventually lands the herd as prime beef . A knowledge of cattle , grasses , ranges and markets has created a vocation profitable to the right man . Sydney Kidman , with his chain of ranches , made fortunes through this process of fattening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , the wild aborigine of Australia grew to physical perfection and spread over an island larger than the United States , living as nature fashioned him until discovered by the civilized world . " Wherever civilized man goes , he plants the seed of disaster to things primitive . " After 150 years , the aborigine is now dying-out with tuberculosis , leprosy and venereal diseases . The " flu " epidemic nearly annihilated him on the York Peninsula , west of the Gulf of Carpentaria . In search of a NEW WEST as a contemporary of our OLD WEST of the sixties and seventies symptoms cropped-out in West Australia north of the Fitzroy River , a comparatively new grass range where the first cattle were introduced as late as 1903 , and the first herd " trailed-in " in the year 1910 . A wild country where 1000 miles of the sea coast is yet to be explored ; coral islands and submerged reefs unite with a 31 foot tide that rushes in at 19 knots an hour , making this tropical corner of the world a burial ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forest , the naked wildman finds food and freedom , as did his ancestors in the centuries past . Like all Utopias , distance lends enchantment . A frontier where the Government would lease a thousand acres at only one dollar a year for a forty year term . Two of these leases , consisting of 180,000 acres , having 34 years yet to run , were sold for $1000 including the im-  | provements . This is a section of Australia , so wild , new and untamed , that the strong will and wisdom of Sid Kidman had abandoned . An outpost of civilization , around which nature has erected a barrier of tropics and heat , snakes and alligators , diseases fatal to human and animal life , garrisoned by wild black men reputed to be the lowest species of human extant . Other sturdy , strong-willed Scotchmen , less versatile in the acquisition of a livestock empire , than the talented Kidman , weathered the five month wet season and seven month dry , in their attempt to add the Kimberley to the economic credit of Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was prohibitive for the small owner due to transportation hazards , hardships and expense . However , their rent to the Government must be paid . This was solved with peanuts . A ten acre crop of peanuts packed on mules to the distant port , paid the bill . Peanuts was the penance they paid for living in isolation . Young men with pioneer blood in their veins , who wish to follow in the footsteps of their parents , who fought the Apaches under Geronimo , and the grandsires who have mountains , streams and towns bearing their names in our western range states , can find an outlet for their ambition in Australia 's Northwest , over the King Leopold range ; a country so wild that no white woman has vet dared to make it her home , or a dozen white men to stake claims . Instead of the danger of Indian massacres , he will have whiskered wildmen for neighbors who are content to spear his cattle in their lust for blood , or whose outlaws steal young girls at night from the native camps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the nude . Still , in the year 1937 , these naked six foot kidnappers agree with the Indian that the female is the beast of burden and chooses his mate from physical instead of facial standards . These natives have neither the mentality nor the animosity of the American Indian . They are content to live their lives in their own way , or to be " broke-in " like a broncho to bask in the white man 's bounty , for food and the scant clothes he forces on them . Young pioneers have gone into this livestock wilderness of Mitchell , Flinders , bundle-bundle , spindle , ribbon and other grasses , along with brush range , with a capital of only $1000 to cope with nature and the natives in the raw , when they only see a white man two or three times a year . The price he pays to become a king without a throne , the master of all he surveys , is the responsibility of providing food for the swarm of " subjects " content to live off his dole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a rainy day ; theorem that is not now in vogue by a strong following of civilized man . History repeats itself . Embryonic cattlemen of adventurous spirit built on pulp western thrillers , will be denied the glamour of cattle rustling ( called duffing ) natives , the reason for this lack of acquisition being that their bellies are their bankbook , where nature must supply the deposits . However , with a crew of native kelp of seven men , hourly records of branding a calf a minute have been made through the use of the " broncho " , an institution and method exclusive to Australia .  | The Patrol , similar to the Mounted Police of Canada , has inculcated in the aborigine brain , a mortal fear of the whiteman 's Law , to the extent that few of the settlers are speared . The animal instinct of avoiding the destruction of the hand that feeds them , evolves station hospitality as a bribe for your life .

I t would require at least five years of practical experience on the range of the Kimberley Country , to get the technique of the cattle industry as practiced by only ten white men who have dared the wilderness , where all feed must come from seed each year . As a cattle frontier , there is possibly no place on earth to compare with its newness , as the first herd of cattle only reached there 28 years ago . The fecundity of these cattle can be judged when Mr. Blythe of Perth related the loss of 15,000 head out of 30,000 in one year recently from pluropneumonia , off his holdings of 250,000 acres . Mr. Clark , the West Australia State Live Stock Inspector paints a dismal picture for those valiant white men who , in 35 years , have brought the livestock industry north of the Leopold Range , up to its present development . In his lifetime , he has yet to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of Western Australia , which shows a friendly attitude by the Government toward those who choose to develop its wild state . Like the whole history of the other states in the  | Commonwealth , cattle first subjugated the frontier to produce revenue , only to be eventually pushed out to face the dingo ( wild dog ) while sheep took their place . Even now , certain cattle stations in the Northwest have been found favorable for sheep , forcing the cattleman to tackle wilder areas where crocodile and wild men prey on their holdings . Financial returns , disease , buffalo fly , ticks , wild mens ' depredations , all contribute to the discouragement of a possible investor . This , combined with a life among a native race of cannibalistic tendencies , who have not risen in 2500 years from animal level , offers only a haven for a recluse soured on civilization . Even then , the immigration laws of Australia are so stringent he would have to be smuggled into the country . A squaw-man has not a chance , for the laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aborigine . However , venereal diseases were unknown to the aborigine until the white man landed . Likewise , the diseases of livestock were introduced from abroad , Bavaria cattle furnishing the parent stock of ticks , while pluro-pneumonia was introduced from Java . North of the Leopold Range of mountains , exists a disease fatal to horses , known as the " walkabout disease . " When contracted , the horse walks aimlessly about until he dies . Stock horses are worth from 4 to 5 Australian pounds , equal to $16.00 to $20.00 per head , but due to this disease , most of the riding stock are mules . One epidemic of the foot and mouth disease broke out in Western Australia , but was eradicated at a cost of 40,000 pounds sterling .  | A paramount pest to live-stock is the buffalo fly which bores gimlet holes in a cow 's hide , selecting the spot between the ears behind the horns as a favored point of torture .

I n shipping cattle in boat pens of 15 head , it is necessary to spray them each evening for this fly . A voyage through the rough channnel , ( where the tide comes in at 19 knots and raises 6 ft. an hour to reach a high tide of 31 ft. in some localities ) batters and bruises the beeves , causing some mortality and a shrink of 100 Ibs. on a 900 lb. steer . Sore-footed and shrunk from the trail drive , dipped , rough-handled in loading , a three year old steer lands in Perth , a poor feeder , ofttimes not bringing the shipping and trailing costs . Run on the range until matured at six , raisers can only count on a $12.00 profit , after deducting boat freight of 10 days at $24.00 and the raising cost of $12.00 or $2.00 per year of growth . A 1500 mile boat ride on top of a long trail drive is no pleasure jaunt for a wild steer of mediocre breeding , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is appalling . I f a stockman desires to import eight registered bulls , he must buy sixteen , as half of the importation dies of hardships and disease before reaching the range ? clipping regulations , fever , innoculations , rough seas , trail hardships , buffalo fly , climate , all sap their vitality . A class of cattle that produces a 600 lb. fat steer at three years of age , is self-evident , as the product of semi-tropical climate , drouth periods , in-breeding from  | bull calves turned loose on the range ; lack of peaceful surrounding when wildmen spear them at the waterings from ambush , or of being nabbed by crocodiles when forced into the lagoons from buffalo fly torment , or harassed from birth by the lurking dingo or Australian wolf . This dingo or striped wild dog , is not quite as large as the loafer ' wolf , but a sufficient menace for the Government to pay an $8.00 bounty on his scalp . Hunters and trappers in search for this revenue call it " dogging " , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pay rent on his leasehold . Brands of range-tally were held at $8.00 around in 1937 , while best six year old steers were grossing $48.00 per head in Perth . A continuous drouth in the Kimberley country would mean complete annihilation of the livestock industry for no provision is made for cured , conserved feed as the agricultural stage has not yet been reached . Lack of roads or railroads eliminates the importation of feed . During all of the bygone centuries , the wild man has made no attempt to cultivate plant life for food , living on wild fruit , bulbs , roots , honey , ducks , wild turkey , fish , mollusks , with the wallaby and kangaroo furnishing a predominance of the meat ration , until the white man brought cattle , which were much easier to spear with their stone spears . Neither have they smelted mineral to fashion into weapons . Iron of any sort ? old horse shoes , nails , etc. , are cherished prizes to be worked into axes or spearheads . The aforementioned vicissitudes are small , com- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle stations beyond the King Leopold Range . Today , their only market is Perth , oftimes 2500 miles away over land and rough seas , which in turn is 13,000 miles from London , or a month and a half for frozen beef , which is out of the question , in competition with the Argentine chilled beef . Neither is the type of Kimberley product the most desirable for export , leaving therefore only the local markets of Perth and surrounding districts for beef consumption . The rapid development of Southwestern Australia beef production of better grade by smaller holders is supplying the local demand , leaving the Kimberleys without a market for their output . After 35 years spent in developing an industry handicapped by drouths , disease , ravaging wildman , hard-living , privation , hardships and isolation among naked savages , these valiant pioneers find themselves and their investments on an economic island cut off from revenue . Their only salvation lies in the establishment of packing plants to concentrate their beef into tin cans . The supply will not justify the investment by syndicated companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant on their own initiative . Only 17 degrees south of the equator , cold storage becomes a big factor . Fresh meat will keep in the open during the dry season , as the blow-fly only lays eggs during humid weather , or their wet season . Therefore March is the beginning of their troubles with screwworms creating havoc among cattle and sheep . This wet season of five months , followed by a dry of seven , per-  | mits only six months growth in a year . This leaves a soft 3 year old steer weighing only 600 lbs . but when held until 6 , he hardens to 900 lbs . " The hotter the country , the smaller the cattle , " seems to hold as an axiom in range countries . Florida cows shipped to Colorado , had sucking yearlings that got on their knees to nurse . Matured cow horses of the South , put on 100 to 200 lbs . in Montana . Therein lies an advantage for the Kimberley cattle to compete with sheep , as a heavier fleece grows only in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowland , far beyond the inroads of dry farmers . Like a rough painting viewed from the proper distance , the eye is fascinated by the blending of colors , form , objects , but close up it is transformed into daubs of varied paints smeared together . Any favorable comparison of the tropical Kimberley in its newness with its annual grasses , to the perennial gramma and buffalo sod ranges that the dry farmer turned into dust bowls and sand dunes , would be like comparing a rhinestone to a diamond . ' T is better we live in memories . Enough can not be said in praise of the fine type of people who are building up West Australia . They have , and still are solving climatic-geographical problems pertinent to a sparsely settled country where distances are very great and water scarce . The building of a 28 inch pipeline , 360 miles long to supply water for the mining town of Kalgoorlie , which has a population of 20,000 people , is but one example of their nerve and thrift . Far out in the mulga ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the draws to catch surface water for stock , while an occasional deep well punctures the earth 's brushy hide to provide a water supply for man 's domestic animals where previously only wild camels could exist . To appreciate the immensity of the vast expanse of West Australia consider that it consists of over 624 , - 500,000 acres of land , with less than half a million population ; there lies on its eastern fringe a stretch of slightly explored country as long as California , and double its width . Five hundred miles inland from the Great Australian Bight , Lake Eyre spreads its salty waters for 100 mile north , at a minus elevation of 38 feet below sea level . Potential discoveries of mineral and economic wealth is exemplified by the black opal mines unearthed by a Jackaroo , and sandal wood spotted from a train window by a world tourist , making both wealthy . Out of this vast wilderness of only salt water supply comes strange stories . Recently a fresh water lake was found among the salt ones . Scattered over this inland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weed , dog weed , bunch grass , used as stock feed , are also the black oak , scrub eucalyptus with white , yellow and blue flowering varieties , and the mypoll tree , whose post will last for 100 years . Wild camel range districts can be designated by the height from the ground to the foliage that has been cropped by camels . Great areas of Australia were originally developed by camel trains and are still in use in some districts where they pull wool and wood wagons from horse collars fitted upside down .  | The 900 mile waterless stretch east from Kalgoorlie was eliminated from the camel trails with completion of the railroads , and the Government beast-of-burden turned loose to shift for themselves , in the vast wilderness from the Bight to Derby . They multiplied and in the course of years , became a menace to settlers as they tore down fences and ravaged scattered settlers crops . The Government 's next move was to shoot them , on sight . The locomotive turned the camel from an asset to a liability , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eleven hundred miles . Stock water ? in this vast area of brush feed ? is a mint . A story told by a sandal wood gatherer is interesting . Suntanned , swarthy , with horny calloused hands , his appearance showed what the desert could do to a man and he still likes it . He related : " Far out in the mulga four hundred miles from the ocean , I came on a dry lake bed in line of my travel with the truck gathering wood . I t was good sandal country . but I was dubious of crossing that claypan so I camped , and dug a hole a few feet deep to test the footing and struck damp ground . The next morning there was eighteen inches of water in the hole . That evening there was none . I staved there several days and the water rose and fell in that hole with the regulation of the ocean tides . Now explain that ? yes ? it was salty . " The highest spot in all Australia is the 7328 foot top of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean altitude of the 100 mile long level agricultural San Luis Valley of Colorado which has a mean elevation of around 7650 feet . The elevation of Sagauche , near the center , is 7800 ft.  | The lowest section of Australia is approximately 350 miles North of the Australian Bight . Between the Bight tides and Lake Eyre is the longest straight stretch of railroad in Australia and possibly in the world , of 330 miles , while the 56 of railroad in San Luis Valley without a bend is claimed as the levelest straight railroad in the United States . The salt Lake Eyre , thirty-eight feet below sea level and one hundred miles long , offers a problem in the flow of underground waters in this central Australia that geologists claim was originally a part of the ocean . Aborigines will stay out in this waterless wilderness for weeks at a time , through their knowledge of the tree life . Finding an open glade , surrounded by mulga , they search for molelike undulations that reach out into the depression , where water accrues in wet weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . These roots are dug up and cut into short lengths that will stand in 5 gallon oil cans . Pure water that the trees have conserved underground trickles from this timber , in sufficient quantities to supply the blackman 's needs . On the mulga fringe of this great area , we saw grade Durham cattle of small frame but slick and fat from the brush and grass forage . I n different localities of the desert ranges of Australia , grows a plant known as the water-weed , fleshleafed plant , or more commonly called parakulta , on which cattle have been known to live for a period of two years without water . It resembles the plant which we know as pigweed.  | " COB BER " IT WAS IN Sydney , Australia that I met him . A retired old cowman on his third trip around the world ; this time doing it backwards ? keeping below the Equator to prevent running into anything he had seen before . We held a sympathy in common for the man who followed a cow for a living , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cattle lands so I nicknamed him my " cobber , " the Ausie 's synonym for " partner , " in the United States of America . As to age , he was no older this year than he was last , as his birthday had been on the international date line coming over , where a day is lost in the recording of time . Cobber 's family tree took root in the clan lands of Scotland where his branch held a feud with the McDonalds back a few centuries ago . This Scotchman 's chief aversion was the number thirteen while his main diversion was bickering over a sixpence or a dime . The first he drew regularly in pullman seat , theatre , lottery ticket , stateroom or hotel , until in Melbourne he backed out of the assigned room that read 113 , snorting : " God , I 'll never get in off this trip ? there it goes again , 113 , I wo n't take it ! " Again in Johannesburg , South Africa , where he came to my hotel from Victoria @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " My room 's No. 14 right next to yours . " I led him upstairs and pointed to the number of my room and said , " And mine 12 . " His eyes bulged out , then he strolled down the hall to find that the numbers ran consecutively . " Huh ! drew 13 again ? damned if I do n't move from this hotel . " He did ? fate certainly played on his weakness to the extent that his tickets either contained or added up to the despised 13 . One of Cobber 's immediate ancestors must have come from the highlands and the other from the lowlands of Scotland , for at times in buying exchange he would aggravate the teller into a frenzy while he wore the point off a pencil quibbling over a fraction of a shilling . Within the hour , he would spend fifty dollars for the best of " teddy bears " to send home as Christmas presents to his tenants ' little children , while the clean shirt on his back was a thing of parts instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them away . . . saves laundry bills and travel light . Buy new ones when you need ' em , wear out old ones when you do n't , " was his philosophy . But within the next block he would sheer-off from the line of pedestrians to drop a shilling into the hat of some special brand of beggar that caught his fancy . Cobber 's attire showed the effect of a fifty two day voyage on a tramp steamer as he stood on the sidewalk at the Sydney Post Office waiting for me to mail some  | letters , when a " moocher " struck him for a piece of coin . There was something in the tramp 's line or appearance that did not appeal to Cobber 's brand of charity so in a low voice he said : " Play fair , buddie . . . get across the street ... I 'm working this side . " Courtesy of the " road " combined with Cobber 's pitiful face prompted the bum to start across , when my friend spied me coming down the Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " Here comes a tourist sucker . Let 's both hit him at once . " Soon I was on the firing line with long phrases of vicissitudes about haystacks and culverts , hunger and cold , starving children and sick wives , etc , bombarding both ears , but the spiel put up by that double-crossing partner of mine would have melted a heart of stone . As a stranger who had never met me before , his long , sad face registered misery and want , eyes glared desperation , while the trembling voice poured out platitudes of Bob Ingersoll eloquence that completely drowned-out his competitor 's plea . The bum shook his head sadly and moved on up the street . Ranking second in Cobber 's aversions were women . His philosophy barred them from his modus operandi of doing business . The prejudice met strong opposition in Australia , where women have usurped positions usually occupied by men . Be your needs either eat ? sleep ? drink or wear , you found their pleasing personalities there to serve you . In the hotels ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had to admit they were the finest type of women he had ever contacted . " I never talk business to a woman if there 's a man behind a counter ? ca n't get anywhere with ' ern. "  | On entering the Grand Central Hotel in Sydney in search of a room for a week , Cobber balked at the door , with ? " Look at that ! " he growled , behind the desk were three women . " Well . . . you go talk to ' em " , and he dropped down into a seat in the lobby . There was only one way that this strong-willed Scotchman would let a woman help him , and then she never knew it . Back on the long trail of his cow-puncher days , a broken leg had set short and crooked . He walked like every other man in a slow crowd but when it came to getting into high-gear at a traffic signal that leg swung like a pendulum . So my Buddy would plant himself on a street corner and wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd trail in behind , letting her break the way . When I accused him of hiding behind a woman 's skirt , he became deeply offended . The " moocher " episode was itching for revenge . In our separate searches for sight-seeing tours , I ran onto a large Scotch woman of personality and salesmanship . I told her that a friend of mine with plenty of money and a week 's time to spare , was then in her competitor 's office considering tours but I would try to bring him in and for her to use her best efforts in seeing that he missed nothing . Cobber would never have gone in had he known a woman was there . I introduced them with : " You Scotch should get on amiably . " " Yes ? " There was derision in his voice and fight in his eye . " Our Clans had a feud in Scotland . "  | " Could you find any bargains in Mrs. Mac 's office , " I ventured that night . " Naw , paid her price ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hereafter . " My Scotch friend 's chief peeve was the transportation problem . He was crossing oceans before he got to them . He began to growl and " ship-shopping " at Sydney , 3100 miles from Perth . The inconsistency of havto pay the same price from Perth to Capetown as from Sydney to Capetown by boat , demanded a reduction if he paid a railroad fare for 3100 miles across Australia . The shipping agents sat fast and so did my Cobber , until he finally threatened Dalgety and Co. , to buy his own yacht and pilot her across the Indian Ocean . We worked alternate shifts , Cobber having me packing notes to the Agents stating , " I am Scotch and wo n't pay any more . " They would read and smile , then add to his note ? " So am I Scotch , and wo n't take any less . " " Let 's move on to the next seaport ? they ca n't have all the cargo boats sewed-up . " There we would find the same price and same story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , it 's got to pay for it , I need a new suit of clothes . " Suit-shopping consumed the bartering instinct until he got a tailor-made suit at half its price in the U. S. " If there 's any tipping on this boat , you 'll do it , I wo n't give them a thin dime , " were his instructions when we started for Africa . The two weeks spent in Perth with Cobber at a splendid hostel ( 82 rooms ) run and managed by three genteel girls from 19 to 26 years of age , were a short  | course in the art of Scotch shopping . His keen insight in bartering , values and material , soon ferreted-out the places where you could get the most for your money in foods , drinks , wear and travel . A faculty which had made it feasible for him to build up a cow-outfit to $80,000 and make his third tour around the world . " Long ago , I learned that I did n't think as fast as most people , but give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of my side of the bargain , " he said once . My buddie was left-handed but wrote two distinctive hands , one right , the other left , which had a significance known only to him . He bought a boomerang that would not go where he willed it . When I suggested that he should have bought a lefthand boomerang , he accepted it as an excuse for his poor aim . Our " horse-play " reached its limit when we met an amiable well-to-do widow who was more than pleased to show us around . The lady spoke of the national gambling game known as Two-up . " Do n't know it . . . like to see it . " Cobber let slip unguardedly . " Fine , I know an exclusive club where I can take one friend . " " Well . . but . . eh . . my friend here . . " Cobber broke in hunting a gap to back out , but the lady had him hooked when she insisted : " He 's not interested , so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iooked at me with suspicion in the coldest eyes he could summon , for the truth was , I had told the lady he was a rich , lonely globe trotter hunting a wife to keep him company .  | My Scotch friend 's aversion was women , but the next day I accused him of deliberately and purposely pushing me over on to a nail in the Park bench , which tore the seat of my pants out , so that he might have her the rest of the day to himself . On landing in Australia we had both discovered our mistake in being there at the wrong season of the year to see the handling of cattle . May , June and July are the months they work cattle on the cattle stations . Should we elect to go out into the mulga for 800 to 1000 miles to the closest stations we would find that the cattle were hidden in the brush and only watered at night . This was a deep disappointment . We visited with men of the ranges and read everything that book-stores and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eleven million sheep told the sad story of the age-old war between cattle and sheep in the land of Never-Never . Only one-eighth of the continent larger than the United States was left as a cattle domain . Cobber 's life settled down to a methodical one in Melbourne . Ship-hunting in the forenoon , choppe-hunting in the afternoon and movie-sleeping at night for my buddie , where I would awaken him between reels and chide him for wasting money on hotels . It was there in Australia that I saw the " Hollywood Cowboy " with the familiar scenes " shot " in the Alabama Hills at Lone Pine , California . We varied this program one evening , attending an old time dance with 24 dances on the program , none of which I had ever seen danced before . Cobber and I slipped into the large hall and found obscure seats on the sideline . Cardboards with the name and number of the  | dance were arranged on an easel on the platform beside a splendid orchestra . I n due time the manager and dancing teacher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the dance but enjoying immensely the novelty of the new dances . This buddy of mine was so versatile in travel that he could shape his conversation on many lands and talk convincingly . At various times he had claimed Canada , United States , Mexico and Scotland as his home , to fit the environments , but to my surprise he grudgingly claimed Hollywood , begging to be allowed to remain in seclusion . " Ah ? Hollywood hunting talent in my renowned school of dancing , " and the manager stepped out into the center of the hall and addressed that fine assembly of middle aged Australians with : " Ladies and gentlemen , our renown has gone afar . No doubt you noticed the two quiet gentlemen who have watched closely your exquisite and figurative dancing this evening . I have just discovered they are direct from Hollywood and no doubt movie directors in disguise , searching for new talent for the great cinema . I will conduct them to the orchestra platform where they may watch your steps , and I trust that you will give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Now see what you 've got us into ! " It was my turn to give Cobber the cold eye , but it was too late , for soon the officious dancing master was conducting us across the long hall under one continuous applause . To mount the platform required a short jump . I was lucky in negotiating it safely , but Cobber 's pendulum leg , as it swung in its orbit , took in one of the program easels . He  | sprawled out on the orchestra platform , the programs on the dancing floor . For once he lost his composure ? the long wrinkled face was anything else but serene , when he said : " I knew that I was goin ' to do something like that . just felt it comin ' . " But the dance went on while we posed as connoisseurs of the art . Amos and Andy could have gained some pointers from Cobber 's conversation with members of the orchestra , between numbers . The hotels of Australia have a monopoly on the bars and ladies lounges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flirting is not a lost art . Steins of beer are called " Choppes " which vary in size and quality , according to location . Cobber nicknamed the lounges as " offices " , and the time spent there as " office work . " The women of Australia certainly go-to-town , and with an over-night bag in their hands . The attitude of the sexes is different from other countries . They stand on their own initiative , and ask no odds . " But I 've got plenty of money and a good position . . . I 'm lonely and crave a gentleman 's company . . . let 's have a good dinner together and go to a show , for it will be a whole week before I have another holiday " or , as I heard a genteel little woman say , who lives 40 miles out : " Well , I guess I 'll have to go now to catch the last train , for it seems that the only way to get a man nowa-days is to kidnap him . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled a duck that did n't like water .  | I n Kalgoorlie , one morning , we were of different minds as to the program of the day , with the result that he went up the street and I down ? then within an hour started to spend the rest of the day trying to find each other . We had each drawn a pair of Queens and needed a Jack to fill in and make two pairs . I n the sleeping car from Melbourne to Adelaide , we met a man whom my Cobber badly misjudged , with the result that he poured into the stranger 's ears a synopsis of our intended expedition across the desert waste of some 900 miles east from Alice Springs , in search of the lost Golden Reef . " We are going to get us a couple of burros , a coal oil can of water , beans and sowbelly , and prospect that country right . " Through the cigarette smoke he saw visions of gold ledges that had missed the inexperienced Ausies ' eyes . and the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of much needed gold . The man listened attentively smiled and kept silent . By chance , this man was stopping at the same hotel in Adelaide that we had chosen , where I ran into him the next day . He drew me aside and said confidentially , " I am a mining engineer and geologist of 19 years experience in the wilds of Australia , so would advise you to dissuade your partner of his contemplated prospecting tour , for the country of which he speaks is spotted with the bleaching bones of men of his type , who presume to come here and find gold . There 's several hundred miles without water , where whole expeditions have perished , some never even found . " I thanked the gentleman for his kind advice and  | promised to act upon it , not having the heart to tell him that Cobber had taken him for a sucker to load . Instead , we went on a Sunday Auto tour to a beautiful lake in the high mountains that served as a reserve water supply for the landscaped city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we saw in all Australia . The original city is a mile square , flanked by a quarter of a mile of parking , beyond which lie the residential suburbs , which in turn are skirted by cherry orchards and celeryfields . The rich plain is about I0 by 80 miles . The railroad paralleled the 360 miles pipe line that furnished the only water supply for the 20,000 inhabitants of Kalgoorlie ? the place where Herbert Hoover spent many long years . Cobber decided that he was going to see the dam and intake of that line . When that Scotchman got an idea in his square head , backed by a determined chin , it was there for keeps . We spent a Sunday going through the Zoo on the island across the river and a motor boat ride on the beautiful Swan river to Freemantle the deep-water port for the city of Perth . Then , one morning Cobber was missing at the hotel . That evening when I asked where he had been all day , he said : " On a one-man train excursion to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we left the depot , but they dwindled away until , when we reached the end of the line , I was the only one left on the train . The Conductor held her until I got my eyes full . Yes , I 've had a hell of a day . " The port of Freemantle found us there ahead of time to take the boat for Capetown , Africa . Cobber had  | managed his finances until he was down to a six-pence of Australian money while I had several dollars to spend . Cobber decided we had better drink it up . He turned Communist for the time , " willing to share his thirst with my beer . " From the first he had given me to understand that each was on his own and that we would go " Dutch " on everything . Under that agreement , he could make a glass of beer last as long as any Scotchman , but when confronted with the problem of getting rid of my Australian money , he developed a thirst that would require a fire hose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming fast and frothy , when I caught a vision in the form of a boat sailing without us , so while my buddy was hunting for one special bar , where Half-and-half was served in buckets , I slipped into a book store and spent the last farthing . " I 've found ' er ! " he finally shouted . " I 'm broke " , I said . " Hell , I was just gettin ' started . " " Let 's go to the boat . " This was our brief conversation when I showed up with a bundle of books under one arm . The amiable captain of the Norwegian cargo boat with his co-operating crew of 35 , made splendid hosts for the varied group of passengers consisting of man and wife , father and vivacious 19 year old daughter , two bachelor girls , two widows and two widowers . Swimming pool , deck games and dancing to Norwegian music broke the monotony of the 16 day voyage . The night before Christmas the bachelor girls gave a party . To retaliate in kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before reaching Capetown we men threw a return party . At the Christmas Eve party it developed that my versatile partner had a love for song , but lacked the qualifications to handle it . His renditions left no regrets for what the books had deprived me of in Freemantle . My buddy 's ability to reach high notes had probably been copied from lonely coyotes while he was killing time on night-guards . At the first sight of African land Cobber stalked the deck yelling : " Lion for breakfast ! Lion for breakfast ! " where we all joined him and searched the rugged coast through his travel-worn powerful field glasses . Years before , he had hunted the king of beasts on the head waters of the Nile . Again in their homeland , the desire to beard one in its den was the mother to a thought that later was visualized on an easel with crayon . At the hotel in Capetown we met a cartoonist of ability . Cobber and he became quite chummy . Then one morning my Scotch buddy was exhibiting a life-likeness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the African Veld , with a scared negro guncarrier in his wake pointing toward a stalking lion bent on having a negro for breakfast , while our lion hunter marched straight on , seeing nothing but thin air . Cobber had this struck off in post card form , as a souvenir for his many friends at home . On passing customs in Capetown , four of us took a taxi to a popular hotel . Two registered , but my Scotch friend balked at ten shillings six-pence a day . " I wo n't be robbed ! I wo n't pay it ! " So on we went  | searching for cheaper quarters until the taxi bill was 8 shillings . Cobber watched the meter with nervous eyes , but firmly refused to pay the price asked at the different hotels . When I suggested that we had better choose the one where our boat friends had stopped , he broke out in a spasm with : " You can go where you damn please , but I 'm going ' to get my money 's worth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel where half the guests were children , and the deep narrow bedroom had a cot at the French door where a window glass was broken out , and no lock on the door , while a single bed was tucked back in a dark corner . I took in the situation , and said : " You chose the the place and the room , so I 'll take the back bed while you stand night-guard at the door to see that no one gets my pocketbook . " Verily , I think he did , for Cobber was a haggard looking man next morning when he confessed : " I made a botch in pickin ' this dump . You go one way and I 'll go the other and we 'll see if we ca n't find a decent hotel . Meet me here at noon . " When I first decided to travel with this thrifty strong-willed Scotchman , I knew it would be as a follower and not as a leader . His wide travel experience and honest thrift had their advantages . We had both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Take things as you find them and make the best of it . " His close-fisted dealings had their humorous side and he was not the last to See it . In fact he got a joy in developing them . His many-sided personality made each mood a vaudeville act . On comparing results at noon , on the morning 's hunt for a new hotel , he agreed with  | me that the original hotel where our friends had registered was the best bet . But with hidden humour in his words , he said : " I 'll pack my own grips down and save a taxi . " Within two days all seven of the passengers who had landed in Capetown were guests at our hotel . Cobber followed two off to Victoria Falls , which ended our traveling companionship . I missed his droll words and sound philosophy as when he said : " My only attraction for women is my money , so I have few women friends . "  | ONE THOUSAND MILES OF SOUTH AFRICAN RANGE THE FIRST stock range encountered by rail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quite similar to the sagebrush ranges of Arizona . Sufficient rain sprouts the flora seed that converts a desert into a flower garden on par with the California deserts of San Bernardino County . Scattered windmills over a three hundred mile stretch of undulating hills support some sheep and horse ranches . The range horses were a fine type , showing breeding along thoroughbred lines suitable for cavalry use . The stony claypan soil is conducive to good hoofs . The sheep were of a mediocre quality and it is said that the wool of South Africa carries as much as six pounds of sand , dirt and oil to a fleece , due to drifting sand storms . A breed of pinto sheep ? black and white ? brown and white ? are unique to South Africa . Small but hardy , they would be an added asset to the Navajo , who could weave his blankets with fast colors from the same fleece . The hardy native Karakul sheep predominates on spare ranges . No cattle of import were seen in this vast desert range , indicating that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Beyond Kimberley they began to appear as motley colored spots , competing on the scenery with the ant hills built three and four feet high , of red adobe soil that resembled Spanish bake-ovens . These hills are  | used as surfacing for road paving when the land is plowed . From Kimberley on to Johannesburg , for several hundred miles , are beautiful rolling hills and vast prairie land , where old grass stood a foot high and the cattle were reeling poor . In fact thousands of cattle and sheep had died during the winter . On the last day of December 1937 , new grass was turning the plain into a velvet carpet of green where 12 head of light mules , or 14 head of oxen of all grades , were turning long black ribbons , as frames around waving landscapes of green and brown , dotted with stray trees of darker shade . In back-furrowing , it would take 200 yards at the furrow-ends to circle these long plow teams back to the plow-land . Around this mile or two mile long lands , crept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oxen dragging old " A " gang plows that scratched the thin soil as a seed bed for milo or wheat . On mile square lands , recently laid out , one could gauge the day 's work from the darker color added to the frame of Nature 's picture . Like termite colonies , the long lines ate into the green veld , turning up the wet dark soil that an African sun was fading into brown and then the dull red , of the ant hill hue . There was a reason for the plowing of the immense tracts ; for reeling cattle in knee-high old grasses ; for the heavy loss in livestock the previous winter ( our summer ) ; for the scarcity of cattle on such beautiful ranges . Inquiry developed that all grass came from seed each year , it did not cure on the ground , and had no strength for winter feed .  | In a country without snow or blizzards , every stockman must provide at least a ton to the head , of dry feed for winter use . The more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ numbers . Beef breeds outside of their native African breed of cattle were supplanted by dual cattle that supplied meat , milk and muscle for the plow .

The Brahman or Zebu play a strong part in its makeup , particularly in making them immune from the tick disease that is prevalent in Africa .

Wild goats stand sentry duty on the high rock pinnacle of the replica home of their free ancestors ; bears peer out of rock caves ; hippopotami swim their ton of flesh gracefully in expansive tanks ; the water buffalo wallows in mudholes ; wolves howl and hyenas scream with the zoo animal orchestra . All branches of the ape family , from monkey to orang-utan , have representatives to their world 's congress at Johannesburg where 2000 of  | the faunas of the known world are assembled . Fish , fowl , reptiles ; aquatic , herbivorous , carnivorous - it matters not to what species , genus , type of clime , land or sea , the wealth of Johannesburg has collected them to the natural home of wild life - Africa .

Some of this new wealth of gold came from shafts of 12,000 ft. - the deepest mine in the world . From tunnels that burrow 32 miles laterally , they have built a thousand hills on the Johannesburg rolling prairie , many a mile long and 300 ft. high , and a half mile wide . Only the devaluation of gold will stop the growth of Johannesburg , with its equable climate that favors floral and tree life on its rolling grass-covered hills . Mines of asbestos , copper and diamonds have been agencies in building the most modern city in the world . The latest designs in modernistic construction of massive buildings add distinction to a young city fifty years old , whose wide streets are thronged with only new cars 95% American models . The United States buys their gold , and they buy our cars .

The version of a mining engineer with twenty  | years experience in South Africa is an eye-opener to the un-informed . He said : " Diamonds would be as cheap and plentiful as peas if it were not for Government regulations . " Even the tides on the east coast roll them upon the shore , where Government officers patrol the diamond strewn beach for miles . It is compulsory to get a Government permit to even own ONE uncut diamond . Like your driver 's license , this certificate must always be kept with you . The diamond industry is under complete Government control , otherwise the world market would be flooded , especially America , who bought 96% of the African output previous to 1926 . Industry consumes more diamonds now than ever before , in the manufacture of tools and machinery , which helps the depleted demand .

Surface water developed down the sides of the dark shaft disappears . The little that accumulates is never stagnant . Previous to 1926 this mine produced 98% of the diamonds , but now produces only 17% . PRETORIA the Capital of the Free States of South Africa , is situated in a beautiful park surrounded by tree-laden hills , 37 miles northeast of Johannesburg . In the crescent of a miniature mountain overlooking the city of 100,000 , nestles the Capitol Buildings built in the shape of a half-moon . Like a composite architecture of the castles on the Rhine , it stretches in a curve for a quarter  | of a mile in a back-ground of forest green , and a foreground of terraced landscaping of flowers , fountains and frescoed balustrades . It is said to be the most beautiful and modern building in the eastern hemisphere .

Cullinan , the largest diamond in the world was discovered near Pretoria . Now in the British crown , it originally weighed 1% lbs . The Jonker diamond ( fourth in size ) was also found in this district . Added to the natural resources of gold and diamonds , are immense asbestos mines pouring out their quota of wealth to enlarge on the mineral fame of the Pretoria district . The people of a country are a main factor to one seeking a new location . The population of the Free States is 69% native , divided between the blacks and whites . Capetown was originally ' colonized with Malay labor , while in Johannesburg , the African negro predominates . The Malay of turban cap and veiled woman , is brown but the native is real black .

Many of the names of towns are beyond spelling , memory or pro-  | nunciation . For example ? " LEANWDOORNSTAD " a railroad station . They are a big , powerful blonde race , inured to hardships in conquering the veld . GoLD ? magic gold , draws like a magnet the adventurous spirit from all corners of the globe to South Africa . The race that controls the financial world is there in strong numbers . Whether from Russia , Germany or Old Jerusalem , gold and cheap labor ( blacks get from 35c to 95c a day in the mines with 200,000 employed ) is an ideal combination for the Jews . Skilled labor is scarce . In the mines , they make from $300 to $600 a month . Life in the mines was short , due to a disease , but of recent years , with air conditioning and sanitation , mining has become a safe vocation .

In each decade , the number of cattle in both Africa and Australia are decreasing while sheep are increasing , which leads to a mutton eating public of the future : 10,575,000 head of cattle in South Africa and 13,852,000 in Australia with only a small percentage eligible for export . The combined cattle census of South Africa and Australia is only 36.2% of that of the United States , while their 152 million sheep gives them three sheep to our one . We are a beef-eating nation where our bills-of-fare afford five choices in steaks , while in these countries only one appears . In 12 years our cattle increased 10% but sheep increased 67.6% which shows that the cowman is losing at home as well as abroad , in competition with sheep with their dual income of wool and mutton .

There , only one operator collects a profit between the producer and the consumer .  | A RHODESIAN RANCH IN SOUTH AFRICA THE FOLLOWING is an article which appeared in the Sunday Times at Johannesburg , written by " Twalamehlo " , and fully describes Rhodesian Ranch Life . Ranch life in Rhodesia is probably much the same as on any other ranch in South Africa . This particular one is about a quarter of a million acres in extent and you can travel for over twenty-five miles within its boundaries . Ranch headquarters lie close to the northern boundary and are about twenty-five miles from our nearest station on the railway , and that again is between sixty and seventy miles from a town of any size ; so that we have to be a practically self-contained unit out here . The whole stretch of country comprising the ranch is completely fenced and divided up into about seventy paddocks of varying sizes ; for the most part it is very open granite country with grazing of rather poor quality , but wonderfully well watered and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variety to the background . There are five " Sections " of which one is given up solely to running young stock , breeding taking place on the other four . At headquarters there are the manager and his assistant with their respective families , and a bachelor storeman . Three of the other sections each has married men in charge , whilst the young stock section boasts only a native foreman , who is supervised from headquarters . Including the youngest members of  | each family on the ranch we total about eighteen whites , and the bodily requirements of all of these are catered for by our own store , where all groceries , working clothes and medical supplies can be obtained . This is a very great boon to housewives out in the blue , and does away with the necessity of ordering a month 's supplies at a time . Included in our amusements are gardening , riding , shooting , tennis , fishing and communal picnics ; and , of course , listening to the wireless , as every family on the ranch has acquired a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a very mild , law-abiding little community , and not a bit wild and woolly . The ranch carries some twelve thousand and a few hundred head of stock , each " section " being responsible for any number between two and three thousand , depending upon the time of year and whether it is the calving season , or whether weaning has just taken place , and so on . The cattle are dipped every week and thus it is possible to keep a fairly accurate check on them in each paddock . Each month a report is made out giving details of all transfers of stock to different classes , such as heifers to cows and young oxen to oxen of a certain age , all births , purchases , sales and deaths . Furthermore the deaths are enumerated ; so many killed by wild dogs , leopards or crocodiles , so many died from gallsickness , redwater , or whatever cause may be revealed by the post mortem examination carried out by the section manager ? if he manages to get to the carcass before the vultures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meticulous method of tallying the cattle on the ranch with the hit and miss procedure entailed with the  | occasional round-ups on the open cattle ranges of America and Australia . I n addition to the European staff , we employ an average of one hundred and seventy natives , some to look after the stock and others for agricultural work and general transport and fencing maintenace . Each section has its own agricultural unit and grows as much feed as possible for the purpose of stall-feeding oxen ; these for the most part are finished off at about three and a half to four years old , when they are railed to Bulswayo , slaughtered and exported overseas as chilled beef . Small buck and birds abound throughout the ranch , reed buck and kudu are fairly numerous and we have a few small and jealously guarded herds of tsessibe and roan antelope . Once in a while a solitary wildebeeste drifts in from nobody knows where and tacks itself on to a troop of cattle : then the native herder in charge of that particular paddock has to keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole of his daily patrol , for these solitary animals always appear to be rogues and charge human beings on sight . When any distinguished visitors come out to the ranch they always hope to see game in its natural surroundings , but the story is told of one occasion when no big buck had been seen and the visitors expressed their disappointment and disbelief in the existance of any big game on the ranch , to the manager . Orders were promptly given for some of the cattle boys to go and round up a bunch of roan antelope and hold them near the road in a certain paddock ; when a motor car was seen approaching they were to duck down and hide in the grass . These instructions were successfully carried out and the  | important personages , taken along that particular road for the one express purpose , were very pleased with the game they saw ; fortunately they were also good enough sportsmen not to start blazing away at such obviously friendly beasts as these roans , and that must have afforded much relief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manager also . In addition to his agricultural work and the stallfeeding of oxen , a section-manager has to attend to the ear-marking , de-horning , castrating , inoculating and branding of all calves . He has to ride around his paddocks and keep an eye on the condition of the stock , the grazing and water supplies , occasionally leopards or wild dogs have been killing beasts , and they had to be chased and , if possible , put out of action ; velt fires have to be fought ; he has to doctor sick beasts , train young horses , and generally perform such a variety of jobs that he never feels bored with what might , to some towndwellers , seem rather a lonely sort of existence . "  | ARGENTINA THE MENTION of Argentina to the average cowman of the United States brings visions of vast grass-waving plains where cattle roam and fatten at will . A cowhaven ? the land of opportunity reft of the vicissitudes that he faces at home . Before the United States clamped down on its immigration , there was logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ migration of Southern Europe to the man-thirsty land that even financed the new settler on its deep , rich soil . This agricultural stampede cut black gashes into the grass ranges that depleted the herds until today 57% of the pampas plains are devoted to timber , orchards and agriculture , leaving 32.4% for grazing , above waste areas and lakes . Needle grass , thistles and locusts , poison grasses and herbs , alfalfa bloat and epidemics of foot and mouth disease , together with 17 year cycle drouths , all menace the serenity and finances of the Argentine pastoral life . The 16 cows and 2 bulls which Mendoza swam ashore in 1536 , within two centuries had populated the pampas as the bison covered our plains . In 50 years the 32 mixed horses had propagated to herds of 100,000 which were hunted for their hair and hides . Only 50 years ago , ( 1888 ) a pampa steer was worth $5.79 , which covered the value of his hide and tallow . Fortunes ran wild on the pampas where the gaucho and  | his bola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cattle kingdom . Gaucho character and technique were moulded by their environments . Living beyond the reach of the law , human as well as animal life were held cheap . The knife and bola sustained existance . A Spanish cross on Indian women endowed the gaucho with the outstanding characteristics of both ? quick tempered , hot blooded and carefree . Proud in his own endurance of hardship and pain , cruelty to animals became a habit . His horse and its equipment were his pride . Although he lived in a hovel of sod and slept on a sheepskin , the saddle , bridle , lariat , knife and bola must be of the masters ' art . He refused to ride a mare deeming it fit only for squaws to mount . Horsemen supreme , the gaucho herein differs from the Arab whose mare mothers him like a colt , warns him of danger and guards him while he sleeps . In fact is his whole existence . White women came to the pampas with the passing of the wild cattle from the plains . Tradition lingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slitting the tissue in a horse 's nostril to give him better wind , or dragging mutilated mares for grass fire-break , belongs to a bygone epoch . Over 6,000,000 emigrants , principally from Italy and Spain , flocked to the Argentine in 70 years and settled on the rich grazing lands within a radius of 350 miles of Buenos Aires , which is now producing 905 of the cultivated crops of Argentina . As New York environs absorbed the bulk of the foreign element , so has the Buenos Aires district assimilated the emigrant . Roving herds gave way to waving wheat fields , that  | poured a stream of golden grain into foreign holds . In 1936 , from world wide ports , 2766 ships dropped anchor in the 60 mile wide Rio Plata to await their turn at crowded wharfs . Wheat , corn and flax painted the pampas plains with patterns of yellow , russet and crimson , where the white pampa flags had reigned for centuries . As their agriculture increased , cattle decreased in numbers until today , Argentina has more sheep than cattle on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles ( 37,956,000 ) sheep . The sheep and crop-sharing arrangement of the emigrant with the estanciero , has proven an economic benefit for both concerned . Like our gramma sod that faded on our plains , so disappeared the pampa flags from the horizon of the Pampas with the advent of agriculture . The rich , deep soil responded to the thrift and energy of new blood , that sank wells , planted trees and built fences . With the advent of modern civilization , passed the romance and glamour of the gaucho , the inbred long-horned herds of wild cattle , the enduring criollo pampa horses , the freedom and mystery of the unlandmarked plains , where a rider , should he suddenly become afoot , had only the sun and moon for guideposts , due to the grass which was head high . Vital factors in the early allotment of this agricultural kingdom , have preserved Argentina livestock prestige . Otherwise the pampas would now be the breadbasket of the world . The Government originally sold a square league of 6250 acres on time payments , as low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early families amassed large  | landed estates , later to lease certain portions of their holdings to the agricultural emigrant on crop or sheep sharing basis . With sheep , the renter received one-fourth wool and one-fourth of the increase above the original number , for their care , shearing , dipping , etc. , the owner furnishing land and livestock . The rich soil , with a maximum depth of 60 ft. was turned over by four-horse plow teams traveling 22 miles at a cost of $2.25 a day . Discovered to be the natural home of alfalfa , one estancia sowed $20,000 worth of alfalfa seed in one year . Alfalfa produced 1000 lbs . of seed to the acre , or six tons of hay per year . Rich soil , sunshine and 40 inches of rainfall made quick fortunes in finishing beef on expansive fields of fattening alfalfa . There being no rocks or waste land on the alluvial plains made every acre 100% productive . Labor was cheap , as three-fourths of a peon 's living was meat , supplied from the estancia ; a sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side line furnished the staff of life to balance the estancia ration . Out of this self-sufficient setup sprang a landed aristocracy that grew arrogant with their economic power . The source of Argentine wealth came from the rich lands owned by families in the land of the pampas , comparable with our " 400 " . Gold flowed into their coffers from livestock or agricultural wealth to make them the moneyed interests of the flourishing republic . Surplus capital from the estancias was invested into imposing Buenos Aires buildings , establishing their power both rural and urban . The engendered pride has marked the succeeding generation of both high and low degree .  | A superiority complex is the earmark of an Argentino from the office boy to the bank executive . This personality is an impressive contrast with the affable , genteel Australian of all walks of life . A prospective citizen desiring to learn the Spanish language inquired of an Argentinean where he could secure accommodations in a private family where Spanish was spoken . The answer was : " Very difficult to find , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was this pride and arrogance born from their own achievements or the direct results of three billion dollars of foreign capital that helped develop the natural resurces ? , 442,000,000 being British and $753,000,000 being American ? on which they have passed legislation which confiscates all but an interest rate capable of being earned at home for the investors ? Or , denied the financial backing , executive foresight , engineering and architectural skill , would Argentina not be in the same category as Mexico , rich in potential values , but unstable in government , which capital has shunned ? The ego of the Argentinean is paraded on the Avenida Florida after four in the afternoon each day , where traffic is suspended that he may strut himself and his clothes like a peacock . The width of the whole street takes on holiday attire where young squirts and old dudes swing useless canes and fondle gloves-in-hand , to imitate a Parisian model as Buenos Aires claims to be the Paris of America . Mother is there with her flock of dark-eyed senoritas , who have been primping since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes speak the language of the sexes in search of adventure on the  | Avenida . Effeminate dudes with marcelled hair and mannish women in slacks vie for the courted attention . Hollywood reels spoken in English but printed in Spanish on the film , give them the latest fads . At night , picture shows with 100 ft. wide swinging-door frontage to accommodate the gay crowds , glare with the light-of day for blocks on the Calle Corrientes . Cafes and cabarets where whiskey is 2 pesos , wine 1.50 and beer 80 centavos a glass , are overflowing at midnight . In 1935 , 45,000 women were " on-the-town " making it a sailor 's paradise , of these 300 held out at the Buenos Aires bar where floor shows on two floors held crowded tables , and women paraded the aisles a dozen in a flock to show their clothes and what nature had given them in face and figure . Only on invitation , did the management allow them to park at a table to entertain guests . By 1938 the city had turned Puritan , allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where they must stay until 4 a.m . All others were forced into the factories where they could make only two pesos a day , or out to the suburbs of San Fernando , 35 miles away , where a red-light district exists . Even these women were inoculated with an ego that personified the estate of a queen , as they strutted their stuff in single file down the long aisles of worldly men from all corners of the globe . Somewhere in most books of authors writing on Argentina , one finds reference to the egotism of the Argentinean , which seems to establish it as a characteristic . It hits you in the face on landing ; in the shops and offices ; none fail to impress you of their importance . That two nationalities springing from similar emi-  | grants with only a river between them could be so unlike in personality , is the mystery of travelers . It is like stepping from fog into sunshine , from an atmosphere of arrogance into one of courtesy and consideration , when you go from Argentina to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must pay homage to the Argentina Consul in Uruguay , where you can wait for a half hour while he reads the newspaper and smokes a cigar before inspecting your credentials for a casual moment . The United States Consul in Montevideo will advise you to attend to this regulation to avert possible complications . It takes half a day to get a stamp stuck on your visa in Buenos Aires Immigration Offices . While you stand waiting at the window , the office force sup black coffee and visit . Taxi and baggage service from the port is a racket . One passenger from Africa paid four taxi fares to reach his hotel . On his third switch , a cane-threat stopped the grafter from touring the city to build up a meterreading . Less than a mile from the wharf , his baggage was four hours reaching the Hotel Jounsten . Buenos Aires is a large city , having a greater population living within its city limits than the combined states of Wyoming , Colorado , New Mexico , Arizona , and Nevada . They do things in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leading to an area where they leveled 20 acres of buildings for a Central Park . The subways that mole beneath the city to reach the manufacturing and residential suburbs converge beneath this landscaped and statue-lined park . Buildings of the type of the Los Angeles City Hall push their huge  | bulk skyward to minimize the shafts of church steeples that hither and yon prick the horizon of masonry . The Roman Catholic Church is supported by the Government and none but a native member is eligible to become President of Argentina . Other creeds are tolerated but the university is alleged to be predominately infidel . The Argentina Constitution was modeled closely after that of the United States with an Electoral College , Senate of 30 and House of 158 . A president is only eligible for one six-year term . Ortiz , in 1938 received a majority of the vote of the Electoral College , although his opponent was favored by the popular vote of the people . Only 2% of the population of Argentina are not of the Caucasian race , which maintains a high standard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leads to culture and refinement with available facilities . In Buenos Aires are found all the comforts and refinements of modern civilization which with their money , the citizens are eager to acquire . Notwithstanding that labor receives less than half that paid in the United States , Buenos Aires has no dole , relief , or bread lines , but a balanced budget for two years to come . ( Buenos Aires Herald ? 12 - 10 - 37 ) . Behind this economic prosperity lie some hidden truths . Possibly biological . Argentine emigrants brought with them a heritage and living standards of many generations according to their class and kind , which they have been content to maintain in their new land of adoption . Be the family calling in tile , brick or stone work ; garden , orchard or farm ; cattle , horses or sheep ;  | metal , leather or fabric factory , they have carried on the vocation . Standards of living and habits of life were enhanced but not pauperized by living beyond their means and station . " Dollar down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The vagaries of splurge and splendor had no appeal . The blood of generations in their veins was content with the freedom and opportunity to accrue rather than exist in the new land . Pay-as-you-go and live-as-you-can soon found them drinking from the horn of plenty . Willing , thrifty , schooled hands fashioned Argentina 's raw material into finished products by men who knew their trades . Marble sidewalks laid in mosaic patterns ; variegated colored tile floors and walls ; marble statuary and buildings ; brick , cement and stucco edifices grew from the technique of artisans happy and content with full-time checks . These people climbed the ladder of achievement by testing each round instead of flitting from job to job in search of a soft-spot . Their road was open and they knew the toll of effort to reach a cherished destination . Pull and politics did not pave it . Cotton and wool , meat and hides , wheat and corn , were raw material pouring out of the Argentina ports for foreign lands , where labor and modern machinery converted them into finished products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as exports to be bought back as shoes and leather goods , processed under patented foreign machinery . Far-sighted financiers placed young Argentinans in the foreign factories as apprentices to the trades .  | Argentina is now making her own shoes out of her hides tanned by the native quebracho bark , that is opening up a new avenue for labor . The human comforts , luxuries and amusements of the city of Buenos Aires form a magnet to the Argentina citizenry , for which it must supply employment , as better than a sixth of the nation 's people now live within its boundaries . Each decade witnesses the inauguration of other factories to utilize potential wealth of the prolific land . The United States automobile industry has entered the rich commercial field with Ford 's assembly plant , which represents the largest American colony in Argentina . By 1942 it is estimated that the International Highway , 12,080 miles , will be completed to Buenos Aires , as 8,595 miles of all-weather road has been built and 2,300 miles of dirt road ready to be surfaced . This CanadaArgentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sale of American manufacturing machinery to Argentina is gradually reducing our exports of manufactured products . These new Argentine industries absorb any slack that may accrue in labor quota . Overproduction of manufactured articles for local consumption apparently has not reached the saturation point , when a million contented employed populace must burn midnight oil to spend their wage . Full-time on half-pay and intermediate gear speed is producing an accepted product by contented men in Argentina . The marketing of United States manufactured cotton goods in Latin America has decreased 40% while the Japanese product has increased 900% . The enviable lap-  | anese fleet of merchant vessels transports the raw cotton from Argentina , Peru , and their quota of the six million acres of cotton in Brazil ( where it will grow six years without replanting ) to Japan , where from 8c to 14c a day labor processes the cotton into commodity needs of the Argentine .

In 1936 over four million cattle , five and a quarter million sheep and a million and a quarter hogs passed through Argentina 's slaughter houses . Among the nine packing companies in Buenos Aires , one is the largest in the world with a daily capacity of 5,000 head of cattle and 10,000 sheep . On the inception of an Incorporated Packing Co. , owned and controlled by estanciero-producers , the market advanced 11% . Twenty-two cents a kilo paid their overhead expense and twenty-eight cents made money for the estancieros . Their stockyard methods of selling cattle has its advantages . Private sales are in order up to 10,00 A.M. , when commission men court the buyers of big packing companies , showing their consignments and consummating sales . At ten o'clock a gong rings and auctioneers take charge of the unsold livestock , which are auctioned rapidly through the bidding system . From an elevated walk skirting the long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the troupe of mounted buyers , who follow from pen to pen until the offerings of the day are all sold . It is there in those lanes that you find the keenest judges of livestock that the packing companies can secure . By far the largest percentage of these seasoned buyers originated on the United States ranges and markets . I t is imperative that they know flesh and classification , shrinkage and weights , as on their judgment and quick decision depends the company 's success . A drouth in Argentina was forcing unmatured cattle on the Buenos Aires market in the spring of 1938 , causing a sacrifice of young half-fat heifers and calves that cut deep into future production . Argentina 's mean temperature of 58 degrees are figures derived from semi-tropic to the Horn districts , covering 2,300 miles toward the Antarctic , where one third of the area is too dry to raise crops without irrigation . Although not susceptible to frequent drouths like Australia , the Argentine must fight locust scourges . I n the year 1924 , 165,000 tons of locusts were destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells , dammed streams and horses and sheep ate them for sustenance . The foot and mouth disease breaks out at intervals in spotted districts to annoy the even tenure of estancia life . Long experience with this malady of cattle gives the estanciero as much concern as a herd of sheep with the scab . Segregated until it has run its course like the measles , the death loss is seldom more than one percent of the herd infected , with only five percent contracting the disease . An instance of a herd of heifers in an iso-  | lated pasture having the foot and mouth disease twice in six months with no deaths , seems to bear out the theory that in time , cattle of a district become immune , or only have it in a mild form , analogous to variloid as a form of smallpox in the human family . I n Holland they stand the affected animal in water until the fever subsides , which prevents contamination of the mouth in licking infected feet . Practical stockmen in South America have a theory that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conditions and plant growth from this soil , the dormant germ comes to life to infect livestock . When only cattle in one pasture are contaminated while adjoining livestock escape , there seems logic in this conclusion . Packer buyers must be alert to the symptoms to prevent an entire loss of the carcass , as the fever melts the tallow , then the melted tallow permeates the tissues , and a prime beef goes to the soap or fertilizer vat . The United State restrictions against the foot and mouth disease is a thorn in our commercial relations with Argentina , which the two trade experts recently sent to South America by the State Department , will need gloved hands to handle . The chilled beef restrictions of Europe have been instrumental in Argentina producting a super-carcass to meet the trade requirements . When Italy and Germany can contract ten million pounds of beef while England is Argentina 's best customer , some idea can be formed of the uniformity of the Argentina beef product . We may claim that our " best is better " but their  | whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the main estancias for fifty years . A 22 to 24 month old steer that weighs from 1,050 to 1100 lbs . off of green feed , did not have a Mexican cow as a near ancestor . Unlike Queensland , Australia , the Pampas have only two poisonous snakes and they are rare . Neither has the dingo any relatives on the Pampas . Dry-farming was tried in western Argentina with bad results . They were compelled to rest the land so that it could revert back to the natural grasses , which is but a replica of the cycle of the sod of other countries . The diversity of the natural grasses of the cattle areas of Argentina , make it possible to run more stock per acre , partly due to the excess in rainfall over United States ranges . However there seems to be an opening for our Department of Agriculture to experiment in the introduction of these seeds on grazing areas in the United States , and reduce the ratio now in favor of Argentina and Uruguay . I f we can run more cattle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce the forage crops on the lands ruined by the dry-farming fiasco on acreage the size of the State of Kansas . A consignment of Argentina grass seed was sent to Houston , Texas two years ago , that may result in creating a new export commodity for Argentina similar to the browntop seed of New Zealand which is successfully sodding the golf courses of the Pacific Coast . Berries of all kinds are conspicuous by their scarcity in both Argentina and Uruguay , creating an opportunity for horticulture experimentation . Whether climate , soil , or lack of enterprise is the cause , solved it would mean a fortune for someone as the populace is fond of fruit and  | depends primarily on the Rio Negro irrigation district of Argentina for its supply . Apples and pears grown there are of fine quality and flavor , while back in the foothills of the Cordilleras of Patagonia , the wild apple grows . The climate of Argentina is more severe in winter than Southern California , although in the latitude of 30 to 35 degrees south . The winters are more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cold wind sweeping up across the unprotected plains from the Antarctic . Ice often freezes to one half inch thick and fireplaces are comfortable . A major problem of the North American in South America is the schooling of their children .

In time matured North Americans roll their " R 's " unconsciously .  | AN ARGENTINA ESTANCIA A SECRET DESIRE of many cattle men is to see an Argentina Estancia where cattle are handled by the thousands . The desire was planted there in school days when the geography taught that the pampas produced cattle for their hides and tallow . It took me 10,000 miles from home to satisfy the longing of a lifetime , to find the fertile pampa a vast checker-board of big farms , the pampa-grass of white flags so scarce it was a curiosity in its native land , and the glamorous gaucho but a memory . Argentina 's natural home of cattle has yielded to the advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A three and a half hour airplane ride westward from Buenos Aires spreads out below you a quilted plain where man 's ingenuity has helped Dame Nature in her patch-work . For varied coloring , they have used rye , wheat , oats , corn and barley for the lighter shades ; purple flax and green alfalfa for darker hues , with the native grass pastures blending into a harmonious vista . For bordering thread the wise old Dame and man whipped her patches together with long lines of blending colors of the many varieties of gum trees , while for the decoration of special blocks , orchards and chinaberry trees add beauty to the design . Long , straight lines of dusty-red roads lose continuity at varied inter-sections where tree-hid and blotted-  | out , they are temporarily lost in small towns that are clustered around the inevitable plaza . For 200 miles west of Buenos Aires , you find a second Imperial Valley , California , minus the irrigation canals . The pampas proper is about 500 by 600 miles , but the 40 inch yearly average rainfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger than half of the United States with 39% of its total crops in alfalfa , or more than 21 million acres , is primarily a live-stock nation regardless of its wheat reputation . There exists a fraternity of men in the western half of the United States who have survived for a century without a charter . Their constitution and by-laws are written in their hearts , and their pass-words the idioms of the range . They speak a language all their own , mastered through hard contact with nature in the raw . Public office has been thrust upon them without regard to political ties , by reason of their character and creed founded on the brotherhood of man . Ex-Governor , Billy Adams of Colorado , perpetual official representative of the whole people ; Will Rogers , the most beloved man of his day ; Teddy Roosevelt , with his driving initiative born on the Wyoming range ? are samples of this unchartered fraternity . These rangemen were trained in a hard school . They have drifted far afield in search of new range , where others of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big packing companies of Uruguay and Argentina were schooled on our western ranges . They greet you with keen eyes and a hearty handshake . When sure that you belong to the fraternity , they pass you  | around to the other brothers who have drifted off the home range . Fortunately , I had preceded these men on both the ranges of Colorado and Montana , which gave us much in common in reminiscence . Proudly , Red Cosgrove showed me a blue criollo ( native ) horse which he had ridden for two years in the Buenos Aires stockyards , that was from the same herd as the noted horse ridden from Buenos Aires to Washington , D.C. , in the space of two years . The pure-blood native wild horse of the pampas , is as scarce in the Pampas today , as is the real Morgan horse in the States . A day spent a horseback with Redmond Cosgrove in the Buenos Aires stockyards , where 11,936 cattle were on sale , gave me a cross-section view of Argentina cattle . Forty years ago , the Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn our methods in agriculture and stock-raising . Thomas Funes , ( whose uncle was at that time , President of Argentina ) and Ernest Sola ( Father mayor of Salta ) . They graduated from the University of Ohio in 1905 . While students of the State Agricultural College of Colorado , they spent ten days with me on a round-up to learn our methods of handling cattle on the open range . After 35 years , I wrote these men of my intended visit to the Argentina and expressed the desire to see an Argentina Estancia which represented their best methods of handling cattle . On arrival in Buenos Aires , I found a letter from Mr. Sola of Salta , stating that Mr. Funes had died two months previously and that it was regrettably impossible for him to meet me in Buenos Aires .  | 1600 kilos away , but that Dr. Morino , who was also a graduate of the University of Ohio , would meet me in the office of the United States Department of Agriculture in Buenos Aires and arrange for the estancia visit . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department of Agriculture , Dr. Morino and Redmond Cosgrove , it was arranged for me to visit one of the best estancias in all Argentina . It was shipping 400 fat steers a week to Buenos Aires market . Big , jovial , competent Paul Nyhus had a standing invitation from Sr. Pedro LaCou , the estancia owner , to pay him a visit , so he insisted that we make it a combined inspection of one of the prize ranches in Argentina . The appointment was made through long distance telephone with Mr. LaCou , and that evening we took a sleeper for the 200 mile ride westward , where we were met the following morning by Mr. LaCou 's chauffeur and driven to the quaint old hotel in the town of Lincoln for breakfast . Many articles have been written on the estancia by newspaper correspondents and gifted writers in the magazine field , but few as seen by an old cowman . A lifetime spent on varied ranges , creates a back-ground from which comparisons may be drawn that the technical writer is not qualified to make . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three estancias , Mr. LaCou insisted that we have dinner with him and his enviable wife in their modern estancia home . We lingered long over cocktails , discussing topics of interest to stockmen . On the road to the railroad station that night , where we took the train at one o'clock , Paul said :  | " Mr. LaCou told me that it had been a great pleasure to him in showing his cattle and estancias to a man who understood what he was talking about , instead of being greeted with such exclamations as Oh , how wonderful ' or How romantic . ' " It is attention to the little details in a stockman 's life , in giving the individual touch that brings success to his business . Although a young man , Mr. LaCou is a profound student of the problems which beset a calling he inherited from an old estancia name . Eagerly he accepted four features of the stock business practiced in the States , upon which I was fortunate enough to be informed , as a partial reciprocation for the new ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Mr. LaCou 's business can only be grasped by the statement of a few figures . They own 80,750 acres in the heart of the best district of the Pampas , which is capable of supporting a head to two acres . The four Estancias in the MITIKILI section comprise 46. - 750 acres on which he is running 20,000 head of cattle and fattens 13,000 steers a year . These ranches are divided into 94 pastures , fenced with seven-wires and all stock is watered by windmills drawing water from 12 to 24 foot depths . Four thousand acres in alfalfa furnishes the finishing feed for steers , and hay as winter food when needed , as it can be cut three times a year without any irrigation , for the average rainfall is 40 inches a season . Two hundred fifty men were being employed in different departments of the estancias . Over 50 modern , well painted buildings are parked around in the shady grove of eucalyptus trees at Mitikili . The homes of the  | general manager , bookkeeper and secretary would be a credit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer home is the model of a country gentleman 's estate with its broad , well kept lawns and shrubbery . A modern winter home is maintained in Buenos Aires . Sr. Pedro LaCou has a little hobby ? only 2000 head of pure-bred and registered Durham cows and 600 head of bulls . One side of his palatial home is decorated under glass with huge silver cups won by their breed of shorthorns . It is a family heritage handed down to each succeeding generation of LaCous . Pedro must be a college man with a scientific education , for he fluently gave the botanical names of various grasses and discussed the chemistry of soils as easily as he gave the pedigrees of long lines of stalled cattle being prepared for the livestock shows . Pedigreed reds and roans were bedded in bright straw that rested on two by four timbers spaced two inches apart , set edgewise making a ventilated floor , resting on posts three feet above the ground . It was just one of those details that a magazine writer might miss . The unique construction gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With 100 pedigreed red and roan Durham bulls , he breeds for a special type through classification . The demand today in Argentina is for the low , compact animal , so he is pulling his breeding stock " down out of the air . " Two year old Crittenden Bobby cost Mr. La Cou 23,000 pesos . Three year old Eatanciaer cost 9000 pesos and weighs 950 kilos , or nearly 2100 lbs . These bulls are built like bullets . They are small samples of the money  | he puts into his herd , as previously Mr. LaCou paid 42,000 pesos for a champion bull that only got him two calves . One of them which we saw , had spent the first four months of its life wrapped in cotton-wool to save it . Some time ago , Mr. LaCou paid 60,000 pesos for a champion bull . The record price paid for a champion Durham , was made in 1925 when Mr. Ginnoochion 's bid was 152,000 pesos . In 1935 , an Argentinean paid 115,000 pesos . A bull is cross-bred when he is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep reds are preferred over the roans . Mr LaCou 's two year old bulls bring 600 pesos for reds and 500 for roans . When the reds grow light in color , the deep red is re-established in the get , by crossing with a roan . To get the maximum results out of his best bulls , Mr. LaCou has adapted an efficiency system , which has increased their breeding capacity 5% with a larger calfcrop . The bulls are stall-fed in daytime and turned into the alfalfa fields with cows at night . Beef-cows with suckling calves , is an Argentina reality as shown by accompanying photo . Great rolls of fat hung on this cow 's hips , although the calf is her own . To reach this acme of development in cattle in the Argentine , a brief resume of their history is appropriate . When Mendoza founded Buenos Aires in 1535 , he brought cattle from Spain , which by 1810 had populated the pampas with wild cattle . I t was then a general Roundup was started and the wild cattle were killed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the buffalo of our plains . Carquin , the first imported shorthorn to Argentina ,  | was brought in by John Miller in 1840 and crossed with the longhorn wild cattle from which the cross was given their name ? Carquina . With Carquin , came the wire fence to Argentina . In 1885 Thomas Dugan bought the pedigreed Crookshank herd of 200 head in Scotland and shipped it to Argentina . From that nucleus has grown the famous Bernard Dugan herd of Durham cattle of the Argentine : " Crittenden Bobby " is a sample . See photo . A ratio of nine shorthorns to one hereford in the Argentine indicates it to be the natural home of the Durham cattle . They bull the cows in October and November . Calves cut , branded and dehorned at a week-old produces better results and a smoother steer for the export trade . Land in the Mitikili district where the best Argentina grasses grow , known as Bromus Unioloides and Bromus Schoaderi , is valued at from 250 to 300 pesos a hectare , ( 2.47 acres ) which rents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return of 20 pesos a hectare shows a profit on the investment .  | URUGUAY URUGUAY , SOUTH America , investigated on a seven month survey , showed more to offer range men of the United States , than any country of the southern hemisphere . Many factors enter into this conclusion . They will be considered in detail , in order to enable a reader to form his own opinion . The added benefit of having investigated Uruguay in 1935 , made it feasible to draw comparisons with other range countries in 1937-1938 . Two months of practical experience on an exemplary estancia in the heart of the rich , black lands of Uruguay , adds authenticity to the details that cover the technique of the successful estanciero ( rancher ) . A brief resume of this pastoral country of 72,153 sq . mi. is beneficial in laying the background of its people : discovered in 1515 by Juan Diaz de Solis when he entered the Rio Plata , his entire party was killed by the Charrua Indians when he landed in Uruguay , claiming the land for the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternately claimed the territory for two centuries , but it was finally ceded to Spain October 1st , 1777 . Jose Artigas proclaimed Uruguay independence by defeating the troops of Spain on May 18 , 1811 . Thirteen years later , May 9th , 1824 , Brazil annexed the territory through force . The Uruguayans again regained their independence and established a constitutional congress , and by July 18 , 1830 , ratified a  | constitution and elected their first President that year . The main boulevard of Montevideo is named 18th de Julio in honor of their independence . The President is elected for a four-year term and is not eligible for re-election until eight years have elapsed . He must be a native . April 19th , 1934 a Constitutional Assembly of 284 members adopted a new constitution which provides for a Chamber of 99 Deputies elected by the provinces , according to population ; a Senate of 30 members elected by the people as a whole ? 15 from the party polling the largest vote , 15 from the party with the next largest vote . Suffrage is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Foreigners may become naturalized citizens without losing their former citizenship . This new constitution is very modern in its legislation , providing for old age pensions , child welfare , state care of mothers , free medical attention for the poor , workman 's accident insurance , cheap dwellings for labor , an eight-hour day and a six-day week , a minimum wage and special consideration for employed women and minors . There is no capital punishment in Uruguay . Complete religious tolerance with Church and State separate . Education compulsory , with 16,987 in the University of Montevideo in 1935 . The peso is the unit of currency with a gold par value of $1.03 , with an average value the past five years of 80 cents . The estimated government income for 1936-37 was $83,245,000 while its expenditures were $83,227,784.  | In 1935 , customs handled $59,959,572 imports and $95,365,862 exports . Of this , the United States furnished $6,222,911 imports and received 86,887,268 exports . The $12,000,000 Government Capitol Building where Congress meets is built of native stone and marble . Its beauty and workmanship in architectural @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courteous attendants , imposing location , leave with one a memory that never fades . Elections give all citizens , whether natural or legal , who are 18 years of age , the right to vote . Red and white flags denote the two leading parties , similar to the Democrats and Republicans in the United States . The Red party is in no sense communistic as interpreted in other lands . The history of these two dominating political parties since independence was declared , is typical of the predominant Spanish blood . Fiery oratory and promised patronage evolved Presidential assassinations and internal revolutions , where bullets and keen knives left bloody splotches over the purple land . They took no prisoners . There was no pacifist party ? one side or the other was the only choice of rural manpower when the revolutionists rode in . Cunningham Graham , Dr. Whitfield Ray , Wing and other able writers have recorded in their works episodes of revolutionary days that are but echoes of the character of the Spanish in war , as were enacted each day in the annihilation of Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so . It is believable . Their loves  | and hates become their whole existence . History seems to bear this out . A revolutionary chapter in Uruguayan history before the turn of the century records the economy-of-war , by cutting all prisoners throats before the assembled captors . Besides saving the expense of holding , feeding and guarding the prisoner , the gruesome spectacle served as an example for any of the company who might choose to change their political views . For a renowned prisoner of the opposing faction , special consideration was shown by sewing him up alive in a green beefhide , to be deposited in a colony of red-ant hills as a cemetery for his bones after the ferocious ants had picked them . With two presidents assassinated , we are still ahead of Uruguay with the assassination of Lincoln , Garfield and McKinley . Bands of revolutionists roaming over the campo ( country ) collecting recruits and forage , were a source of much concern to the estancieros , as they commandeered all broke horses , foodstocks and fresh meat from the herds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , but hiring riding stock and team from the trabajadores . Those owners who had good horses kept them hidden away in some back pasture with only oldskates at the home ranch . Alternating administrations of Reds and Whites in the political history of Uruguay show a very even balance of following , where the personality of the president in power acts as the governor of the political machinery . Baldomir , elected president March 1938 , is of the Red party and promises to be a benefit to the estanciero interest . The campaign was a family affair as the pre-  | ceding president ' was a relative . Political rallies , radio speeches , parades and float advertising were much in evidence , similar to the political propaganda of an election in the United States . However , the parades with banners and mass meetings and fiery speeches during Holy Week , in protest of the war in Spain , far surpassed the display of the presidential election . Sympathizers and refugees from the Spanish War either paraded the streets or thronged the sidewalks and beautiful parks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each with its Capital and Administrative Officers elected by popular vote . Each department is represented in the Senate of the Republic , with Representatives in the other House . A senator must be 33 and a representative 25 years of age , and both must be natives or legal citizens . In 1930 , 96% of the national exports were derived from the livestock industry . By 1938 , manufacturing and agriculture had advanced until 82.35% of the national income was from livestock . LAws . It stands to reason , borne out by fact , that the laws enacted by a pastoral populace , cover and protect the livestock interests from every angle . Government banks , railroads and wharfs , cater to the convenience and economic benefits of the livestock producer . Broad fenced lanes spread over Uruguay like cobwebs where the feed is reserved exclusively for trail drives . These even parallel the surfaced highways for 200 miles with Government pastures located at convenient intervals in order that the trail-herds may water and graze for the night .  | A long stock-train is loaded in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chute . The end doors of one stockcar serve as a passageway to the next car , by opening horizontally , while the doors to the adjoining car opens vertically . This converts the entire train into one long lane . The herd of beef cattle are driven into this chain of cars and cut off into carload lots by closing the intervening doors . No bruised hip bones on car door corners . Further protection from bruising are the air-cushioned bumpers between adjoining stock cars which absorb the jar of starting and stopping the long train . Mortgage loans through the Government Bank of 60% of the appraised land value on a 30 year amortization plan , offer equitable financing to the estanciero . The Government Bank issues the 7% mortgages . They are sold on the stock exchange , sometimes at a discount . The interest is payable semi-annually with the following distribution : 1% amortization that pays out in 30 years ; 1% charge for handling the business ; 5% interest to the Government Bank on the bonds . Fluctuations of the mortgage bond market offer an opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par . TAXES . There are no taxes on personal property in Uruguay , as a further evidence of who made the laws . This is a salient feature of the livestock industry of Uruguay . Neither are the land taxes excessive , as the country is primarily supported by export and import duties . The land tax on close to 3500 acres of rich land was 750 pesos a year ( $310 ) which , with the improvement and livestock represented an 80,000 peso invest-  | ment . ( Exchange varies from $2.20 to $2.40 ? 1938 ) . Laws for the protection of life and property are not superficial , but exacting . The people are proverbially honest . No hold-ups or bank robberies in Uruguay . Petty thievery among the peons is a grave offense with them , and instances are practically negligible . The custom of paying in cash in the canzpo , instead of by check as practiced in the United States , requires much currency for payrolls on the personnel of the estancieros , and in their homes . The contents of money belts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27,000 sheep are sold to the high bidder , would start a small bank in the U. S. A. Pocket bank rolls , capable of paying for a herd of cattle or sheep are protected through inbred honesty , respect for the law , and the past records of these sales . The career of a modern gunman in Uruguay is short-lived . The aforementioned features are but a few of the outstanding Government factors that show the trend of laws beneficial to a pastoral commonwealth . Uruguay 's century of practical experience has evolved laws and customs governing the livestock industry that other range countries can well adopt . This little pastoral republic of South America is found on the world 's map in the northwest corner of the intersection of 30 degrees south latitude with 50 degrees south longitude west of Greenwich . Sydney of New South Wales , Australia , Capetown of South Africa , and Montevideo , Uruguay hang close to the parallel while Newfoundland , Guianas and Uruguay are in a north and south line . Comparisons leave mental pictures when figures are  | lost to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burden the memory where a familiar analogy becomes a matter of fact . To appreciate the climatic assets , richness of the soil , and the carrying capacity of livestock of year-round green-grass lands of the entire productive acreage of Uruguay , a comparison with other areas is impressive . Uruguay is larger than England and Scotland , but smaller than Nebraska . Using the livestock census of 1935 , Uruguay is carrying more cattle and sheep than England and Nebraska combined , although England has 23,017,259 head . Uruguay lies between the parallel of 30 degrees and 35 degrees south latitude , which correspond with the ones in north latitude that passes close to New Orleans , Houston , Austin and reaches the Pacific 200 miles south of San Diego , California , while 35 degrees north contacts Mojave , California and Amarillo , Texas . Uruguay has the contour of a fat pear . Folded-over on top of Texas with Montevideo at Amarillo , the Brazilian stem would reach the Rio Grande . There , the comparison ends , as snow is unknown in Montevideo where green grass and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Uruguay winter is 55 , of summer 72 , and the average annual of around 62 . There is no regulation of seasons in Uruguay as it rains every month in the year , which accounts for its well-watered rolling plains covered with 55 varieties of stock grasses , all under fence with practically no waste lands in the republic . The topography is composed of a network of water courses divided by undulating hills and low ridges , ex-  | cept in the north where timbered hills may reach 2000 ft. above sea-level . Lime , granite and marble croppings furnish the needs of building material , with certain soils suitable for building-brick which is the universal construction of the estancieros modern homes . So well watered is the country that fencing can be so aligned as to provide living stock water in nearly every pasture . The subdivision and survey of the lands of Uruguay are a radical change to the custom in the United States . Instead of being divided into sections , townships and ranges , the water course and dividing ridges regulate one 's holdings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads hold to the ridges that wind over the weaving , rolling plains , avoiding the outlay for expensive bridges . Modern highway construction , ushered-in by the automobile , has deviated from ridge-routes in favor of alignment on the primary highways , but in the Campo , the roads still follow the ridges that divide the water-runoff and establish property boundary lines . These broad fenced lanes are the property of the State where the grass is reserved exclusively for trailing herds . The adjoining land-owner has no right whatever to graze the protected feed and is subject to a penalty should the mounted police find him trespassing , except in transit , with stock . A map of the deeded lands looks like a patch-quilt instead of a checkerboard . Neither can a land-owner hog all of a stream . The partition fence between him and his neighbor must provide for living water on both sides of the structure .  | Within your own boundary lines , fence as you like , but the Government has so wisely subdivided the pasture area that range is contiguous to stock-water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without a poll tax being levied . Off of the main highway , the public reverts to the expediency of breaking a new track when erosion and wear wrecks the old one . Politics and pull seem to govern whether it is a trail or a highway that leads to your door . In unusually wet seasons the black land turns into a bog where harvesters get swamped in the grain fields , and the crop is dissipated to the elements for want of opportunity to harvest . Tree-lined streams pencil the grass-map of weaving plains , and denote the slope of the country . Hither and yon on the pastoral landscapes are clusters of chinaberry , locust and eucalyptus , which shade high knolls that overlook an estancia . Peeping from the green sheath of trees are commodious brick homes stuccoed in white and capped in red tile . Dense domestic groves dot the pastures where sheep and cattle may hide from the midday sun . The gradual fall in the topography of the country permits of long inveigling lagoons where catfish , water fowl and the native carpincho propagate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wild pigeon find a safe retreat from ravenous hawks , whose favorite torture is picking the eyes out of mired sheep or cattle . Once blinded , the victim is at their mercy to be devoured piece-meal at their leisure . These fierce hawks are a grave menace to sheepmen . I f the birds of prey  | locate a swamped sheep first , the " capataz " of the estancia can only take its pelt ? the eyes are gone . The gentle contours of the pasture lands of Uruguay are unfavorable to erosion . The matted sod holds in abeyance the 38 inches of annual rainfall to be absorbed by the spongy black soil . The red lands , that abound in the draws , are heavier , less susceptible to the ravages of water currents . There , are also found , the denser sods . In the equitable distribution of the red and black soils of its pastures , lies one of the most enticing features of the stock industry of Uruguay . They are responsible for green grass all the year round . Certain varieties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and winter temperatures as their growing season . Other types of forage are at their best in the black soil and propagate their seeds under summer temperatures . Cardo asnal , a type of thistle of sunflower proportions , is the best land mark of areas of the rich black soil . The larger the growth , the better the land . The long low ridges of black lands of the watersheds of the Bequelo and Cololo streams in the Province of Soriano , are considered as part of the most prolific soils of Uruguay . Gramilla , the finest fattening grass of the republic , predominates in this district , due to the soil and climatic conditions . This deep black loam has been known to produce three crops of potatoes in one year . Alfalfa takes kindly to the black loam but fails to respond on the red . Likewise , other agricultural crops flourish on the dark ridges , while the lower red lands knit a dense sod impervious to the close-cropping of sheep . Plowing of the strong inclines of black lands in-  | vites the demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy rainfall . When one inch of violent rainfall deposits 22,600 gallons of water on every acre of land , only matted vegetation can prevent a runoff . Given an incline , the black loam dissolves like sugar , to the plowpan . Even contour furrowing will not hold it in place . " That nature has a cure for every ill " is accepted by the estanciero when he attempts skin-surgery on the afflicted hide of the earth . He is willing to gamble with nine out of ten chances in his favor . Through dry seasons , locust attacks and the resultant overstocking of pastures , the two cardo thistles , ( both of them poisonous to livestock in certain stages of their growth ) convert the rich black loams to their own individual use , killing out other vegetation through sapping the soil , or eventually smothering the undergrowth in dense shade . Mowing , when the thistles are in bloom , temporarily defers their conquest of the land . The estancerios of the level pampas of Argentine , have devised a heavy rolling cylinder three feet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by universal joints , permitting the rollers to hug the ground-level . This huge roller is shod with sharp knives at eight inch intervals , similar to the shoes on tractor wheels . This machine is pushed forward like a bull-rake , as the thistles will cut the hair and skin from horses legs , which often times are laced with leather leggings to protect them . This heavy roller pushed over the land at blooming time , cuts the thistles into eight inch lengths to lie on the ground and decay . Destroyed for the season with the  | seed killed in the bloom , a new lease on life is given the undergrowth that has survived . When these damaging thistles reach the stage of control of the black loam hills and ridges of Uruguay , the estanciero plows the areas and seeds them to grain for the season . Before the plants stool , is the one chance in ten that they risk against the worst enemy of good lands ? erosion . It is at that period that torrential rains cut deep gashes in the rich loam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danger period , the grain crop kills the cardo and the entire area goes back to the native grasses . Hence , the " cycle of the sod " begins a new rotation of time , in nature 's effort to supply the range for livestock , which , favored by the slight fall of the country and abundance of rainfall , combined with the 55 varieties of stock grasses , perpetuates the rolling sodded plains of Uruguay . The topography of Uruguay is economically enhanced by its intricate water ways that permeate the entire land like the sutures of a broad plant-leaf . No large areas are without living stock water . I t is doubtful whether there exists on the face of the globe , a similar acreage of grazing land as well-watered as entire Uruguay . Almost completely bounded by ocean and rivers , the larger rivers being navigable for ocean-going vessels drawing from nine to fourteen feet draft , the tributary streams ferret the back country to the boundary of Brazil . The river Uruguay alone supplies ten ports for ocean vessels . The benefits of cheap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuts the freight costs of products of the interior , reached by over 700 miles of navigable rivers . The Rio Negro , formed on the northeast corner of Uruguay , near the Brazilian border , practically bisects the republic on its south of west course to the Uruguay River . At the port of Mercedes in the province of Soriano , it is a quarter of a mile wide , where river vessels fill their holds with flax , oats and wheat for transportation to European ports , their cargo being reloaded to ocean going vessels on the River Plata . Midway between its mouth and Brazil and close to the geographical center of the republics , the Government is constructing a large dam to produce hydro-electric power that will supply the interior towns and be transmitted to Montevideo . This is but a nibble at the potential values of this beautiful tree-lined river , which penetrates the heart of an uncommercialized agricultural empire , where stock raising is the main industry and irrigation unknown . Uruguayans have only scratched its agricultural possibilities , being content to follow the livestock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cereal foodstuffs at a price that surpasses the returns from livestock , an agricultural awakening will pour streams of gold into the Treasury of Uruguay , as the agricultural products of the Pampas contributed to the building of a city of two and a half millions on the banks of the Plata at Buenos Aires . The people of Uruguay one contacts in the livestock industry , are of the peon and the cultured classes , each with distinctive standards , habits , characteristics and modes of living .  | The dominating population of Uruguay sprang from Europe , primarily from southern Europe with a sprinkling of the peon ancestors coming from the Canary Islands . This cross with the native Indian gives a darker complexion to certain of the peons who serve in the more menial walks of life . Their language is Spanish , similar to the dialect of the peons of Mexico . Many are schooled in the rudiments of education attained in the provincial schools . With an innate respect for the cultured class , these peons are a valuable asset to the economic values of Uruguay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are content with what their position in life has to offer in joys and benefits , as equitable laws have been enacted to protect their social security . The peon does not sit down at the family table in deference to class distinction . They either cook their own food , or it is supplied from the kitchen to be eaten in their own quarters . He has not been spoiled by false standards of living beyond his power to attain as no " dollar-down and dollar-a-week " financing has entered his realm . A certain fortitude to hardships is part of the peon character . Houses thatched with grass roofs do not permit of indoor fires , so they do their cooking in the open . They work , sing and whistle in a drizzling rain in preference to losing the time . Drenched to the skin , their hardy bodies in a covering of wool clothing , are as immune to colds as were the sheep that grew the fabric . Their only change is a coat of sunshine and sweat at such times . The peons of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the technique of their work , content to  | begin at sunup and quit at sundown , with a two hour siesta at midday , when they sleep or sup mate as a pastime . As the cow-puncher packs his six-shooter , so does the peon carry his long sheathed knife in the hollow of his back . It is his constant companion on the estancias . Of more service than a gun , it fills innumerable applications in the course of a day . Dexterously they will carve tidbits from a roasted sheep shank and pick their teeth with the sharp point ; chop the root of a poisonous plant or clean a plow-share ; take the hide from a sheep or trim even rope-strands from a cowhide . The peon is unusually adept in using his feet as a vise , instead of his hands . Much of their accoutrement is made from self-tanned hides . House-help is clean , capable and reliable , ever ready to join in a spirit of fun , as amusement on an estancia is limited to its personnel . Maids and cooks receive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estancia get from 12 to 24 pesos a month including their keep . I t takes a versatile peon capable of serving as a teamster or gaucho to merit 24 pesos , which , with the exchange at 82.40 would be $10.00 a month . Unlike the roaming footpads or hitch-hikers of the United States , the transient peon or gaucho is an exception , as the estancia help is recruited from established local families of good repute . Americans venturing into the estancia life , can secure a trustworthy " capataz " and wife for 50 pesos a month , capable of handling the investment . These men know all the answers to successful management . Born and raised in the business , their experience alone is wor-  | thy of their hire , relieving the investor of the danger of expensive mistakes . Pride in the position , loyalty to employer , knowledge of the peon character , poison plants and diseases fatal to livestock , rotation of crops and seasons , customs of the country and its people , also their laws , are but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes his services indispensable to a new investor . The cultured strata of Uruguayans embody all of the refinements found in the best homes of the United States . There is no reason it could be otherwise , as Spanish , Scotch , Irish , English , German , French , Italian and Portugese names were the foundation of the republic . Jose Pedro Varela was a strong advocate of schooling , and made a journey to the United States where he studied our education system , later inaugurating it in Uruguay . He imported 40 teachers from the United States , and they have left their imprint upon Uruguay education facilities . This was in 1877 and 1879 when Varela served as the ninth President of Uruguay . Over 16,000 students in the University of Montevideo in 1935 gives sufficient evidence of their hunger for learning . Compulsory schooling adds to a high type of citizenship . The estanciero loves his home . Stained glass , tiled floors , showers and baths , hot and cold water under pressure , electric lights and radio , hark of the city ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , French , English , etc. authors reach understanding readers . The Breeder 's Gazette , Pastoral Review and  | Reader 's Digest come from the foreign world to keep the estanciero abreast of the times . For $1.50 a month , the telephone connects the estancia with the town twenty-five miles away and permits communication with the surrounding estancias , while long distance contacts Montevideo markets . So , through a medium of the telephone , radio , magazines and books , the isolated estanciero 's mind is on a broad-gauge ready to take on any mental-freight that comes to his station . University training has paved the way . His knowledge of plant life and soils , crops and markets , livestock diseases , breeds , blood and lineage has a technical foundation enhanced by practical experience . The evening meal is practically a social family function . A shower , shave and clean linen and vermouth chase fatigue away , and a meal in courses spiked with convivial conversation knits the ties closer that depict a happy family . Individuality is the natural sequence of the free life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love of liberty , the fruits of their calling . With these salient characteristics , is woven an innate love of life and its joys . The combination makes the estanciero an admirable host , who makes you feel at home through lack of pretense and unnecessary conventionality . A custom of the country , of clapping your hands on arrival at the home gate , brings some member of the family to greet you . It warns the household of company and protects the visitor from fierce dogs . Upon departure the entire family assemble to bid you farewell . The renowned hospitality of the Spanish people has lost none of its distinction on the far away isolated  | estancia of Uruguay . Tea-time is a function which permits of animated conversation and an exchange of ideas and experience pertinent to their calling . An hour 's discussion on the merits of grasses , certain breeds of sheep or cattle , uncovers a technical understanding that one would expect from an agricultural college professor .

Be it climate , race , food , child raising or all combined , Uruguay can boast of the most handsome children as a whole to be found in any land . On the side residence streets of Montevideo , or isolated estancia , they impress you like rays of sunlight at dawn . Even-featured , healthy glow of the skin , and love of life in their clear eyes , are the nuclei around which the radiant vivacious youth is grown . Endowed with the rich gifts of nature , it has taken the Spanish mother 's instincts to create a work of art . Politeness is inborn . . . There is a distinctiveness in the children at play . A whole-hearted abandon to the joy in hand . Oblivious to surroundings , alert with a glint in the eyes that " shows there coursed in those blue veins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vintage of old Spain . " There is possibly no feature more important in a foreign country where a young man anticipates making his home , than the native women . The sexes attract . I n  | them he must find relaxation and companionship away from the care of the business day ; confidence , respect and consolation worthy of his ideals ; the glamor , refinements , and flirtations that soften the contact with the bluntness of his man made world . The bloom of womanhood fades faster with the Latin race . American women do not assimilate readily with the social life and customs of the country . With affluence their world grows small , with a yearning for the States creeping into their heart . Native wives prove the best in the long run . The generations that followed the Spanish , English , German and French immigrants speak the Spanish through force of numbers and schooling . Of pure Caucasian bloodmixtures , they only differ from the average United States citizen by speaking Spanish as their native tongue . " When in Rome , be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ republics of South America . Go native ! You 'll like it ! They 'll like you ! Marital relations seem to be on a different plane . The responsibility may rest on religion , tradition or laws . Divorce is the exception and not the rule . Woman 's domain is in the home as an efficient helpmate , rather than a beautiful plaything for a man to glorify . Marriage is a cooperative business with the goal of a fine family to cheer old age . Examples among the peons carrying it to such fecundity that the children were named Primero , Segundo , Tercio , etc . ( First , Second , Third ) or others have givennames of their birth month , or day of the week on which they were born . Celebrated dates of history are commemorated in civic life by the naming of streets as " 18th of  | May " while one of the provinces is called Treinta y Tres ( 33 ) . The love of family is exemplified at the fine beach resorts of Carrasco and Playa Pocitos of Montevideo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in groups on the sandy shores to feast from a bounteous lunch-basket spread , after they have all had a dip in the sea . Modern bathing-suits ? not to extent of the rubber gadget that fits like a glove ? expose the charms of young womanhood , comparable to figures seen on North American beaches ; rather more compact and shorter than the North American figure , with well rounded curves . In common with the women of South America the waistline all but disappears with maternity . The pride that the North American women hold on the narrow waistline is lost to the eye in South America . Food and child-bearing may be the answer . Appreciative of the social evil that has been with the human race since the birth of mankind , the city fathers have devised a plan that works well . Admitting that it can not be eliminated , they have segregated it . In certain parts of the city , license is permitted in alternating blocks . One block is clear for respectable residences . In the next block , a redlight is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a flat . This eliminates wild parties and the disturbance of other residents of the block . An old woman guards the door as the judge of whom to admit . A policeman on the corner is the guardian of law and order . Who is your neighbor ? is a secret hidden behind strong doors and drawn blinds , of which the children on their way to school are in ignorance and  | only the initiated in night life have the key . " Social-security ( ? ) " for the women is evinced by the lack of attacks and outrages on the dockets of the courts of Montevideo . Montevideo , being a seaport city where ships from all parts of the world anchor , of-needs-be provides entertainment for deep-water sailors and transient tourists . Exotic in charm , the theaters , cafes and cabarets are thronged nightly by people speaking many tongues . Saloons to fit all types and nationalities are scattered over the business section and waterfront . The environs of Plaza I ndependencia afford a variety of cafes from cellar to second story cabarets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to Paris . A lover of good food will pick up the scent from the sidewalk which will lead down a winding stairway . At the first bend , the appetite is whet by spring chicken threaded on one steel rod and another knotted with huge hunks of tallow-lined carne fresca ( fresh meat ) roasting over red charcoal fires . These tempting viands rotate mechanically past the roasting coals with the fat dripping into the fire , to send the aroma on to the street as self-advertising . For less than 50 cents of United States money , one enjoys a seven course dinner in the exotic sub-cellar at the plaza corner , including a pint bottle of wine . Filet mignon an inch thick and as tender as veal ; maragut , and all of the tidbits of cowland are served as only a connoisseur knows how . From the 16th hour ( 4 P.M. ) the sidewalk cafes are thronged with mixed parties quaffing steins as they watch the crowds pass by .

It is there a foreigner is sure to find one who speaks his language . Partly decked in the latest creations , these women exist on an abominable thirst ? they live off of it , but are very willing to share it with their girl friends if the " sucker " pays the bill . If one is to live in a country , it becomes essential to know the cross-section of its people . You see it at the cabaret . The staid business man out on a lark , possibly with a bunch of visiting friends from abroad ; estancieros and gauchos in with a drove of livestock ; naval officers and members of the crew on shore-leave , where uniforms from many lands join in an evening of abandon to dance , drink and feminine companionship ; deep-water seamen and officers in civilian garb shaking for the time being the monotony of a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a retinue of waiters and women paying homage to their bankroll ; the personnel of office and manufacturing buildings breaking the routine of cooped-up lives ? all choosing a rendezvous according to their stations in life and the size of the bankroll .

A quaint little city founded 200 years ago , is said to be more like Spain than any in South America . Directly across the Plata River from Buenos Aires , it offers in its people a radical contrast to the cosmopolitan population of Buenos Aires . The river is only 60 miles wide at this point , while to Montevideo it is 120 miles or an over-night ride on the sumptuous ferry boat that affords all the comforts of an ocean liner . Ferry boats to Colonia make several trips a day on schedule time . They are met by a caravan of commodious busses that cover the 90 mile concrete highway into Montevideo in short time , giving the tourist an opportunity to enjoy the fascinating rural scenery of the rolling hills of Uruguay . Upon contact with Immigration and Custom Officers in Colonia , one senses the personality of a friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official power .

The old stone fort high on the promontory , looks out over the cozy little harbor dotted with wooded islands , while beyond in the broad expanse of the yellowsilt-laden Plata , above water peep the masts of two merchant ships that strayed from the dredged ship-channel , to stick and sink in the ooze of the murky bottom . Salvage boats rescue many as it is not an uncommon catastrophe . Below the old fort is an ancient sea-wall built of native stone by master masons from Spain . The ceaseless toll of time and storm-waves have broken holes in the defense to gouge-out grottos and tempting bathing pools in the soft stone of the shore .

A Buenos Aires wheat buyer in from Paysandu was paying $12.00 for 1000 kilos of wheat , the equivalent of 2205 lbs . or 54c a cwt . The Uruguay Government operates a cleaning and classifying plant at cost to the producer . This machinery is mounted on railway cars and visits the wheat loading railway station where it functions on a side track . Birdseed , export grain ? second grade , etc. are classified and sacked for different markets . The unmarketable products can be returned to the estancia for local use ? just another example of the producer 's hand in law-making . Wheat , flaxseed and flour constitute the major agricultural exports which will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities are only limited by market demand . The history of grazing countries giving-way to grain with the ultimate decrease in livestock , as in our western plains states , Victoria and New South Wales of Australia , and the pampas of Argentine , will follow as the night the day , to the pastoral empire of Uruguay . At the present price of wheat received by the producer compared to his heritage as a meat eater , there is no present cause for alarm to the estanciero . The city of Montevideo consumed 198.2 lbs . of meat per capita in the year 1938 . Three-fourths of the food of the peons living in the campo , is meat . One million head of cattle are exported a year and 83.35% of  | the national income is from the livestock industry . Agriculture represented only 2% of the exports in the census of 1930 . When agriculture and manufacturing gain only ONE percent a year , world markets must stimulate the price of agricultural products to threaten the ranges of this generation of stockmen of Uruguay . Following the trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grassy hills of Uruguay , as the following figures illustrate : Table Of the states of the United States of America , Texas stands first in the number of cattle , sheep and area in square miles . Taking the census of 1935 for comparison we find : Table Difference ? Texas exceeds in cattle by 94,088 Uruguay exceeds in sheep by 13,532,123 . The little South American republic , less than a third as large as Texas , is grazing nearly twice as many cattle and sheep , carrying 260.6 head to the square mile and 2.45 head to the acre . The stock-farming State of Nebraska of 76,808 sq . miles has 4655 sections more area than Uruguay and has 3,921,000 cattle and sheep to compare with this pastoral paradise of South America , having 27,686 , - 000 head .

These states constitute the heart of the range country of the United States where the Taylor Bill primarily applies to public domain , and where the grazing of cattle and sheep are an important factor in the area 's economics . The estanciero is making . money producing this meat at less than half what it is costing in the United States and chilled meat can be delivered in our ports at 2c a pound transportation cost , with the balance of trade strong in our favor . In February 1938 , $1,500,000 worth of United States goods were being held in customs awaiting the Uruguayan merchant 's ability to pay 2.40 pesos for one of our dollars , to cancel the account . They want our manufactured products , respect us and are far more friendly than Argentina . England , Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in order . We consume 45,000,000 lbs . of meat per day , which is supplied by five million stock  --  farmers , few of whom know of the following figures , published in Social Justice issue , March 3 , 1938 , by A. H. Anderson , Congress Representative from Minnesota .. " During the year 1937 just passed , 604,570,456 pounds of beef , pork , lamb and poultry came into the U.S. from Foreign Countries . This meat was estimated to be worth $58,531,897. "  | In 1933-4 we destroyed 7,000,000 head of cattle to help the price to the producer of livestock , now we are importing meat in competition with him . I f his ear is to the ground , the stockman will hear a rumbling indicative of the storm brewing in the masses .

The attempts of labor organizers to control the farming industry by setting wage scales and hours which the very nature of the occupation prohibits , and interference with transportation mediums , are factors disrupting the fealty that should exist between labor and farmers . Foot and mouth disease regulations and the vote of the electorate are the only barriers between the man who wants to buy our manufactured products and the laborer who wants to eat his cheap meat . Yellow fever was conquered , smallpox quelled , and typhoid tied by medical science . The same source can solve the importation of South American beef to the United States . Europe accepts their product of chilled beef without courting disaster to their livestock industry . The meat-eating followers of industry can logically reason that if the South American meat is safe for Europe to eat , it is safe for United States consumers .

National labor unions and stockfarmers are not in sympathy on labor problems . Industry arrives at the price of their product by adding the cost of raw material , labor , taxes , overhead , profit , etc. , and sets its price . The farmer has to take what industry offers . There is no alternative . Should he go on a strike as a unit and raise only what he can consume , then foreign foods would come in free of duty , as our high standards of living and labor costs have reached the point where there is no South American market for our product at the price . We lost 40% of our trade in South America and Japan increased 900% last year . ( 1937 ) . With our present trend of labor economies , the livestock producer of the United States has a dreary sunset ahead .

MERCEDES ? a town of 20,000 located on the Rio Negro some 200 miles northeast from Montevideo , is in the heart of the black-lands of Uruguay .

In its suburbs are high hills overlooking the silvery thread of navigable water lined with the fringe of trees where weeping willows dip thin branches in the slow current with every breeze .

Far out on the carpet of green , knots of dark groves mark scattered estancias . Well-water being available , the Uruguayan builds his home on a high point of his estancia that overlooks his grazing herds .

The meat is sold in chunks , at 12 centavos for roast and boiling meat and 16 centavos for steaks and loins . At 2.40 pesos for an American dollar , this is 4.1 and 6.6 cents a pound . ( 1938 ) There is but one man who takes a profit between the producer and the consumer of meat in Mercedes ? the butcher . Plate glass cases , refrigerators , neon lights , overlapping inspectors of sanitation and meat , city , county licenses , income and sales taxes , high salaried purveyors , etc. , have no part in pyramiding a pound of meat for the family .

A stockman , necessarily , finds no feature of Uruguay so enthralling as the estancia life ; it is his most interesting feature of the " natural home of livestock . " Schooled in the profession in a foreign land , he soon finds that the 200 years of cut-and-try methods of Uruguay have much to add to his store of accrued livestock knowledge . Admitted that the mentality of domestic livestock holds on an even plane throughout the civilized world , one finds that climate , seasons , foodstuffs and environments affect their habits of life . A pack of timber wolves in an estancia pasture would be a feature of curiosity ? just a new type sheepdog ? to the cattle and sheep , for all predatory wild animals were eliminated from the ranges of Uruguay , generations-of-cattle long past . Mio-mio a poison weed that grows throughout the ranges ; when mashed , has a very pungent aroma , which is distasteful to sheep . Native stock identify and avoid it through instinct , but it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imported stud stock before turning them into a pasture . The weed is then identified through scent and the sheep will not eat it thereby protecting themselves . Lambing and calving-time occur in the reverse order to ours , by reasons of climatic seasons in the southern hemisphere . Green grass the year round permits continuous growth of young stock . The estanciero capitalizes this food feature by not weaning steer calves . Mothermilk and green feed crowd his young life to qualify as export beef . There 's where the money lies , but this custom and other deficits cuts the calf-crop to 60% . Due to the mild winter climate and season grass ,  | haystacks are an oddity and strawpiles are burned . A few estancieros conserve oat hay in barns for stall-fed stud stock . No snow storms or blizzards , torrential winds or cyclones sweep the rolling plains of Uruguay to harass the even tenure of the pastoral life . Only in June , July and August do cold winds creep up from the Antarctic that drift the stock off the ridges to bed-down in sheltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in temperature . Ridges of lime , granite and sandstone croppings , decked with scattered native timber , afford firm footing in times of excessive rainfall which saturates the lowlands like a sponge . The diversified topography of an estancia adds to its economic worth by supplying the needs of livestock in the cycle of the seasons . A cow 's life is a long and happy one in Uruguay . I f a good type , she is bred until 12 years old before becoming a candidate for the beef bunch . An instance of a registered Hereford cow having three calves after she was twenty years old ( checked by her registration papers ) demonstrated that old age is no detriment to fecundity in a cow paradise . The Hereford dominates the ranges of Uruguay as as the Durham rules the Pampas of Argentina . ( Statistics ? 18 million shorthorns to 2-3/4 million 1-Ierefords . ) He is a rustler , loves to climb and search for his feed . He will draw his water from a small stream while the shorthorn passes it up to wade into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter comes " the Hereford steps out to distant feed , while the Durham hunches his back and bawls for a haystack . One is independent of man , while the  | other is dependent on man . On the climate and topography of a range , depends the choice of these two leading beef breeds . Uruguay differs drastically with the United States in the production of finished beef . There is no dry-lot feeding . Cattle are finished on green oat fields . ( The drouthy season of 1937-38 in Argentina found estancieros using wheat fields to finish cattle in preference to harvesting the grain . ) Of 9000 head of cattle on the Montevideo Tablada ( livestock market ) not one single animal returns to a range . Every animal is killed . Poor cows with young calves , thin old bulls , young feeder steers ? all head for the slaughter house when the trading is over . There is no feeder market ! Being supplied with growing grass the year round , permits the continuous growth and early maturity of young cattle , unlike parts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of Australia where feast and famine admits development but half of the year . A two-year-old steer in Uruguay weighs more than a six-year-old from West Australia Kimberley Ranges . Uruguay 's climate , feed and breeding , produce export meat , fine wool and clean hides . For fifty years , old estancias have been breeding to an export type with registered bulls , partly inspired by a Government premium of 20% on beef cattle that qualified . ( Only recently has this subsidy been discontinued . ) Although the livestock industry has ever been , and still is the backbone of Uruguay , cattle raisers hold true to breed ? do not resort to running Hereford bulls for two years , then Durham for like period to strengthen  | the loins and hind-quarters , as an ideal feeder much in demand in the United States corn-belt . Long trail-herds of straight-backed white-maned Hereford feeders string into the reanate-feria ( monthly auction sales ) of back country Urugayan ranges to be fattened on the finishing oat-fields to make export beef . Fully 90% of 7500 cattle auctioned on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One noticeable drive of 500 head were like peas from a pod , on the long white mane strip of the withers . I t was a special flesh-mark of the brand , showing that the stockman 's hobby admitted of no deviation in this marking of sires for many generations . Ranging in pastures likewise permits of classifying sheep according to texture of wool , then breeding to that type . Barbed wire is practically not used in Uruguay . Seven smooth wires stretched taut until they sing , leave no flesh-marks on hides , or wool-pointed barbs to harbor scab to possibly infect the next " rubber ' . Scab infection in sheep is under Government supervision . Inspectors drop in on an estancia without ceremony to be conducted over the padlocked pastures at their discretion . It is a Government provision that has little need , as every estancia running sheep is provided with a dipping-tank that the owner uses for self protection , many dipping their sheep through precaution rather than necessity . A unique and substantial fence erected as a defense against herds-in-transit on highways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wool , in an adjoining pas-  | ture , demonstrates efficient fence construction . The low fence a meter away from the main-line prevents sheep , in the near pasture , touching the outside structure or any scabby wool attached to it . Should scabby sheep scratch themselves on the main-line , the fragments of wool are burnt-off with a blow-torch by the fence-rider . The granite posts 8 ft. long are chiseled out of the large boulder seen in the distance in the illustration , at a cost of 75c each . The seven smooth galvanized wires are threaded through auger-holes in quebacho posts and hardwood stays , to be stretched on ratchet-bolts at quarter mile intervals . ( When using stone-posts , the wires are passed through a picket and it tied to the stone post with smooth wire . ) No staples are used in fence construction . A native tool used in wrapping and splicing this smooth wire leaves the connection with the appearance of being machine-made . The Uruguay fences are so strong and formidable that the only way to get through is to cut the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The heavy hardwood posts coming from Paraguay will last a lifetime , nor will they break with bulls fighting from opposite sides of the fence . These fences cost around $100 a kilometer , according to material . The gates are a mechanical art devised for long life and stability . Iron-braced hardwood frame , threaded with 3/8 to inch iron rods threaded and tapped at each end . The hand-wrought hinge has a mechanical tie to the gate post that only a hacksaw can solve . It is far more secure than the padlocked chain on the other end of the gate . The cost is $ 12.00.  | The Uruguayans have an automatic wire flood-gate for water gaps that makes a sanctum of his holdings . It insures the purity of classified strains of sheep or cattle held in adjoining enclosures . It permits restful nights for the estanciero while the rain pours and the streams swell . Time has gauged the maximum flow of a watercourse . To this the flood-gate is fitted , the bottom held in place with weak wires . The ingenious gate is difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the site , measurements and construction , ratio and tension on guiding wire . The governing principles are gravity and tension . As an example let us take a 5 ft. deep and 20 ft. wide channel , 5 ft. high fence and gate posts 15 ft. long . The 15 ft. upright flood posts are threaded above the center of gravity on a heavy level wire stretched to bank-posts . From the base of distant posts , a tension wire passed through the top of the gateposts . The stress on this wire keeps the gateposts perpendicular until flood-force swings them down stream throwing stress on the elevated tension wire . When flood-strain is gradually relieved , the tension-wire pulls the gate back into vertical position . This is facilitated by a horizontal pull on the tension wire which is anchored pulley-fashion to the top of an intervening post . Double twisted tension wires admitting of give-and-take strain also add to the stability of the top of flood-gate posts . Raging floods that overflow the natural channels of course sweep all before them , but for practical use the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bracing of a corner or gate post is complicated , efficient and lasting , devised because of the cost and  | scarcity of timber . I t is quite worthy of copying in the United States of America . It requires more time and work but the efficiency is well worth the outlay , due to the strain placed on the seven strong smooth wires , where the posts are set in soil saturated by 38 inches of rainfall each year . A Uruguay corner-post stays anchored to the earth , for the greatest strain is on the second post 8 ft. away in the line of the fence . A deadman is sunk in line with the top of the second post and the ground level of the corner post . Heavy galvanized wire is doubled from the deadman to the top of the second post . Tighttwisting in the trench and between posts anchors the base of the corner post to the deadman , as well as a continuing of the stress to the top of the second post where the stretcher is applied . Wiring between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a gatepost . After stretching to the second post , the short panel wiring is put in . One horizontal timber is used in bracing the top of first and second posts . There is no vacant Government land in Uruguay . All is private owned and under fence . For miles on end to the distant horizons , the eye follows the silvery threads glistening in the sunlight , like scattered dew-laden cobwebs in a sea of grass . I n the cross-webs , house-tops , outbuildings and stock-barns , are reflected the sun 's rays with the same glistening hue of corrugated iron . Millions of tons of wire and roofing to make livestock secure , and protect human comforts from soaking rain , have been pouring into Uruguay from a foreign land in lieu of their hides and tallow ? meat and wool . What country ? England ! Uruguay is without coal but their homes are heated  | and the smoke-stacks of industry send skyward the curling dark signal of its presence . Where did it come from ? From the holds of English vessels ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find a United States made saw , drawing knife or modern straight-clawed hammer . The saw-teeth were filed in house-gable pattern , the drawing-knife unknown , and they had only heard of the modern compressed leather handled hammer steel-faced , bottle-necked and straight claws . Long handled shovels and hoes are a curiosity to the natives , while the short handled backbreaking European variety is the universal tool . Even Henry 's Ford-parts come from his English factory . The seed we planted on the estancia and the new 14 ft. drill and two-gang disk-plow came from Canada to a people , who Iike us , want our products , but so long as our production costs of material and labor surpass those of Germany , Italy and England , and we continue to control the exchange of NINE South American countries , through lack of trade balance , Europe and Japan will get their business . Although New York is 424 miles nearer to Montevideo than Liverpool , and Genoa Italy is closer than New Orleans , the Uruguayan trade will go where their money buys the most . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while unfortunately some inferior United States manufactured goods penetrated the Uruguayan trade to leave a bad impression . Honest products and fair dealings are assets that Uruguay demands of those with whom they trade . The most lamentable feature of our machinery trade with Uruguay is that the native is not mechanically  | minded . An attorney who had subdivided ten large estancias expressed the situation frankly when he said : " We want your farm machinery but we need more your competent men to keep them in adjustment , as Uruguay is spotted with American machinery abandoned for need of repairs . Once anything goes wrong , our people go back to the horse-teams and the old methods . When you sell us modern farming machinery , give us service by trained men who will keep it going , as the peon is not mechanically minded . " Herein lies a tough problem for the manufacturers of modern devices for farming in a country ideally adapted for power machinery . However , this version is not universally adapted by estancieros . There is an unwritten law of the land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the peon 's realm of activity . He is the ' boss " to supervise and direct , but not absorb the labor in hand . Farming and gaucho work is the peon 's heritage . When an owner or manager enters in competition , he loses face with the peon . They respect his brain but not his brawn . Expensive machinery is short-lived in the hands of a man who does not comprehend its governing principles . The outstanding opening for technically trained young men of the United States in Uruguay is for one who is the master of the science of our modern farm machinery . As the attorney expressed it , " He is invaluable and worth any price . " Next comes a pomologist capable of resurrecting the fruit industry . A writer of 1873 eulogized on the profundity of the orchards of that period with trees the size of his thigh loaded with luscious fruit . Today , market-  | able fruit is the highest priced commodity that supplies the table in Uruguay , as most of it is imported . An entomologist who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into this industry , will build a name for himself and fortunes for the orchardists . A broad field is open in South America for berry culture , noticeable from their absence on all markets . South America is sadly in need of a Burbank to solve this problem . Climate , soils , seasons , comparable to ours seem impotent to the growth of berries . Fortunes lie in the solution . Luscious red apples in the immense public market of Sao Paulo , Brazil drew the inquiry ? " Where were they raised ? " The surprising answer was " California . " The orchards of Uruguay do not supply their fruit demand . The Rio Negro district of South Argentina is producing fine fruit . The wild apple grows in the cordilla , southwest from there . Certain districts of Uruguay produce grapes . The wine industry is a factor in local consumption , but the best wines are imported from Portugal . Wine is much higher in price than in California of a similar climate , leaving the inference that the supply does not meet the demand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of Uruguay . The vegetable supply of an estancia embodies a wide variety , some unknown on our markets . It is alleged that South America is the home of sweet and white potatoes and tomatoes . Three crops of potatoes in one year have been grown in Uruguay and two are always grown . Wheat is the leading agricultural export . Flour mills are scattered over the Republic . Uruguay soil and  | climate have been generous with the three staples of life ? bread , meat and potatoes . The fertility of the soil places within the reach of its 2,020,040 ( 1935 census ) the necessities to maintain life . The population is selfsustaining in foods , unlike England which must import 65% of its food . The immense wool-crop and woolen mills , hides and shoe factories , add to their spirit of self-sufficiency . Food and clothing , equitable climate the year-round , religious tolerance , congenial social life with the calendar red-lettered by public holidays , the good people of Uruguay find contentment at home and are at peace with the whole world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic Church or ecclesiastical year , ( In 1938 it was the week of April 10th to 17th ) is allotted as one grand holiday when the populace takes on a carnival spirit . Banks , public offices , in fact all business of a public nature close shop and go on a vacation . An eightday-rodeo in the race-track park of Montevideo entertains milling thousands . Sprinkled throughout the year are holidays dedicated to the trabajadores ( laborers ) while carnival holidays add to their inherited spirit of levity . Labor and capital work in friendly unity to the betterment of the little republic which they patriotically love . Their rare mixture of justice , tolerance and human understanding , gradually permeates the consciousness of a foreigner who keeps his nose clean and a smile on his face . It speaks well for the people of Uruguay for one to hear substantial Scotchmen , Englishmen , Frenchmen  | and Americans who came to the pastoral paradise through curiosity but stayed through choice , laud its natural resources and commend its institutions . Handicapped by not understanding the language , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Men of small capital found an opportunity to capitalize their knowledge and thrift . It was not so much the opportunity to make money by quick turnover , as it was by letting little money grow into big money on the natural resources of the pastoral wealth . In the channels of trade , the good people were slow to accept new innovations . The bicycle , typewriter and adding machine found a reluctant market . It was necessary to school the public to their time-saving , durability and efficiency elements . It took time , much time , but today they are in universal use . " Be not the first to try the new or the last to lay the old aside " is a characteristic of the Uruguay people and one that agencies paid dear to learn . The habits of the people are so deeply rooted that no fly-by-night project can take them by storm . To illustrate the possibilities of foreigners assimilating with the people of Uruguay , Herbert Coates is chosen as an urban example and Winford Thompson as rural . From the activities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an analogy of the opportunities awaiting Americans interested in the livestock haven . HERBERT Co rES of Montevideo is an outstanding example of men who saw potentialities in Uruguay . He landed in Montevideo over fifty years ago as an Eng-  | lish lad scouting the globe for a place to realize his ambitions . He has profited by his vision . Uruguay was indeed most fortunate in attracting a man of his caliber , as his progressive spirit is identified in the modernization of business of Uruguay , and the human comforts of its people . Instrumental in building the first railroad reaching out into the back country to Mercedes on the Rio Negro , 300 kilometers from Montevideo , the livestock and agricultural products of the rich black loam of Sorriano poured into the business channels of Montevideo to fill the holds of deep-sea vessels that came from all ports of the globe . The merchandise of the city was piled on station platforms in an over-night run to cater to the needs of local merchants and thrifty estancieros , who bought supplies in wholesale lots . Gone were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rutted roads where creaking ox-carts snailed their way over the rolling hills . Mail and passenger service eliminated isolation . ' That " a man makes a country instead of a country making a man " is verified by the ensuing years in the life of this man of vision . Grown wise to the character of the people of his adopted country , this enterprising man adapted a system of educating them to modern needs by introducing and demonstrating over a period of time , the First typewriter in Uruguay . When they had finally accepted it as a practical necessity in business , he stocked-up to meet the demand . Next , in the modernization of business , came the First adding-machine to be seen in a shop window of Montevideo . They were skeptical of the accuracy and durability , of a mechanical mind to do their computing where mistakes could spell financial ruin . It was an up-
