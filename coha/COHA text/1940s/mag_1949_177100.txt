Rank &; file U.S. movie exhibitors may not care much about cinematic art for its own sake , but they know what they want from Hollywood . Last week the exhibitors drew some conclusions from their box-office receipts . After polling its exhibitor-members across the nation , the Allied States Association announced : Hollywood 's pictures ( and advertising ) have been truckling to the tastes of " sophisticated Broadway audiences " and " professional reviewers , " and run a serious risk of becoming " class entertainment . " <P> The exhibitors had some specific beefs and advice : <P> The public is getting tired not only of " sordidness and crime " but also of that cinematic staple , sex . Small-town and neighborhood audiences want more wholesome stuff , i.e. , nature , children and animals that the family can safely see . <P> " The million-dollar cast is a bust . " <P> Story material is trite and runs too much to cycles , e.g. , the rash of psychological thrillers . <P> Musicals are " quite often ... a gamble , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake , " said one exhibitor , " quit making backstage musicals . " <P> Pictures are getting so long that they " droop and die in the middle . " <P> " We have had a great deal of glorification of the Catholic and Jewish religions . We must not lose sight . . . that the vast majority of our people , and our critics , are of the Protestant faith . " <P> Hollywood has been lax in failing to clean up the private lives of sinful stars . Instead , some producers have deplorably chosen to make capital of their " outrageous exploits . " <P> " Exhibitors are agreed that they have never had a first-class western that was a box-office failure . "
