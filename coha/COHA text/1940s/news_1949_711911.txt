txt 7 ,  --  . The shift in the top command of the Soviet Government , in particular the replacement of Mr. Molotov with Mr. Vishinsky as Foreign Minister , has leashed such a flood of speculations and varying interpretations as to its ineaning that it has thrown the world into new confusion and uncertainty . Since this is a state of affairs in which Soviet policy thrives best , that result may also have been one of the incidental purposes of the change and the manner in which it was made . The Kremlin may , in fact , be enjoying both its success in this respect and the tribute to its power implied in the world 's reaction to what it presents as merely a routine move . As far as the outside world is concerned , however , this result must again point up what is one of the worst and Most dangerous aspects of . a totalitarian regime , whether brown or red . For this new shift again emphasizes that under such a regime all authority is vested in a few men able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguise their purposes and intentions . No such thing is possible in the democracies . For in the democracies the results of elections and byelections , the debates in Parliament and the drift of a free public opinion both determine the course of events and openly indicate their direction , and thereby enable the rest of the world to adjust itself to them . But the totalitarian regimes work in darkness and operate with surprises and faits accompli which can confront the world With sudden and tragic decisions . That was true of the Hitler regime and is even truer of the Soviet regime . It remains what Winston Churchill said of it ten years ago ? " a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma . " Under these circumstances , the world , which must perforce deal with it , must depend on some minor indications and certain fundamental facts to find a key to Soviet policy . Unfortunately , whatever the future position of Mr. Molotov , there is nothing in the change in Moscow that holds out much hope for an improvement in either Soviet policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is any reassuring aspect of it at all , it is perhaps the fact that , in contrast to 1939 when the Soviets were preparing for war and " when Mr. Molotov took over the Foreign Office , that Office has now been entrusted to mere technicians who have no policy-making power of their own and can be only the executors of the policy set by the Politbureau . For what it is worth , that fact may be considered an indication that , whatever else the Soviets may undertake , they do not look forward to actual war . But the appointment of Mr. Vishinsky , supplemented by the appointment of Mr. Gromyko as his first deputy , also indicate that the policy already set by the Politbureau is likely to continue , and that if there is any change at all it will be a change in tactics rather than strategy or objectives . There can be little doubt that , as far ifs Western Europe is concerned , the Soviets ' " cold war " has not only reinited in a stalemate but has also Aroused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threat . It is not impossible that the Soviets may try new methods to break up this unity and remove the last obstacle to a Communist world domination . In such an effort , Mr. Vishinsky , who is not only the most volatile and the Most vituperative but also . the most cynical and flexible of the Soviet statesmen , can play- a useful role , steadied by Mr. Gromyko , who , like Mr. Molotov , has become the personification of the Russian " No ! " Indeed , the Moscow voices which accompany the shift suggest not only a continuation but even an intensification of the double-pronged Soviets drive which on the one hand proclaims Russia 's unswerving devotion to a- policy of " cooperation among all democratic countries , regardless of their internal social systems , " and on the other hand seeks to organize treason and sabotage to convert cooperation into surrender through the Communist fifth columns . In this situation , and until Soviet deeds persuade the world to the contrary , the democracies can only continue and even intensify their efforts to create bulwarks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the democratic statesmen suggests that this is exactly what they are going to do .
