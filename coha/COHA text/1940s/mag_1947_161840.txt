People were always whispering things to Rocky Graziano , a reform-school graduate who fought like fury in the ring . <P> At Manhattan 's sleazy Stillman 's Gym , where he trained , a place full of the smell of dust , sweat and arnica , characters paid 50 to get in and crowd around . When Rocky , the biggest crowd-puller outside of Joe Louis , swigged water between rounds and aimed a spout at a funnel in the corner of the ring , they did n't mind being splashed . When Rocky elbowed his way through the mob to work on the small punching bag , the hangers-on tried to borrow five or ten , or find out " How 's ya condition . " Rocky liked to tell them kiddingly that he was going to throw the fight : " Naw , bet on the other guy . . . I 'm going into the tank . " Then he always gave them the same brush-off : " See ya later . " <P> Last week , Rocky was deep in trouble for failing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . At Stillman 's Gym , the boys were . whispering about him . Said one : " I say he should n't get it ... he done right dint he ... he nixes the guy , do n't he ? " Said another : " He goes ... I say he gets it . " The man in the street did n't want to see Rocky " get it " too hard . Rocky had turned down the bribe , even if he had n't reported it ( though he had reportedly feigned a sore back to duck the fight ) . Last week the New York Athletic Commission barred Graziano indefinitely from New York rings . The ban meant the end of next month 's Madison Square Garden title fight with Middleweight Champ Tony Zale . But all was not lost : from hungry promoters in Cleveland , Chicago and points west came offers for fights for Rocky .
