1 EXT. - BATTLE FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON - WIDE ANGLE SHOT - PANNINGFADE IN The stricken field of Custer 's last stand on the Little Big Horn stretches out into the distance toward a ridge whose crest never was gained . It is four hours after the battle . All along the gentle slope lie the grotesquely-sprawled figures of the slain troopers -- -half-stripped , scalped , some pincushioned with Sioux lances . They lie singly and in huddled knots : islands of blue , bronze-reefed by breech-clouted , war-painted , feather-bonneted Indians . Here and there we may see a trooper and a brave locked in death-frozen combat . Dead horses , their legs stiffening , are among the human dead . Overhead the buzzards are wheeling , their harsh , expectant CROAKING the only SOUND above the keening WHISPER of the breeze through the grass . The same breeze gives fitful movement to yellow cavalry kerchiefs and the trembling feathers of Indian War-bonnets . Nearing the end of its pan , the CAMERA picks up a foreground object lying on a section of trampled sward . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few pages of a long-treasured love-letter lying a top . The breeze riffles the pages , then blows them aside -- revealing beneath a tin-type of a sweet-faced woman . The CAMERA COMPLETES ITS PAN by shifting a few more inches to frame a blue-sleeved arm and a hand still clutching a broken sabre , shattered against an Indian lance , point driven into the ground , its shaft-feathers stirring .

These legs are cased in soldier pants , drawn over short boots and they dangle loosely with the aimless motion of the dead . 19 EXT. - STAGE COACH - AS IT CONTINUES ITS CAREENING HEADLONG passage .

Near the door an olla , or earthen water jug , with a gourd hanging by it . In an angle by a little window , sunrise seeps through to gild a battered field desk on which rest three tintypes in leather cases secured into a sort of triptych by a faded yellow ribbon . The tintypes are of a woman , and two small girls . Near this group is a large old-fashioned calendar , with a line drawn through every numeral on the page .

Through the ensuing scene , this leg , through careful exercise will be restored to full ninety degree action , in the midst of intermittent GROANINGS and flexings . Presently , the door is seen to open at opposite wall of room and Sergeant Quincannon , half-horse , half-alligator , dressed in first sergeant 's chevrons , enters and comes to an earth-shaking salute , at the same time eyeing the water jar nearby .  --  9  --  &nbsp; QUINCANNONGood morning , sir .

Meanwhile , the sergeant under the pretext of ostentatiously dipping himself a drink of water , has removed from the olla a whiskey bottle , uncorking it with his teeth , and palming it so that when presently he will raise the gourd to his lips , it will mask the fact that he is taking a four ounce slug of whiskey from the watering place . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( o.s . ) When does the stage coach stop running ?  --  10  --  &nbsp; QUINCANNONIt stopped .

His cavalryman 's moustache could strain a quart of coffee through its gray filaments . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( he sighs ) MacKenzie was a good man . He 'd have made corporal in five or six years . 28 FULL SHOT - NEAR DOOR - BRITTLES &amp; QUINCANNON As Brittles stoops to put on his shirt , he puts his head meaningfully close to Quincannon and Quincannon with a troubled , but dutiful air , reluctantly breathes into the captain 's face .

( NOTE : The months on both calendar pages are to be obscured so that we will not know whether this is July or September . ) With a piece of red crayon or chalk -- hanging by the calendar -- Brittles circles the numeral 7 , and then draws a slant line through the numeral 1 . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( grimly ) Six more days . &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( disgustedly ) Ah , the army wo n't be the same when we retire ! &nbsp; BRITTLESThe army 's always the same . . . The sun and moon change , but the army has no seasons . Brittles gives his leg a painful straightening , pulls himself erect , shoulders back .

They are Lieutenant Flintridge Cohill with the silver bar of a first Lieutenant , who is lance straight , hard-bitten , nine years out of West Point , and just about ready to take his master 's degree in the profession of arms . The other lieutenant , with the blank straps of the second lieutenant , is Ross Pennell , four years out of West Point .

The two sergeants , Hochbauer and Quincannon , now follow a few paces back of the officers , and CAMERA HOLDS long enough to " spot " the natural animosity between the sergeant of the line and the sergeant of the orderly room .

He impatiently tucks the disarranged napkin back around the lunch basket and glares defiantly up at Cohill . &nbsp; PENNELL ( cont 'd ) I 'll tell you where . . . At Delmonico 's in New York  --  about two months from now ! . . . With Olivia on my arm . . . and I wo n't be wearing any blue suit , either ! He cuts the buckboard around and savagely whips off . Cohill , with a grin , shoves the balance of the egg into his mouth . Section Details 64 EXT. - SUTLER 'S STORE A faded shingle reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Quincannon emerges , wiping his lips with the back  --  27  --  of his sleeve , followed by Toucey Rynders , Indian agent . Rynders is a tall , suave , urbane , well-dressed rascal -- with a fur collar around his jacket , an immaculate white silk shirt with a flowing tie , all topped with a light Stetson . Outside the store are two goons , dressed in modified plains fashion , who -- as from long habit -- casually follow in after Rynders as he moves . One is called Hench , the other Badger . &nbsp; RYNDERSSure you have n't time for one more , Sergeant . . . ? &nbsp; QUINCANNONNo , sir . I 'm practically on the water wagon . . . Never more than four or five at a single sitting . 65 EXT. - POST HEADQUARTERS - FULL SHOT Major Allshard sits upon the steps , pipe in hand , waiting informally . Across from him , Captain Brittles waits just as lazily . Near Brittles is Tyree . The men watch as Quincannon and Rynders -- followed at several paces by Rynders ' bodyguards -- approach . &nbsp; RYNDERS ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? &nbsp; ALLSHARD ( vacantly , but ironically ) Why , yes , Mr. Rynders . . . You 're probably aware that the garrison here at Fort Starke has n't been paid in over two months ? &nbsp; RYNDERS ( giving it a little eyebrow ) My books at the store are eloquent testimony to the fact , Major . . . ( pause ) Do you wish to discuss your own grocery bill at this time ?  --  28  --  &nbsp; ALLSHARDNo. ( bluntly ) I want to discuss the paymaster with you . Thought you might be interested in Dr. O'Loughlin 's autopsy . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( casually ) Would you care to view the body , Mr. Rynders ? He extends his hand in invitation toward the open door . Rynders does not recoil with guilt but stops at the top of the third step . It is clear he has no intention of going inside . &nbsp; RYNDERSI 'd prefer . . . well , certainly , if you wish me to . . . &nbsp; ALLSHARD ( overlapping ) There 's no need for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stands ) . . . if you 've some personal disinclination . &nbsp; RYNDERS ( quickly ) But if I can be of any service . . . The appearance of Dr. O'Loughlin at the door interrupts the scene . The doctor holds a bullet between tweezers , with a gauze pad beneath it . He is followed by the ubiquitous Hochbauer with orderly board . &nbsp; O'LOUGHLIN ( as he comes ) Well , gentlemen . . . He pauses , noticing Rynders -- -not knowing whether to continue . Allshard motions him to proceed . Rynders is eyeing the bullet with curiosity -- -and perhaps a little apprehension . &nbsp; ALLSHARDGo ahead , doctor . . .  --  29  --  66 ANGLE FEATURING O'LOUGHLIN The others coming closer to peer at the bullet when he holds it up . &nbsp; O'LOUGHLINHere 's the bullet that killed our friend Cheadle . . . A rifle bullet . Somehow all eyes turn on Rynders ; he sees the battery trained on him and stands a bit defensively and defiantly  - -  - returning the stare around the circle . &nbsp; RYNDERSIs there anything so odd about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is - something very odd , Mr. Rynders . It came from a repeating rifle . . . a Winchester rifle . . . It was a Winchester rifle that killed Trooper MacKenzie . . . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( casually ) Two men killed within twenty-four hours by the same type of firearm . What does that suggest to you , Mr. Rynders ? &nbsp; RYNDERSPerhaps it is the same Winchester ? &nbsp; BRITTLESThe men were killed a hundred miles apart . . . Try again , Mr. Rynders . &nbsp; RYNDERSThen I confess , it puzzles me . Have you a theory ? 67 ANOTHER ANGLE - ON STEPS  --  FEATURING BRITTLES AND ALLSHARD Again the courteous deference from the senior officer toward the junior in rank . Allshard makes a small  --  30  --  gesture with his pipe , bidding Brittles to put the questions . &nbsp; BRITTLESYes , I have , Mr. Rynders . . . If the Cheyenne Dog Soldiers have shifted south , it is only to create unrest among the local tribes . . . and I put it to you that a ring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wartalk . &nbsp; RYNDERSI dislike challenging your theory , Captain , but I can not believe any Winchesters could be sold in this territory without my knowledge . Brittles gets stiffly to his feet , works his knee . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( flat tones ) Perhaps you are right , Mr. Rynders . Allshard also rises . It is noticeable that none of the men look directly again at Rynders ; he has had his last warning . &nbsp; O'LOUGHLIN ( to break tension ) Shall I read you the clinical report ? &nbsp; ALLSHARDAnother time , doctor . . . &nbsp; RYNDERSThen if you 're through , gentlemen , I 'll be on my way . . . He breaks off and all turn at sudden CRIES from guard-house o.s. 68 FULL SHOT - STOCKADE GATES - A GALLOPING COURIER He comes through on a foam-flecked horse , riding low and hard and comes full up to the CAMERA with a plunging stop and swings down exhausted -- -fumbling in his shirt for dispatches .  --  31  --  69 EXT. - FRONT STEPS - ALLSHARD AND GROUP As Allshard steps down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brittles takes the exhausted man by the arm and passes him on to Tyree . &nbsp; BRITTLESSee to him , Sergeant . . . and have someone cool out his horse . As Tyree and the courier move out , all look to Allshard who is skimming the pages with increasingly grim face . 70 EXT . PORTRAIT STUDY . . . ALLSHARD He has the born soldier 's deliberative poise upon the receipt of the news : He takes the pipe from his mouth and paraphrases the gist of the news for the others : &nbsp; ALLSHARD ( quietly ) Well , gentlemen , it 's quite true about Custer. . . and even worse than we had heard . . . And Sitting Bull is rousing the Sioux Nation for a holy war . . It promises to be a hard and bloody winter . He hands the dispatch to Brittles . &nbsp; ALLSHARDHere 's the list of the Custer dead . . . two hundred and twelve of the Seventh Cavalry . . . . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( reading the names ) George Armstrong Custer . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .

FADE IN  --  32  --  Section Details 71 EXT. - STOCKADE GATE - LATE AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT Captain Brittles is walking slowly towards the stockade entrance . In b.g. , the corporal of the guard , standing in the guardhouse door , sees him and instantly ducks back into his cubbyhole as if carrying out a long accustomed service . Meanwhile , a sentry turns and lifts the gate bar , and faces outward at present . The sentry at the other side of the gate does likewise . As Brittles reaches the guardhouse , the corporal comes out without any military formality whatsoever . This is a friendly , family thing without the emoluments of rank , as the corporal is now seen to be carrying a wooden bucket filled with water , and a gourd which will later prove to be pierced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He presents these , with a collapsible canvas-seated camp stool , to the tall captain . &nbsp; BRITTLESThank you , Corporal . Thank you . &nbsp; CORPORALMy pleasure , sir . Brittles is about to salute the sentries with their present arms when suddenly from rear and into scene comes Wagner , the big Teuton last seen slicking up Lieutenant Pennell 's buckboard . He is clumsy and bear-like , but he too has the same tender solicitude of the corporal of the guard . &nbsp; WAGNER ( bashfully ) Captain Brittles. . . please , sir . . . He produces from behind his back a sheath of the summer 's best hollyhocks arranged with German precision in a spray . &nbsp; WAGNER ( still stammering ) From mein frau. . . for . . . He makes a head-jerking gesture out toward the open ground .  --  33  --  &nbsp; BRITTLES ( accepting flowers ) That 's mighty nice , Corporal . . . ( inspecting flowers ) . . . hollyhocks . . . ( to Wagner ) You tell Mrs. Wagner I 'm obliged . &nbsp; WAGNER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . As he continues , both arms now laden , the sentries go from present to the rifle salute . &nbsp; SENTRIES ( in unison ) Evening , sir . . . Good evening . He continues on through the stockade as a color guard passes by the port . 72 EXT. - OPEN PRAIRIE - LATE AFTERNOON - BRITTLES Walking slowly toward CAMERA , Brittles has his eye fixed on something past and to the right of the CAMERA . He is unmindful of the beauty of the dying day , but its serenity touches him as he comes closer for his rendezvous . 73 EXT. - ANGLE ON BRITTLES AND NEARBY SECTION OF A PALING OR PICKET FENCE As he comes to the fence -- his eyes still fastened on something unseen , the CAMERA PANS SLIGHTLY so that we see that the fence is that of a small cemetery -- the fort 's Boot Hill -- pathetically small in the immensity of the plain on which it stands . The cemetery is dominated by one atrocity of a monument -- doubtless erected by a St. Louis brewer to the memory of a wayward son -- but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood , with here and there a plain stone .  --  34  --  74 75 CLOSER ANGLE - CEMETERY Passing the monstrosity , moving slowly down the lane between two lines of graves , Brittles comes to a stand-still before three simple headstones so grouped that they are unmistakably reminiscent of the three tintypes of the triptych on his desk . The larger and central stone bears the inscription : SACRED TO THE MEMORY OF MARY CUTTING BRITTLES Beloved wife of Nathan Cutting Brittles Born September 10 , 1844 Died June 2 , 1867 The stone to one side reads : &nbsp; ELIZABETH BRITTLESBorn December 4 , 1860 Died June 5 , 1867 The last stone reads : &nbsp; JANE BRITTLESBorn February 20 , 1862 Died June 7 , 1867 Brittles sets down the bucket , opens the campstool , lays the hollyhocks across the foot of the grave , then sits wearily on the stool . He takes the dipper from the bucket and carefully begins watering the running cover of the grave -- -possibly periwinkle . He begins to speak quite casually .  --  35  --  &nbsp; BRITTLESWell , Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathan will be out of the army . . . Have n't decided yet what to do . . . Just ca n't picture myself back there on the banks of the Wabash , rockin ' on a front porch . . . No , been thinkin ' I might push on west to the new settlements in California . . . We 've had some bad news , Mary --  George Custer 's been killed and his whole command . . . Miles Keogh among ' em . . . You remember Miles ? That big happy-go-lucky Irishman who waltzed so well with you ? ( sheepish smile ) Yes , I know . . . Guess I was jealous . . . I never could waltz myself . . . ( brisk again ) I 'm takin ' the troop out in the mornin ' . . . some Cheyennes around . So I 'm to pick up the patrols and chase ' em back north . . . Probably my last mission , Mary . . . Hard to believe , is n't it ? Brittles has finished his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think out his next thought in ordered speech . At this moment the shadow of a woman falls across the plot . The effect , at first , is eerie , but is not held long enough to be pointedly supernatural . Brittles leans forward , studying the shadow , then slowly turns and looks up at the figure casting it . 76 EXT. - FULL LENGTH PORTRAIT STUDY - OLIVIA - FROM BRITTLES ' ANGLE Olivia is wearing a simple dress of some dark stuff with a light scarf thrown over her head and shoulders . Not now the spirited filly of the picnic episode , she is a figure of shy , gentle , young-womanly beauty . She holds a small potted plant -- doubtless embedded in a tomato can which is bravely wrapped in paper and tied with a ribbon and small bow . It is her peace offering -- and something more . She speaks hesitantly , fearful of her intrusion .  --  36  --  &nbsp; OLIVIAI . . . I hope I 'm not intruding , Captain . . . But . . . I 've watched you come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . to your . . . family . . . and . . . ( extending flowers ) . . . so I 've brought this . . . Brittles rises stiffly and takes the flower pot in both hands -- like a man receiving a chalice . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( having a little trouble with his voice ) I appreciate this . . . very much . &nbsp; OLIVIA ( in quick relief ) They are called cyclamen . . . it 's a Greek word . I think it means Rabit 's ears . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( studying flowers ) My wife called them " flaming arrow " . . . She was . . . she was fond of gardening . &nbsp; OLIVIA ( shy again -- drawing her scarf ) Well . . . then . . . Oh . . . I 'm sorry I made such a fool of myself at the gate this morning . . . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( smiling ) I thought you made a fool of two lieutenants. . . and that 's never against army regulations . Olivia smiles warmly back at him -- and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OLIVIAThen I 'm forgiven ?  --  37  --  &nbsp; BRITTLES ( taking her hand ) Forgiven . She turns and leaves . &nbsp; OLIVIAGood night , Captain . &nbsp; BRITTLESGood night . . . Miss Dandridge . Brittles stands a brief moment , looking after her , conscious of her youth and beauty and freshness ; conscious , too , of the tenderness he has lost in all these years after his wife 's death . Then , finally , he rediscovers the flowers in his hand and turns back to the graves . 77 CLOSER ANGLE - BRITTLES As he places the pot at the base of his wife 's headstone and carefully distributes the hollyhocks at the base of the other two stones . Meanwhile he resumes his conversation . &nbsp; BRITTLESShe 's a nice girl , Mary . . . Reminds me a little of you . Guess it 's no wonder those young lieutenants of mine have been pawing the ground like buck elks in the Spring . . . Well , I 'll say good night , Mary . Say goodnight to the children . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reaches for the camp chair and the other equipment when o.s. is heard the SOUND of a BUGLE blowing " TO THE COLORS " . He straightens and comes to a salute . 78 EXT. - FORT - FULL SHOT PAST BUGLER Officers and men , scattered about the ground , are facing the colors , saluting as the BUGLE continues . 79 EXT. - LONG SHOT - CEMETERY Brittles stands , a lonely silhouette -- and a small figure against the night sky and the outlines of the graves .

As a dozen trooper hands reach up and pluck them down . 4 . A ROW OF HORSES DRAWN UP OUTSIDE THE STABLES . Each horse with saddle blanket on its back , each with his trooper standing beside him -- saddle poised .

She is unashamedly dabbing a tear from her eye with a pudgy fist , while her husband swings his infant son high in the air and holds him at arm 's length -- studying his face . The baby is laughing delightedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Take care of mama ! &nbsp; MRS .

She is trying her best not to cry . He steps back a pace , comes to attention , snaps her a salute . With an effort , she pulls herself erect , salutes him . Without a word , he pivots and marches away -- and she takes an involuntary step after him , her hand going to her mouth to stifle a cry for him to return for one more kiss . 88 7 FULL SHOT - COMPANY STREET The troop is assembling , men leading their horses . Women are crowding to the sidelines . Little boys -- and girls -- their eyes bright with interest and excitement are watching -- and getting in the way . Dogs are BARKING . The BUGLE ends its series of calls with BOOTS and SADDLES . 89 INT . - BRITTLES ' QUARTERS - BRITTLES AND QUINCANNON We see them now -- old warhorses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is no gayety in them , but rather the eagerness of men called to a task they know they are competent to execute . Their uniforms are bleached by the suns of other patrols . They wear belts and suspenders . At the opening of the scene , Brittles is loading his revolver . He gives the chamber a whirl , expertly swings it into place and holsters the revolver . Then he flexes his gimp knee-elaborately . He STAMPS the floor a time or two . Seeing him ready , then , Quincannon hands Brittles his sabre . Brittles takes it formally beneath his left arm and pulls back for the usual striding exit -- -Quincannon as usual taking a place behind him . But Brittles pauses a moment -- for a look around . His eyes go briefly to the triptych -- and hold -- then continue around the room -- the act of a man making sure he has forgotten nothing . He pulls erect again , but stops dead -- seeing that damned calendar on the wall . Slowly he crosses to it , with Quincannon -- no less dejected -- at his shoulder .

Quincannon is about to let his Irish temper flare -- he did n't go to the calendar , did he ?  - -  but he quickly realizes Brittles does n't mean a word of it .

Section Details 90 EXT. - COMPANY STREET - MOVING WITH BRITTLES AND QUINCANNON As they stride past the assembling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking up cinches . Cohill is riding herd on the men -- ad libbing instructions and injunctions . Suddenly Brittles falters and comes to a stop in sheer amazement as we see Lt. Pennell riding beside a wagon and bringing it into position with the troop .  --  41  --  91 ANGLE ON BRITTLES &nbsp; BRITTLES ( calling off ) What 's this , Mister ? . . . We carry no wagon on this patrol ! 92 FULL SHOT As Pennell rides up , saluting . &nbsp; PENNELLMajor Allshard 's orders , sir . Angrily Brittles swings on his heel and moves off at right angles toward Allshard 's quarters , with the equally puzzled Quincannon trailing a yard behind . As he goes , troopers begin coming from Allshard's -- struggling with trunks , hatboxes , a few loose parasols and other feminine gear . Brittles sees this with mounting indignation while Quincannon is finally brought to a full stop by the carrying out of a dressmaker 's form , modelled on the slim lines of Olivia Dandridge . As Brittles hits the steps of Allshard 's quarters : 93 94 INT . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company layout with files , order boards , pegs , rifle racks , field desks , etc .

Brittles stands shoving the screed toward Allshard , who makes a slight gesture toward Hochbauer . &nbsp; ALLSHARD ( hum-drum manner ) File it , Sergeant-Major . . .

She is acutely conscious of his coming and , womanlike , appears elaborately indifferent to it . But Cohill 's first words shatter that indifference into splinters .  --  63  --  &nbsp; COHILL ( leaning in -- words coming in a rush ) Take your hooks out of Ross Pennell , do you hear ! He 's got the makings of a good officer !

And now Abby lowers her guard for perhaps the first and last time in her life and lets her words rush out in a burst of self-disclosure which at first stuns , then touches her old friend . &nbsp; ABBYAn Army wife ! . . . Oh yes , you know some of it ! The gallant smile when your man rides out . . .

Indians racing up the slope , YIPPING triumphantly . 175 EXT. - PROFILE SHOT NEAR EDGE OF CHASM Tyree past his horse 's neck , speaking softly , reassuringly . &nbsp; TYREESee it , Lady ? , , , Take a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! 176 EXT. - FULL ON SLOPE AND EDGE OF CHASM Tyree quickly guides his mount a dozen strides back toward the advancing Indians , then pulls LADY around and makes his approach to the jump . 177 EXT. - EFFECT SHOT - PROFILE CHASM AND OPPOSITE LEDGES As Lady makes her superb leap and carries safely over . O.S. , Indian YIPPING takes an ANGRY TONE . 178 EXT. - EDGE OF CHASM - CLOSE ON INDIANS Their mounts rear up almost on top of the CAMERA , suggesting they are being pulled to a stop on the very brink of the chasm . ( NOTE TO SOUND CUTTER : Put in terrific NEIGH of a frightened , protesting horse over this ) .  --  76  --  179 EXT. - FAR SIDE CHASM Tyree , recovering from the jump , looks back -- then slaps Lady 's neck encouragingly -- swerves his course slightly and continues away at a slightly slower pace . 180 EXT. - CHASM EDGE Indians on their panting horses , gesturing threateningly but obviously abandoning the pursuit . 181 EXT. - LONG SHOT - LATE AFTERNOON Tyree once again is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though to suggest he is regaining his original course . DISSOLVE . pp. 38-57 &nbsp; pp. 77-95 182 EXT. - COMPREHENSIVE SHOT ON TROOP - BRIGHT MORNING EFFECT ( NOTE : If possible , shoot this against rising sun ) . The troop again is on the march , clear of the buffalo herds , moving along at a good trot . 183 EXT. - HEAD OF COLUMN Brittles in the high heads . Suddenly , o.s. we hear the faint REPORT of a SHOT . Heads swing up attentively . Brittles starts to raise his arm . Two more SHOTS -- clearer and unmistakable -- come through . Brittles completes the arm signal . Quincannon and Cohill at once ride in close . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( to Quincannon ) Sergeant -- -the ladies to the rear . . . Mister Cohill , take the troop ! Advance at the trot ! ( louder -- to troop ) First two squads ! . . . At the gallop ! Ho ! &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( bellowing ) Horseholders !

Ho ! 184 EXT. - RUNNING SHOT Brittles leading first squads out as o.s. the nearer PLOP of scattered SHOTS . Now as the angle widens we may see in the distance two dust clouds -- one relatively small , the other larger . ( NOTE : If the terrain permits , there may be some intervening bluff or section of bouldered ground at a midway point between Brittles ' squad and the distant patrol under attack . We would assume that this may screen Brittles ' unit from the eyes of the attackers and give him the needful cover and element of ambush strategy ) .  --  78  --  185 EXT. - LONG SHOT - PATROL AND DISTANT PURSUERS - AS FROM BRITTLES ' VIEWPOINT Ahead of the first dust cloud we now see Corporal Quayne 's patrol -- five or six men , two of them mounted on single horse . They are making heavy progress , their horses almost spent . . . Behind them there is dust . Riding in it the spaced vanguard of twenty to twenty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no firing from the Indians . 186 EXT. - RUNNING SHOT - BRITTLES ' SQUAD &nbsp; BRITTLESIt 's Quayne 's patrol , men ! He gives an arm signal . The squad spreads into a line of skirmishers. 187 EXT. - QUAYNE 'S PATROL We now see that one horse is carrying double , a wounded man exhaustedly hanging to his companion . The other troopers ride at the flanks of the double-burdened horse with one deliberately shielding it from the rear . . . They are throwing OCCASIONAL SHOTS back . As the troopers move ahead , we now see their pursuers -- featuring above all the heroically savage RED SHIRT , fiercest of the Arapahoes . He is riding a blue-gray stallion and carries a bow . Most of the Indians carry lances -- none has a rifle . 188 EXT. - NEAR BROKEN GROUND As Brittles ' squad approaches . The wise old campaigner has judged his terrain perfectly and knows too much to throw his eight men against two dozen Indians . He flings up his arm and the patrol pulls in for a concerted running dismount . Like a precisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troopers who act as horse-holders and lead the mounts into cover . The troopers then take cover  - -  in units of threes -- behind the rocks , carbines ready . Brittles alone stands exposed and draws his sabre .  --  79  --  &nbsp; BRITTLES ( during above ) Dismount ! . . . Take cover ! . . . Hold your fire ! He takes a few paces out onto the plain -- raising his sabre overhead so it will catch the sunlight as he brandishes it . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( yelling off ) Patrol ho ! Patrol ! Here ! This way . 189 EXT. - WIDE ANGLE - PLAINS The patrol comes into foreground with Brittles standing -- a distant figure , signalling with the silver blade of his sabre , alone in front of the cluster of boulders . Obedient to his command , the patrol swerves and makes for him . A moment later the van of the Indian attackers sweeps in , riding thru the dust churned up by the patrol . As other Indians fill the screen and the dust cloud becomes too thick to pierce . 190 EXT. - REVERSE ANGLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLOSE ON BRITTLES He brings the sabre down , pointing it to right . &nbsp; BRITTLESReady on the right ! FIRE ! 192 CLOSE ON THREE TROOPERS Calmly they have been sighting along their carbines --  their faces expressionless , intent . The CARBINES BARK in unison . &nbsp; BRITTLES ' VOICE ( o.s . ) Ready on the left ! Fire !  --  80  --  193 FULL SHOT Brittles -- sabre to left -- and including three other troopers who have risen from behind boulder and FIRE simultaneously . 194 EXT. - FULL ON INDIANS As REVERBERATION of second volley SOUNDS . Red Shirt pulls his horse back on its haunches as two Indians near him go down -- and the charge is broken . Another FUSILLADE cracks out . Red Shirt yells for his men to turn and the Indians wheel their mounts and ride off . As he rides off , Red Shirt pauses long enough to pick up one Indian whose mount has been lost . The Indian does a running vault up beside Red Shirt and is carried away . 195 EXT. - NEAR BOULDERS The patrol -- -having swept past the squad -- has circled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and their sobbing horses . Brittles is the first to reach the mount carrying double and steadies the wounded man -- Corporal Quayne -- as he all but falls to the ground . 196 EXT. - DETAIL AROUND BRITTLES AND QUAYNE Quayne is a rough-tongued veteran , now bled almost white -- and with a broken-shafted arrow imbedded over his heart . Brittles and others help him to the ground . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( during this ) Steady Corporal , steady . . .

( indicating arrow ) . . . and I got this ! . . . Quayne suffers himself to be placed prone now . The clatter of the approaching troop comes over as Cohill leads it forward . Quincannon rides in and dismounts and approaches the group around Quayne.  --  82  --  &nbsp; BRITTLES ( during this ) A good clear report , Corporal . . . This day will show on your record when you come up for that extra stripe in two or three years . . . Seeing Quincannon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think a drink of whisky is in order here , Sergeant .

Brittles has arisen . He gives Quincannon an impatient glance . &nbsp; BRITTLESNot for you , you jughead ! Leaving Quincannon hurt and crestfallen , Brittles stalks away . 197 ANGLE INCLUDING VANGUARD OF TROOP AS IT RIDES IN , COHILL LEADING Cohill brings his arm to the signal for halt and prepares to dismount the troop . Dr. O'Loughlin is out of the wagon like a shot and hurries toward the knot of troopers around Quayne , followed by Abby . Brittles moves quickly toward Cohill . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( calling sharply ) There will be no halt , Mister Cohill !

Sergeant Tyree was right . Cohill 's jaw hardens . This is the news both men have been fearing . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( bitterly ) I have been too late ! A trooper leads Brittles ' horse to him . He mounts his horse and walks out into the lead , with Cohill following . DISSOLVE . Section Details 198 EXT. - TROOP ON THE MOVE AGAIN - TROTTING Brittles leads the column . Olivia and Cohill are packed in close with the first squad . The wagon brings up the rear . Its flaps are down , but there is no other sign as it rattles and bounces along that a desperately wounded man lies within it . An orderly leads the doctor 's horse at the flanks of the wagon . 199 CLOSE ON TAILGATE OF THE WAGON - MOVING Dr. O'Loughlin , his manner anxious , comes from within the wagon and beckons to the orderly . &nbsp; O'LOUGHLINMy horse , Grady . . .

O'Loughlin 's dour face is illumined with a smile .  --  85  --  &nbsp; O'LOUGHLINThank you , Nathan ! And he gallops the length of the column as we see the men throwing off their horses and beginning to walk . DISSOLVE Section Details 201 thru 205 SERIES OF SHOTS - THE WALKING TROOP This is a procession , a funeral march , not the romantically-caparisoned movement of a cavalry troop . The scene shrieks with silence -- a suspenceful silence like that in a quiet room with a noisy clock . Here the clock is the SCUFFING of booted feet , the PLOP-PLOP of horses ' feet in soft ground , the monotonous CLINK of canteens , the agonizing SQUEEK of one wheel in an axle that needs grease . 1 . COMPREHENSIVE ON COLUMN , moving in an almost serpentine fashion to follow a level course . 2 .

They are kicking stones out of the path -- stooping occasionally to roll out a larger boulder -- stamping or scuffing earth to fill depressions . We must sense this is not a matter of orders , but of desire . ( NOTE : It may be deemed desirable -- and for fuller clarity here -- that these men are not leading their horses , but have turned them over to horseholders who stride parallel with the work group ) . 5 . As the wagon passes , we briefly see ABBY ALLSHARD , her hair bound with a **29;2682;TOOLONG out and toss Quayne 's blood-stained shirt with its  --  86  --  yellow chevrons , to the ground . The eyes of the passing troopers flick to it as they stoically trudge along . 6 . CLOSE ON WAGON WHEELS at ground level , rolling through the dirt , cutting a deep double-track .

Captain Brittles. . . yo ! At the first SOUND , Brittles flinches . His face shows his foreboding ; he falters -- turns , looks down the column where -- in the far distance by the wagon -- O'Loughlin 's orderly is waving .

They look after him . 206 EXT. - WAGON - REAR As Brittles reins in and walks a pace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the canvas bows , looks up at Brittles .

The doctor 's announcement is greeted with a hoarse CHORUS of JUBILANT YELLS from the troopers immediately around . Brittles ' smile is as relieved as theirs as he yells . &nbsp; BRITTLESPass the word ! . . .

The good news about Quayne has had its natural effect on her and is making her forget her hostility toward Cohill . &nbsp; OLIVIA ( happily ) I 'm so glad about Corporal Quayne ! Cohill cups his hands to receive her boot . &nbsp; COHILL ( bluntly ) Why ? . . . He 's just another dogface soljer in dirty-shirt blue . . . He has lifted her into the saddle . She looks down on him angrily , but he meets her stare -- challenging her . &nbsp; COHILLWhat 's it mean to you if he lives -- or dies ? . . . Did you ever dance with him at the fort ? . . . speak to him ? . . . Did you ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . turns to a little self-searching and possibly some contrition . Cohill meanwhile has gone to his horse and mounts . Brittles passes them and takes the head of the column . &nbsp; COHILL ( answering his question ) No. . . you did n't . . . No officer 's bars . . . not a gentleman . They put their horses in motion , close behind Brittles . &nbsp; OLIVIAI 've been finding that some lieutenant 's bars are no guarantee of that !  --  89  --  &nbsp; COHILLYou 're glad about Quayne -- certain ! But only because it puts the happy ending to the story you 're taking back east to your tea parties . . .

A little to Cohill 's surprise , Olivia does n't hesitate a moment -- in fact seems -- and is -- truly grateful for a chance to be of service . &nbsp; OLIVIACertainly , Captain . . . thank you ! As she turns and rides out , Brittles moves closer to Cohill , who has been looking back , frowning , after Olivia . &nbsp; BRITTLESHas anyone ever taken down your little britches and tanned your hide , Mister Cohill ? &nbsp; COHILL ( somewhat startled ) Why . . . no sir ! . . . that is yessir , my father . . . with a razor strop , sir .  --  90  --  &nbsp; BRITTLES ( pointedly ) Well , Mister Cohill , I 'm old enough to be your father . . . Take the point , Mister . As Cohill spurs out . 210 EXT. - WAGON - OLIVIA Olivia is being helped into the moving wagon by Sergeant Quincannon , who is leading her horse . She goes forward bravely , trying not to recoil at the sickly sweetness of the chloroform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . As she disappears , Abby comes forward into view . 211 EXT. - ABBY ON TAILGATE She is unwinding the kerchief or white band which , nurse-fashion , has been covering her hair .

Brittles riding at the point , with his bugler. 213 CLOSER ON BRITTLES Suddenly he pulls in , looks off -- his face tense . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( to the bugler ) Sound the charge ! Brittles spurs ahead -- at the gallop . The bugler stands his mount a moment , blowing the STRIDENT NOTES . 214 COMPREHENSIVE ON THE TROOP At the charge , BUGLE BLOWING o.s . As it crests the rise , or rounds the butte-whichever terrain permits . 215 ANGLE FROM BEHIND AND ALONGSIDE THE ROCKETTING COLUMN MOVING UPON THE BURNING RUIN OF SUDRO 'S STAGE STATION - MOVING SHOT  --  92  --  We see the burning buildings , the corral in whose gate the stagecoach -- one wheel broken -- is almost consumed by the fire . Atop a high corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waving a guidon . There is a well at Sudro 's and , grouped around it , a tight little band of four troopers and Sergeant Tyree , holding a six-year-old tow-headed girl in his arms . Near them is the girl 's brother -- a nine-year-old , with a rifle two feet longer than himself . Still in the defensive positions they had been holding until the troop brought relief . Possibly far in the distance -- and receding as the troop approaches -- we may see the dust cloud created by the retreating Indians . 216 217 EXT. - NEAR WELL AND CORRAL As the column thunders in and at a signal from Brittles , comes to a panting holt . Tyree , the besieged troopers and the boy stagger toward Brittles . The men are powder-smudged , smoke-stained . Perhaps a torn sleeve and bloody smear here and there among them attest to the close fighting . The little girl 's eyes are wide with terror .

Somewhat apart from her stand COHILL and PENNELL . A study of the cross-currents of their minds would be interesting . To Cohill , her attitude is merely the personally-disappointed one of the traveller who has missed a train . To Pennell , this means Olivia will spend the winter at the post -- to give him time for his resignation to be acted on . To the girl herself , this is a moment of self-revelation ; she has seen horror ; she feels herself accountable for it ; had it not been for this trip to catch the stage there might have been no massacre at Sudro 's . . . Beyond that she may be thinking of a man named Flint Cohill and beginning to understand his bitterness and the reasons for his low opinion of her . Brittles enters the scene , speaks sternly to his dawdling lieutenants.  --  95  --  &nbsp; BRITTLESSee to the troop , Mister Cohill ! Mister Pennell. . . the picket lines !

She hands the flag to Tyree who takes it reverently.  --  96  --  &nbsp; ABBYIt 's the best that I could do , Sergeant . &nbsp; TYREEIt 's mighty kind of you , ma'am . As Tyree turns away , CAMERA SLOWLY PANS him over to where three crude hastily knocked together wooden coffins are side by side , awaiting burial . He kneels on one knee , takes his revolver and nails the now identifiable Confederate flag on one of the coffins .

Squad fires burning , huddled blanket-shrouded figures prone or outlined against some of the fires which are now burned much lower than they were when seen at the time of the burial . Prominent is one sentry-like figure , caped and hatted. 226 CLOSE - DETAIL OF ROCKS - NIGHT A painted Cheyenne carefully pulls back on his war bow and releases an arrow with a sinister TWANG.  --  101  --  227 EXT. - DETAIL SUDRO 'S - NIGHT The sentry-like figure in cape and hat shudders with the impact of an arrow that buries itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It catches fire at once -- revealed as Olivia 's dressmaker 's dummy -- and as it blazes brilliantly . 228 CLOSE ON CHEYENNE His face a mask of surprise , then chagrin .

DISSOLVE Section Details 229 EXT. - ROUGH COUNTRY - NIGHT EFFECT ( NOTE TO CREW : This and following shots leading to the Rynders massacre sequence may be made on some of the rainy or cloudy days to be expected on location ) . The column passes the CAMERA tightly drawn up at close intervals at a dogged horse-walking pace . Nothing is heard but the MUFFLED TREAD of the horses , the quickly-silenced CLANKING of a CANTEEN or SABRE , the RUMBLE of the WAGON . Brittles leads the column -- the grim man-of-war , eternally vigilant ; squired by his bugler . After him , the first squad with giant Quincannon tenderly carrying the six-year-old Sudro girl on the pommel of his saddle . Near him rides the boy , still valiantly clutching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully to the tightlipped Cohill riding grimly nearby . Then the wagon . Abby parts the canvas covers as a trooper , riding close , hands in his canteen -- for wounded Quayne . She accepts it with a nod , the covers swing shut and the wagon moves .  --  102  --  Finally the rear guard -- and Ross Pennell , his face as black and angry as Flint Cohill 's . Suddenly he stiffens and whirls to one side , defensively , as we hear the DRUMMING of a horse 's HOOVES , a shouted CHALLENGE and quick REPLY . &nbsp; TROOPER ( o.s. ) ( flanker in distance ) Who 's that ? &nbsp; TYREE 'S VOICE ( o.s . ) Sergeant Tyree. . . 230 FULL SHOT - HEAD OF COLUMN Brittles and troop van as Tyree approaches from angle to column . Brittles spurs out to meet him . The two men put their heads together as Tyree makes his report -- which we can not overhear except as a BUZZ over the steady forward movement of the troop . Brittles and bugler pull out of column with Tyree and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TROOP &nbsp; BRITTLES ( softly ) Pass the word for Mr. Pennell . . . We hear the whispered word carry back .

Pennell rides in . &nbsp; BRITTLESSabre , Mister . . . and come along . . .  --  103  --  Pennell quickly unhooks his sabre and the four men ride in file alongside the wagon , drop their sabres on the floor beside the driver . Abby sees them -- with some apprehension . Then they ride off in the direction from which Tyree had come . The troopers ' heads turn apprehensively as they go past . Olivia makes a small gesture -- the faintest raise of a hand -- as Pennell passes her , but he does not seem to see her . 232 LONG SHOT - FROM TROOP ANGLE On the four riders -- Brittles , Tyree , bugler and Pennell , picking their way up rising ground , rough country . 233 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tyree raises his hand and dismounts . The others follow . They turn their reins over to the bugler who acts as horse-holder , and warily continue their climb afoot . Now , faintly -- then with increasing clarity -- we hear the sound of MEN 'S VOICES -- one , authoritative , others angry , jabbering. 234 CLOSE ANGLE - ACROSS A RIDGE TOP As the heads of Tyree , Brittles , Pennell peer over the crest . The reflection of dancing flames dapple their interested faces . 235 EXT. - A SMALL HIDDEN VALLEY - NIGHT ( NOTE TO PRODUCTION CREW : Director suggests this scene be shot at night at a site near the permanent camp location , generator lights to be augmented with flares . ) In the red glare of campfires , Red Shirt with a score or more of his Arapahoes stand in a rough semi-circle around the gun-runners ' wagon . It is the typical frontier freight wagon with its canvas now pulled back to reveal its contents . Within it may be seen bolts of trade goods , some whiskey kegs , but predominantly rifle and ammunition boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailgate and near it , possibly on the ground , is an opened case of rifles .  --  104  --  Toucey Rynders stands negligently against the wagon , his silver-headed buggy whip in his hand . Acting as his spokesman and interpreter is LEE BRADLEY . Hench , one of Rynders ' goons , holds his carbine ready -- eyes roving over the Indians . The other goon is handing out tin cups of whiskey to some of the Indians -- a group of others jockeying for position near the keg . Other Indians are staring greedily at the rifles in the box . Bradley is talking to Red Shirt  --  words not distinguishable at this distance . But his attitude and that of Red Shirt indicate that they are arguing or bargaining . In the b.g. of the scene are the Indian horses -- a few of the youngest bucks guarding them . 236 EXT. - CLOSER STUDY AROUND WAGON Red Shirt is concluding an angry speech to Bradley . &nbsp; RED SHIRT ( in Indian ) . . . too much . . . too much . . . &nbsp; BRADLEY ( to Rynders ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rynders plucks one of the shiny Winchesters from its case , pushing back a few young Indians who have been bending over it . &nbsp; RYNDERS. . . too much , eh . . . ?

Red Shirt shoots Rynders a look of savage hatred -- as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . &nbsp; RED SHIRT ( in Indian ) You have the money . Suddenly Rynders wheels and discovers a young Indian reaching tentatively for one of the carbines in the case . With a teamster 's skill , he slashes out with the whip and lays a red welt across his face . As he does , there is a startled cry from one of the goons and a yell from the Indians . &nbsp; RYNDERS ( as he strikes ) Get out of that , you dog-eating thief ! 239 EXT. - RED SHIRT - STUDY OF SYMMETRY - NIGHT ( FLARES ) With poised skill , the giant Indian raises the bow , feathered shaft and string to his ear , and with brawny forearm in powerful and graceful pull , extends the bow to its full pull . As he lets fly , there is a terrific " TWANG " . . .  --  106  --  240 EXT. - RYNDERS - EFFECT SHOT - NIGHT ( FLARES ) He has turned just in time to take the arrow full into the breast . It transfixes him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a target of blood widening upon the white silk shirt . Even as he falls , bending , already dead , at the foot of the rifles , there is a terrific SHOUT . 241 EXT. - PANDEMONIUM AND LOOTING - NIGHT ( FLARES ) SCREAMS , YELLS , demoniacal LAUGHTER , as frenzied Indians rush in to fight with the guards and loot . The bucks are transformed into crazy men . Even though there are plenty of rifles for all , they fight among themselves in their crazed eagerness to secure Winchesters and cartridges . 242 EXT. - BRITTLES AND PENNELL - NIGHT EFFECT Brittles is watching the scene without a change of expression , but Pennell has the eye of one who is learning something , his eyes begin to travel , as if following a moving object . 243 EXT. - GENERAL VIEW OF LOOTING - NIGHT ( FLARES ) Hench , a bully earlier identified as Rynders ' right hand man , is running like a deer , broken arm flapping behind him . As he dodges , rabbit-fashion , behind him two boys on ponies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tag , suddenly a giant warrior rides into the scene , raises in his saddle , and pins Hench into the ground ( with a telescope lance ) , as the two youths rush by to count coup on him . 244 EXT. - BRITTLES AND PENNELL - NIGHT EFFECT Pennell 's eyes have ceased roving , as he has followed the chase to the kill , and he looks anxiously at Brittles , who continues to stare deadpan. 245 EXT. - INDIAN REVEL - NIGHT ( FLARES ) The rifles are all apportioned now . Twenty-five or thirty bow-and-arrow fighters now have two or three Winchesters apiece . They gallop about in a sort of Indian gymkhana , or horse carnival , around the figure of their chief , Red Shirt . Their CRIES , in Indian language , are evidently  --  107  --  given to vaunting and boasting . Some of them are making the difficult off-side , under-the-neck shot . Some others are simply firing at random , emptying their magazines at the stars . Others are piling high the wooden cases for a bonfire . Still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are trailing them like garlands , round and round the scene . . . After many feats of wild horsemanship , crazed exultation , all composed into a general pattern of a devil 's ritual . . . . 246 EXT. - FEATURING BONFIRE - NIGHT ( FLARES ) The Indians have caught one of the bullies and are carrying him spread-eagle , as he fights and shouts . They fling him high in the air and he lands smack in the fire , as they roar with laughter . As the man bounds out , ablaze , they seize him and lift him again . 247 EXT. - TROOP IN COLUMN - COHILL - NIGHT EFFECT The troop is moving along at the trot . Cohill is keeping it closed up . He hears the SOUND of DISTANT FIRING . There is apprehension and anxiety for the missing captain on every face as the troop goes by . 248 EXT. - INDIAN PANDEMONIUM - NIGHT ( FLARES ) Red Shirt sits his horse , brandishing a rifle and calling out the tune of the CHANT , like some satanic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are at the pitch of fury in their antic delirium , and the DRUMS boom war . 249 EXT. - BRITTLES AND PENNELL - NIGHT EFFECT Tyree is shadowy behind them .

Pennell leading the troop down the declivity. 2 .

Pennell arriving at the river 's edge with the van , is looking at the current , trying to pick his best course . As he leads off into the water , looking back from time to time . 6 . The young lad with the long rifle , looking forward with the thrill and excitement of swimming a river with a force of cavalry , himself suddenly planked into a world of romance and danger from the life of a little chore-boy at a stage stop . 7 .

Quincannon elaborately stands at vigil , still holding the little girl on his saddle . The suggestion is that the women are wringing out their wet skirts . Quincannon does an elaborate " takum " , and averts the little child 's face from the scene , shielding her eyes with a broad hand , as Abby and Olivia step from behind the boulder , carrying their wet skirts on their arms .

The WHOOPING and DRUMMING becomes louder and there are a few more SHOTS . 279 EXT. - FULL SHOT - TROOP AND RIVER Cohill fording the stream , the troop moving off -- but every eye in the column back on the man crossing the stream alone .

We may see Quincannon , steadying the sleeping Sudro girl , holding her on his saddle . Abby and Olivia -- no longer the sharp contrasts of dashingly-dressed Eastern girl and drably-practical veteran army wife , but alike as two dusty peas in a pod . A grim , silent , spent cavalcade , it plods through the gates of the fort . No cheers , no welcoming cries for its reception . Only a MURMUR , perhaps , of shock and sympathy . The children themselves stare with open mouths . The very dogs hang back .  --  120  --  The troop moves in -- with Pennell bringing up the rear guard -- and the stockade doors slowly come shut and we hear , muffled and distant : &nbsp; BRITTLES ' VOICE ( a dry croak ) Troop . . . halt ! . . .

DISSOLVE TO :  --  125  --  Section Details 285 EXT. - FORT STARKE - EARLY MORNING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CAPTAIN BRITTLES ' QUARTERS Once again we see , thru the door into his sleeping quarters , the booted leg of Brittles being flexed , painfully , as its owner faces his last day in the Army . But there is something new in his bleak quarters -- an old-fashioned suitbox lying on the plank table . Draped over its opened cover is a claw-hammer pepper-and-salt mixture of pre-Civil War vintage and nearby a high-crowned , flat-topped hard hat . There may be other evidences that Brittles has spent much of the night getting his belongings in order -- his military gear piled on one side , his few personal things on the other . The door is flung open and Quincannon enters and comes to a thundering attention . &nbsp; QUINCANNONGood morning , sir . . . Five-thirty-one . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( o.s . ) Five thirty-two . &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( spots the ciwies --  makes for them wonderingly ) And a black day for the Army . Brittles comes out , completing his dressing . If he sees Quincannon staring and fingering the ciwies , he ignores it . &nbsp; BRITTLESHave the quarters cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firewood to Mrs. Crumrein. . . my extra saddle to Mister Pennell. . . you can sell the pail and the wash-basin . . . &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( a sudden thought ) . . . and the olla , Captain darlin ' ? &nbsp; BRITTLESOh yes . . . the olla !  --  126  --  He goes to it and under Quincannon 's astonished stare reaches in and plucks out the bottle -- and holds it to the light . &nbsp; QUINCANNON. . . now how did that ever get there . . . ? Brittles merely gives him a look . Quincannon turns accuser . &nbsp; QUINCANNONHow long have ye known about it ? &nbsp; BRITTLESEver since the second battle of Bull Run , you thickhead ! &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( hurt -- touching his heart ) It hurts to think of ye deceivin ' me all these years , sir . Brittles almost casually shoves the bottle to Quincannon and goes to the calendar . We now see that this is the ringed day . Brittles carefully draws a line through it -- and then , after a moment 's bitter reflection -- with two sweeping strokes slashes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ! Well , Sergeant , I think this is an occasion for a drink . Help yourself . &nbsp; QUINCANNONNo , I 'd take no pleasure in it . . . ( quickly ) But as it 's an order , sir . . . Yer health . He lifts the bottle and gulps thirstily . Brittles moves to the hated ciwies . Quincannon follows him , wiping his lips .  --  127  --  &nbsp; QUINCANNONOnly fourteen days for meself , sir , and then , no doubt , I 'll be havin ' to buy one of these monkey suits , too . &nbsp; BRITTLESIt 's the only one I ever owned . . . I was a lad in jeans when I left my father 's farm to join the army . . . I 'd drink to your retirement , Sergeant , if I were a drinking man . . . &nbsp; QUINCANNONSir , I 'll do the honors for ye . He raises the bottles . A BUGLE CALL -- probably ASSEMBLY -- sounds . Brittles whirls at it , facing the door . Quincannon lowers the bottle . Brittles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review the troop alone this morning . . . Try on that suit for me ! &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( puzzled ) The suit , sir . . . ? &nbsp; BRITTLES ( firmly ) Want to see how it looks . Quincannon sets down the bottle --  gives a quick darting look about the room -- looking for the Captain 's dress coat . Brittles meanwhile does his familiar leg-flexing routine and steps bravely out the door . 288 EXT.  --  BRITTLES ' QUARTERS As Brittles emerges -- then comes to a stunned stop , looking off .  --  128  --  289 EXT. - FORT STARKE COMPANY STREET The troop stands ready at horse , Pennell and Allshard among them .

The sabres flash up -- every eye on Brittles. 290 EXT. - BRITTLES ' QUARTERS He is manifestly stunned by the honor they are paying him . Quincannon comes up behind him with his dress coat , to which is pinned his Medal of Honor . Brittles unhooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it back on , mounts and rides away . 291 EXT. - COMPANY STREET The troop remains at the salute as Brittles rides to the front center position .

He bends down for a closer glimpse but a pre-warning SOUND of STRAIN makes him straighten promptly . He tries the silver-headed cane at various jaunty angles -- all the while indulging in a little half-wistful monologue . &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( soto voce ) Ah now , me darling Missus Callahan ' stoo good of ye to say that . . . besides , Callahan 's me friend . . . He whirls guiltily as Brittles enters . &nbsp; QUINCANNON ( cont 'd ) ( guiltily ) Excuse me , Captain , I was just practicin ' to be a civilian . &nbsp; BRITTLESLet 's see the side view .

He starts to salute , awkwardly comes in contact with the derby , tips it and practically stumbles out . Brittles follows him to the door and watches after . 297 EXT. - COMPANY STREET Quincannon strutting self-consciously but proudly across the street toward the Sutler's -- ignoring the amazed glances of some troopers who turn to stare after him . Among these is Sergeant Hochbauer . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( calling ) Sergeant Hochbauer !

Suddenly out of the doorway , there emerges a mass of knotted and rioting men , with Quincannon the center of the group . It staggers in a collective whirl like a demented octopus , until with a mighty gesture , Quincannon swings himself free , scattering the men like nine pins in a circle about him . He manages to hold his grasp on only one , Wagner himself if possible , and swings him aloft with his two brawny arms .

DISSOLVE .  --  139  --  Section Details 307 308 309 310 EXT. - INDIAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHT EFFECT SERIES OF SHOTS . It is a scene of wildest excitement and savagery . Around the scores of circularly-grouped tepees , war dances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two or three quarters , small bands of mounted Indians are dashing into the camp , to alight and be greeted by those already assembled . Horses are led into the pony herd picketed nearby . The fact that this is an alliance of the tribes will be suggested by the varied clothing worn by the different bands -- some in the hanging clouts and shirts of the Southern tribes , some in the ornate porcupine-quilled leggings and chest plates of the Plains Indians , some war -- bonneted , some in bison-horned caps . Masked dancers are RATTLING GOURDS and DRUMS . Individual Indians are racing their ponies up and down -- firing SHOTS wildly into the sky . Groups are dancing and chopping at the painted war posts . Red Shirt and some of the band seen at the Rynders massacre greet a new arriving band of savages -- and as the chief alights , Red Shirt ceremoniously presents him with one of the stolen rifles . As this chief now raises it and pledges himself to war , the SOUNDS of PANDEMONIUM rise to a new CRESCENDO. 311 EXT. - ALONG RIDGE SLOPE - NIGHT EFFECT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line just beneath the ridge crest . The troopers are dismounted , sprawled out . Horseholders guard the picket lines .

Tyree is back . Brittles swings into his saddle . &nbsp; BRITTLESFollow on , Sergeant ! And he and Tyree ride toward the direction of the Indian camp . DISSOLVE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The excitement has reached a fever pitch . Dancers are prancing , waving scalps , brandishing rifles . Red Shirt is riding in short galloping bursts back and forth through the camp , followed by some of his braves . Perhaps a few of them still are waving the yard goods and ribbon taken from Rynders . Somewhat apart from the turbulent scene is a wagon belonging to old Pony-That-Walks . In it are his squaws . We may see -- but not spot -- the old chieftain and a few of the elder members of the tribal council squatted before a fire near the wagon . Suddenly out of the darkness and into the red glare of the fires ride two figures -- like blue apparitions : Brittles and Tyree . They ride , eyes straight ahead , into the middle of the camp and towards Pony-That-Walks . There is a moment 's hush as they appear , succeeded by SCREAMS of anger and astonishment and the braves begin to converge on them and follow them . Some of the riders  --  143  --  dash their horses up to them and rear up -- challengingly .

Brittles looks up . 317 CLOSE ANGLE RED SHIRT He holds his bow ready for another shot , a look of malignant hatred on his face . The Indians HOWL their approval at his challenge . 318 319 FULL SHOT Brittles quickly stoops , pulls out the arrow , breaks it , spits on it and flings it into Red Shirt 's face . Red Shirt has lost much face by this . . but we must sense from his expression , his convulsive grasp of his bow that it will be but a matter of seconds before he releases another shaft . But in this split second old Pony-That-Walks hurries into the scene , perhaps deliberately intervening his body between that of Brittles and Red Shirt . A few other elders follow him .

He reaches a hand into a pouch at his belt and extends the salt to Brittles and Tyree. . . as they dip up a pinch and swallow it there is a disappointed HOWL from the young bucks crowding around . &nbsp; PONY-THAT-WALKSSmoke pipe ! . . . Good ! Good ! The old Indian strips the cover from his pipe , takes a brand from one of the other elders , puffs the pipe into life and quickly passes it to Brittles and Tyree . And now the Indians crowding around step back , GROWLING angrily but momentarily at least respecting the peace pipe and salt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .

The old man looks at him a long moment and his eyes dim and his shoulders droop in grief and resignation . Then , with great dignity , he takes his peace pipe in both hands and holds it out chest-high and offers it to Brittles . &nbsp; PONY-THAT-WALKSThen Na-thonn , my brother . . . go in peace ! Brittles takes the pipe with equal dignity , turns and remounts . The old chief raises his hand in farewell and benediction as Brittles and Tyree turn and ride slowly back through the camp . Brittles holds the pipe high , for all to see . 320 CLOSE STUDIES BRITTLES AND TYREE Now , as they slowly ride through the camp , the Indians begin to crowd menacingly again , with a note of rising anger .

But it is the director 's intention to show the herd wildly racing through the village , toppling tepees , scattering the warring braves . The troops will follow at a mad gallop -- not SHOOTING at the Indians themselves , but INTO the AIR and continuing to make the maximum amount of NOISE and CONFUSION . As a final gesture , some of the troopers will throw their fire-brands into the tepees-causing them to go up in flames .

I have been a civilian for two minutes . . . He replaces his watch and unhooks his sabre . &nbsp; BRITTLES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cohill --  &nbsp; COHILL ( accepting it ) Thank you , sir . . . &nbsp; BRITTLES . . . And your Army ! He salutes , wheels his mount and rides off . DISSOLVE . 329 EXT. - LONG SHOT - WIDE ANGLE - MORNING The troop is riding along , grinning broadly . Ahead of them -- by twos , sixes and twenties , the scuffling braves limping along . Riding by Tyree is Pony-That-Walks , smiling very contentedly . &nbsp; TYREEWell , General , how you standin ' that McClellan saddle ? &nbsp; **25;2713;TOOLONG ? DISSOLVE .

Captain Brittles ! 333 WIDE ANGLE - COMPREHENSIVE ON TWO As Tyree spurs his horse towards Brittles. . . 334 CLOSE ON TWO As Tyree pulls in to a stop . &nbsp; TYREE ( fumbling in blouse ) It 's for the Captain , sir ! . . .

With a laugh , both men turn and start the journey back . DISSOLVE . 335 EXT. - FORT STARKE - NIGHT EFFECT - COMPANY STREET OUTSIDE ASSEMBLY HALL As Brittles and Tyree -- dusty with travel -- ride down the main street , paced by an orderly . &nbsp; ORDERLYIn here , sir . . . As Brittles and Tyree dismount -- somewhat curiously -- Sergeant Quincannon , in formal dress and wearing a sword knot , opens the door and emerges . &nbsp; QUINCANNONThe Major 's in here , sir . . . &nbsp; BRITTLES ( wonderingly ) Quincannon. . . ?  --  152  --  Brittles looks hesitantly at Tyree , but Tyree backs away . &nbsp; TYREEAi n't my department , sir . Brittles proceeds alone , and as he passes Quincannon , the sergeant blows gustily in Brittles ' face , then steps back a pace within the lighted doorway of the assembly hall , to stand like a major domo. 336 ANGLE ON DOOR - FROM INSIDE THE ASSEMBLY HALL As Brittles enters , Quincannon is facing the unseen assembly , making his announcement . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brittles ! Chief of Scouts ! Brittles ' head turns down the length of the room and he comes to a stunned stop . And now the BAND LETS GO with a series of RUFFLES and FLOURISHES . 337 FULL SHOT - THE ASSEMBLY ROOM The troop is drawn up in its formal best in a double facing line , with the ladies of the troop standing with the men . Every eye is turned with happy expectation toward Brittles as he stands travel-stained and bewildered in the doorway . Slowly then he makes his way down the lane between the ranks to where Allshard and Abby , the two lieutenants and Olivia stand waiting for him . 338 ANGLE ON ALLSHARD GROUP With a broad smile , Allshard extends his hand to the still overwhelmed Brittles . &nbsp; ALLSHARD ( smiling ) You 're two days overdue -- -Colonel.  --  153  --  &nbsp; BRITTLESI . . . I 'm sorry . . . I. . . got here as fast as . . . &nbsp; ALLSHARD ( grinning ) Do n't apologize . . .

Oh , you look fine . . . does n't he ? &nbsp; BRITTLESYou look pretty fine yourself , Abby . . . &nbsp; ABBY ( blushing ) How can I ? . . . with that big ape of a Quincannon losing my best corsets ! Cohill now comes forward -- leading Olivia with a possessive hand on her hand . &nbsp; COHILLSir , perhaps you 'll be surprised to know that Miss Dandridge and I. . . &nbsp; BRITTLESI knew that all along , Mister . . . He looks at Pennell and smiles . &nbsp; BRITTLESAnyone above the rank of second lieutenant could have seen that , eh , Mister Pennell.  --  154  --  &nbsp; PENNELL ( with a grin ) There 'll come a time when I 'll be the first lieutenant , sir . &nbsp; BRITTLES - COHILL ( in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the BAND STRIKES UP " She Wore a Yellow Ribbon " and there is a general movement to choose partners and begin dancing . Cohill reaches for Olivia , but she backs away and comes closer to Brittles instead . &nbsp; OLIVIAWill you stay for the dance . . . . Colonel ? &nbsp; BRITTLESNo. . . if you 'll excuse me . . . Olivia knows he has a rendezvous and , with swift understanding , takes the small nosegay of flowers she has been wearing and puts it in his hands -- and then dances off with Cohill . Brittles looks at the flowers , then starts from the room . 339 ANGLE NEAR DOOR - QUINCANNON AND HOCHBAUER , TWO TROOPERS IN BACKGROUND , SUGGESTING QUINCANNON 'S GUARDHOUSE ESCORT Quincannon elaborately unsheaths his sword and passes it hilt first to Hochbauer . Hochbauer , with equal dignity and ceremony , refuses to accept it . &nbsp; HOCHBAUER ( to troopers ) Escort the sergeant back to the guardhouse ! And cautiously he slips a pint bottle into Quincannon 's waistband . Quincannon smiles his surprise and pats his belt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make a soldier yet ! And with great dignity , he marches out . 340 EXT. - FORT GATES Brittles slowly walking towards the gate . Again the familiar gesture of the corporal of the guard as he comes out with a collapsible stool . Brittles takes it and our last sight of him is walking up the line -- toward the cemetery silhouetted in the evening sky . FADE OUT . THE END pp. 115-136 &nbsp;
