One rainy morning last week newsmen and photographers picked their way across Maryland 's Aberdeen Proving Ground to a wooden stand overlooking a large , wet field . Soldiers stood on guard . In the middle of the field , some 2,500 feet away , stood a gibbety-looking pole , with a baglike object suspended from it . From the pendent object oozed a steamy vapor . <P> Tethered to stakes at varying distances from the pole were 84 goats munching grass , occasionally maa-aa-ing . <P> What everyone had come to see was the explosion of this steaming bag a new explosive called " glmite , " invented by Lester Pence Barlow . Mr. Barlow had already impressed a joint Congressional military and naval affairs committee by blowing up a telephone pole . Congressmen wanted to see what Mr. Barlow 's glmite would do to the 84 goats . Newsmen , on the advice of army officers , practiced opening their mouths and stuffing their fingers in their ears , glanced anxiously from the suspended bomb to a nearby ambulance . Everything was ready . Two truckloads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the goats . Here , there and everywhere , trailing the skirts of his green slicker , hat drooping with rain , pants spattered with mud , gesturing excitedly , hopped Mr. Barlow . The goats munched on . <P> Where was the Congressional committee ? Looking worried . Congressman An drew Jackson May of Kentucky and Senator Robert Rice Reynolds of North Carolina emerged from under the grandstand shelter . But still missing was Senator Morris Sheppard , chairman of the joint committee , who was flying from Washington . <P> Distracted Mr. Barlow sizzled : " The bomb is dying every second . He meant that the liquid oxygen in his bomb was leaking into the air . A metal case would have held it , but the glmite had been put in a canvas bag so that there would be no flying fragments . Still no Senator Sheppard . Wailed Mr. Barlow : " It 's seeping down through the carbon just like water out of a bag " <P> Colonel Burton Oliver Lewis , second in command at the Proving Ground , tried putting his arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gesture . Mr. Barlow , without waiting for his bomb , exploded . He shouted : " I 'm on the spot . I 'm going to get the horselaugh of the whole nation . I 'm going . . . . " Into his car he hopped , drove fiercely away , abandoning glmite , goats , goatherds , photographers , Congressmen and Colonel Lewis . <P> In time 's nick Senator Sheppard arrived , intercepted Mr. Barlow . Explanations flowed thick &; fast ; Mr. Barlow was persuaded to return . Colonel Lewis tried again to put his arm around Mr. Barlow 's shoulder , this time succeeded . Mr. Barlow pulled cotton wadding from someone 's ears , laughingly stuffed it in the colonel 's . Everyone trooped out for a closer look at the steaming bomb . It was decided to postpone the demonstration for nine days . <P> The 84 goats munched , maa-aa-ed , waggled their dripping whiskers.
