SAMUEL SLANE A STORY BY MURRAY DYER I T WAS the morning of December 8 , 1941 . While in history that date will go down as the morning after Pearl Harbor , there are a few to whom it will go down also as the desperate and despairing end , not perhaps of their faith , but certainly of the work which had given their faith its substance . That morning I thought particularly of Samuel Blanc  --  so strongly that it almost seemed as if part of me actually could see him , so many miles away . He was sitting at his breakfast table . From his chair he could look through the windows of the dining room down the slope of the hill on which the residential section of the city stood , to the harbor , and beyond , across the Bay of Osaka to the mountains which rose like a blue smudge to meet the horizon . And the morning , I think , was beautiful , as only morning in winter in the Far East can he beautiful ; but Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a letter from his son Tom , a letter that I knew had been written many weeks before . Samuel Blanc had just finished reading it . I thought of him appraising the years of his endeavor ; and I wondered if he would admit that he did not know whether his work had been worth while . True , Kuno would have been a murderer but for him ; Hondo had been possessed of an evil spirit and he had cured him ; Tsuji was now professor of economics at an Imperial university . " But it was my money , " Blanc would have to say , " which paid for hisstudy . " Three men , and three men only , would come back clearly into Samuel Blane 's mind as he sat appraising the forty years of his service . Samuel Blanc was lonely , and alone , in the darkness of his own Gethsemane . Samuel Blanc was old enough to be my father . I never really knew him . And yet I know him very well . All through my childhood he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father and another missionary named Ffoulkes were the three most important adults in my young life . And yet none of them paid any attention to me . All three of them had come out to Japan in the early , very early , 1900 's . My father was from Montreal . Ffoulkes ( to this day I do not know his first name : he was always called " Mr. Ffoulkes , " or " Ffoulkes " ) was an Englishman . Samuel Blanc was from Kansas . I believe only if you are an advertising agent or a missionary will you come across such a strange assortment as my father , Ffoulkes , and Samuel Blanc . My father called himself " interdenominational , " which covers a multitude of sins . Ffoulkes was an Englishman who had , in his family 's eyes , " gone wrong . " Born and bred to the life of either a country gentleman or a colonial administrator , he had been caught up at Oxford in the fervor of a religious movement which , while the Empire adjusted its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessity of saving the souls of those not fortunate enough to be English by birth . As a result he had signed up for life as a missionary in Japan and was head of the group of missionaries to which my father belonged . Samuel Blanc was a Southern Methodist . In the early 1900 's , when these three men found themselves in Japan , the wheel of life was hanging for a brief moment almost motionless . We know now that the forces getting ready to spin it , and spin it madly , were gathering impetus . But for a child , and for a missionary , and for a business man those early years of the 1900 's were supreme . Security was in each tick of the clock , each mouthful of porridge at breakfast , each session of family prayers at night , each comfortable laying of a tired head on a white pillow while outside the window , rising and falling with the wind , the Buddhist temple bells boomed softly and timelessly . All three men , my father , Ffoulkes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ souls , they held conventions which taught other Japanese to save souls , they gave " Bible readings " and held prayer meetings , they distributed tracts and pamphlets without end ; they were the slaves of one idea : the world was soon going to come to an end and the souls they had saved would be their reward for the things they had given up . Make no mistake about it , these three men , and many others like them , were not unintelligent . All three of them had given up good positions , good money , good futures to get the Japanese into heaven . This of course kept them very busy . So , what with meetings and pamphlets and conventions , together with Bible readings , I did not see much of my father except at breakfast and supper . In the earliest years of my life I had to find my own amusement . And , since in the town where my father was stationed , there were only two other " foreigners , " things that the average boy or girl would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Samuel Blanc were among these . For six years my father worked in a district over which Samuel Blane had supervision . And for six years , at least four times a year , he came to stay with us . For days I looked forward to his coming . Instead of going to bed immediately after supper , I was allowed to sit in the living room and play one game of chess . At breakfast I heard stories about his boyhood on a farm in Kansas ; how the molasses in the cellar froze stiff , and his brother went down to get some of it for buckwheat cakes and left the spigot in the barrel turned on , simply because it was so cold he could n't turn it off . When the thaw came of course the Blanes had lost their molasses . " And say , " said Samuel Blanc , winding up that story , " did Dave find out all about what cold weather does to liquids ? Dad took him out in the woodshed and paddled it right into him . Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that week-end as it happened , and he listened to the story with amazement . When it was finished he barked : " I say , Blanc , d' you mean your father beat your brother for not turning the spigot off when it was so cold he could n't move it ? " " Sure he did , " said Blanc , in his gusto at remembering the details pouring his milk into the sugar bowl instead of over his porridge . " You 've got to learn you do n't forget things when it 's fifteen degrees below zero . Dad did n't thrash him because he could n't turn the spigot off . lie thrashed him because he forgot to tell any of us he 'd left it on . " " You 're pouring your milk into the sugar bowl , " said Ffoulkes acidly at this point , and the resultant confusion stopped any more stories at that meal about the farm in Kansas . Still , although these visits left brilliant pictures in my mind which I could go off by myself and think about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play with , there was a gap in those early days which was filled when Samuel Blanc began bringing his son Tom along with him on his trips . Tom was about my age , and after the first afternoon we found we could get along . The first visit by the two of them coincided with Ffoulkes ' presence . In addition two more missionaries were down , so the house was pretty full . The cause was a full-blown Revival which was to be started in the town . The fact that Tom was coming this time with Mr. Blanc , and that a Revival campaign was to be undertaken which would last at least a week , was almost too much for me . I kept wondering why both things had to happen together . Why could n't they be spaced out when there was so little to look forward to anyway ? Friday came ( for some reason Revivals always started on a week-end ) , and with it Tom and Mr. Blanc . The Revival campaign was to start that night at seven-thirty . Samuel Blanc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other two missionaries , had been waiting for Blanc so they could all go together into my father 's study and hold their own private prayer meeting for the success of the week 's services . My mother was busy with a thousand things : the food for supper , the sheets for the beds , the towels for the washstands . So naturally Tom and I had to shift for ourselves . We went into the garden and stood looking at each other , doubtfully and askance , as small boys have looked at each other since the world began . " How much muscle 've you got ? " Torn said suddenly , opening the conversation . This I immediately resented for , since it was my home ground , it was obviously my business to speak first . I looked him over for a minute and then said , belligerently : " More'n you have , so shut up . " Tom looked at me for a few seconds and then said quietly : " I guess we better fight . " " 1 do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? " " Not very well , " he confessed . " But I 'm learning . I 've had two fights with Roy already . " Roy , I knew , was his considerably older brother . " Well , " I suggested , " suppose you teach me all youknow about fighting and then we 'll fight ? " " All right , " Tom agreed . " Shall we start now ? " " Yes , " I said . " They 've gone into father 's study to pray and that means we wo n't have supper till six-thirty . " For the next hour I learned " fighting " and finally surprised Tom by saying that it did n't seem nearly as good as jiu-jitsu . This was the beginning of a firm and steady friendship . Tom knew nothing about jiu-jitsu and I , in the long afternoons which I spent alone , had found out I could wander down the street to a police school where jiu-jitsu was taught . The policemen were very kind to me and used to let me come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would call me out on to the floor and show me how to throw a man over my shoulder or fling him on his back across my hip . When Tom left at the end of the week he was planning how best to get Roy into a fight so that he could throw him across the floor with the jiu-jitsu hold which I had taught him . Meanwhile on this particular afternoon we grew tired of fighting and " judo " by five o'clock , and wandered back to the house through the garden , wondering how much longer before supper . We passed under the windows of my father 's study and stopped to listen . Both of us had heard prayer meetings like this one before . We were no mean judges and our critical knowledge was based on having heard the extemporaneous prayers of some pretty good men . We listened for a while in silence . My father 's voice rose and fell in rolling cadences : " Pour out , 0 Lord , Thy spirit upon the souls who will gather before the mercy seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ffoulkes was praying : " 0 Lord , we will not leave this room until we have Thy assurance of victory . Come down in power , manifest Thyself in glory , pour out upon Thy servants , gathered here , the oil of Thine anointing that we may go forth to victory in Thy name . " . . Tom and I withdrew from the window . We believed in those days in the actual and not the figurative meaning of words . " How long , " I said , " d' you think before they know God 's going to give them the victory ? " This was no blasphemous question . It was serious and all-important . And Tom knew it was . For one thing , on its answer hung our supper . " I do n't know , " said Tom , " but the meeting starts at half-past seven . " " You mean , " I asked , " they 've got to know before then ? " " Yes , " said Torn simply . " I forgot that , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get ready to eat . In my youth one of the most important things in my life was The River . It came down out of the green , pine-clad mountains which marched around the city to the north , in a series of white , glistening cataracts . Where it flowed through the valley it was deep and wide , quiet and satisfying . My ambition was to get big enough to throw a stone all the way across it . My father could n't . Neither could Ffoulkes . But Samuel Blanc could do it . At least he had done it  --  once . And by so much I decided that baseball was a game worth playing , for before making the throw that put the stone on the other side , Mr. Blanc had said he used to play baseball and was a pitcher on his team at college . His third try had put him over . Sometimes we would picnic by The River . Sometimes we would just wander out to it after breakfast and before lunch . Sometimes , usually after Sunday dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along some part , took in The River somewhere where it flowed through the valley . Strangely , I never saw The River except when it was blue . In summer it was a warm , friendly , quivering blue . In the depth of winter it was a chill , hard , steel-blue . But it was always blue . Never gray , never dirty , never troubled . Soon after I had got to know Tom I found another amusement , carpentering . I had managed to get hold of a saw . I used a hammer that belonged to my father . And I was allowed to borrowhis chisel and screw driver . I could get nails any time I wanted them by dropping in at the carpenter 's shop up the street . In summer , old Ushikami , the carpenter , a towel round his head , a coolie coat over his shoulders , a white cloth about his loins , and his legs bare to the ankles , used to like me to stop by and pass the time of day with him . Glistening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , he would stop pulling his saw through a beam that was to become part of a house , take out his absurdly small-bowled tobacco pipe ( enough for three puffs ) , light it and ask me how things were going . Ushikami and I were great friends . And I have always loved the smell of wood shavings since those days . Ushikami showed me how to make my first boat . A clumsy affair but very wonderful . I made it in his shop but with my tools . And it was a Monday in April when it was launched . Of course in The River . Ffoulkes and Mr. Blanc happened to be staying over the week-end . Monday morning we all went for a walk and naturally it was to The River , for I was carrying my boat . All the dusty way to The River I kept thinking to myself just where I would launch it . My father , Mr. Blanc , and Ffoulkes had had some business matters to talk over on the way down so they had walked together , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we crossed the rough , uneven , grassy ground that bordered The River they finished . " Well , " my father called gaily , " where 's your boat , Sonny ? " " Yes , " said Ffoulkes , " put her into the water and let 's see how she sails . " Mr. Blanc said nothing . But I remember he looked at me and grinned . I had a string tied to the stern . I was afraid to sail her without it . She might get lost in the current . As I stooped down to put her into the water I heard Ffoulkes . " I say , John " ? this was to my father ? " she looks as though she 'll capsize . " My father called , " She 's going to turn over . " " No , she is n't , " I shouted back . Those were days of faith . I held her in the water and took my hands off slowly . If she was going to turn over I wanted the failure to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . She floated . And I took my hands away and pushed her out into the current and stood up . Ffoulkes was the first to comment . " Bravo , " he shouted , " that 's capital Capital . " For the first time in my life I really liked him . We all stood watching while my boat bounced over the little , breeze-lifted waves to the middle of The River . Then Ffoulkes spoke again . " I say , why do n't you take the string off and let her go ? " Because , I told him , my liking fading as quickly as it had come into existence , I wanted my boat back . " Nonsense , " Ffoulkes laughed . " The river gets narrower lower down . We could get it back for you there if it got away in the current . But it wo n't . " " Why not ? " I asked . " Because , " he said , " we can take care of it with stones . If we throw stones beyond it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I considered that idea and was inclined to reject it when my father added his support for Ffoulkes . Mr. Blanc said nothing , although I remember that once again he looked at me . But this time he did n't grin . He was just watching . I cut the string . And my ship was on her own . Ffoulkes now took over . " We 'll let her get into the middle of the stream , " he said , " and then we 'll drive her back . We used to do this when I was a boy in Sussex on the Arun . Splendid fun we had too . " They began throwing stones , my father and Ffoulkes . And very soon it was clear that they were not going to have things all their own way . The current was going to have something to say . " We 'll have to throw them nearer , " said Ffoulkes breathlessly , his face beaming . " You 'll hit her , " I said anxiously . " Oh , no , I hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest stone he could find . I can still see that stone , turning lazily in the sunlight before it fell . It swamped my boat . For a minute Ithought she might come through . But no . She rocked dangerously and then capsized . I walked forward a little so that I should be ahead of the men where none of them could see my face . " I say , " said Ffoulkes after the thunder of the splash had died down . I heard my mother remark quietly that it seemed to her a very careless piece of work on his part . Ffoulkes spoke again , to me . " Well , I 'm sorry . But you can make another all right . As a matter of fact you 'll make a better one . A boat should n't capsize like that . But now she 's turned over we ca n't leave her . We 'd better sink her . " And he began throwing stones again , this time to hit . My father looked at me with a friendly grin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " how about it ? Shall we sink her ? " And I nodded . And again Samuel Blanc said nothing but only looked at me . A week later , from Kobe , came a package from him which , when I opened it , was , and still is , the most beautiful model of a two-masted schooner I have ever seen in my life . When I look back on it I think that what I know now of Democracy came from Samuel Blanc . He never talked about it . But he was instinct with it . I doubt if he ever thought much about it either . It was part of his code , although he would n't have understood what you meant by the word " code . " I remember playing chess with him one day . He was a really good chess player and when he could n't play with my father , and always on my own account at least once each visit , he played with me . He taught me how to castle . The first time I saw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could castle . And I 'd got him for once , through his carelessness , into a nasty corner . His castling got him out and I knew that , once out , with his skill I 'd never get the game . But he insisted castling was legitimate , called my mother over to ask her if it was n't , said it was too bad I had n't known it , but that ignorance of the law was no excuse . And he won the game . For a minute I could hear what Ffoulkes would have said if he 'd been there . " I say , Blanc , you know the boy did n't know you could castle . Bit unsporting , do n't you think ? Take the game like that ? " Then I remembered The River , and my boat , and the way Samuel Blanc had looked at me then . He looked at me the same way now . And suddenly I understood . Chess was a game . And it had rules . And you kept the rules . Just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you had debts you paid them . My boat , which Ffoulkes had sunk , was something about which no rules had been formulated . Therefore it was something about which the final decision was mine . But because I was just a boy , Ffoulkes considered I had no particular right to be consulted . To some extent my father held a similar point of view . Of all the five of us on the river bank that day , Samuel Blanc was the only one who felt that as an individual a very small , immature individual  --  I still had a right to make my own decisions in a matter that solely affected me . I began to see less of Samuel Blanc after this . For one thing I was sent away to school . For another , he went home on furlough  --  home to a Kansas I had never seen but in which , nevertheless , I had lived . A Kansas dotted with farmhouses set in vast oceans of prairie grass through which Indians crawled or galloped and over which , periodically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which men like Samuel Blanc saved their homes by setting backfires . A Kansas where men walked with revolvers strapped to their sides , revolvers which they whipped out whenever they insulted each other , which was regularly . It was a very jumbled picture I had painted , pieced together in my own way out of all the many odds and ends of talk by Samuel Blanc to which I had listened for so many years . When he came back I looked at him with a certain reverence . Here was a man who lived much more dangerously than my father did . The years Samuel Blane lived in Japan , I was sure , were the only ones when he was safe . On his return he brought me a set of chess men . We christened it that night . It was my last game of chess with him . From that time on our paths did not cross again until many years later when I saw him at the summer resort of Karuizawa . By that time I had finished school and college and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was back amid surroundings which were part of me whether I would or no . It was nearly the end of August and I was sitting in the grandstand at the baseball field . It was a hot , brilliant afternoon . Slowly the seats filled . A group of missionaries came in , some with their wives . They were well dressed and neat , but the cut and style of their clothes set them apart . Most of the women wore half-length sleeves , some full length , and their shoes were serviceable rather than smart . They sat down next to some members of the diplomatic colony in Tokyo . The men in this second group were in white suits which they could afford to have laundered every day . They had on silk socks . And the women carried expensive sun parasols , while on the hot , still air about them hung the faint but unmistakable scent of a French perfume . Their arms were bare to the shoulders and their dresses had come from Shanghai or the shops on the French ships which called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil and importing firms straggled in , nodding to the legation and embassy people . Ten miles away , its bare , brown shoulder humped against a cloudless sky , the volcano Asama smoked lazily , a low , green-clad ridge running across the foreground in front of it . It was the day of the annual baseball match between the missionaries and non-missionaries . Saints against the Sinners some called it . Surprisingly enough the Saints often won . I was sitting half way up the stand when I saw Samuel Blanc again . I started in surprise . In a straw hat , black alpaca coat and striped white trousers , he ambled into the stand with a big , folded sun umbrella in one hand . He sat down amidst the banter of friends around him just as the game began . it went as any game might go , neck and neck right up to the ninth inning . A certain amount of pleasure was derived from the fact that the Bishop who presided over Samuel Blane 's missionary activities played for the Sinners . They , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to put on a catcher 's glove again , as he had done several times before in his life to very good advantage . As I sat there that afternoon it was hard to think that a world was breaking up under our eyes . Out on the field everything looked and seemed as it had for twenty-five years past . True , Ffoulkes was dead , but he had never come to the grandstand unless it was a cricket match . My father had taken over his administrative duties . Samuel Blanc was older but he scarcely looked it . And the grandstand had a roof that needed patching and a hole in the wire up near the eaves . True also , I was no longer one of the boys who hung on the flanks of the seats , hoping to find the balls which fouled over the top of the grandstand into the tall grasses behind , a service which meant a penny in your pocket for every ball recovered . But I could close my eyes and still see the lanterns decorating the streets at New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear the pounding of the mallets making rice cakes . The game was nearly over by the time I had finished looking backward . It was the second half of the ninth inning , the Sinners batting , two out and the Bishop at bat . The count against him was two and three . The score was nine to eight for the Saints , but there was a man on third . There was a hush over the field that only an American could understand . Then Blanc lifted his voice as he saw Cartwright , who was a Congregationalist , preparing to pitch . " It 's whole hog or nothing , Brother , " he shouted . And the grandstand roared . The Bishop looked round directly at Blanc , and the stand roared again , for Blanc was holding up his fingers to Cartwright in a sign calling for a hot one straight over the plate , and " whole hog or none " was the Bishop 's private battle cry upon every occasion . If it was money to run the mission he wanted all he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be " saved " he wanted it saved in the strictest Southern Methodist manner or else postponed until this could be accomplished . Now , with the count two and three , and the Bishop batting against his colleagues , Blanc had lifted the battle cry against him . And the Bishop was a little annoyed . To give the stand time to quiet down , Cartwright shot the ball to third , and Waterman , a tea exporter , thumbed his nose at him . As the ball came back the Bishop called out to Blanc : " Our Brother in the stand asks for a sign ; let him remember the evil and adulterous generation which earlier asked for a sign and no sign was given unto it . " Blanc waved his umbrella . " Hallelujah , Brother , " he said , " now let 's see you smack it . " The stand shouted again and a voice yelled : " Boys , let 's praise the Bishop with hymn number 210 : Glorious things of thee arc spoken . " Cartwright held up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the umpire , an Episcopalian , waved the stand down to their seats . Again Cartwright got ready to pitch . Suddenly from between the tall grasses at the far end of the field along the path came a rickshaw . Not an unusual sight and we all saw it ; the rickshaw-man loping easily along , behind him , leaning against the cushion , upright , not a passenger but a huge , rectangular , black trunk . Samuel Blanc saw it too and lifted up his voice again . " Brother , " he yelled , and we all knew he meant his Bishop , " there comes your coffin . " Again the stand howled . And we knew the Saints had won . Cartwright would n't even need to pitch the last ball ; he could just lob it , for the Bishop 's nerve had gone . With the stand still shouting , Cartwright slammed a curve over the plate . The Bishop fanned , and it was all over . As the Bishop walked in , Blane walked out , his face wreathed in good-natured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Brother , " he boomed for good measure , remembering the Bishop 's scriptural quote , " that was a mighty good breeze while it lasted , but remember Mark 4 , verse 39 : ' And the wind ceased , and there was a great calm . ' " But the Bishop just pushed past and walked into the locker room . Slowly the crowd began to thin . The daylight faded . The sun set . Asama , the volcano , stood out , black and smoking , against a cloudless sky , quiet now and with banked fires . Even so , none trusted her . For none knew when she would erupt again . Just as none knew when the world would erupt again so suddenly into madness . Yet on that evening there was , in the evening light , the stillness that some say precedes the storm . A thrush fluted from a hedge and a lark rushed skyward singing . Soon the day would be over . And not this day only , but my father 's day , Ffoulkes ' day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " I said as I walked home . But it was ; my day too . Those years can never come back .
