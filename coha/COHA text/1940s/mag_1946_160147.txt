Thirty years ago a young wife was hauled up a sheer 600-ft. cliff to her new home in the Faroe Islands . She has n't yet made up her mind to come down again . Six hundred years ago her Viking ancestors on the craggy basalt archipelago , jutting sharply from the sea 250 miles north of Scotland , came under Danish rule . They have n't yet made up their minds to shake it off . <P> In overheated Faroe kitchens , hotheaded partisans recently have let the whale-oil lamps burn low while they argued the merits of proud independence on the one hand or Danish protection on the other . Some have even suggested alliance with the U.S. or Britain . But last September , when the Danes offered them a flat choice between full freedom or continued rule , the Faroese , unable to decide , turned down both alternatives . Last week they elected a new Lagting ( local parliament ) with instructions to work out some compromise which would adapt Danish rule to local conditions in the Faroes . <P> Why not ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the cliffs ; Faroe ponies ( who double as sheepdogs ) have adapted themselves to eating fish heads when grass is scarce ; and the Faroe sea birds have learned to lay cone-shaped eggs that roll around , but not off , the narrow ledges where they nest .
