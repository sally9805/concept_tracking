Premier Marshal Tito last week charged that Greek forces had fired across the Yugoslav frontier in an effort " to provoke us . " Thousands of Macedonians , he said , had escaped into Yugoslavia to escape Greek terrorism . " Our soldiers , " Tito added , " have not replied with a single shot . " At the same time Moscow , which last week reported similar atrocities from Macedonia , announced that the National Front Government of Federal Macedonia had protested to the Yugoslav Government that " fascist " Greek organizations , supported by units of the Greek Army , were carrying on a reign of terror . The Macedonian organization , said Tass , official Russian news agency , described the terror as comparable in savagery to " the most horrible in the times of Turkish enslavement . " <P> To similar reports a week ago Greek cabinet members replied : " Malicious propaganda . . . . " <P> Were the Greeks clearing Macedonia of everyone who is not a Greek citizen ? Or was the Government of Marshal Tito , which long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ federated Yugoslavia , preparing to carry out its plans ? It was still too soon to say . But there was little doubt that terror of one kind or another was sweeping Macedonia .
