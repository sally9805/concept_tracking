txt THOUGHTFUL BRITISHERS realize , in considering the huge American loan , that if Britain receives much , she also undertakes much . Everyone knows that the credit from the U. S. means a respite in which this country may make a big stride toward equilibrium . He also knows that without it , the equilibrium , if ever recovered , would take twice the time and effort . But everyone also sees the risks involved in the obligation to drop , by certain dates . props which Britain has used to holster its finances and economy against the shocks of war . The pledge to abandon the dollar pool soon comes as a particular surprise . Adherence to Bretton Woods was long ago accepted as an inevitable condition of any American loan , but here also the British attitude remains cautious That is due less to the prospect of resuming the link with gold than to doubts about American readiness to import heavily after the world 's convalescence with the same enthusiasm it now seems to have Inward exporting heavily while the world recovers . That problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . but observers are already wondering how accounts will he squared between the U. S. and Europe after the Continent 's dire postwar reconstruction needs have been met with American abundance and American loans  --  unless the U S. is prepared for a change of role from seller to buyer for a long time Europe has moved a long way into the region of managed economy since Bretton Woods was drafted Thus the campaign for freedom of monetary and commercial eic- change will come up against the opposition of a large number of nations whose economies are strictly state-managed . There 's no doubt of Britain 's sincere sympathy with the American move toward freedom . Britain 's pre-war prosperity itself was based on freedom , but there is skepticism about the practicability of its restoration . This leads many to repeat the remark of the London Times  --  that freedom of trade , like the other freedoms in the modern world . must be organized and ca n't be established by simply dropping fetters and shackles . The official American suggestion about prospective international agreements on commodities and other problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is eventually 1 estored will be more or less strictly managed . ? ? ? SHORTAGE OF LABOR still is the cry from all sectors or economic activity . It threatens to undo the efforts whereby agriculture was revived during the war period . It is the main obstacle to launching the house-building program . It is putting a heavy brake on any increase in industrial production Slowness of demobilization conseq.iently remains a really weak point in the government s armor . According to official statements , the armed forces will have released a million and a quarter and munitions plants two and a half million by the . year-end . For various reasons . However . the civilian labor force will be increased by less than two and a half million . In view of the enormous progress to be made after six years of war that is disappointing . The Government says it is only carrying out the demobilization policy laid down by the coalition government . But that policy was framed in the expectation of Japan 's resisting much longer than it did . It proves a lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far less acute here than in the United States . The number of strikes so far this year is below 1944 . But there are signs of trouble ahead . Farm workers are demanding a 305- increase . Dockers will certainly obtain higher pay . Locomotive engineers are drawing up a net demand and miners and metallurgical workers are thinking of following suit . There is the risk of the movement spreading rapidly unless the government adopts and maintains a firm attitude . So far it has never defined its wage policy although it has pledged itself to stabilize the cost of living . It could scarcely resist the general push for higher wages without inviting a wave of strikes , ? ? ? THE NATIONALIZATION PROGRAM wo n't be as easy to carry out as it looks on paper . The Minister of Fuel . who intended to present to Parliament before Christmas a bill handing over the coal mines to the state , finds so many complications that he has been obliged to request a delay . The problem is n't so much indemnification of owners as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Transport Minister 's proposal to nationalize long distance highway haulage has stirred up a wasp 's nest . Sixty thousand small operators who claim to control 90 ? ; : - of such transport announce they will fight to the death for independence . They contend this is the first time the small businessman has been attacked by the nationalization program and that Labor has always professed to be his friend , ? ? ? RUSTING AND ROTTING surplus war stores dumped on the roadsides and in the fields or jamming needed warehouses have been arousing protests from ill-fed and threadbare citizens who spend days looking for factory space , trucks , raw materials and equipment . By official petrnimminn , only $120 million of surplus goods has been disposed of . whereas in the 15 months following the first World War the Government got rid of 14 times that much . The reason was that In 3919 surpluses were sold at auction by the bulk . Now they ? are offered at controlled prices through regular trade channels .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
