Draft news reared its confused head again last week . Testimony by Manpower Commission and Army bigwigs , asking Congress for next year 's payrolls , raised a welter of headlines that left draft-age men still hopeful but still bewildered . But a handful of facts shone through the fog : <P> &gt;By July 1 , the armed forces will total 9,200,000 men , 7,161,621 in the Army . <P> &gt;The Army will reach 8,200,000 in December , probably grow no larger unless war plans change radically . Peak payrolls for fiscal 1944 will be 8,233,083-including 375,000 WAACs . <P> &gt;For the rest of this year , men will be inducted at the rate of 300,000 a month . For the first half of 1944 ( as far as Manpower officials would prognosticate ) inductions will be just over 100,000 monthly , i.e. , for replacements only . <P> &gt; Industrial deferment is now limited to six months . <P> &gt; The supply of single men is practically exhausted , of childless men is fast running out . ( Selective Service recognizes children born only before Sept. 14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few fathers may be deferred because of " extreme hardship . " Draft Director Hershey described a sample case : " ... A man with two or three children , whose wife is an invalid and who has nothing except what he earns , and who . . . has to take care of his wife and children . . . get the meals and wash the children 's clothes . " <P> &gt;When induction of fathers begins , the number of children will make no difference . <P> &gt; Drafting of fathers will be general around October . The majority of ablebodied , nonessential fathers between 18 and 38 will be in uniform by year 's end .
