Set the clock back to M-Day , Sept. 1 , 1939 . Subtract from the world of that date the German and Japanese military forces . The answer to this calculation is peace . Break that peace into its components . The components are poverty in the midst of plenty . <P> Now set the clock forward to V-Day . The German and Japanese military forces will by then have been subtracted . The answer again will be peace , peace in a world that will be at least one thousand billion dollars poorer in goods and equipment than the world of M-Day , poorer by perhaps fifty million men , women and children who might otherwise have survived. * <P> And if the world of V-Day is no richer in applied wisdom than the world of M-Day , this further calculation can be made . There will be no way except charity to put Europe quickly back on its feet again . International charity must inevitably soon run thin . When the U.S. , for one , ceases to give goods away it will suffer from unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , European and Asiatic collapse will be on a far greater scale than they were when U.S. relief and financial first aid dried up in the early ' 20s . In sum , the answer may be greater poverty in the midst of a greater potential plenty . <P> This calculation rests on the somber fact that the need to rehabilitate is in itself no guarantee that rehabilitation will take place . A row of shattered houses does not get itself spontaneously rebuilt any more than a valuable but unexploited mine spontaneously opens itself or milk spontaneously provides itself to school children or to Hottentots . In a world organized to enjoy the economies of a division of labor , work gets done only as the result of a command or an inducement . <P> In a free economy the universal inducement is money . Command can be issued only in a totalitarian state . Hence , unless the world is to drive itself through painful stages into totalitarianism , it must learn how to make money fill its full role as a stimulant to labor . <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mankind . Plain people talk about it constantly . In cafs , on trains , in bazaars , on front porches , over backyard fences everywhere in the world , money-the money price of things , the money rate for jobs-is the most common element in normal conversation . Not love , not crime , but money . <P> Despite its homely familiarity , when money goes abroad it cloaks itself in mystery . The present generation has seen this mystery in its darkest phase . It has seen the franc bloat and the mark blow up . It has seen Montagu Norman claw his way up from devaluation to set the pound on gold at the sacred rate of $4.86 . It has seen Hjalmar Schacht counter with moneys designed to fit every purse and purpose . It has listened to the jargon of scores of theories . And it has rightly suspected that all this confusion had much to do with unemployment . <P> Yet international money was not always a tangle . Once it was almost as simple as coin in the pants pocket . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Out of this relatively happy experience and the unhappy turmoil of the ' 20s and ' 30s may come the knowledge that will make money simple and stimulating again .
