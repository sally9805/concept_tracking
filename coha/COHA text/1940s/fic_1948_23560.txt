Dirty Money . A Story by Hugh Rockwell Illustrations by Frank J. Russell T HEY all stood there looking down at the mess , and then Hanson said : " Well , Nick , how about it ? " " Nothing doing , " Nick said . " We been over all that before , Hanson . " " You do n't expect the machinists to do it , Nick , eh ? " " I do n't expect nothing , " Nick said . " 1 been working around this yard too long to expect anything . " Hanson turned up the palms of his thick hands , as if to say he had done all a man could reasonably be expected to do . Then he tilted his gray safety helmet to the back of his bald head and with the little finger of his right hand thoughtfully prodded around in his right ear . " Boys , " Mr. Blandy said . " You know this here 's a hot job , boys . You know we got thirty days for this job . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish this job in thirty days . " Mr. Blandy was the superintendent . He looked like the superintendent out of a movie and he spoke with the air of decisiveness that superintendents in the movies always use . He was a short soft man with pudgy well-kept hands and beautiful blue eyes that had a perpeptual whiskey glisten on them . He was dressed in explorer 's khaki and the sleeves ofhis shirt were rolled up so everyone could see the expensive watch with the sweep second hand on his left wrist . Now Mr. Blandy took off his black superintendent 's helmet , his shining black helmet with its pretty gold band . There was a thirty foot hole in the ship 's side where the torpedo had struck . The soft summer breeze came through this hole and ruffled the matted blond hairs which covered the hump of fat at the base of Mr. Blandy 's neck . " Mr. Blandy , " Hanson said . " Are you sayin ' my mechanics should clean up this mess ? " " Mechanics should n't be afraid of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I got to laugh , " Hanson said . " Honest to Christ , Mr. Blandy , I got to laugh . You 're quite a card at that , Mr. Blandy . " Mr. Blandy looked offended . " Really , Hanson , " he said . " Really , what 's so funny about that ? Are mechanics supposed to be afraid of a little oil and grease ? " " Right , " Hanson said . " But mechanics ai n't supposed to handle no arms and legs , Mr. Blandy . " " I never said they were . " " O.K. , " Hanson said , " I just wanted the record straight . I just wanted everything understood , Mr. Blandy . " T HE three of them fell silent and stood looking down into the bilge again . The torpedo had entered the ship 's side on the starboard quarter , just forward of the shaft alley . The thick steel plate around the hole was wrinkled and twisted like tin struck by a heavy hammer . The steam pipes , evaporators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what the men were talking about were a couple of arms and legs protruding from the mess . Mr. Blandy raised his bloodshot blue eyes from the bilge and regarded Nick , and Nick shifted uneasily . Nick was the chain-gang snapper . Nick 's gang was supposed to do any dirty and menial job , but Nick 's gang had refused to go down and dig out the arms and legs . " Nick , " Mr. Blandy said . " I think it 's your job . " " I got nothing to say , " Nick said . " Until the shop steward gets here , I got nothing to say , Mr. Blandy . " " I have sent for all the shop stewards concerned , Nick , " Mr. Blandy said . " I have also sent for Dirty Money Carlson . " Nobody said anything , and they stood there looking down at the arms and legs and shuffling their feet . At last Mr. Blandy pulled a package of cigarettes from the pocket of his explorer 's khaki shirt . He offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer the men cigarettes in the movies , and Nick and Hanson each took one . They flushed slightly because their two gangs of men were looking at them , but cigarettes were very scarce at this time . " Really , boys , " Mr. Blandy said , " Really , I think we 're being sort of foolish . After all , there 's a war on . We on the home front got a duty as well as those in the trenches . " Nick and Hanson puffed thoughtfully on their cigarettes and someone in the two gangs of men behind Mr. Blandy made a loud unpleasant noise with his lips . Mr. Blandy 's mouth trembled beneath his small mustache . He brought his left arm up in a snappy way as though he was about to salute and looked at his expensive watch with its sweep second hand . " Ei t-fifteen , " Mr. Blandy said , as though someone had asked him the time . " They ought to be here by now , boys . " Somewhere in the gang of men behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweetheart . He whistled it very slowly and softly and whenever he ended the refrain he would quaver it out and work around it a little and the two big Negroes in the chain-gang would say Yeah ! and giggle with cynical delight . Mr. Blandy felt that things were somehow ? slipping out of hand , but the brief labor-management course given him by the company had never touched on this particular situation , this arms and legs business . " Eight-fifteen , Nick , " Mr. Blandy said , as if Nick had asked him to repeat the time . " They ought to be here by now , Nick . " And somewhere behind Mr. Mandy a man was whistling Let Me Call You Sweetheart , still whistling , and the two big Negroes were still keeping time in a soft tattoo with their iron-toed shoes on the twisted floor-plates , and still Mr. Blandy was thinking of a dozen things he might or ought to do but nothing that he could . Mr. Blandy looked down again upon the bilge and the twisted pipes and grease and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of eyes on his back and he sneaked his feet away from the verge of the hole . He wanted to walk around to the other side of the hole and face the men , but he had n't the guts . It was an odd feeling , a panicky feeling , the feeling Mr. Blandy had . He knew , naturally , that nothing was going to happen to him  --  he was the Company 's representative . He was the Company 's representative , and he knew no one would dare push him down there into that grease and slime and jellied pieces of men ; but it was perhaps the feeling that they would like to that was getting into Mr. Blandy a little . " It 's a fine night , Nick , " Hanson said . " Nice out to Coney tonight , Nick . " " Yeah , " Nick said . " And you know , I come damn near going out there tonight too , Hanson . Just before supper the old woman says to me why do n't I stay out tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her no , I will make a ringer this week and next week I will take two days off . And now here I am down here and they want me to be an undertaker . And I had a hunch to stay out , Hanson . I had hunch not to come in . " " You got ta hunch , you ought not to come in , " Hanson told him . " The worst thing you can do is go against a hunch , Nick . " They were talking right across Mr. Blandy 's face as if he were n't there at all . Nick 's breath stank of garlic and Hanson 's of stale rye whiskey and Mr. Blandy 's stomach began to feel slightly queer . Mr. Blandy kept looking at the arms and legs because that was the only place he could look . None of the mens ' faces were friendly enough to look into , and if he looked straight ahead there was nothing but a maze of twisted machinery , which Mr. Blandy knew very little about . So he kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwing his soft face into a fierce frown of concentration ? " thinking things through " they called it in the labor-management course . And the man was still whistling Let Me Call You Sweetheart , and the two big Negroes were now leaning back with their eyes closed , keeping time to the whistler with soft repeated yeahs ! " Here they come , " Nick said . The engine-room steps had been carried away in the explosion and the staging men had rigged an emergency ladder . The two shop stewards and Dirty Money Carlson were now coming down the long swaying emergency ladder . " Now we can thrash things out , Nick , " Mr. Blandy said . " Oh , sure , " Nick said . " Now we can thrash things out , Mr. Blandy . " D IRTY CARLSON was first down the ladder . He was followed by Cigar Frankic , the machinist steward , and last was old Billy Wagner , steward for the chain-gangs . They were all slow-moving , fat , authoritative men , and they came over and joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood next to Nick and Hanson , and Dirty Carlson got as close as he could to Mr. Blandy . " Well , Mr. Blandy , " Wagner said . " What 's the trouble ? " Mr. Blandy had been rehearsing in his mind what to say . Now he barked it out the way the superintendents bark In the movies . " Here 's the situation , Bill , " Mr. Blandy said . " We got to have that thrust-bearing out tonight , Billy . To do it , the mechanists got to work in the bilge . They wo n't work until this mess is taken away . The machinists say they will not clean up this mess and I got to admit am inclined to agree with them , though this here 's a national emergency and nobody should stand strictly on his rights . What I really think is , I really thing this here 's Nick 's job , Billy . I asked Nick to do the job and he 's refused . So that 's the situation , Billy . And we ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard superintendent , Billy . " This was a long speech , a long speech even for Mr. Blandy who had been trained to make such speeches in his labor-management course . It was a long , nice-sounding speech , and the two big Negroes kept time to this speech with their softly repeated yeahs ! " What about it , Nick ? " Wagner said . " The men wo n't touch this ? " Nick said . Wagner looked down at the oil and bits of flesh and grease . " I would n't touch it myself , " he said . " Before we go any further , " Cigar Frankie said , " I got to say this : the machinists wo n't never touch it , under absolutely no conceivable circumstances . War or no war , a mechanic has got his dignity . Am I right , boys ? " The machinists approved , and the big Negroes ended this stanza with a soft yeah ! " Well , Billy ? " Mr. Mandy said . " It 's a tough proposition , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human situations that ai n't covered in the contract . Would n't your boys do it for dirty money , Nick ? " Dirty money is premium money paid for certified dirty work . - What about it . boys ? " Nick said . There were five men in Nick 's gang . There were the two big Negroes , a shriveled Italian , and two blowsy Irishmen . The two Negroes looked at each other , and then they looked with great interest at a point some distance above the white mens ' heads . The shriveled Italian shrugged his shoulders eloquently and smiled . " The way I look at it is this , " the bigger of the two Irishmen said . " While not meaning to speak for the other lads , I think a little dirty money would not be out of place . What do you think , Denny ? " " By God , the job 's worth a finl " Denny said . " There ca n't be more than half an hour 's work , " Mr. Blandy said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will after twenty , " Denny said . " I handled flesh before , Mr. Blandy . " " What do you think , Carlson ? " Mr. Blandy said . D IIM ' CARLSON 'S job was to investigate any work the men thought rated premium pay . If Carlson considered the conditions bad enough , he certified the work for a bonus . But it was hard to get a bonus from Carlson , because his own pay was a percentage of the money he saved the company . c ? : . This was a nice sort of job , and Dirty Carlson was a nice sort , too . He was a fat whiskey-sodden lick-spittle with a greasy bag of a suit and a dirty red , white , and blue tie that he always wore , winter and summer , fair weather and foul . He also always wore a gray felt hat . Carlson considered the tie and the felt hat the earmarks of an executive . Now he rolled his dirty-brown eyes fondly over Mr. Blandy 's face and tried to figure out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Carlson ? " Mr. Blandy said . " Well , Ralph , " Carlson said . " Well , Ralph , there ai n't really enough oil and grease down there to justify dirty money . " He said Ralph very loudly , so everyone would be certain to hear him call Mr. Blandy by his first name . An executive could wear a felt hat and a red , white , and blue tie , and call Mr. Blandy by his first name . " But the bodies make a small difference , I should say , " Mr. Blandy said . " You 're god-damned right they make a difference , " Nick said . " You want to know , I 'm ready to puke right now . " " Yeah , Nick , " Dirty Carlson said . " Sure . Nick . But it ai n't as if they was scarey . What I mean , it ai n't as if they was all in one piece . See what I mean ? " " What ? " Nick said . " Well , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Nick moved over to Carlson . He looked at Carlson closely . He examined Carlson as if ha had never seen him before . He even sniffed at Carlson , loudly , making a funny sound like a dog . The two big Negroes laughed softly . " Really , Nick --  " Mr. Blandy said . Nick moved away from Carlson . He closed his eyes , as if this scene were something precious , something to be remembered always . " Really , Nick --  " " Go get the baskets , Paddy , " Nick said . ? A Very Bad Act Indeed . I. ( 1 ) " Its enactment would set the stage for a conflict which would injure the relations between employees and employers for all time and seriously retard national recovery . " ( 2 ) Its enactment would produce such great industrial confusion as to seriously undermine the present world position of the United States . " ( 3 ) In place of a formula for industrial peace , its alleged purpose , it establishes a foundation for industrial warfare . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a whole would reverse the basic direction of our national labor policy , inject the government into private economic affairs on an unprecedented scale , and conflict with important principles of our democratic society . . . It would be a dangerous stride in the direction of a totally managed economy . . ? . " ( 5 ) " .. . It constitutes a complete departure from our constitutional and traditional theories of government . " ( 6 ) " ... An omen of a business fascism . . . . I am sounding a clear warning to every American who loves his country , who believes in his country , and who champions genuine free competitive enterprise , to be on guard . "
