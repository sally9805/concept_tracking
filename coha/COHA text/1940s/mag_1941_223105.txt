In Los Angeles , Edward Price Richards , 29 , who registered for the draft last fall and was classified as 4-F ( physically , mentally or morally unfit ) petitioned the Superior Court to change his name to Barbara Ann Richards . Reason : he has given up his job , begun to stick around the house , stopped shaving six weeks ago ( his beard had stopped growing ) and felt he just had to change to women 's clothes .
