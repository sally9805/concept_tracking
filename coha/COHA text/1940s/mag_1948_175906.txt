During nearly three years as Britain 's rulers , Britain 's Labor Party has given up great chunks of empire-India , Burma , Ceylon . At home it has nationalized transport , coal , electric power , aviation , overseas communication and the Bank of England . It has also raised taxes and cut rations , and its popularity has taken a definite , although possibly not decisive , slump . Last week the Labor Party met at Scarborough in its annual conference to take stock of its accomplishments and chart its further aims . From Scarborough TIME Senior Editor Max Ways reported : <P> The sense of power and glory that was Britain and might be Britain still is not in these men . They seem too humble even for middleclass , easygoing Scarborough , and much too modest for its Grand Hotel . Yet these modest men indubitably believe themselves the architects of a greater Britain , followers of a loftier vision than Pitt or Disraeli or Churchill had . <P> They are constructing a workers ' state , or more precisely , a trade union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. terms . Though the sun never sets over the lands to which their sway extends , the Labor Party looks inward . The fate of Burma disturbs it less than a housewife 's complaint , and the housewife will go unheard if a shop steward is discontented . <P> But beneath the double covering of trade union caution and British restraint , a fire smolders . Again &; again at Scarborough it flashed forth in spite of restrained notes struck by Emanuel Shinwell , the conference chairman , and Herbert Morrison , Labor 's Leader of the House of Commons . Morrison called for a period of " consolidation . " He indicated that party bosses were going slow on further nationalization of industry . <P> The delegates were not happy about all this . They did not deny their leader 's assurance that British workers are better off than they had been before . But they had a rankling feeling that , in the words of one delegate , " the standard of living of those who do not have to work has not dropped in the least . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Labor Party , but it is one of the strongest . How to leave the private enterprise sector of British economy its profit motive-and at the same time get more production from British workers-was the basic problem which the Labor Party faced but did not solve at Scarborough . <P> " Employers in Fear . " Day after day , Clement Attlee sat slouched on his spine , taking in five-minute speeches from scores of delegates , speeches for the most part well organized , lucid and obviously sincere . Behind him on the platform sat Mrs. Attlee , knitting . She likes short speeches , even when her husband makes them . Sir Stafford Cripps , whom some call an economic dictator , sat modestly behind a row of executive committee members-he is not a member of the executive-and was not invited to speak . Nor did he ask to take part .
