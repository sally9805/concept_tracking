Do not dread the " change of life . " There is nothing to fear . Modern medical science has swept away the cobwebs of superstition , opened wide the windows of the mind to the light of facts , and developed proven therapeutic methods for treating symptoms , should they become too troublesome . Alas , all too many women , not excluding the otherwise informed and intelligent , still are befogged by old wives ' tales , handed down through the ages . They attribute all sorts of ailments ? headaches , backaches , worries , depression , bad temper , and many other conditions ? to the menopause . They fear that the menopause means a profound change for the worse in their lives . They think it means old age ; they fear insanity ; they 're sure that sex life ends with the climacteric ; they think it causes cancer . Most of this is nonsense . Before we find out exactly what the menopause is and what can be done to handle it wisely , let 's dispose of these specters : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life are likely to cause wear and tear . You 've been raising your children , and it 's been a responsibility as well as a joy . Even without children , your marriage has had its inevitable problems . You may have had financial worries . You may have had some real physical disease . So you 're rather tired , and you do get those headaches or backaches , or you are fatigued or nervous . That 's what time does ; it has nothing to do with the menopause . At forty many women begin to excuse themselves for vague ailments and a general letdown of standards ? and yet may not cease to menstruate until they are fifty or older ! Other women nourish the gnawing fear that they 'll lose their minds . They can remember Aunt Ida , and Mother 's horror stories of Cousin Edith , who finally had to be committed to an institution . Now , there is no relation whatsoever between insanity and the menopause . It is true that in middle age certain types of insanity can develop ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an entirely separate condition . There is absolutely no cause and effect . True , women may suffer a slight depression , but that is transient . All too many women are sure that the menopause is the end of their sex lives ; that when their ovaries cease functioning , they lose not only all inclination toward a normal existence but also their attractiveness for their husbands . Well , this also is folklore . Such women have an erroneous idea of the relation of the libido to the ovarian function . The ovaries are not indispensable to sex emotion in human beings ; the psyche plays a far greater part . Indeed , many women have more highly developed sex impulses after the menopause than before . They are through with childbearing ; their concern with pregnancy is banished . Some women for the first time in their lives experience normal sex reactions only after the menopause . As for the terror some others suffer , thinking that cancer comes with the menopause , let us banish that at once . The menopause is a normal part of living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than in youth . But one does not cause the other . " Climacterium " is a more accurate term for the change of life than " menopause . " For " menopause " actually means the time when menstruation ceases . The climacterium is the whole period of change , just as puberty is not merely the time when menstruation in a girl begins , but is the era of physical development in . her life . During the climacterium there are retrogressive changes , such as the shrinking of the tissues of the breast and uterus . It is a transitional period involving the sex organs . Now , very definite symptoms develop during the climacterium . The doctors call them vasomotor symptoms , because they are manifested through the so-called vasomotor nerves , and they are caused by the withdrawal of hormones from the body .  | First and foremost are the hot flushes involving the head , neck , and upper part of the chest . Then there are , though less frequently , hot flushes that may affect the whole body . Some women suffer these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women may be disturbed by them ten or twenty times a day . Then there are sweats , which sometimes follow the flushes immediately and sometimes occur without hot flushes . Finally , there are flashes , tingling sensations all over the body . These are the real symptoms of the menopause . There are , it is true , some other symptoms . During the climacterium sonic women suffer from low spirits or can not sleep , and so on . If a woman is frightenecd by this inevitable experience , if she approaches it with apprehension , she may develop all sorts of symptoms as a result of her fears . But the true symptoms are the vasomotor ones . Therefore the good doctor treats these vasomotor symptoms . In approaching any other manifestations of the climacterium he will try to find out whether they have any other real cause , such as a genuine disease , or have a psychological origin . The treatment of the vasomotor symptoms is one of the great developments o ' modern medicine . Really only a very small proportion o : women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on1y reassurance and some Dutch-uncle talk Others , who have vasomotor symptoms t will be able to get along with just a little 1 sedative to relax any tension . But minority of women suffer acutely during 7 this period , and for them the treatment now available is heaven-sent.  | Nowadays the hormones lacking may be supplied to women who genuinely suffer . This makes it possible for women to make the change of life gently instead of abruptly and miserably . A few years ago there was a great deal of doubt as to whether gland treatment was any good at all . Many gynecologists thought that gland therapy was useful because it made the patient think she was feeling better , and that pills of bread and sugar probably would have the same effect . As a matter of fact , when gland treatment was first tried , the skeptics were right ? it was n't any good . The old ovarian or corpus luteum tablets were practically inert . TODAY , however , the real hormone of the ovary is available ? the estrogenic hormone , sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these hormones were given either hypodermically or by mouth . The injection by hypodermic was by far the more effective , though it was extremely expensive and a nuisance to the woman who had to be forever going to the doctor for her shots . Several years ago , however , British physiologists discovered a group of substances which are not vital principles , like hormones , but which are simple chemicals that nevertheless produce physiological effects identical with the estrogenic hormones . The best-known and most frequently used is called " stilbestrol . " Stilbestrol is used widely today by most good gynecologists . It is very cheap , costing only one or two cents a tablet . Compare this with the six or eight dollars a few hypodermic injections used to cost ! Also it is convenient ; it can be taken as a tablet , like an aspirin . Stilbestrol is not without its disadvantages . A certain proportion of the women who need it , perhaps 15 percent , can not take it . They react unfavorably ; it may cause nausea , vomiting , or dizziness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in too large doses , it may bring about a recurrence of bleeding . This also may happen when estrogen is used hypodermically , but it is n't so likely as after excessive use of stilbestrol . These disadvantages are slight , The discovery is a godsend , for stilbestrol brings profound relief to women who suffer so constantly by day from vasomotor symptoms that they are miserable and embarrassed , and so much by night that they can not get a good night 's sleep . The best doctors will tell you , however , that treatment with any of these substances should not be constant . They should be administered only when you have the flushes . Yet it is a curious thing ? some women become addicts ; they delude themselves into thinking , even for years after their menopause , that they can not get along without their pills or their shots ! Many scientists have been asking whether or not this hormone treatment predisposes women to cancer , for one of the most important studies in cancer is the relationship of the hormones , especially the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the laboratory in experimental animals by long series of doses of estrogen . Consequently , the doctors have wondered whether or not it also might be incited in women . The present evidence indicates that no therapeutic dose would produce malignancy in a woman . The doses that have  | caused it in laboratory animals are much higher than a physician would prescribe for his patients . However , most doctors believe that , to be on the safe side , estrogen should be used conservatively by women whose families have been afflicted with cancer , or who have any condition that possibly might be regarded as precancerous . Although , as we have Iearned , cancer is not a result of the menopause , ignorance of the actual progress of the climacteric has caused the death of many . For although the menopause means the cessation of menstruation , many women believe that it is characterized by excessive and irregular bleeding . This is not true . It is characterized by diminishing and irregular menstrual periods , with more and more time between the periods , until finally they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not necessarily a symptom of cancer . It may be a symptom of any number of disturbances . But it also may be caused by a malignant tumor , and the possibility must never be ruled out until it is proved untrue . You must go to the doctor at once when you notice any such manifestation ; speed will save your life . Thus , as you now know , the climacterium is not a time to be dreaded . If you keep busy , keep healthy and fit , keep ' your mind on your duties instead of brooding morbidly about the melancholy I aspects of your change of life , the chances are you will go through it scarcely noticing it . And if it does begin to bother I you , go to your doctor ; it need not bother you long . Do n't begin to look for it at forty . Roughly half the women in this world cease menstruating between forty-five and fifty ; only a quarter of them see an end of their reproductive lives before forty-five , and the other quarter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty . So do n't make a timetable . But remember : women have a plaguing heritage of old wives ' tales about this time of life . You must know them for what they are ? fairy tales . And go about the business of living with no further regard for them . There 's nothing to be afraid of .  |
