txt Methodists reached the high point of their great Quadrennial General Conference at Mechanics Building , Boston , today as the 758 delegates unanimously approved the Quadrennial Plan proposed by the Council of Bishops . The plan , called " For Christ and His Church , " aims at deeper understanding by Methodists of their faith , their church , their ministry , and their mission : and a resurgence of worldwide Methodist missionary and relief work . It was introduced to the Conference in terms . of the deepest seriousness by Bishop G. Bromley Oxnam as Secretary of the Council of Bishops . Need of Spirituality " Any man of intelligence today knows that world relief and reconstruction must be continued , " he told the Conference , " but he soon senses that the world has still another need , the need of spirituality . Men must know what they believe and to whom they are committed . " This plan now brought before you is based upon a fundamental principle that the supreme need of man today is religious faith . " Four objectives were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming quadrennium . During the first year the Methodist faith will be studied and the effort made to increase " world service giving " to levels commensurate with contemporary need . The second year will be devoted to study of the Methodist Church and an effort to reach the unchurched with the evangelical message of Methodism . The third year will be devoted to acquainting all Methodists with their individual ministry on " the Protesant principle of the universal priesthood of all believers , " and to recruiting more men for the formal ministry of the Methodist churches . Mission Program The fourth year , whose keynote will be " Our Mission , " will concern itself with the mission of Methodists to their home , their community , the nations , and the world . The program of action implementing this idea has yet to be worked out . The For Christ and His Church Movement will include the raising of a special , entirely voluntary fund , over and above the funds already pledged to World Service by the present Conference . No goal was set for this fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as all the organization , promotion , and administration of the For Christ and His Church Movement , was placed in the hands of the Quadrennial Advance Committee . This committee includes 10 bishops representing all jurisdiction 's , 12 ministers ? also representative of all the jurisdictions , 12'laymen from the church at large , three of whom must be women . ' Individual Responsibility One of the important features of the Movement , as pointed out by Bishop Costen J. Harrell of Alabama , who spoke in its support , is that it reaches down into the local church and makes each church and each church member responsible for a share in the program . Dr. Ralph E. Diffendorfer . Ex , ecutive Secretary of the Division of Foreign Missions , stressed ' the importance of the missionary phases of the program . " I call to your attention , " he said , " that in 1915 the three branches of Methodism now united in this great church had about 1,300 missionaries in the field . In 1941 , before the war checked our missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1947 there were 716 ? scarcely half as many as in 1915 . " There are no short cuts to the millennium , " he declared . " There are vast areas of the world today where the fundamental principles of Christianity are by no Means taken for granted  --  they are set aside as worthless indeed . Materialistic Challenge " The forces of secularism , nihilism , and.materialism are contesting for supremacy . Communism is an adversary . The only way to meet that kind of situation is. in John Wesley 's great phrase , to ' go on to perfection ' in our own practice of our faith . " Demanding that the Methodist Church send 200 new missionaries into the field as soon as possible to combat Communism , Dr. Diffendorfer said , " They must be trained men and women , " And by ' trained , ' I mean I want them trained in Communism so thoroughly that they can talk the language of the Communist if need be:and answer his claims . " I am not afraid in the least about how much our missionaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the less appeal it will make to them , " he declared . and the delegates applauded him . He said the genius of the plan was that it was for something , not just a plan for opposing evil . " We believe in our creed ; we believe in our church ; and we are going right after it this next quadrennium to see that our belief and our faith is implemented . " At the close of Dr. Diffendorfer 's remarks , Bishop A. Frank Smith of Texas , who presided at today 's session , called for a vote on the report and suggested it be recorded by standing . It was unanimous , and the delegates then stood with bowed heads while the Rev , Marshall T. Steel of Dallas offered a prayer for divine aid in establishment of the effort upon which the church had just entered . A guest at today 's meeting was the Rt . Rev. Norman B. Nash , Protestant Episcopal Bishop of Massachusetts , who said : " The tragedy of our Protestantism is that Methodism ever broke away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reunion . " To this , Bishop Smith replied : " We gladly acknowledge our relationship as children to your church . And as children grown up we will gladly provide you a home if you will only come .
