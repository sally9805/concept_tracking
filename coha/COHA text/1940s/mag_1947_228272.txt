From Boca Grande to Naples , a terrible smell hung over Florida 's west coast . On the sandy beaches , or tangled in mangrove swamps , lay millions of big &; little dead fish , eels , crabs , scallops . Natives and visitors ( including Coalmaster John L. Lewis ) held their offended noses . So many tourists began hurrying home that the nervous Lee County Chamber of Commerce wired Washington ( the U.S. Fish &; Wildlife Service ) for help and advice . Last week Army airplanes were spraying the masses of decomposing fish with DDT to prevent a threatened fly plague . <P> The trouble started early last month . Cartoonist J. N. ( " Ding " ) Darling ( an ex-Government Wildlife man ) found the beach near his Captiva home strewn with dead fish . More were floating offshore , belly-up , and the water was heavily laced with sickly yellow-green streaks . <P> All up &; down the coast it was the same story . A fishing boat with a well built into its hull to keep its catch alive steered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow-green water got into the well , the captive fish swam to the surface , gulping air . Then they were as dead as their uncaught fellows outside . <P> Rumors flew fast and wild . Was it a subterranean eruption fouling the Gulf with sulphurous poisons ? Darling examined samples of the water under a low-powered microscope . He reported that the water seemed full of " waltzing mice " : thousands of fast-moving organisms which " seem to accomplish their swimming by a whirling motion . " He made sketches and sent them to Washington . <P> The tentative diagnosis , from Fish &; Wildlife 's Dr. Paul S. Galtsoff : Florida 's affliction , though rare and annoying , was nothing new . In various parts of the world , sea water is occasionally poisoned by " very rapid reproduction of unicellular organisms of the group of Dinoflagellates . " California , Florida was happy to learn , has had the same trouble . Japan 's pearl oysters have also suffered from the destructive Dinoflagellates . <P> No one could describe exactly how the swarming organisms kill sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suffocate fish by blocking their gills . But there is no quick remedy . This week dead fish , but fewer of them , were still coming ashore . The only thing Florida chambers of commerce could do was hope that the next cold snap would clear the sea of yellow-green streaks .
