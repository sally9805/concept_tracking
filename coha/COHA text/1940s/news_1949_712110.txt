txt A confessed former holder of a Communist card testified today that he was " recruited " into the party by Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz while both were working in an atomic laboratory at the University of California , Berkeley , about six years ago . The witness , Robert R. Davis of New York , appeared before the House Committee on Un-American Activities . He made his accusation with bowed head and in so low a tone that he could hardly be heard , while Mr. Lomanitz stood tense and silent in front of him . Before a Senate Judiciary subcommittee . a short time earlier , a hearing on a Communist-control bill brought an exchange so bitter that the chairman , Senator James 0 . Eastland , Democrat , of Mississippi , cursed a witness , C. B. Baldwin , with the epithet commonly shortened to the initials , " S. 0 . B. " Senator Eastland used the full term , preceded by an oath and followed by the word " liar . " He did so in angry reply to an attack on his political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry A. Wallace in his unsuccessful campaign last year for President on a ticket that had Communist support . Red Question Called " Routine " When Mr. Baldwin appeared before the subcommittee to testify against the bill , he was asked what a member of the committee 's professional staff , Robert B. Young , later called a " routine question " put to all previous witnesses , as to whether he was or had been a Communist . Mr. Baldwin refused to answer and asserted that in fifteen years of attending Congressional hearings he had never been " so insulted . " However , he would " gladly take an oath of allegiance to the United States , " he added . Senator Eastland arose to aignal that the session was over , waved Mr. Baldwin from the stand and said that his statement about the bill in the circumstances would not be accepted . Mr. Baldwin shouted accusations that the Senator had always fought against the " rights of the Negroes " and asserted that Mr. Eastland did not really " represent " the State of Mississippi , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " plantation owners . " It was then that Senator Eastland cursed Mr. Baldwin and walked from the room . He previously had said that " we held this hearing only to accommodate you . " Mr. Young , in a statement later , said that the subcommittee had unanimously agreed at the outset that the question concerning Communist party membership would be put to all witnesses because it was " extremely relevant " to a // FORMER ATOM AIDE SAYS HE WAS A RED // measure proposing sanctions against Communists . Recalling that the hearings had begun on April 29 , Mr. Young asserted that Luke Wilson , a Washington representative of Mr. Wallace 's Progressive party , " on more than two occasions , " had received the opportunity to testify " but for reasons of his convenience no witnesses appeared . " Mr. Wilson had been present at many .. essions , Mr. Young added , and it was " inconceivable that he was unaware " that every witness was expected to answer as to Communist affiliation . Baldwin Denies He Is Red Mr. Baldwin issued a statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " not now and never has been a Communist , " but challenging the right of the subcommittee to question him on such a point . He accused Senator Eastland of using a procedure that was " borrowed lock , stock and barrel from the political arsenal of Hitler and Mussolini . " As to the House hearing the scene there was one of a confrontation between Mr. Davis , the accuser , and Mr. Lomanitz , the accused . A third witness was David Joseph Bohm , an assistant professor of physics at Princeton University . Mr. Lomanitz is now an associate professor of physics at Fisk University , Nashville , Tenn . The present employment of Mr. Davis was not brought out by the committee . Mr. Lomanitz , who testified first , refused , on the ground that it " might possibly tend " to incriminate him , to answer when asked whether he had " recruited " Mr. Davis for the Communist party . He refused also , for the same reason , to say whether he was or had been a Communist . Dr. Bohm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Communist , pleading possible self-incrimination . Like Mr. Lomanitz , however , he declared that he had always been loyal to this country and had no knowledge of any action against the interest of the United States . In the period under examination , all three young scientists worked in a radiation laboratory , a part of the atomic project , which was then under Army control , at the University of California in late 1942 and early 1943 . The exact nature of their work was not made known . Earlier Testimony Read When Mr. Davis accused Mr. Lomanitz , much of his testimony consisted of mute assents to a reading by a committee staff member of evidence he had given in a closed committee session in New York in April . After Mr. Davis had identified Mr. Lomanitz as the man who had taken him to his first Communist meeting , in late 1942 or early 1943 , Mr. Lomanitz was asked to stand up . He did so at the back of the committee room . Mr. Davis peered without making a definite identification . Mr. Lomanitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " It appears to be the same person , " Mr. Davis testified . " Well , " he was asked , " have you ever known any other Giovanni Rossi Lomanitz ? " " No , " Mr. Davis said . He testified that he had remained in atomic work until November , 1948 . He was then discharged " for questionable associations " by the Atomic Energy Commission , which meanwhile had taken over control from the Army . Dr. Bohm spoke , without amplification , of having left his atomic work in the fall of 1946 , when the Army was still in control . Mr. Lomanitz told also of having quit the radiation laboratory in 1946 . Mr. Davis testified that along with his wife , who had been " recruited " by him , he joined the Communist party out of " curiosity . " He asserted that he and Mrs. Davis had never given the party " real " support , and had soon torn up their cards . It was shown that , testifying in the New York session he referred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " girls with thick glasses and empty faces . " Representative Francis E. Walter , Democrat , of Pennsylvania , said that the committee was preparing to recommend a bill against what he called an " amazing laxity lin handling vital secret information .
