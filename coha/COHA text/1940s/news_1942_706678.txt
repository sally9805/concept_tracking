txt The ship . yard foreman pulled a scrap of paper from his pocket and waved it toward a mighty hulk of steel encased in a cradle of wood scaffolding beside the river Willamette . " Keel was laid Aug. 1 . " he said in a terse scream above the blare of riveting . " It 'll be In the water Aug. 25 . Tic enty.seven days . " The foreman 's brief , laconic final phrase should go down in America 's glossary of triumphant cries of victory .. for never before in any country . in time of war or time of peace , has a 941 foot merchant ship been ltdd and launched in 27 days . Just an Empty ! lull Now . Today , eight days before this proud steel ship will he launched and three and a half months ahead of contract , It is an empty hull . Men are clamber . ing over the scaffolding , welding and riveting its steel plates . Giant 43 ton cranes lumber overhead . Its false bottom is not in . Its decks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a hull of steel in a way . Ten minutes away , as ordinary men might stroll it , the decks , the bottoms , the 275 tremendous pieces into which 15,000 smaller pieces are reduced by welding , are being prefabricated . On the land , at the stern of the ghostly hull , the mighty . engine is being assembled . Soon the cranes will begin to move up and down their wide tracks , carrying one by one these finished pieces to the hull . And suddenly the Pierre S. du Pont , No. 567 in America 's fleet of new Liberty ships , will be ready to take on the challengers of the sea . Denver 59th Ship Today . A miracle ? To ordinary men , yes , but this is the shipyard of the Ore . gon Shipbuilding corporation , one of the three shipyards that the famous lienry T. Kaiser operates in this area . This is the company which had never built a ship until 1941 . This is the company which built and delivered its fist ship in 253 days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its 59th ship tomorrow , 50 days from keel laying to sea going and four months ahead of contract . This Is the company and this is the shipyard which will be used to make 70 ton cargo planes if the plans of Mr. Kaiser . its guiding genius , come true . The workmen here say there Is no reason why Kaiser 's new vision can not he realized . A little over a year ego these yards were a morass of valley swamps . A basin for ships dredged out of the swamps , docks mint . mighty ways erected , and now t he long gray ships are going down to the sea at the rate of 14 a month , sleek , armored , capacious , shining with brass and confidence . Men and women work side by side in the roaring shipyard tumult which actually Is as ordered as a row of ants streaming into an anthill . Until you are five feet away you can not distinguish one from the other , for men and women alike are clad in the sexless protective clothing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gauntlets and great circular black hat of fireproof fiber , SOO Women Welders . This was the first shipyard to employ women on construction . The first woman came in May . Now it has 300 as welders , 51 as laborers and 26 as electricians ' helpers as well as 500 In office work . Under a master agreement for the Pacific coast , men and women get equal pay , $1.20 an hour as journeyman welder or 86 cents an hour as a helper . If it seems incongruous to see women wielding acetylene torches to cut steel in the lathe shop , which is an open hall half a mile long with orange metal framework stretching high overhead , or welding mighty plates of steel in the great assembly building where everything f r om tanks to deck houses are prefabricated , listen to what a male foreman says : " They are good . They are interested . They work hard and do n't ask any favors . They go right ahead . They just take it . After one has been here two weeks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man . " Come In All Sizes . Under the master union agreement , no physical examination can be required for women welders , all working under a special permit from the boilermakers ' union . Consequently , they come in all sizes , from less than 100 pounds to 185 , but ages of from 25 to 45 are preferred . With many thousands more workers needed at the three yards , necessity will cause the employment of hundreds of additional women . The company hopes to employ as many wives of workers as possible , as the housing shortage here seems an insuperable problem . All are trained by the company . They attend vocational schools , and after from two to six weeks a $23 a week telephone operator can be a $62 a week welder . Just where the thousands of new workers are coming from , no one seems to know . No one expects them to come trained . They will be trained here . Albert Bauer , assistant general manager of the three yards , hopes to touch the large pool of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women will be important . Evolution of Labor . " We feel there are millions of men doing work women can do just as well , " he said . " The evolution of labor demands that women replace and relieve them . " No story of the shipyards here , indubitably one of the most magnificent stories of achievement in America today , is complete without a summary of how , they do it . Bauer summed it up in four phrases : use of h ea v y equipment , prefabrication , transition from riveting to welding and , as important as any , the spirit of the yard . When the supports for the finished Liberty ship are kicked away and it slides down greased skids , armored for war add outfitted like a luxury hotel , to meet the waters it is to ' sail , that spirit is rewarded . A workman 's wife christens the ship her husband helped build .
