SALEM AND THE INDIES ( 468 pp. ) - James Duncan Phillips-Houqhton Mifflin ( $6 ) . <P> No one has done for other fields what Van Wyck Brooks did for New England letters . No one has written a comparable flowering of American industry , or of American military or naval life . It may be that such works will never be written , that the American achievement in other spheres has been too diversified and chaotic , its conflicts too bitter , its heroes too narrow . <P> But there was one period-between the Revolution and the War of 1812-and one place , the ports of New England , when the scene was small enough to be grasped and the time span not too great to be covered , when a kind of flowering of commerce took place , as wonderful in its own way as the literary harvest that followed it . Samuel Eliot Morison 's The Maritime History of Massachusetts , touches on this period ; Salem and the Indies covers it in detail . <P> James Duncan Phillips ' book has none of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work ; it is exact , down to earth , sometimes crabbed and partisan . Mr. Phillips is a retired businessman , for 25 years treasurer of Houghton Mifflin , and a local historian , the author of Salem in the Seventeenth Century and Salem in the Eighteenth Century , His prose is as clear and dry as a salary check . He has written what is probably the best history that there is , factual and authoritative , of an American port . <P> Phillips is perhaps the last advocate of that vanished conservative party , the Federalists . He believes that present-day attempts " to make Jefferson 's reputation great by inflation may burst the bubble , " and speaks of the explosive honesty of John Adams , the " underhanded tact and hypocrisy " of Jefferson , the " subtle and persistent venom " of John Quincy Adams . Such blunt historical editorializing has scarcely been seen in the U.S. since the days he writes about . But his partisanship for the Federalists is no greater than that of Morison and Brooks and Arthur Schlesinger for Thomas Jefferson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account of the prosperity , the civilization and happiness of life in Salem in the years of its prosperity seems not quite credible . The modern reader instinctively feels that there must have been some catch in it somewhere . Yet the truth is that historians have not glamorized Salem 's past . <P> Mr. Phillips , for example , barely mentions the cruise of Nathaniel Silsbee in the Benjamin . Silsbee was her captain at 19 , with a crew of boys . The cargo cost $18,000 . They sold it at the Isle of France ( Mauritius ) , converted the profit to gold , and made about $54,000 in six months , because of the inflation of the currency during an embargo . They sent perhaps $25,000 to Salem ( to pay for their ship and cargo ) , bought $30,000 worth of wine at the Cape of Good Hope , sold it at the Isle of France for about $90,000 , and returned to Salem with still another cargo-a return of perhaps $125,000 in all .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
