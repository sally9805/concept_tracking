Having been snubbed from Yalta , General Charles de Gaulle was in a mood to do some snubbing of his own last week . He declined Franklin Roosevelt 's invitation to a tte -- tte in the Mediterranean . Then , with haughty suspicion , he proclaimed the French Empire 's aloofness from any trilateral designs planned in the Crimea . <P> At a special Cabinet session the General and his Ministers decided to build " a large land , air and naval base " on Africa 's Atlantic bulge , at Dakar , which Franklin Roosevelt more than once implied was a U.S. strategic outpost . A few days later the General dropped in at the Institut Gographique , where French Indo-Chinese were celebrating their New Year . <P> Stiffly Charles de Gaulle accepted an armful of flowers from a creamy Annamese girl . Stiffly he spoke : " Chre Indochine . . . noble , loyal and intelligent Annamese people . . . . France wants to make the political , economic , social and cultural development of the Indo-Chinese union one of the principal aims of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect , the General told the Big Three that the Big Fourth reserved all rights in the Far Eastern colony seized by the Japs before Pearl Harbor . Indo-China-bigger than France , with a population of 23,000,000 , rich in rice , rubber , tin and zinc-is the French Empire 's most precious colony . <P> In Paris , en route to Yalta , Harry Hopkins had talked to Foreign Minister Georges Bidault about " internationalized bases . " He had received a bland reply : " French bases are at Allied disposal now . For the future what we do with our bases is between us and our colonies . If bases are internationalized , it must be reciprocal , which would also include such places as Pearl Harbor . . . . "
