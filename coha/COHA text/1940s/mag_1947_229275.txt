Malaria 's cause is known : a tiny animalcule injected by a mosquito 's sting . But no one knows what makes the disease so hard to cure permanently . Parasitologists think it is because the malaria bug knows how to hide : even when the bloodstream has been cleared by an antimalarial drug , the organism may remain in body tissues , lying low for new attacks . If scientists could grow the parasite in a test tube and find out exactly what makes it tick , they would be well along toward wiping out malaria . <P> Last week a team of Harvard Medical School researchers reported that they were getting warm . In a paper so important that it got a prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Science , they announced that they had bred in a test tube two types of animalcules . One causes malaria in monkeys and the other ( Plasmodium vivax ) in man . <P> Harvard 's Quentin M. Geiman and Ralph W. McKee said that they now know , pretty well , what foods the monkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glycerol sodium acetate , certain other vitamins and amino acids . They have also been able to test the effect of antimalarial drugs . <P> The Harvard men hopefully suggested that their discovery might pay dividends against other diseases ; the same technique , they said , could be used to cage , breed and study the deadly trypanosomes that cause African sleeping sickness .
