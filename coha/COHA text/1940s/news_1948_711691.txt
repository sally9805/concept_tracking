txt BIG FOUR REPLIES ON BERLIN LESSEN CHANCE OF ACCORD Note to Bramuglia Reveals Soviet Refusal to Make Conciliatory Gesture UNITY DEMANDED BY WEST Security Council President Consults 5 Other ' Neutrals ' to Seek New Solution Texts of Russian and Western replies on Berlin are on Page 4. 333 , CA/ILEIOLJE DE . CIASTEEAL Special to Trom Now Vora Tx-Arms . PARIS , Nov. ** of the Berlin dispute appeared to be farther off than ever today . The publication of the Big Four replies to Dr. Juan Atilio Bramuglia 's questions about the problem showed that the Soviet Union had refused to make a conciliatory gesture and the Western powers had made it clear that they considered the unity of the Berlin city administration as the basic prerequisite for an agreement . The Argentine Foreign Minister who is president of the Security Council during November , is attempting to find a basis for the solution of the Berlin currency problem . Dr. Bramuglia held another meeting tonight with representatives of the ? other member nations on the Security Council not directly connected with the Berlin dispute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circulated among the various delegations that Dr. Bramuglia was planning to draft a new resolution on the Berlin case . Dr. Bramuglia submitted five questions to the Big Four to ascertain their views on the establishment of a four-power body to control the introduction of the Soviet zone mark into all of Berlin . The Soviet reply said that an agreement on the four-power control plan would mean the simultaneous lifting of the Berlin blockade and a return to four-power collaboration in the administration of Berlin . ' In its note , the Soviet Union told Dr. Bramuglia he would find the answer to his questions in the Aug. 30 Moscow directive . Ang . 30 Directive Quoted That directive outlined the manner in which the Soviet zone currency should be accepted for all of Berlin but called upon the four military governors in Berlin to work out its implementation . To make the meaning clearer , the Soviet answers gave almost word for word the text of that directive . Thus in effect Moscow implied that if the Western Powers wanted to have the blockade lifted they should resume direct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is what the Soviet Union has been seeking since the direct negotiations broke down Sept. 26 and the Western Powers decided to submit the question to the Security Council In their joint reply , the Western powers said t ... z.t " it will inevitably be difficult in practice to exercise four-power control of currency ins city in which the previous unified administration under fourpower supervision is not fully functioning at present and is indeed being rapidly diminished . " West Seeks Economic Guards To make control effective , the Western reply continued , " certain technical arrangements and agreements are necessary to provide the specific assurances and safeguards required to protect the interests of the Western powers and the Soviet Union . " The Western answer did not give a detailed explanation of what would be considered satisfactory guarantees . However , a French spokesman left no doubt as to what the Western powers had in mind . He gave a detailed description of the measures enacted by the Soviet authorities to split Berlin and then declared that the Soviet military commander had refused to allow the holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persist in their , present attitude , the French official said , it is obvious that after Dec. 5 , when elections will be held in the Western sectors , those areas will have an administration entirely different from the Soviet sector . The cleavage will then be deeper and two city atiministratons will be inevitable , he added . After a premise that dealt with these political aspects of the Berlin question , the Western reply // outlined a plan for four-power control of the Berlin currency . Its basic principle was that the fourpower financial commission should " exercise supervision and control over the activities of the German Bank of Emission of the Soviet Zone , but only insofar as they relate to arrangements for the introduction and continued use of the East mark as the sole currency in the City of Berlin . " This , the reply said , would be necessary to determine " the ' amount of currency and credit available for all of Berlin from the German Bank of Emission " and to afford protection against the " non-discriminatory provision of currency throughout the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested that some means of control on the issuance of currency should be established to curb the German Bank of Emission controlled by Soviet authorities in Berlin . The Soviet Union said in a White Paper published in October that " no one can be responsible for emission of the German mark in the Soviet sector " and there was no necessity of referring the problem to the military governors . In contrast with what was de ' scribed by United Nations circles as the Soviet " curt and dry note " the Western powers assured Dr. Bramuglia that they were " anxious to provide all possible assistance in your examination of the Berlin ' currency problem . " They said they were " continuing their study of possible solutions . " The general feeling of delegates who studied the four powers ' replies was that Dr. Braniuglia 's efforts had suffered a serious setback and that unless the Soviet Union instructed its military governor in Berlin to rescind all measures he had enacted to divide the city there was no basis for a solution . They entertained serious doubts that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden and entire reversal of . the Soviet policy in Berlin .
