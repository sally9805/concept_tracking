To most laymen , and many a concertgoer , the name Bach refers to Johann Sebastian Bach , who left behind him a musical reputation second only to that of Ludwig van Beethoven . But Johann Sebastian was only one of many talented Bachs who furnished Germany with music for seven generations . Himself the culmination of a long line of Bachs , the great Johann Sebastian begot 20 children , three of whom became composers of world renown : Wilhelm Friedemann Bach , Johann Christian Bach and Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach . <P> Most gifted of this trio was Carl Philipp Emanuel ( 1714-88 ) , whose fame long outshone his father 's . For 27 years C. P. E. had the politically impressive but musically dubious honor of accompanying Frederick the Great while he bore down on the flute . Frederick played a repertory of some 300 concertos in relentless rotation , nearly wore his accompanist out . When the Seven Years ' War began , C. P. E. got temporary relief . <P> But during his spare time , C. P. E. managed to turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale , revolutionary in manner , rich in quality . They set musical styles for a hundred years after his death . Among the most popular were 52 concertos for harpsichord and strings , some of which are still played in concerts today . Nine of them have been published , many have disappeared . <P> Mr. Koldofsky 's Mystery . C. P. E. 's long-lost concertos have had a way of turning up in unexpected places . Recently Toronto musical circles have been celebrating the discovery of a rich cache of 14 C. P. E. concertos . To do them justice , the Canadian Broadcasting Corp . brought world-famed Harpsichordist Wanda Landowska to Toronto and set her to work playing the concertos , one by one , in a series of Sunday evening broadcasts . <P> How C. P. E. 's concertos got to Toronto , nobody knows . Nine years ago a Toronto violinist and collector named Adolph Koldofsky was approached in a Toronto music store by a little Englishman named Barnes who was trying to sell a batch of old musical manuscripts . Barnes , a paper hanger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he had found his manuscripts about 20 years before in a little bookstore at Richmond and York Streets . The shop had since been torn down . Its owner , one Rosenthal , had died . <P> The frayed and yellow manuscripts were written in a beautiful 18th-Century hand , and each bore the name of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach . Koldofsky bought the manuscripts and started a six-year search through musical libraries . He found that the manuscripts were not in C. P. E. 's own handwriting . Seven turned out to be copies of concertos by C. P. E. already listed or known to exist in European collections . The other seven , so far as Koldofsky has been able to discover , are new to the musical world . Since all the scripts are in the same handwriting , and all bear C. P. E. 's name , there is no good reason to suppose that all are not authentic C. P. E. They sound like it when Wanda Landowska plays them .               @ @ @ @ @ @
