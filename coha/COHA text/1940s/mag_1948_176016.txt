For a small foreign-language paper , Manhattan 's Amerikai-Magyar Npszava , a Hungarian daily , was getting a lot of attention in international short-wave circles last week . A new editorial team had just taken over . And while a well-wishing message from President Truman was beamed to Central Europe by the Voice of America , the Moscow radio lambasted the new management as a bunch of rascals . <P> What annoyed the Russians was 1 ) the way the Nepszava ( People 's Voice ) smuggled papers into Budapest , and 2 ) Npszava 's staff , a Who 's Who of the Hungarians Moscow hates most . Editor in chief was Zoltan Pfeiffer , head of the Independence Party in the coalition government that was squeezed out by the Reds a year ago . Ferenc Nagy ( rhymes with dodge ) , ex-Premier and leader of the Smallholders Party , now a small holder ( 130 acres ) in Virginia , was a contributing editor . Others : Exile Tibor Eckhardt , onetime head of the U.S. " Free Hungarian " movement ; Charles Peyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Bela Varga , once Speaker of Hungary 's Parliament . <P> Their sponsor was a blue-eyed New Jersey manufacturer named Victor Bator , who had been chased out of Hungary in 1940 by the Nazis , and had built up a prosperous electrical insulating business . Along with Louis Szanto , Virginia tobacco grower , and John F. Montgomery , prewar U.S. minister to Hungary , Bator put up about $100,000 to buy Npszava ( circ. 23,000 ) from its Polish-American owners . The new owners will fight Communism at home &; abroad , plug ECA and try to keep alive the idea of a free Danubian federation . They hope to double circulation among Hungarians in the U.S. and , by smuggling copies into Hungary , become a potent voice in the underground .
