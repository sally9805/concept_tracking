or Cape Cod or one of those places . After a couple of weeks I moved out of the Hollywood Plaza into a big , pink , reasonably priced apartment house called the Villa Espana . I spent desperate and lonely hours in my office at the studio mulling over the story they had finally given me to read , an action melodramaabout smugglers , come-on girls and the coast of Florida . I knew that Sammy Glick would have thrown it back in their faces and demanded something more in keeping with his artistic temperament , but I supposed the producers knew their business and , as it turned out , this story did have the makings of a fair C picture . But it was dismal , ditch-digging work , and I felt more alone than ever because the producer did n't even seem to care how I was doing . The only word I had for weeks and weeks was the producer'srequest , via interoffice communication , to keep turning in pages . At night I usually had supper at the Vine Street Derby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I 'd stroll down Hollywood Boulevard , stopping in at one of the joints for a drink , or browsing around in Stanley Rose 's bookstore listening to the conversation , or maybe dropping in at a movie . After a while I felt as if I were wandering around a small town , because there never seemed to be anything to do and I began to notice the same faces drifting by night after night . The only friend I made in those early days was an unknown playwright who had the office two doors down from mine . He told me he had come out to Hollywood about a year ago because the doctor had told him his four-year-old daughter 's sinus trouble was going to get serious if he did n't get her out to a warm , dry climate . When I met him he was just beginning to get jittery because his option was coming up in a couple of weeks and he did n't seem to think he could get a job anywhere else if they let him out . He said the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Anybody who goes a year in Hollywood without getting a single screen credit , he said , might just as well shop around for another profession . I asked him how it happened that none of his pictures hadP51reached the screen , and he explained that the first script he wrote had been shelved because at the last minute they could n't get the actor it had been written for , and the second one never reached first base because it was a topical subject and one of the other studios beat them to it , and the third one was stymied because it could n't get by the Hays Office . I did n't see why that should hurt him if the producers had liked his scripts , but he took a more pessimistic view of it . He said by the time a year had gone by , all they would probably remember is that he had worked twelve months without getting anything on the screen and that would he the pay-off . I tried to cheer him up , even took him and his young wife out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office the following Monday morning he was gone . He left a note for me saying the worst had happened , and that I had taken some of the curse off those last few weeks and that he was driving back to New York to see if he could n't get an advance on a new play he had started . A couple of years later I saw one of his plays that the Federal Theater was doing in Los Angeles , but I 've never seen him again . It 's queer to think how many little guys there are like that , with more ability than push , sucked in by one wave and hurled out by the next , for every Sammy Glick who slips through and over the waves like a porpoise . After he left , I tried to think if there was anyone else in town I knew , and I suddenly remembered Henry Powell Turner , the poet , who had been a senior when I was a freshman at Wesleyan . I remembered how excited we all were at school when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England which he had read to the Literary Society while he was still in college had been awarded the Pulitzer Prize . I had met Henry again on his way out to Hollywood several years ago and he had told me , by way of making conversation , to be sure and look him up if I was ever out that way . The operator told me that Mr. Turner had a confidential number , so I finally wired him at his studio and asked him to call me . I did n't hear from him until several weeks later when I picked up the phone to hear a cultured woman 's voice say , " This is Mr. Henry Powell Turner 's secretary . Mr. and Mrs. Turner would like to have the pleasure of your company at dinner at seven-thirty this Wednesday evening . " What I remember most about the Turner manse was that it was a five-dollar taxi ride from the Villa Espana , that you could see the Pacific Ocean from its front lawn , and that it was the largest example of the worst kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had always thought of Henry Powell Turner as my ideal of what a great poet should look like . I could remember him as a student , built along heroic proportions , six feet three and over two hundred pounds , with blond curly hair and the kind of chiseled , classical good looks that always remind me of the way epic Greek poets looked  --  or ought to have looked . And even when I had seen Turner last , four or five years ago , he was still a romantic figure to me , erect and hearty as ever , with his wild yellow hair turning a more dignified gray at the temples . When I saw him again this time , in that huge , cold living room , with the expensive furniture and the high ceiling , there were only a few strands left of the old youthful yellow among the thinning , straightening gray , but he was hardly more dignified because he was already well on his way toward the state of drooling intoxicationwhich I later discovered he managed to achieve with monotonousregularity each evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , prematurely gray , with a boyish figure in low-cut red velvet . They asked me the usual polite questions during cocktails , and conversation died once or twice at dinner , though Turner and I did our best to squeeze the most out of our common interest in Wesleyan . That 's about all I remember about that dinner , except that it was served with an irritating pomp , and that Turner shattered whatever illusions I had left about him by telling one of those long dirty stories for which the only justification would be the tag line at the climax , which they never seem to reach . At the finish he laughed so loudp53that he finally broke into a coughing fit which he managed to soothe with loud gulps of sparkling burgundy . When we rose from the table , his wife , ghostlike all through dinner , finally disappeared , and I found myself cooped up with him and several bottles of Bellows Scotch in his imposing study . I spent the next three or four uncomfortable hours in trying to follow him through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recited some of his lyrical poetry . In the second , he mocked his own poems with dirty limericks composed extemporaneously , " which , " he laughingly informed me three or four times , " I have seen fit to create in line of my duties as Hollywood 's Poet Laureate . " In the next he reviewed his chief conquests of the current season with a glint that brought me back to the lurid tales we used to swap in our adolescence . And of course he reached the final stage full of teary nostalgia for the glories of his youth and eloquentresolutions to return to New England and his Muse , " as soon as I finish the MacDonald-Eddy script I have to do when I get back from my vacation . " I finally managed to escape around one in the morning , after we had topped off the evening by killing the second bottle of Scotch and singing a Wesleyan song . I must have been more upset than I realized when I left there , because by the time I reached my room and started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after was still with me . Only now what I had taken merely for boredom or disgust came into sharper focus as I began to be stunned by the horror and sense of mental nausea most of us feel when we 're forced into ringside seats for great personal tragedies . So I buttoned my shirt again , put my tie back on and called a cab . For 1 had decided that the only way to forget the wreck of my epic poet was to make an evening of it . I asked the cab driver where a man could get a drink and a couple of laughs at an hour like this and he drove me to the Back Lot Club . You have to stay up till two o'clock to realize what a small town Hollywood is . It goes to sleep at twelve o'clock like any decentp54Middle Western village . The gay nightlife you dream about there is confined to private houses and the handful of hotspots which enjoy special privileges for which they are taxed in a very special way . At least that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Judge Bowron and his reformers had won the Battle of Los Angeles and began to fumigate the City Hall . The Back Lot was a noisy , gaudy example of what most people seem to imagine all Hollywood is after dark . But except for an occasional celebrated face , it might have been any night spot in any American city . It was a montage of hot music , drunken laughter , loud wisecracks and hostesses like lollypops in red , green and yellow wrappers . The music took the old sweet melodies and twisted them like hairpins . It was a symphony strictly from hunger , to which everybody beat their feet in a frenzy of despair , trying to forget luck that was either too good or too bad , festered ambitions or hollow success . It made me realize again how true jazz music was , how it echoed everything that was churning inside us , all the crazy longings raw and writhing . I had a few drinks while I looked the place over , and then a few more while my angle narrowed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot of the ladies who floated through the semidarkness on the loose , to a close-up of one particular hostess , large , but well-proportioned inside her tight satin evening gown , with a reddish glint to her hair combed strikingly back from her face and falling gracefully to her bare shoulders , where it emphasized the creamy whiteness of her skin . I watched her hips slip up and down as she moved among the tables and it was n't until she lingered at one of them to chat with a little blonde co-worker that I realized who the little blonde 's escort was . Sammy Glick . It was one of those moments when I would have greeted the devil as a long-lost brother if he had only been willing to sit down and have a drink with me . And , in the mood I was in , the redhead was something of an attraction too . It did n't make sense , but my friends have always considered me a disgustingly normal person , and it was normal if unprincipled to get the idea that Sammy might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking for. p 55Sammy had been doing a lot of drinking but he was n't drunk . That did n't surprise me , for it was hard to imagine him ever letting his defenses down long enough really to lose control . As soon as he spotted me he leaped up , yelling , " Well , if it is n't little Alsie-palsie , " and threw his arms around me . It was strange to think that Sammy probably liked me as much as he could like anybody in the world . I think that was because anybody who took life the way Sammy did , gangster , dictator or screenwriter , was ( loomed to be lonely , and even though Sammy knew I could read him like the top line of an optometrist 's chart , he also knew that he could relax with me because I was n't willing or did n't know how to use him for a ladder the way he used me . And at moments like these when he slowed down to a trot I sensed a flash , just the tiniest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shoulders to leap over the wall , and a hint or two of the old respect that he felt in those early days on the Record when I was still trying to teach him not to say ai n't . " Al , " he said , " this is one of those lost angels I was telling you about , Sally Ann Joyce . " He put his arm possessively around the little blonde and grinned at her . She took this as her cue to laugh . She seemed too young to look so tired around the eyes . " Honey , " he said , " I want you to meet one of the sweetest guys in the world . Al Manheim . " And last but never least , you can see for yourself , " Sammy said , indicating the redhead , " is Billie . I do n't think I know your last name , honey . " " Rand , " Billie said , moistening her large lips and trying to look pleased about the whole thing , " Billie Rand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is familiar , but I ca n't quite place the body . But I bet you can guess where I 'd like to place it . " Sammy led the laughter , which they joined automatically . I pushed Billie 's chair in for her and as she looked up over her shoulder to smile into my face she did n't seem to mind my staring down her dress.  | " What are you trying to do , Al , " Sammy said , " give us any imitation of a tourist at the edge of Grand Canyon ? " Sally Ann and Billie giggled dutifully again , though I was n't sure whether they thought it was that funny or not . We drank a couple more rounds , while Sammy told the girls what pals we had been in New York , and it was funny to see how he could carry himself away with his own salesmanship . By the time he was through he made it sound as if the only reason I had come to Hollywood was to be near him . " Maybe you boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was always good for a laugh . It was , but of course Sammy managed to top it . " Do n't give up , girls , " he said . " Have n't you heard we 're ambi-sextrous ? " The last time the waiter set our drinks up again he told us the bar was closing in ten minutes . Sammy pushed the table away rudely . " Let 's get out of this hellhole , " he said . " You 're all coming up to my apartment . " He took one girl under each arm , calling to the boss on the way out : " Do n't worry about your girls , Pop  --  I 'll see that they get to bed early . " The boss gave a fake laugh and tried to make his voice sound as friendly as possible , " Glad you came in , Mr. Glick . Come back again . " I was feeling pretty woozy from all that liquor and the smoke , but I remember wondering as I hit the open air how many people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come  --  in that same tone of voice . Sammy 's apartment was in the fashionable Colonial House just off the Sunset Strip . The names of the tenants underneath the mail boxes at the entrance read like a list of Hollywood 's most eligible bachelors . Sammy 's place was one of the smallest in the building and even that must have been way beyond his means for those early days , but he wrote off only part of the expense to shelter , the rest to prestige.  |p57The  apartment was furnished with an elegance that did n't seem to fit Sammy , at least not yet , with a bedroom that opened off a long living room with a fireplace at one end . Sammy brought out Courvoisier . I wondered where he picked up all those little tricks , and then Billie and I started playing records and doing a little slow dancing , while Sammy and Sally Ann took over the big couch . As we danced , hardly moving together , I heard the sound and silence of held kisses , several shrill , half-giggled Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business about putting her in the movies . It was hardly more than kidding , and Sally Ann knew it , but you could tell from the way she kidded back how much that meant to her . It was all so naked that I wished I were drunker or not there . It was no secret to anybody that she was working out on him and he was working out on her , each one wanting something and not quite admitting it . Some people call that the Hollywood tug of war , though that concept is a little narrow . Hollywood may be one of its most blatant battlegrounds , but it is really a world war , undeclared . There was a long silence while we made a gesture at dancing and then Sammy and Sally Ann started for the bedroom with their arms around each other . They could have slipped out with us only half-noticing them , but Sammy could no more do things by halves than J. P. Morgan could run for president on the Communist ticket . " If anybody asks for me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm tied up in a conference . " Billie started to laugh , but it was just force of habit , and I did n't crack a smile , so he must have thought he was n't being funny enough and tried again . " Well , be good , Al , " he said , " and if you ca n't be good , be careful , and if you ca n't be careful , see that it gets a good agent . " Then we were left alone and I suddenly felt very lousy . Maybe I 'm a Puritan , but there has to be somewhere you draw the line and this was always it for me . I have always been one of those who held that whatever sex may have been to our primitive ancestors , it has become an experience for us that at least deserves the samep58privacy we give to taking a bath . Sinking to the couch with Billie , I remembered a similar revulsion years ago when I walked into a college fraternity the morning after an all-night house party and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a preoccupiedcouple on the living-room sofa . " What are you thinking about , honey ? " Billie stage-whispered , though she could never be the quiet , seductive type . She and this whole set-up were about as subtle as Wallace Beery 's acting . I was n't exactly surprised to find that Sammy approached the most elemental emotion in life with all the sensitivity of a slaughterhouseworker slitting a steer 's throat , but somehow that last crack at the bedroom door had sliced too close to the bone , and it was n't very pretty . With one razor-edge phrase he had cut me down to his level , and it was going to take me some time to rise again . But one thing you had to say for Billie , she was very kind in her way and always patient . I felt as if I had just closed my eyes when a sense of motion in the room opened them again . Through sticky eyes with the eyeballsburning holes in the lids , my host slowly came into focus , dressed for the day and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and started to rub some of the sleep out of my eyes , I could see that Sammy was all washed and shaved and looking irritatingly fresh . My face felt like an old shoe that had been left out all night in the rain , shrunk and stiff in some parts , swollen and mushy in others . But Sammy 's face looked fresh from the laundry . I looked around at the half-empty glasses , the cigarette butts and the other desolate remains , and asked , yawning , " What time is it ? " " Eight-thirty , " Sammy said . " Eight-thirty ? " My stomach went roller-coasting down . " What the hell you doing up at eight-thirty ? " " I have a date for breakfast , " Sammy said . " Not ... " I began.  | " No , " Sammy said . " That was last night . This is business . " Then I realized only Sammy and I were left . " Where are the girls ? " I said . " In the other . . . ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sammy said . " While you were passed out . I do n't like to see them when I get up . They get in my hair . " " But eight-thirty ! " I mumbled . " What 's doing at the studio at eight-thirty ? " " I 'm picking up a friend for breakfast before I check in , " Sammy said . " As a matter of fact you know him . Julie Blumberg . " " Blumberg , " I muttered . " Oh  --  Julian ... ? " " He 's been trying to write some originals , " Sammy said , " so I thought I ought to help the poor kid out and take a look at them . " I was too groggy to see anything wrong with that picture so I just let it pass . Sammy advised me to call the studio and say I was sick and then climb into his bed for the rest of the day . He was being kind , but even in my condition I could sense the way he was gloating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of some horrible grinning robot . " You did all right for yourself , " he said . " I 'll buzz you next week and we 'll do a repeat . " Then he looked at his watch , saw he was late , cursed his dawdlingand was off on a run . So there I was , spending the day , of all places , in Sammy Glick 's bed . When I woke again around four I had a bad taste in my mouth and a worse one in my mind and all I thought about was getting out of there as quickly as possible . I went straight from Sammy 's to a Turkish bath , where I abandonedmyself to steam and sweat and where I had nothing to do for hours but stare at the ceiling and dwell upon the discovery that Sammy Glick at work was hardly more terrifying than Sammy Glick at play.  |p60I  suppose it 's too bad that people ca n't be a little more consistent . But if they were , maybe they would stop being people . They might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our characters on the screen are sandwich men for differentmoral attitudes . We will have the young man who stands for Honest Government and Public Service while his brother is a low-down Wallower in Wine , Women and Corruption . In the last reel the good brother has to be killed off so the bad brother can be regenerated . Regenerated . That is one of Hollywood 's favorite words . This may be heresy , but I have yet to meet anybody who ever got himself Regenerated . I do n't see any **29;6726;TOOLONG running around loose either . Allp61people seem to do is the best they can to get along and have a good time ; and if that means keeping what they 've got , they 're liable to become fascists ; and if it means trying to get what they need and do n't have , there 's a good chance of their learning the Internationale . If I were trying to tell this as a picture story instead of just putting it down the way it happened , my hate for Sammy Glick would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he passed me on the street I would have to cross over to the other side and sooner or later we would come to grips , probably on the edge of a cliff . But that does n't seem to be the way we 're made . Most of us are ready to greet our worst enemieslike long-lost brothers if we think they can show us a good time , if we think they can do us any good or if we even reach the conclusion that being polite will get us just as far and help us live longer . I 'm afraid all this is just an apology for admitting that the next time Sammy called me , a couple of weeks after that first soiree , I did n't hang up on him . In fact , I did n't even refuse his invitation . And without that slackening of moral fiber I would never have had an excuse for knowing him better . For there was no use kidding myself any longer . I wanted to know him . Not that I ever expected to solve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been much too involved with Sammy already ever to be able to forget him . Or even want to . He rankled . He was like a splinter festering under my skin . If I broke off now , I had the feeling his memory would go on torturing me . I had the crazy feeling that only by drilling into him , deeper and deeper , could I finally pass through him and beyond him and free my mind of him at last . Or maybe all I am trying to say is that he was slowly driving me nuts . " Hiya , sweetheart , " he said , " do n't you love me any more ? " " As much as ever , " I said . " How 's tricks over at that sausage factory of yours ? " He always made you feel that any confession of failure was on a level with admitting that you had a yen for nothing but female dogs and ten-year-old corpses . So all I gave him was a cagey " Okay , I guess . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you schlemiel . Sounds like you 're letting them push you around . " " Being pushed around can be quite a luxury , " I said . " At Atlantic City you have to pay for it . " " Do n't worry , " he said , " you 'll pay for it here too . Remind me to give you a couple of pointers on How to Win Friends and Influence Producers when I see you tonight . " " Tonight I am going to get into bed and read , " I said . " Listen , dope , there 's only two things bed is good for . And one of them is n't reading . " I told him to try me some other time as I was already half undressed . As a matter of fact I did have my tie and shoes off . " If you 're half undressed that means you 're also half-dressed , right ? " he said . " So get those gunboats out of dry dock and get the hell over here . We 're unpacking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I told Billie we might look in on her later too . " I felt the knot which held me to the bedpost slipping a little bit . I had come to admire Billie considerably . " Not tonight , Sammy , " I said . " I 'm right in the middle of a book . " He had to know what book and I told him . " Fontamara . By Ignazio Silone . " " Who the hell is Ignats Silone ? " he said . " For my dough one of the greatest writers in the world , " I said . " No kidding ! " He was interested . " Has he got a good story ? " " One of the greatest stories I ever read , " I said . " All about howa ragged little group of peasants rise against Mussolini . " " Well , for Chri'sake , who do you think 's gon na make a pictureabout a lot of starving wops ? In the first place , you 'd lose yourwhole foreign market and ... " As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew it did n't have a chance for pictures . " I do n't know why the hell I waste my time with a crazy bastardp63like you , " he said . " You 're shell-shocked , you do n't add up . What good do you think it 's gon na do you to crap around with stuff like that ? " Very much on the defensive , I admitted that I liked to read . " Sure , " Sammy said , " I never said I had anything against readingbooks ... " " The publishers will be relieved to know that , " I tried to insert , but Sammy was too quick for me and was already rounding the bend of his next sentence . " But as long as you 're going in for it there 's plenty of good , dead authors that 'll hand you terrific picture plots on a silver platter . Why , I knew a guy who made a nice little pile out of one of De Maupassant 's stories just the other day . And all he had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Western stagecoach . If you were smart you 'd try to hit on something like that and write yourself an original . " I found myself thinking that wherever De Maupassant was I hoped he was unaware of what was going on . He had too little faith in mankind as it was . " Hello , where the hell are you ? " Sammy was saying . " Have you hung up ? " " No , " I said , " but only because I have no conscience . " " That 's what you get for being a rabbi 's son , " he said , " a conscience . Going through life with a conscience is like driving your car with the brakes on . " I 'm not sure why I switched and said I 'd come . It might have been the lousy day I had had at the studio . My producer had thrown out my first script and put another writer on with me . His name was George Pancake . I hate to sound obvious , but Pancake could n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaded two hundred pounds . He had the body of a wrestler and the face of a fag . The boys in the office across the hall told me Pancake was a credit hound , one of those writers who practically have convulsions over sole screen credits , so I knew I was in for trouble . The first thing Pancake said when we started talking it over was that he thought it would go faster if he did all the writing , as Ip64obviously had n't caught on to what producers want . Then he started dictating a new line as fast as he could talk and it suddenly hit me that he was n't just coming on the story at all . He must have been working on it for weeks without my knowing it . When that dawned I felt so low I knocked off early , went home and called a masseur . There is something about a massage that makes it a better gloom-chaser for me than getting plastered . But it did n't quite sweat the mood out of me and just as I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my blues I had a notion that a little of Billie and Sammy Glick might not be such a bad idea , if only to get my mind off my own tsurus . I sat at Sammy 's little bar a few minutes , while he stood behind it making drinks and telling me what a riot his next picture was turning out to be . When the doorbell rang I started to answer it , but Sammy told me to sit still and let his Jap get it . " My Jap 's in the kitchen going crazy carving cheese into flowers , " he explained . " I think he 's a fugitive from the WPA Artists ' Project . " We heard the door open and a woman 's voice say , " Hello , Naga . " " This , " Sammy said mysteriously , indicating the door , " is the most terrific thing I ever met . " I looked up as Sammy turned to meet her . She came toward us with a mannish , swinging stride , like a good woman golfer following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bag , with both hands thrust deep into the pockets of a smartly tailored suit . Sammy went for her with open arms , rocking back and forth as he hugged her , half kidding , half on the level . I stood on the sidelines , conscious that I was seeing a new kinetic element in the life of Sammy Glick . This was no faithful poodle like Rosalie Goldbaum or a cute little doll like Sally Ann Joyce . She was arresting , but no beauty , at least not stamped from the Hollywood mold . She looked the type that always gets picked to play the leading man in girls ' school productions . She was in her middle twenties , tall , maybe five-eight , and neatly put together though there was something about the masculinity of her carriage andp65gestures that scared you off . Her skin was tanned and seemed to have been pulled too tight across her face , revealing the bone structure . Her lips seemed even fuller than they were in her lean face . She left her eyebrows pretty much alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpainted . She might have done things with her hair , which was walnut brown , but she just combed it back into a thick coil . " Hope I have n't kept you waiting , " she said . " I spend my entire day trying to duck my producer and then I have to meet him in the hall on my way out . Ever try putting over a story you know is falling apart as you go along ? Great way to lose weight . " Her voice was low-keyed but not husky , and her words raced ahead of each other as if hurrying to keep up with a mind that was always crowding them . She maneuvered neatly out of Sammy 's embrace and turned to inc . " My name 's Sargent . " Her eyes were dark and restless , with large shiny pupils that made me nervous . She extended her hand , and when I took it I was n't surprised to find her grip intimidating . " Kit , " Sammy said , " I want you to meet one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Al , this is Kit Sargent , my favorite screen writer . " He put his arm around her shoulder . It was n't quite long enough to make the gesture look graceful . " Kit is doing the next Gable-Loy . " There was almost as much pride in his voice as if he had the assignment himself . " Oh , you 're Catherine Sargent ! " I felt like Merton-of-the-Movies blurting it out that way , but I suddenly realized this was the gal all the critics were nominating a couple of years back to write the great American novel . I could still remember that first book of hers , The Sex Express , which penetrates the mind of a flapper after her day is done and the depression has set in , when she 's floundering in a backwash of neuroticism and mental disease . I also remembered the author 's photo on the jacket , a picture that made her look a little morep66elegant than she looked now but which caught nicely her cool smile . Under it was a blurb by Dorothy Parker which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , takes us on a fascinatingand frightening journey ... " I told her how her book had hit me . " I 'm glad you thought so , " she said . I suppose that was modesty , but it made me feel like a dope . All she had to do to make me feel that way was just stand there and smile through me . Because we really have n't learned to take female superiority in stride , I resented it . " Her book must have been all right , " Sammy said . " It sold twenty thousand copies and got her a sweet five-year ticket . " " How did you like it , Sammy ? " I asked . " What I read of it was terrific , " he said , " but I could n't get through the first chapter . Let 's get out of here . Let 's go over to the Back Lot and make like crazy . " His humor had n't improved but he was beginning to develop a surefire delivery , with some of the knack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're going to find Billie and have like a bacchanale . " The way he pronounced it , it rhymed with ukulele . We got into his yellow Cadillac . Sammy raced the car too fast in first and threw it into second with naive abandon . " I can go sixty in second , " he said . . He only reminded you once in a while that he was in his early twenties . It was frightening to think what he would be like when he really grew up . When we reached the Back Lot the band was beating it out and the music came at us like a Santa Ana wind . " Will this be all right , Mr. Glick ? " asked the headwaiter , showinga lot of teeth in what was supposed to be a smile . " No , " Sammy said , " I want that one over there . " He pointed to a table practically in the middle of the dance floor , with a RESERVED sign you could n't miss . " I 'm very sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Balls , " Sammy commented.  | " Really , Mr. Glick , you know if I could ... " " Balls , you just hang those signs out to try to give the joint a little class . " Kit started for the ladies ' room . " Let me know how it comes out , " she paraphrased . " I 'll be in Number Three . " People were beginning to look around . I tried to act as if I were n't with Sammy , for I hate headwaiter scenes . " If I do n't get that table , " I heard Sammy say , " you 'll never get me in here again . " I could imagine what the headwaiter would like to have told him . But we got the table . We sat there without anyone taking our order for a minute or two and then Sammy looked around and yelled , " Hey , waiter , gasson , what do you have to do to get a menu in this place  --  send in your agent ? " The waiter hurried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Never talk to waiters like that , " Kit said . " Can I help it , " he said , " if I only went one year to finishing school ? " " It is n't manners , " she said like a sensible schoolteacher quietly disciplining a small boy , " it just is n't smart . " I thought of the time I first told him not to say ai n't . He took this the same way , a little peeved but making mental notes . I noticed he was never too much of an egotist to take criticism when he knew it would help . It was part of his genius for self-propulsion . I was beginning to see what Kit had for Sammy . Of course she stood for something never within his reach before . But it was more than that . Sammy seemed to know that his career was entering a new cycle where polish paid off . You could almost see him filing off the rough edges against the sharp blade of her mind . " I want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't bother sticking your thumb ... " He caught himself and made a nice recovery . " Have you two made up your minds ? " I said Scotch and soda too.  |p68Kit  said Scotch and water . The waiter had only taken a couple of steps when Sammy called him back . " St. James , if you have it , " he said . He tried to make it casual , but he could n't quite get away with it and I knew he must have picked that up since our last outing . The band broke into a rhumba . Sammy rose and reached out his hand for Kit . " I feel like dancing , " he said with a cigar in his mouth . " You do n't know how to rhumba , " she said . " I can do as good as the rest of these jerks , " he said , and his voice carried . " I hate a bad rhumba , " she said . " There 's something about a bad rhumba that 's indecent . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a spring dance ? " As he pulled her to her feet , not roughly but forcefully , he noticed a swarthy , sideburned Latin who was dancing under the impression that he was Veloz . " That guy looks like a leading man in a dirty picture , " he laughed . Then he broke into song , singing through his teeth and his cigar , with an exaggerated Jewish accent . " I 'm a Letin from Menhettin ... " " Now look , " she said , " either dance with me  --  or the cigar . " Sammy was a crude dancer , but he was n't like so many bad dancers who ca n't make up their minds . Because he was n't selfconsciousabout it and forced her to follow all his mistakes , he got away with it . It was n't exactly a thing of beauty , but you had to hand it to him , he had a sense of rhythm . Back in the New York office if anybody had told me that three years later I would be sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rhumba with one of those Vassar smarty-pants I would have called the Bellevue psychopathic ward to come down and take him away . But now that I was actually at a ringside table watching it happen , I could n't make myself feel too surprised . He had about as much interest in dancing the rhumba as he had in writing . But I had begun to take for granted his ability to do everything just well enough so it would n't break his stride.  |p69She  was dancing under wraps but looked as though she really enjoyed it , even with Sammy . But not he . He looked desperate and busy . He was working at it , he was working at having fun . Recreation never seemed to come naturally to him . In fact the only activity that did seemed to be that damned running . I do n't think he ever drank because he liked the taste of whiskey or frequented the Back Lot through any craving for hot music . He just went through the motions of relaxing because he was quick to discover and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their leisure . It would n't have surprised me if this even extended to sex . He seemed to be a lusty little animal , but I think if Zanuck offered to give up his job to Sammy on the condition that Sammy never touch a woman again our hero would have gone impotent before you could say **39;6757;TOOLONG . The waiter set our drinks up again . They went on dancing . I kept an eye on Billie doing a little drink promoting at the bar . They came back to the table because the floor was getting too crowded , and the waiter went for another round . Kit fixed a cigarette to her long holder and eyed the dance crowd with frowning amusement . " Kirstein says the way people dance with each other is the real barometer of any country 's society , " she said . " Just look at ours  --  no more group spirit  --  every man for himself , covered with sweat and trying to push all the other couples off the floor . " Trying to follow her and watch Sammy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been listening . He was preoccupied with somebody on the other side of the room . She turned her head for an instant , caught on and gave him a patient smile . " Go ahead , " she said , " go over and see him , you 're practically over there anyway . " Her voice was that of a mother trying to practice child psychologyon a delinquent child . He rose , thrusting his cigar through his lips , and there was something pugnacious about the way he clenched it between his teeth in the corner of his mouth . It stuck out in front of him like a cannon leveled at the world . " I 'll try to get him over for a drink , " he said . He did n't circle the dance floor to reach the other side . He walked straight across it , pushing his way through the dancers . " Who 's he sucking around now ? " I said . " A good-natured lush called Franklin Collier , " she said . " He was married to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When she got tired of him she packed him off to Iceland to make a picture . He surprised her and everybody else in town by not only coming back alive but bringing Pengi with him . " Pengi was the epic that was so beautifully acted by a cast of penguins , one of the sensations of the twenties . " Is Collier a good ... " She had the disturbing habit of beginning to answer your questionsbefore you had finished asking them . " He 's always had a flair for outdoor pictures , " she said . " He 's sort of a one-man Last Frontier . But when it comes to stories , I do n't think he knows his ass from a hole-in-the-script . " She did n't use those words the way women usually do , consciousthey 're making you think they 're talking like men , but having to get a running start for every word not considered fit for ladies or dictionaries . Sammy returned with a tall man in his late forties , with a red face and bald spot , slimly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a thin neck with a large Adam 's apple . He was n't navigating too well under his own power and Sammy , almost a head shorter , guiding him to our table , looked like a busy little tug piloting a liner into port . " Mr. Manheim , " Sammy said with his best Sunday manners , " I want you to meet not only one of the greatest producers in town but one of my favorite people . " I almost expected Mr. Collier to start making an after-dinner speech . I thought that was going a little too far , even for Sammy , but Mr. Collier took it very gracefully , or perhaps it was only drunkenly . He seemed to be bowing , but it turned out he was onlypI 71aiming his bottom cautiously at the seat of the chair . The waiter brought his drink over from the other table and Collier stared into it with an expression that might have been either thoughtful or thirsty . " Now what was I just saying , son ? " Collier began . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted . " Correct , " Collier said . The only effect his drinking seemed to have on his mind was to throw it into slow motion . " Rappy tells inc you did a hell of a job on Girl Steals Boy , Glick . Hell of a job . " " We 'll know better after the sneak , " Sammy said . " And we 'll know best when we see whether Mr. and Mrs. Public buy tickets . " Later Kit told me Collier 's favorite beef was that writers did n't care what made money and what did n't as long as their stuff went over with the Hollywood first-nighters . And Sammy did n't sound as if he were exactly stabbing in the dark . Collier looked around at us in triumph . " If only more of you writers talked that language ! " Then he turned back to Sammy as if he were going to kiss him . " Well , you and I could talk pictures till all hours of the morning . But I 'm in a spot , son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid like you can help me out . I 've got Dorothy Lamour for a South Sea picture that 's supposed to start in six weeks . It opens at the Music Hall Easter week . It 's got a surefire title , Monsoon . All I need now is the story . " Sammy jerked the cigar from his mouth as if it were a stopper checking his flow of words . " South Sea story ! You 're looking for a South Sea story ! Well , of all the goddam coincidences I ever heard of ! " Hold your hats , girls and boys , I thought , here we go again . " Do n't tell me you 've got one ! " " Have I ! " Sammy yelled . " Is this a break for both of us ! I 've only got the greatest South Sea story since Rain , that 's all . " It was so convincing it even made me wonder if he had n't been holding out on us . " I 'll tell you something about me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a mistake in my life when I played my own hunch . Something just told me you might come through on this . " He took a little notebook from his pocket and wrote in a large , precise , drunk-under-control hand : Glick  --  Monsoon . " You folks wo n't mind if Sammy tells us his yarn right here ? " he asked us . " Go right ahead , " Kit said , " maybe we can even get the boys to play us a little South Sea music . " I tried to figure out how she felt about him , but it was n't simple . She was as eager as I to put him on the spot , but I do n't think she was hoping to see him go on his trim little can the way I was . I think she was just pushing him off the high board because she enjoyed the spectacle of seeing him straighten out and get his balance before knifing into the water . It made me panicky just to imagine myself out on that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the boys in the band started working again , he said , in a voice buttered with boyish sincerity , " Listen , Mr. Collier , I 'd love to tell you the story now , but it would n't be fair to you . When you hear this story I want you to hear it right . Now what if I came out to your house next Sunday ? ... " He had sidestepped his tackler beautifully and was off again . Sammy not only had his lunch date Sunday but Collier was urging him to come early and try the pool . Sammy hardly let Collier get out of earshot before he asked his question . " Neither of you happen to know of a good South Sea story I could use ? I 'd split the sale with you . " I stared at Sammy as if I were practicing to be an X-ray machine . I just could n't seem to take him easy . Kit was leaning back , relaxed , but with her eyes busy , as if she were enjoying a football game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sammy , " I started to say and then I stopped because I knew I could n't think of anything equal to the occasion . So all I finally said was " Sammy Glick , " using it like a swear word. p 73 " A little birdie tells me that lunch is going to cost him just about ten G 's , " Sammy said . " This time you 've lost me , " Kit confessed . " How can you sell iniything while you 're under contract ? The studio owns everything you write . " " Everything I write after I began working for them , " Sammy said coyly . " It would n't be fair for the studio to own everything I wrote before I came to Hollywood , would it ? So who has to know when I wrote my South Sea story ? " All he had to do was say South Sea story once more and I 'd begin to believe he had really written one . The only answer I could think of was , " What South Sea story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he 'll have it . It would be different if he had to write the greatest South Sea story since Rain overnight . But he has three whole days . " " That reminds me , " Sammy said , " what 's Rain about ? " " Holy Jesus , " I said with reverence . " Sammy , now I know you 're a great man , " she said . " What oilier writer in the world could compare his story , which he has n't written , with a classic he 's never read ? " " I did n't have to read it , " Sammy explained . " I saw the movie . But I was such a little kid that all I can remember is Gloria Swanson shaking her cute little can in a minister 's face . " " That 's the plot all right , " she said . " What more can I tell you about it ? " " Come on , Kit , stop the clowning , give out with Rain . " Sammy was through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story . She told it well . You could feel the machinery in his mind breaking it down . I kept my eyes on his face . Sharp , well-chiseled , full of the animal magnetism that passes for virility , his skin blue-complexioned from his close-shaved heavy beard adding five years to his appearance , he was almost handsome . If it was n't for that ferret look . In moments like this when he was on the scent of something you could see the little animal in him poking its snout into a rabbit hole. 74 III BUDD SCHULBERGp74Just as she was reaching the climax , where the good Sadie starts giving way to the old Sadie again , Sammy suddenly leaned forward and cut in . " Wait a minute ! I got an angle ! I 've got it ! " There was an old junk dealer in my youth who used to collect all our old newspapers to grind into fresh pulp again . That was the kind of story mind Sammy was developing . Without even warning us he launched into one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  or ever want to . " All you got ta do to that story is give it the switcheroo . Instead of the minister you got a young dame missionary , see . Dorothy Lamour . Her old man kicked off with tropical fever and she 's carrying on the good work . You know , a Nice Girl . Then instead of Sadie Thompson you got a louse racketeer who comes to the Island to hide out . Dorothy Lamour and George Raft in Monsoon ! Does that sound terrific ? So Dotty goes out to save George 's soul and he starts feeding her the old oil . Of course , all he 's out for is a good lay , but before very long he finds himself watching the sunrise without even thinking of making a pass at her . The soul crap is beginning to get to him , see ? He tells her she 's the first dame he ever met he did n't think about that way . Now give me a second to dope this out ... " I told him I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give him several decades , but he did n't stop long enough to hear me . " Oh , yeah , how about this  --  just about the time George is ready to break down and sing in her choir every Sunday morning they get caught in a storm on one of the nearby islands . They have to spend the night in a cave huddled together . Well , you can see what 's coming , she ca n't help herself and lets him slip it to her . When they realize what they 've done they both go off their nut . He goes back to his booze , shooting his mouth off about all dames looking alike when you turn them upside down , and Dotty feels she 's betrayed her old man , so she goes to the edge of the cliff and throws herself into the ocean . But good old George manages to get there in time and jumps in after her . Then you play a helluvap75scene in the ocean where you get over the idea that the water purifies ' em . Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the third time with Dotty in his arms hollering something like : Oh , God , if You get us outa this  --  I 'll work like a bastard for You the rest of my life . ' And you 're into your final fade with Dorothy and George married and setting up shop together , in the market for new souls to save . " Sammy looked at us the way a hoofer looks at his audience as he finishes his routine . There was a moment of respectful silence . " Of course , " Sammy explained , falling back on the official Hollywood alibi , " I was just thinking out loud . " " But where , " I said , " does the monsoon come in ? " " Jesus , " he said , " I 'm glad you reminded me . What the hell is a monsoon ? " " A monsoon is a sequel to a typhoon , " Kit explained . " Only bigger , " Sammy interpreted . " So the monsoon 'll have to be coming up all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a natural for inter-cutting . Symbolical . When she does her swan dive from that cliff she lands right in the middle of it . That will really give the rescue scene a wallop . " " I 'm glad you added the monsoon , " Kit said . " I could n't quite see how an ordinary ocean would purify them . But a monsoon makes it convincing . " " What do you think of it , Al ? " he said . " I do n't know much about art , " I said , " I only know what I like . I think it stinks . " He looked at her with a question mark . " I think Collier will buy it , " she said seriously . Sammy turned on me with a leer not quite hidden in a smile . " That shows what you know about story values , Al . " His shell of egotism had n't quite had time to harden yet , but he was already beginning to show annoyance when his picture judgment was questioned . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future yes-man so I pressed my point.  | " I did n't hear Kit say anything about the story . All she said was that you might sell it . " " Well , what more do you want me to do with it ? " Sammy said . " Win the Nobel Prize for literature ? " " Have n't you learned yet never to argue with Sammy about himself ? " she said . " That 's one subject on which I 'm convinced he 's infallible . " " But why should you want to encourage crap like that ? " " You do n't really think what we say has anything to do withit when there 's so much more encouragement at the other end , good at any bank ? " Her voice was crisp and confident . I decided that I would always prefer to have her on my side . " As long as they sell South Sea pictures before they know what they 're going to be about , " she continued , " the kind of ad-libbingSammy just gave us will be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a work of genius , " I said , " like Shirley Templeis my child bride . " " Look up the word genius in the dictionary sometime , " she said . Sammy was lining up the plot on the tablecloth . " How the hellcan I get George to find out she 's drowning ? " he said . I stuck a cigarette in my mouth and Kit promptly lit it for me . " Feel like dancing ? " she said . For some reason it reminded me of a night down in the Village when a man invited me to dance . I wanted to go on talking with her , but I knew I would feel foolish having to take her in my arms . I do n't think I ever had that reaction to a woman before . I tried to beg off on the grounds that it would leave Sammy alone . But he said , " Go ahead , dance . You know me , Greta Garbage , I von to be alone . " As we rose Sammy 's hard , stubby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought a be ? " he said . " An exotic little savage her old man converted . So when she starts going for George she 's just reverting to type ! " " Do n't you think that psychology stuff is a little highbrow ? " Ip 77said over my shoulder , and we were out there on the floor , set to music . I felt like a kid at his first dance . Scared of getting too close to her . I held her at arm 's length literally and otherwise . She was so damned cool and well-groomed . Not only her clothes , but her face and her mind . I had a screwy temptation to mess her up a little bit , muss her hair , mix her up . She had it all down so pat . When it came to understanding our little friend I felt she had a couple of laps on me . My dancing was n't too good because I was conscious of not being able to think of anything to say . Finally , she had to start it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not so very long , " I said . " I do n't know , maybe a month . " " Suppose it is n't fair to ask whether you like it or not ? " " I 'm making twice what I was in New York , and the climate'sa whole lot better . Why should n't I like it ? " She smiled at me with so much understanding it was humiliating . " Do n't worry , hardly anybody does at first . " " I low about the eminent author of Monsoon ? " I said . " ' They 're different , " she said . I told her I could only see one Sammy Glick at that table , unless the last couple of drinks had caught up with me . " I meant all the Sammy Clicks , " she said . " ' There is only one Sammy Glick , " I insisted . " I know . I met hull when he could n't have been much over seventeen . Why , I 've practically seen him grow up and ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't think Sammy Glick was an adult at birth , but he must have become one very soon after-wards . " " I hope you are n't right , " I said . " For his parents ' sake . But I had Sammy working out on me every day for years . And I 'm willing to swear on my option that he 's a unique contribution to the human race . " " I hate to disillusion you , " she said , " but he has plenty of soul mates running in the same race . " " I wo n't believe it till I see it , God forbid , " I said . " One Sammy Glick in my life is all my constitution will stand . "  | " I 've known Clicks before , " she said . " My first producer out here was a Glick . And so was the agent I just got rid of , Barney Burke . " " God rest their souls , " I said . " Of course , I will admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " With a special hopped-up motor . But he 's put out by the same people . " The only topic we had in common was Sammy  --  and 1 was afraid of pushing that too far because I was n't sure how things stood with them . The conversation hit an air pocket . She could dance , all right . She danced the way professional models walk , with a haughty effortlessness . The only trouble with her dancing was it made me feel pretty much the way her talk had . She followed so well she seemed to anticipate me . At times it was really hard to tell whether I was doing the leading or not . The music stopped and I made a false start toward the tables , but it was only a beat between numbers and she started dancing with me again . " I love to dance , " she said . " But no one ever seems to think of taking me dancing . " " It 's a funny thing , " I said , " I 've always liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're not a lousy dancer , " she said , " you 're fair . I like to dance with fair dancers . For some reason they 're usually better guys . " The music blared . Billie promoted . Sammy figured . The crowd pushed , and we pushed back , in time to music . We danced along silently and I wondered what we were going to talk about next . Until she suddenly said , " I guess you 're his best friend , are n't you ? " There it was again . Beginning to haunt me . The wording of a familiar Jewish phrase came back to me : My worst enemy should n't have such a best friend ! " I do n't know , " I said . " Maybe I am . Maybe I am at that . Only I do n't think friendship is one of Sammy 's fortes. "  | " He only has one forte , " she said , " himself . " She did n't say it bitterly : solemnly . We were hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor , feeling the music and getting to know each other . The band struck its intermission chord . " Thanks , " I said . " Let 's go back and see how W. Somerset Glick is getting along . " She laughed . " Even Houdini could n't turn Rain upside down ! " We laughed with each other again . More than the remark deserved . I could n't help taking her figure in as I stood aside to let her lead the way , single file , to our table . Not as masculine as I t bought . Athletic , but not so much the Babe Didrickson type as the Helen Wills . " The music 's getting on my nerves , " Sammy said as we sat down . I was surprised to hear he thought he had them . " What d' ya say we blow ' n ' go back to my joint ? I wan na try my story on you . " " You remember us , " I said , " we were here for the first show . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , " he said . " Now I 've really got it licked . " Half an hour later Kit , Billie and I were seated on Sammy 's modernistic gray suede couch watching him like an audience . You kid to hand it to him . He was always improving . I mean , he was becoming more and more expert at being Sammy Glick . The way he was telling this story , for instance . He was n't outlining it , he was acting it . What the story lacked in character and plot his enthusiasm and energy momentarily overcame . As I watched him perform I realized why he was repeating it . This must have been the only way he could write , telling his story over and over to people who supplied a line here , an idea there , until the story began to take shape like a snowman forming hastily under many bands . Instead of listening I found myself sifting the qualities which made his kind of storytelling possible.  | First , no qualms . Not the thinnest sliver of misgiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel that the most important job in the world was putting over Monsoon . In the second place , he was as uninhibited as a performing seal . He never questioned his right to monopolize conversation or his ability to do it entertainingly . And then there was his colossal lack of perspective . This was one of his most valuable gifts , for perspective does n't always pay . It can slow you down . I have sat in my office and said to myself , There are twelve million of your fellow Americans unemployed this morning . Who the hell are you ? If that kept me from writing a line all morning it might mean I had perspective . Or thinking how the world was fifty million years ago and all the men who had their chance at living in it and what that had to do with the big pay-off scene in Nick Turner  --  Boy Detective I was supposed to turn in by five o'clock . That 's perspective too . Or just staring up into millions of stars at night till you become molecular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very unhappy . I could n't imagine Sammy ever unhappy . Or happy either . I wondered what emotions he did have . Perhaps only a burning impatience to be further , further on . Billie liked the story because she could just see Raft and Lamour playing the parts . Kit started to tell Sammy how to put a picture story together . " The scenes ca n't be like a lot of people gathered at random , Sammy , even if they 're colorful people . A good picture should be like a family tree . Every scene giving birth to the one that follows . " You did n't have to have much of an imagination to see the tentacles of Sammy 's mind closing around that idea . I could almost hear him explaining his theory of film continuity to Collier that Sunday . When my turn came I said , " Sammy , I still do n't think the vehicle is worthy of you , but the acting is devastating . But deafen-ingly . " I was n't exaggerating . The worse the story became , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , " Kit said , " there must be something in that technique . Adolf and Benito have been doing it for years and look where those boys are . What a marvelous pair of Hollywood phoniesthey 'd be ! Ca n't you just see them taking over a story confer-ence ? " Sammy seemed rather flattered by the comparison . " She 's right , Al , " he said . " Here 's a little motto your Uncle Sammy made up himself  --  hang it up in your office  --  I 'll give it to you free : Work hard , and , if you ca n't work hard , be smart ; and , if you ca n't be smart , be loud . " " You sound like Moses , " I said , " proclaiming the Ten Commandmentsfrom Mount Sinai . " " Moses was a sap , " Sammy said . " Look at the joke they made of those Commandments of his . They 've been playing him for a sticker for three thousand years . At least mine work . For instance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the first story conference I ever had out here . " He took that first conference , all right . We had a very vivid picture of the producer , the supervisor , another writer and Sammy trying to dope a good , quick way for the boy and girl to meet at the opening of the picture . " The supervisor keeps throwing out but the producer plays tough . All he says is corny , stinks or 1902 . The other writer is a Caspar Milquetoast with an expression on his face like he 's really thinking . Looks like he needs an enema . I 'm thinking too , but not about the scene . I 'm thinking I know from nothing about what I 'm supposed to be doing and any minute the producer who 's no deadhead is going to find it out . " Then Milquetoast starts mumbling something under his breath . Like this , see ? " Sammy tried to give us his interpretation of a timid soul . It was a difficult part for him . " I wonder if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy into a room she believes vacant but actually is still occupied by the young lady ? ' " This time the producer do n't even bother to say no . Maybe the does n't even hear him at all . Everybody just goes on thinking . The poor schlemiel looks around waiting for a reaction and endsp82up talking to himself . Yes , ' he says , ' I guess it is . ' " The poor schlemiel turned out to be S. Henley Forster who has had more books reprinted in the Modern Library than any living American writer . " The dope probably does n't know it , but he showed me how to smack a story conference . I sit there a couple of seconds till I 'm sure I have the producer 's eye . Then I start opening my eyes and sucking in my breath like I 'm just discovering America or something . Then I start getting to my feet , slow , like this , looking at everybody as I rise . Significantly . " Wait a minute ! ' I yell . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. Christ I 've got it ! ' " They look like I 've slugged ' em over the head with sandbags . The boss does n't even say swell or let 's have it . I can feel I 've got ' em already . Jesus , what a feeling ! " Here 's the boy , ' I says , wandering through the rain in a strange city looking for the cheapest room he can find . ' " Even for us Sammy turned his collar up and started trudging through the rain . " The landlady , a terrific old character , leads me up the rickety stairs . " You 're in luck , young man , " she says to me , " there was somebody in this room but she had to be out by six o'clock . I ca n't afford to run a free mission around here . " ' I 'm not giving you the dialogue , you understand , just ad-libbing , but you can see where the dialogue can be terrific . Now we got suspense , see ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about already and we 've got them wondering about the lovely young girl who 's just been turned out into the cold . " Now the door swings open . I walk in . All of a sudden I look up and stop . Dead in my tracks . Staring .. " That 's where I paused , " Sammy told us . " Let ' em have a moment for the scene to sink in . " The camera swings over and what do you think we pick up ?  --  our girl , half-dressed , just as little on as the Hays Office will let us get by with . She looks up  --  like a tigress  --  fighting for shelter . We 're right into a helluva situation . It 's a terrific moment. p 83I keep looking at the girl . She keeps looking at me . Everybody in the audience knows the battle I 'm fighting . How the hell can I take this room tonight and throw this tragic little waif out into the gutter ? ' " Sammy paused again , looking at us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The landlady is talking to me , telling me she 'll have the girl out of there right away . I do n't even hear her . And then , do you know what I say ? Without taking my eyes off the girl I ask the landlady , How much does she owe you ? ' And when she tells me , I just say , It 's paid , ' just like that , It 's paid .. " And if you do n't think that 's the most terrific opening you ever had on any picture let me out of my contract and I 'll go back to my old job of managing editor of the New York Record ! ' " Sammy turned his collar down again , indicating that the curtainhad fallen . " Jesus , I murdered them . The producer jumped up and kissed me . Then he had me tell the whole thing through main . Then he asked the supervisor and the other writer what they thought of it . I wish I could have had a picture of that poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it completely . " Sammy 's laugh invited us to join in at Forster 's expense . His excuse for dwelling on the story was its lesson for me . But from the relish with which he re-enacted his crime you could see how the experience fattened his pride . It made me realize more sharply than ever what a peculiar phenomenon his pride was . He was prouder of the method with which he had triumphed than if he had thought of the original suggestion himself . " Now I know what I have to do to become a successful screen writer , " I said . " Take elocution and singing lessons . " I tried to kid about it , but I was really depressed . For if making the grade out here meant going through the song-and-dance that Sammy had just presented , I felt I might as well start applying for hand-outs at the Motion Picture Relief . But Kit reassured me . " You may not believe it , but there are some writers out here who really write . I 've seen them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dudley Nichols , forp84instance . He and John Ford have just done a job called The Informer that made me want to wash my mouth out with soap for all the nasty things I 've been saying about Hollywood . " That was the first time I had ever heard anybody make Hollywoodsound like a job , instead of a happy hunting ground where the customary weapons were a fabulous gall and a mouth energetic and loud . I was settling down beside her , ready to hear more , when Sammy came over and dropped his arm around her . " I ca n't understand it , " he said , " a smart wench like her  --  just lousy with ideals . " Out of his mouth that word sounded like something from a foreign language . " You know she 's on the Board of the Screen Writers Guild , " he said . " She even got me to join her lousy organization . " It disturbed me not to be able to get a line on what they thought they were doing with each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And yet if it was love it was a new kind on me . I think I had collected enough evidence to prove to myself that the only love Sammy Glick was capable of was a violent passion for his own future . And why a dame in her league wanted to play around with a swift little rodent like Sammy Glick seemed to be one for Dr. Freud . " Look at the time , " I said . " How about it , Billie ? Maybe you and I ought to drag each other out of here before he starts charging us rent . " Kit showed Billie into the bedroom to get her hat and coat . I did n't know why I should have felt annoyed that she knew her way around so well . Sammy and I had a nightcap . I must have been a little further gone than I thought , to tell him about my studio troubles with Pancake . Sammy responded like a fireman hearing the alarm . " Let me show you how to give that guy the finger , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was real benevolence in his voice , of his own peculiar brand . " If you turn in one treatment with both your names on it andp85that fat swish lets the producer know he did all the writing , you 're dead . If you want to play it cozy , write a treatment of your own without letting Pancake know and then get to your producer alone and tell him you thought Pancake was so far off the line it seemed faster to straighten it out yourself . That way you 've got a chance of scaring him into bouncing Pancake off the picture and grabbing yourself a solo screenplay credit . " I could n't see myself doing it , and I told him so . I was n't sure whether I would ever make a screen writer or not , but I had no illusions about my powers as a politician . " Do n't be a sap , " he said . " You 've heard of the survival of the fittest . " I admitted that I held with the theory of evolution , but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all the fancy names you want , " he said , " but when you come right down to it it 's dog eat dog . " Somehow , I had been hoping that Kit was going to leave with us . But she had made herself very much at home . She had even let her hair down . I never understood before what a nice figure of speech that was . Instead of the large , neat knot that gave her that brisk , efficient look , it fell down over her shoulders now , softening her face , making her look relaxed , almost girlish . " So long , sweetheart , " Sammy said to me . " We 'll be previewingsome night next week . I 'll give you a ring when I find out what night and we 'll all get together . " There he stood in the doorway of his classy apartment , in his early twenties , in his expensive shoes , in his brand-new flashy jacket , in his brand-new Horatio Alger mind , but still looking like a kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clothes he found in the closet . My best friend . My worst enemy should n't have such a best friend. 1111111Back in my room , Billie and I had our moment and then as the passion drained , our bodies returned us to what we really were , casual acquaintances.  | The longer the silence lasted the further apart we drew . Finally she said , " What 're you thinking about , honey ? " " Oh , just a lot of things , Billie , " I said . " Nothing much , I guess . " " You know , " she said , " I like it with you a lot . You 're sweet . " There was nothing ever sordid about sex with Billie . The way she talked about it , it might have been surfboard riding or mountainclimbing , anything she happened to be good at and enjoy . " Billie , " I said , " do n't answer this unless you want to . How many men have you been with ? " The question was n't intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " Well , when I was fourteen , " she said , " I tried to keep track of all the boys I knew . And when I was fifteen I tried to keep track of all the boys I kissed . And when I was sixteen  --  but now I 've even lost track of that . " She chuckled as if she had told a joke on herself . " Billie , what do you think of Sammy Glick ? " She pulled the sheet up to her neck . " Oh , I do n't know . He 's a pretty smart feller , all right . " " You know what I mean , " I said . " How do you feel about him ? " This time she really seemed to think it over . " All I know , " shesaid slowly , " is that I 'd hate to go to bed with him . " The principal furniture in Billie 's mind was a good-sized bed . " Why , Billie ? " She hesitated , giggling with the embarrassment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I do n't know exactly , " she said . " I 've always liked to do it because it 's just about the most fun you get out of life and because  --  I bet you laugh at me for this  --  it 's always seemed like the friendliest thing two people can do in the whole world . That 's why I 've never wanted to turn pro . But  --  I know this sounds crazy  --  but somehow I 've always felt that if I ever went to bed with him  --  even if he did n't pay me  --  I 'd feel like I was doing it for money . " I kept turning that over in my mind as I was falling asleep andp87the more I played it back the surer I was that Billie , in her own sweet horizontal way , had said something more searching about Sammy than anything I had been able to hit on yet . And I had been working at it ever since the little copy boy burst into my office and launched his undeclared war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant searchlights ballyhooing Sammy 's preview plowing broad white furrows through the sky . " There it is , " Sammy said as we turned off Sunset toward the Village . The words came out of his mouth like hard , sharp-sided pebbles . " Jesus . " He meant those lights up there were spelling Sammy Glick . There was no other word for the sound of pride mouthed with apprehension . There was n't much talking . Sammy 's mood always provided the backdrop for the rest of us , and he was nervous . Even when he tried to cover it with wisecracks , they were nervous wisecracks . " What kind of a house is this ? " he said.  | " A tough one , " Kit said . " They only laugh when it 's funny , not when it 's supposed to be funny . And they never cry when it 's maudlin . Only when it 's pathetic . " " Jesus , " Sammy said . " And they 're preview-wise , " she warned . " They 've had so many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They complain about the angles , and the smoothness of the dissolves , and they even tell you what to cut . " " The bastards , " Sammy said , " they better think my picture is funny . I know it 's funny . I counted the laughs myself . One hundred and seventeen . " The theater entrance was full of excitement that came mostly from women who were attracted to the leading man , and men resentful or regretful that they would never go to bed with anybodylike the star , and unimportant people who idealized their envy into admiration and kids who wanted to have more autographsthan anybody else in the world . All the lights were on in the theater and everybody in the audience had his head turned toward the entrance . It looked crazy , as if the screen had suddenly been set up behind their backs . They were all watching for the celebrities to fill up the loge section that had been roped off for them . I realized why Sammy had rushed us through dinner . He wanted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The three of us started down the aisle together but we had only gone a couple of rows when we lost Sammy . When I looked around , Sammy was practically in the lap of a dignified , grayhairedman , with a pink , gentle face , which was a little too soft around the mouth . " That 's his producer , " Kit said as I was about to ask . " Sidney Fineman . " I looked again . Fineman was one of the magic names like Goldwyn and Mayer . As we waited for the lights to fade , we talked about Fineman . He was one of the few real old-timers still on top . He had written scenarios for people who have become myths or names of streetsp90like Griffith and Ince . He was supposed to have one of the finest collections of rare books in the country . " And it is n't just conspicuous consumption , " she said . " His idea of how to spend one hell of an evening is to lock himself in his library alone . He built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his estate . " The more she told me the more curious I was that a man like Sidney Fineman should want to work with Sammy . " Fineman is n't the man he was fifteen years ago , " she said . " He had just as much taste as Thalberg and more guts . Hollywood was his girl . He loved her all the time . He had ideas for making something out of her ... " I could see Sammy out of the corner of my eye . He had finally worked his way down to our aisle . He was leaning over two or three people to shake hands with Junior Laemmele . " But that 's all gone , " Kit was saying . " The Depression killed something in him . Not only losing his own dough , but the big bank boys like Chase and Atlas moving in on his company . He began to get an obsession about the Wall Street bunch working behind his back . He started playing safe . Now he 's just one of the top dozen around town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's scared to death that the minute he starts losing money they 'll take his name off the door . He 's convinced Sammy is a money writer . And I have a sneaking suspicion who convinced him . " Sammy ducked into the seat beside me as the credit titles came on . I watched his face as his name filled the screen : ORIGINAL SCREENPLAYbySAMUEL GLICKThere is no word in English to describe it . You could say gloat , smile , leer , grin , smirk , but it was all of those and something more , a look of deep sensual pleasure . The expression held me fascinated because I felt it was something I should not be allowed to see , likep91the face of the boy who roomed across the hall from me in prep school when I had made the sordid mistake of entering without knocking . " Then Sammy leaned over and whispered something in my ear that will always seem more perverse than anything in KrafftEbing . " Just for a gag , " he said , " clap for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did . There were my hands clapping foolishly like seal flippers . The applause was taken up and spread through the house , not what you would call thunderous ovation , just enough of a sprinkle to make my hands feel like blushing . It was n't bad enough that I had become Sammy 's drinking companion . I had to be his one-man claque . My applause could n't have been more automatic if Sammy had previouslyhypnotized me and led me into the theater . As I stared at that credit title I had a feeling that something was missing . But it was n't until the screen was telling us who designed the wardrobe and assisted the director that I remembered what it was . Julian . Julian Blumberg , the kid who made the lit t le snowball that Sammy was rolling down the Alps . Granting that Sammy had written , God knows how , the screenplay alone , the worst it should have been was original story by Samuel Glick and Julian Blumberg preceding the screenplay credit . But there it was , all Sammy Glick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better one than before , I leaned over and asked Sammy whether he noticed anything funny about that screen credit and when he did n't , I enlightened him . It was like lighting a candle in Mammoth Cave . " That first story we did all went in the ashcan , Al , " he said in i thick whisper . " I had to start from scratch . I know it 's a tough break for the kid , but that 's Hollywood . " " The hell it is , " I said . " That 's Sammy Glick . " Kit said a sharp shhhhh . As the picture was opening I was wondering whether I would have agreed with Sammy about Hollywood before I met her . The picture was n't anything that would come back to you asp92you were climbing into bed , or even remember as you were reachingunder the seat for your hat ; it was a good example of the comedy-romance formula that Hollywood has down cold , with emphasis not on content but on the facility with which it is told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been geared for , slick , swift and clever . What Kit calls the Golden Rut . But in spite of the entertainment on the screen I preferred the show going on in the adjoining seat . I never saw a man work so hard at seeing a picture . " Eleven already , " he said to me a couple of minutes after the picture started , and I realized he had a clocker in his hand and was counting the laughs . And each time they laughed he jotted down feverishly the line or the bit of business . And every time they did n't he 'd mumble , " It 's that goddam ham  --  he 's murdering my line , " or " That 's a dead spot they can kill when they trim it . " I just sat there watching him learn the motion-picture business . He was an apt student , all right . He learned something about pictures in five months that I 'm just beginning to understand after five years . Hollywood always has its bumper crop of phonies but believe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was smart enough to know that the crook who cracks his jobs too consistently is sure to be caught . His secret was to be just as conscientious about the real work he did as about the filching and finagling . The picture got a good hand as the lights came on again . I turned to follow Sammy up the aisle but Kit grabbed my arm . " Out this way , " she said . " It 's better . " She indicated the emergency exit on the side . It led us to an alley that ran around the theater . As we walked through the darkness toward the street , Kit said : " I always like to duck out before anybody asks me how I liked the picture . " " Even if you did ? " " It is n't that simple . Hollywood has a regular ritual for preview reactions . When they know they 've got a turkey they want to bep93reassured . And when they have one that 's okay they expect superlativcs . " She illustrated her point by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are asked what they think of the preview . The first says it is without a doubt the greatest picture ever made . The second says it is absolutely colossal and stupendous . The third one is fired for shaking his head and saying , " I do n't know , I only think it 's great . " " Just the same , " I said , " I 'm impressed . To tell the truth I did n't know Sammy had it in him . " " Do n't misunderstand , " she said . " I think it 's a damn good movie . The only thing I have against those guys is that they 're like the old Roman Caesars  --  every piddling little success becomes an excuse for staging a triumph . And I just do n't happen to enjoy king dragged along behind the chariot . " When we reached the street Sammy was standing with half a dozen men bunched on the curb in front of the theater . They all seemed to be talking at once , though Sammy was doing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others besides Sammy and Fineman , the director , the cutter , several other executives and the cameraman . A couple of others were hovering around the edge , mostly listening and reacting . Fineman and the director seemed to he having an argument . The director was yelling that if they yanked his favorite scene they could take his name off the picture . Sammy was supporting Fineman . We watched a boy bring out a ladder and climb up efficiently to change the lettering on the marquee , and then Kit said , " These sidewalk conferences are liable to last all night . Let 's go and have a drink . He can meet us there . " My mind kept remembering the way she had made herself at home at Sammy 's as we left that night . It was crazy to let it annoy me because I had n't even made up my mind yet whether I liked her or not . I liked the way her mind drove at things but there was something disconcerting about the way she kept you from getting too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she turned around and called to Sammy briskly , " The Cellar . " An anemic young man in a shabby overcoat was waiting at the car . I knew him , but I could n't place him until he began to talk . Of course it was Julian Blumberg . He was unable to hide the terrible effort it was for him to approach me . You could see it was an act of desperation . " Mr. Manheim , I do n't think you remember me ... " His eyes seemed to be forever crying . He kept cracking his knuckles , shifting his balance and looking everywhere but at me . The Jewish language has the best word I have ever heard for people like Julian : nebbish . A nebbish person is not exactly an incompetent , a dope or a weakling . He is simply the one in the crowd that you always forget to introduce . " Of course I do , " I said . " Glad to see you . " I tried to make it sound hearty . He extended his hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruler . I could feel the perspiration in his palm . When I introduced him to Kit he gave her a preoccupied nod and then , as if he had been sucking in his breath for it a long time , he blurted out what he wanted to say to me . As with so many timorous people when it finally came out it sounded brusque and overbold . " Mr. Manheim , I 've got to see you right away . " " Sure , Julian , " I said , " can you tell me what it 's about ? " He looked at Kit suspiciously . " Alone , " he said . " I want to talk to you alone . " His voice begged and demanded at the same time . I suppose I should have been sore , but it was hard to miss the undertones in Julian 's rudeness . " All right , " I said , " will it take very long ? " The determination valve suddenly seemed to loosen and the bluster leaked out of him . " Gosh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I would n't think of bothering you like this unless ... "  | " How long would you say it would take ? " I interrupted impatiently . " It 's  --  there 's quite a lot to tell . I 'd say a couple of hours . " I looked at Kit . " Why do n't you two go ahead ? " she said . " I do n't mind being alone . " That was the trouble , I knew she did n't mind being alone . " I 'll tell you what you do , Julian . It 'll keep until lunch tomorrow , wo n't it ? How about dropping around at the studio ? Twelvethirtyokay ? " I le was so grateful it was painful . He backed away like an awkward courtier , hoping he was n't being too much trouble and thanking me again . " Who is that damp little fellow ? " Kit asked as she pressed her foot on the starter . I still did n't feel I knew her well enough to tell her the story of Girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writer Sammy and I knew in New York who was out here looking for a job . " No wonder he looked worried , " she said . " There were exactly two hundred and fifty of us working today . The Guild keeps a daily check-up . And do you know how many screen writers there are ? Nearly a thousand . With carloads of bright-eyed college kids arriving every week  --  willing to do or die for dear old World-Wide at thirty-five a week . " I do n't really believe that liquor will cure all the ills in our society . But two or three healthy slugs often cure our curious inability to know each other . Unless we know people well , we sit around with our words and our minds starched , afraid of being ourselves for fear of wrinkling them . Down in the Cellar , after the first couple of drinks , I could feel us loosening up with each other . It was n't in anything we said , it was just that we seemed to like each other better and we both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes watchingp96how different people came down the stairway and posed on the final landing before entering the room . When we had had enough of that game we found ourselves playing a new one called How I Met Sammy . She asked me first . I amused her for ten or fifteen minutes with a quick enumeration of the highlights of Sammy Glick 's Mein Kamp f , but doing a Will Hays on the more extravagant of his achievements . " I met him during the revolution we almost had last year , " she said . " When Upton Sinclair was running for Governor . " I said I had heard about it but had never paid much attention to it . " Then you really missed something , " she said . " The panic was on when Upton Sinclair won the Democratic nomination by announcing that he was going to End Poverty in California . " " I always thought Sinclair was just another of your California crackpots , " I said . " Oh , his script had plenty of holes all right , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people a better run for their money than Merriam 's  --  which had n't changed a line since Birth of a Nation . " " Well , where does Sammy Glick come in ? " " He 's practically banging on the door now , " she said . " At the height of the campaign World-Wide had a sudden loss of memory . It 's funny how a little thing like the Bill of Rights can slip your mind once in a while . They demanded that every employee contribute a day 's pay to the Merriam fund . That was something I thought even honest Republicans should resent , so I told them where to go , in my prettiest profanity . " A couple of days later I was sitting there in my office minding my own script , when a total stranger burst into my office as if his pants were on fire . " " I 'm Sammy Glick , " he said . And waited as if that were all the introduction he needed . " Whatever you 're selling , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm very busy . "  | " You 've got me wrong , " he laughed . " I 'm the new writer just moved in across the hall . " " How chummy , " she said . " If you 're ever short drop over and rrow a cup of dialogue . " Because she had never heard of Sammy Glick she tried to discouragehim by turning back to her typewriter . ' That 's a honey , " he laughed , moving in . " I 'll hafta remember that one . " As she turned around she found herself looking into his face . " Mr. Glick , " she began sweetly , " I suppose I ought to be hositableand welcome you to Writers ' Building C. And now that I ave will you get the hell out of my office and let me work ? " She had chased her share of brassy guys out of the office , ad-space lesmen and small-time agents and the usual studio lounge lice . When sarcasm did n't get them , a little pungent cussing would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of her desk andcoked over her shoulder . " I hear you 're working on Dancing Debs , " he said . " That Ought a be a swell credit . " She rose , covered her typewriter , stuffed some of the papers on her desk into a big envelope and slung her coat over her shoulder . " Where you goin ' ? " he said . " Where I can work , " she said. " ' ley , " he said , " do n't let me chase you out . I just dropped in  --  r a friendly chat . Thought I 'd give you a tip that the front office nows you 're the only writer on the lot who has n't come across for Merriam . " That was the way the pressure went . Nobody was ever called into an executive office and told to shell out or get out . That job was taken over by the stooges . The yes-men had a field day with their " **32;6798;TOOLONG " stuff , coercion by innuendo in the best Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were being told the latest studio gossip . Next morning Kit reached the lot a few minutes before ninethirtyand had coffee at the studio diner before going to work . Sammy was there , having breakfast and making verbal passes atp98the waitress . When he saw Kit he slid over to greet her as if their first meeting had been love at first sight . " Which way do you come in the morning ? " he asked . " Maybe you could pick me up . " I come by way of Boulder Dam , " she said . " I 'm sure it 's a little out of your way . " He took this as a joke and started reading the Megaphone with her . Of course the lead edit was about Merriam and Sinclair . Sammy began to read it out loud . She picked up the paper and paid her check . He followed her out . She walked faster , ignoring him . He trotted along beside her desperately . " Look , you 're a smart girl , you read the papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nut Sinclair ... " She managed to lose him by turning into a convenient ladies ' room . As she came down the hall he appeared at his doorway . She tried to shut the door in his face but he slithered through like a cat . No kidding , Katie  --  is that what they call you , Katie ? I 'm worried about you , " he said . " Now why do n't you let me get on the phone and tell Dan Young . . . " Dan Young was the studio manager who had sent out the notices about the day 's pay . Sammy reached for the phone . Kit looked at him curiously . " How long have you been in California ? " she said . " Four days . " " So you 've learned enough about the issues of the campaign in four days to become a political adviser , " she said . " How long does it take you to find out that the sun rises in the east ? " Sammy said . " One good look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy 's answer came prompt and glib . " He 's for law and order . He 's a friend of the industry . He 's a right guy . " " If the people push over the Merriam machine , " she stated quietly , " it 's my guess they 'll find enough corruption crawling around under there to keep all the starving lawyers in California busy the rest of their lives  --  digging it out . "  | " So what ? " Sammy said . " Everybody knows about JimmyWalker . And he 's the best mayor New York ever had . " " I 'm afraid you flunk in citizenship , " she said . " Did n't you everhave to take Civics ? " " Sure , " he said . " What a laugh . The teacher giving us all that crap out of a book when all we had to do to learn about politics was watch the Tammany guy on the corner . " She looked at him . She had a temper and she knew she was going to have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a moment or fro . Anything on a large enough scale , even a pest , can be arresting . And how about Upton Sinclair ? " she said . " What do you know about him ? " " He 's a Bolshevik , " Sammy recited . " He 's out to cut up all the big dough in the State so everybody has the same . He wants to shut down the studios and start a revolution . " " Do you know he 's the regular Democratic candidate ? " she said . " What are you trying to give me ? " Sammy said . " Merriam 's running for the Democrats and Republicans both . Sinclair 's running for the Communists . " " This time , " she said , " you 've been learning your politics on the wrong corner . Sinclair got the heaviest vote in the history of the Democratic primaries . The regular party machine is behind him . And the Communists are running their own candidate . " Sammy looked at her as if she were crazy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I know is either you plunk for Merriam around here or you 're a dead pigeon . " That was where the smooth pavement on Kit 's patience ended . " Goddam it , " she yelled , " comes the revolution I only want one favor of Comrade Sinclair  --  to line you up against a wall and shoot you myself  --  and if you do n't get out of my office by the time I count up to one , I wo n't even wait for the revolution ! " She told it vividly and I could see it happening : Kid Get-Ahead being dropped right down in the middle of Hollywood 's most violent controversy , taking a couple of turns in the air and landing100 BUDD SCHULBERGp100on his feet , with all the instinct for self-preservation of a scrappy kitten . " I really lost my temper , " she said . " You 'd have thought that would have been the end of it . " " Oh , no , " I said . " Not me . Sammy 's built too much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster he comes back . " " I 've never seen anything like it , " she said . " Two hours later he was trying to get me to have lunch with him . That afternoon he called me on the phone about the Merriam business again . I hung up on him and he called me right back and said we were cut off . Finally , I went to Sidney Fineman , who was my producer then , and told him I was n't being paid to vote for Merriam but to turn in the best script I could . And that a leech across the hall that called itself Sammy Glick was pestering me so much about my day 's pay to save the industry that he was ruining the chances of one of its pictures to show a profit . Sidney was sympathetic . He made it pretty clear that he wished he could resist the pressure himself . " Of course , I felt a little guilty about snitching on my neighbor that way . Even a neighbor like Mr. Glick . But the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only from ear to ear but all the way round the back of his neck . " " Thanks , baby , for the plug you put in for me . " All she could do was look and sound bewildered . " You musta told some of the top guys I was after your dough for Merriam . That 's what I need . That gets ' em talking about me , see . Hell , every punk on the lot has laid it on the line for Merriam , so that adds up to nothing . But this way they all hear about it . Next time they hear the name Sammy Glick it rings a bell in their brains . " " I 'll bet he was wetting his pants he was so scared his name might never ring those bells , " I said . " I doubt it , " she said . " I do n't think Sammy knows how to bep101afraid . He 'll probably learn it out here , because this place is full of fear . But when he does I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tomcat I had castrated once . " " Were you afraid ? " " When I was holding out on that Merriam thing ? Of course . Terrified . All my heroics were strictly on the surface . Maybe that 's where heroics always are . " " And was Sammy right  --  about your being a dead pigeon ? " " No , " she laughed . " They would n't even fire me , thank God . In other words those threats turned out to be a super-colossal bluff . " " That 's a helluva way to start a friendship , " I said . " I thought reline was queer . But yours is absolutely bughouse . " " Maybe friendship is the wrong word , " she said . " I used to wonder why I kept seeing him after the Merriam affair blew over . I think it was the sense of excitement I seemed to feel around him . I do n't know , he does something to the air you breathe , intensifies it . Have n't you felt it ? Know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held too long . Makes you want to scream . " " I did n't know you ever let anything get you like that , " I said . It was spoken with an irritation that made her smile . " It bothers you . " There was that disconcerting habit of stating unnecessary questions as facts . I had n't realized how much it bothered me until I began to talk about it . " Everything about you and Sammy bothers me . That night I left you at Sammy 's , for instance . That bothered the hell out of me . " We looked at each other until we were n't acquaintances any more . After the pause , she did n't change the subject , only the direction of it . " I 'm sorry for him . " " Sorry for him ! Sorry for Sammy Glick ? " " I have a crazy theory about that , " she said . " You know the cripple who peddles papers outside the Derby ? We 're sorry for him because a germ he did n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shape . Maybe we ought to feel the same way about guys with twisted egos . " " But the kid with the papers is helpless . " " So is Sammy , " she said . " In his own way . Ever have him tell you anything about his childhood ? " Her Sammy Glick was a new conception and I paused to see what I could do with it . " Try to think of it this way , " she instructed . " There was an epidemic raging in that neighborhood of his  --  more contagious than polio  --  and he caught one of the worst cases on record . " There was just time enough to file the idea for further reference , for Sammy was coming down the stairs , making a triumphalentrance with Sidney Fineman . Sammy lingered to shake hands around the first table . You could tell from the faces that he was being congratulated . By some inexplicable telepathy , news of his success had preceded him . It seemed to me to he black magic , for the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had Kit stopped too . She said that one of the things which distinguished the old Brown Derby on Wilshire was the way guests at one end of the room could hear distinctly every word being said at the other , because of the trick acoustics of the dome-shaped ceiling . And that it always seemed as if all Hollywood must be covered by one of those Derby ceilings . Fineman and his party found a table and Sammy continued his victory march down the aisle until he reached us . From the moment he sat down , the conversation continued to be about Sammy Glick , but in a different key . It was Variation on an Old Theme by Click , allegro con spirito . It would have been deadly if Sammy had n't been hopped up with success . He sprayed us with words like a verbal machine gun . He described every detail of the evening just as if we had n't been there at all . " I 'm over the hump , " he said . " From now on I can write my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move in yet . Why not wait till it 's held over a third week at the Music Hall and starts to cleanp103up in the sticks ? By that time I 'll be able to spit in the boss 's eye ml make him like it . " I had never seen him so wound-up before . He seemed to havememorized every word of praise he had received all evening . Hetoldus how the cutter had said that even though the picture raneighty-five hundred feet it moved so fast it could stand thatCage . And what the theater manager had said . He went onta1king about Sammy Glick with such flaming enthusiasm that sop me God I could feel the excitement beginning to catch inThe effect was hypnotic , like hearing a record over and over again : So I told Fineman ... I 'm in a terrific spot . . . My picture I said ... I ... He talked at you with so much force it was hard to eat . You kit he was sticking his face right into your plate and the words into your mouth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how Sammy was learning to talk , leaning against you , never letting up , swarming all over you as he forced you back and back . I watched for an opening and when Sammy had his mouth full of his last bite of steak sandwich I made a motion that we adjourn . " I hafta wait for the reviews , " Sammy said . " They mean a helluva lot . " Hurrying importantly down the stairs was a beefy middle-aged mall whose clothes were dapper , if not his body . Nine-tenths of is silk handkerchief was hanging out of his breast pocket . Hises seemed too small for his large face , and too close together. c looked like a confidence man , but a confidence man who had risen to the position of employer of other con men . I noticed that Kit and Sammy stopped talking to watch him , that people at other tables were doing the same thing . Kit kept her eyes on him as he entered the room . " You can stop worrying about that review , Sammy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus , " Sammy said . " I got ta read it . " The note of anxiety that had been there before the preview was back again . He was off to Fineman 's table on the double-quick.  | I was mystified . " I 've heard about portable telephones in here , " I said . " But when you start getting wireless messages ... " " This is like every other spiritualist trick , " Kit said . " Very impressive until you go behind the scenes . " " Let 's go , " I said . She led me off on a little verbal tour through Darkest Hollywood . " All I had to do was watch the guy who just came in . Gabby Hanigan , who runs the Megaphone . " " What do you mean , watch him ? Who 're you , the girl with the X-ray eye ? " " All it takes is practice , " she said . " I 've been watching Hanigan come in after previews this way for years . When he 's written a rave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs . But you can always tell when he 's thrown the hook into you because then he just gives it this . . . " Her hand made two quick fluttery motions and stopped . " So this time it looks in the bag . Gabby was waving to Fineman like a Boy Scout the moment he came into sight . " She was right . Sammy came trotting back with a proof copy of the review . He rolled it out on the table for us with a flourish . " Read that , " he said crisply , and he shook his head as if further expression failed him . " Tuhriffic . " It was . You could almost hear the headline screaming : " GIRL " CINCH B.O. SMASH . Kit began to read it out loud , with an ironic inflection which Sammy was too intoxicated to appreciate . It read like a press-agent blurb . It drooled over Fineman 's showmanship , the acting , the directing , the photography . It did n't say anything about them except that they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . He was hailed as a brilliant addition to the ranks of Hollywood writers . The reviewer seemed especially impressed with his craftsmanship and originality . " Sammy , " I said , " tell me the truth . Is Gabby Hanigan your father ? " " Father , hell , " he said . " That plug is going to set me back two hundred smackers. " p 105I said I had n't realized the Megaphone was that kind of sheet . mentioned the word bribe . " What do you mean bribe ? " Sammy said . " They just came in couple of days ago trying to sell me a full page ad and when I Id them I 'd think it over and let them know after I read the view , they said not to lose any sleep over it . " " I beg your pardon , " I said . " I did n't mean to jump at conclusio-ns . " I was mystified again . And with good reason . How could puny get so upset about a review that was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my favorite Hollywood foible , " it said . " I do n't know how many times I 've sat in this very room with producers who were absolutely sweating blood to read a view they had already made sure of . And not only that , but gloat er it like children when it finally arrived . " I said I could n't believe it . But Sammy could . " That 's not so Crazy as it sounds , " he explained . " This Hanigan guy is nobody 's fool . I hear he likes to cross you up once in a while , just to keep you guessing . " " Why the hell does Hollywood let him get away with it ? " I said . " Because there are still too many people out here more interested in boosting their own stock than in making pictures , " Kit said . " As long as they 're around we 'll have our Hanigans and our canned reviews instead of the real , slugging criticism that might do some good . " Sammy was signing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he id . " Reform the industry tomorrow . Tonight we celebrate . " The Triangle Club was n't Monte Carlo , but it was the best I lollywood could do . You had the old thrill of being stared at through a peephole and feeling privileged as the door swung open . ' I'liis was partly for the effect , partly because gambling was illegal in Los Angeles and they had to slip the city machine something for protection . It was the place the top producers liked after working their guts out until midnight , hoping to slow down withp106champagne cocktails , five-dollar steaks and a couple of grand tossed away at roulette before trying to catch up with a little sleep that was as restful as a Vorkapich montage . They knew Sammy here too . More people were stepping up to grab his hand . They all seemed to know he had a hit . That was the Hollywood grapevine clicking again , the thing about it that impressed me most  --  a gigantic industry involving thousands of people situated in a boom town with a village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carpet , the mirrored bar , and all the rest of the trappings , and you would have the village beer joint . For hardly anywhere else could Sammy have become so quickly known or his exploits so discussed . I do n't remember much about that night except that Sammy kept buying us champagne and blew five hundred bucks at the crap table ( and told everyone it was a thousand ) and Kit tried to explain that it was n't really a loss because a guy called Veblen said we make our reputations by how much money we can publicly throw away , and I tried to get her to come home with me which even surprised me and made me realize how much champagne Sammy must have bought , and I lost my week 's salary at blackjack which is strictly a sucker 's game , and I began seeing Sammy 's face exploding around me like a pinwheel , and when I asked myself What makes Sammy run ? a woman 's voice answered How many times are you going to ask me that ? and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think we 've met , " and the answer came , " Of course we have , you 've been to my house for dinner , " and even then she had to repeat it several times before I could realize that the woman in my arms was Mrs. Henry Powell Turner and that somehow the Triangle Club had disappeared and the walls that were spinning around belonged to my room at the Villa Espana.  |p107Fifteen  minutes early , Julian 's hesitating voice trembled up to me from the reception room . I hated to keep him waiting because I know how it is when you 're down ; the most trivial slight becomes persecution . But I did n't want to leave too soon in case my producer called . Writers usually cover up for each other , but I could n't trust that bitchy streak in Pancake . When I went downstairs I found Julian looking even more miserable than the night before . " It 's awfully nice of you . . . " he began . " Let 's see , " I said , " where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list automatically . " Like Chinese food ? " Anything , he would eat anything.  | " Good , " I said , " there 's a pretty good little Chinese place around the corner . " A Chinese joint is usually a good place to talk , because it 's almost always empty and the waiter is so busy reading his language paper in the back that he barely has time to drop his plates and run . It 's easier to talk around waiters who seem more interested in something they ca n't wait to get back to . I ordered egg foo yong and cold pork and Julian thought a while and decided he would have the same and I yelled after the waiter to throw in a bottle of sake . Then I waited for Julian to begin . He leaned forward uncomfortably , nervously cracking his knuckles . " Do n't crack your knuckles , " I said . " It 's bad for your hands . " He dropped his hands into his lap in embarrassment . " I know , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blanche ? " I said . " Oh , gee , I 'm awfully sorry to bother you about all this , Mr. Manheim , " Julian said . " But that 's what I wanted to talk to you about . Blanche is my wife . And she 's going to leave me . " I had n't even known he was married . Why do poor little nebs like Julian always have to be the first ones married ? " We 've been married three years , " he said . " Blanche and I were engaged all through high school . We 've always been crazy about each other . And now ... " His voice trailed off like a distant radio station fading and I had to wait for it to come back again . " Now she says she 's going back to New York . " I was sorry , very . But I was sorry about so many things I could n't do anything about . " But you could , " he said . " If you could only talk to Mr. Glick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're a good friend of his . " Please , Julian , I thought . When you say that , smile . But that would have been asking too much of him at the moment . It struck me that Julian and Sammy must have been just about the same age , twenty-two or - three , probably brought up i11 the same kind of Jewish family , same neighborhood , same school/ing , and started out with practically the same job . And yet they could n't have been more different if one had been born an Eskimo and the other the Prince of Wales . And there were so many Julian Blumbergs in the world . Jews without money , without push , withoutplots , without any of the characteristics which such experts on genetics as Adolf Hitler , Henry Ford and Father Coughlin try to tell us are racial traits . I have seen too many of their lonely , frightened faces packed together in subways or staring out of thousands of dingy rooms as my train hurled past them on the elevated from 125th Street into Grand Central @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and everyday little guys to consider the fascist answer to What Makes Sammy Run ? And yet , if the same background that produced a Sammy Glick could nurture a Julian Blumberg , it was n't an open-and-shut case of environment either . I filed a mental note to mull over Kit 's idea again , that Sammy 's childhood environment was the breeding ground for the predatory germ that thrived in Sammy 's blood , leaving him with one of the most severe cases of the epidemic . " Sammy Glick ! " I said . " You do n't mean to tell me that your wife and Sammy . . . ? " " Oh , no , " he said . " I do n't mean that . But I swear to God , Mr. Manheim , even that would n't be as bad . It is n't my wife that ( : lick 's stolen  --  it 's my  --  my whole life . " I wished his eyes could have been angry , but they were n't . They only cried . " Wait a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the credit for that story , I 'm with you . But I do n't see what I can do about it , Julian . " " Oh , that is n't it , " he said . " That story does n't matter , Mr. Manheim . " " My name 's Al , " I said . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " But that was just the beginning . Jesus , if I could only have my job in the ad department back and go on writing my novel at night . I ca n't even write any more , Mr. Manheim . Honest to Christ , if I had a little more guts I 'd throw myself off that bridge in Pasadena . "  |p110His  voice threatened to get away from him . " Hold it , " I said . " You better eat that while it 's hot . There 's nothing lousier than cold Chinese food . " Then begin at the beginning . Take your time . And telling inc how upset you are wo n't do either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the facts . " I poured the sake and he wet his lips with it . When he began again he dropped his voice to a flat monotone to keep it steady . It seems that Rosalie Goldbaum was n't the only one waiting for a letter when Sammy went west . Sammy was supposed to lay the groundwork for Julian and let him know the moment he found an opening . So Julian kept his little job in the ad department , waiting for Der Tag . But the only news of Sammy he ever had was via Parsons ' column . Finally , Blanche made him sit down and write a letter . It was long , plaintive and unanswered . One night he came home from his job to find Blanche packing . For the vacation in the Catskills she had been wanting ? No , to California , to Hollywood . " But Blanche ! " he said . " We haven ' t heard from Sammy Glick . How can we go to Hollywood ? " Blanche was short and lean , toughened in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sit down and eat your dinner before it gets cold , Julie , " she said . " We 're going to California in the secondhand car I bought with part of the story money this afternoon . We 're going to pay a little visit to that friend Glick you were all the time telling me was doing so much for you . " " Blanche , you sound mad . Do n't be mad at me , " he said . " Oh , do n't be silly , I love you , " she said furiously . " If I did n't love you it would n't get me so sore to see you let a gonif like Glick make a dope out of you when I know you could be a fine writer . Now sit down and eat so you can get through and help me pack . " They had three blowouts , their radiator cracked from overheating crossing the Continental Divide , Julian drove a hundred miles outp111f their way one night when Blanche fell asleep and when theyarrived in Hollywood Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day for a week , but Sammy was never is They could n't reach him at home because the studio would n't 1111 them where he was living . They frequented places they could n't afford , hoping to run into him . It was n't until their money had dwindled to the margin Blanche had laid aside in case they had to 've East again that Julian managed to get Sammy on the other d of a telephone . Sammy dispensed with the overtures . His voice grated : " Listen , shtunk , for Chri'sake who the hell told you to come out here ? " " But M r . Glick , I thought ... " " The hell you did . If you thought you would have stayed home . id n't I tell you I 'd send for you when the time came ? " " Yes , but I did n't think it would take ... " " Listen , kid , " Sammy 's voice suddenly soft-pedaled . Do n't fink I 'm having any cakewalk . As soon as I get set I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got me going around in circles . " j ( paused , hying to suck Julian in on the laugh . " I guess we 're just couple of kids who did n't know when we were well off , hey , Julian ? " Julian thought of the trip home , of the lousy job , and Blanche . ' Mr. Glick , I told Blanche you would n't give me the runaround. there must be some way you could get me in . Not even as a writer . aybe the story department could use a ... " " Look , do you wan na be smart ? " Sammy told him . " Get the tell out of this lousy town and back to New York . You wo n't have prayer around here until the fall anyway  --  the summer 's always low . . . " Then his voice tensed and quickened . " Listen , pal , hey 're calling me for a conference . I 'll shoot you a wire the first Mme anything looks hot  --  now be a smart guy like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he cut Julian off . I do n't know how he looked when he really hung up that phone but the secondhand version he gave me in the booth of that Chinese restaurant was the closest I ever want to come to it . I ( is pale blue eyes were pink-rimmed and his skin looked too thin to hold his face in . It was not a weak but a sensitive face , which seemed to be characterized by the gentle curve of a delicate nose " For days I did n't even have the nerve to tell Blanche I had talked to him , " Julian said . " I knew what she would say and I felt like a big enough sap already . You know , love is a funny thing , M r . Manheim . There never was anything small or selfish about Blanche , and yet I think things would have been better between us if I could have come home with that writing job . " So he spent three weeks riding the street cars and the buses and trying to get by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusive night club where everyone knew everybody else . Ile learned that Hollywood extended from Warner Brothers at Burbank , in the valley beyond the northern hills , to Metro-Goldwyn Mayer , twenty-five miles southwest in Culver City . He found a new side of Hollywood , the ten-man-for-every-job side , the seasonal unemployment , the call-again-next-month side . The factory side . He learned how many Julian Blumbergs there were , who found nothing but No Admittance signs , for every Sammy Click who opens the lock with a wave of his cigar like a magic wand . It was n't until he had made the rounds of all the major studios and began ringing doorbells on Poverty Row that he had his first nibble . A shoestring producer told him he had bought the stock shots from Hell 's Angels and Wings and needed an airplane story with no more than three principal characters , in as few interiors as possible . He worked all week and when the producer told him he seemed to be on the right track he put in another feverish week , finishing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's secretary ( who was also his entire staff ) asked Julian to leave the manuscript with the assurance that if it were approved he would be hired . Two weeks later it was returned in the mail , with a brief , formal note . An unemployed writer in the hotel put him wise . Julian hadp113fallen for a familiar Poverty Row economy gag . The producer encourages as many as a dozen aspiring writers to work on his idea . They knock themselves out over his story for two or three weeks in return for nothing but the vaguest of promises . Then the producer conies out of it with enough free ideas to nourish the one writer he finally hires . When Julian heard this there was nothing to do but make a full confession to Blanche and throw the suitcase into the back seat again . The drive back took them three days longer than they expected because of a short in the battery and the piston rings ' wearing out . They had the trip budgeted so carefully that they reached Blanche 's parents ' apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can imagine how we felt when we read this telegram , " Julian said . " Mother said it had been waiting there several days . I saved it as a souvenir of my Hollywood career . " his mouth smiled , but nothing happened to his eyes . " It 's turned out to be the only item in my collection . " I le handed me the over-fingered , often-folded telegram . I read it , and then I read it again , and then again . It was like hearing Sammy Glick 's voice in the room . DEAR JULIAN . HERE IS GREATEST BREAK OF YOUR LIFE . HAVE SCREEN-WRITING JOB FOR YOU . ENCLOSING MONEY FOR IMMEDIATE AIRLINE TRIP TO HOLLYWOOD FOR YOU AND WIFE . WIRE COLLECT WHEN I SHOULD MEET YOU AT AIRPORT . YOUR PALSAMMYSo the day the Blumbergs arrived from Hollywood in their broken-downjalopy they were flying back again via TWA . Sammy was waiting at the airport . He threw his arms around Julian like a brother . Five minutes later they were in the car Sammy had hired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with excitement . He thought he was heading straight for the studio.  |p114Twenty  minutes later he found himself in Sammy 's apartment . Sammy was n't losing a moment . He sat Julian down , handed him a script and told him he could start working . Julian began reading obediently , too busy to notice Blanche 's suspicions . What kind of a job was this that kept them from the studio ? she wanted to know . " Lots of writers work at home , " Sammy said . " I told them I thought it would go faster here . And to tell you the truth  --  you are n't exactly on the payroll yet , Julian . " " Oh , " said Julian . " Not exactly ? " said Blanche . " I 'll come clean with you , " Sammy said . " The studio canned the writer who was working with me because they seemed to think l could get along better alone . But I find I have n't got time to knock the script out myself so I thought it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give me a hand . And as soon as you have a couple of scenes under your belt it 'll be a cinch for me to get you a regular job by showing ' em what you can do . Meanwhile you can move in with me and I 'll loan you twenty-five a week to keep you going till you 're on your feet . " It did n't sing like the telegram . But at least it was an in and even Blanche was willing to ride along . Julian rolled up his sleeves without knowing the difference be tween a fade-in and a stand-in . He stayed up all that night reading one screenplay after another , getting the feel of it . By morning he discovered that he was able to find holes in the script that grew out of the bizarre collaboration of S. Henley Forster and Sammy Click . Twenty-four hours after he arrived he was rewriting the first scene and he kept batting out scenes for the rest of the week in eighteenhourstretches . The plan was for him and Sammy to write alternate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the studio that lasted most of the day . But he explained to Julian that he was still carrying the brunt of the work as he was going ahead and laying out the ensuing scenes . In his mind . In the frenzy of those first days Julian began to feel he had been writing scenarios all his life . When Sammy read his work all he saidp115was , " This stuff sounds okay , " but Julian noticed that he did n't waste any time racing off to the studio with it . Blanche and Julian took the day off and discovered Hollywood was a small town on a large scale with simple , modest houses separated by small , neat lawns . It was Julian 's last day before he was to take his place with Sammy at the studio . They rode to the end of carlines , holding hands and giggling like kids . They felt as if they were taking the first deep breath since they arrived . It was fun to remember that this was late winter , with the green trees and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take for this crisp heat to dry up Julian 's sinuses . They even stopped in to ask the rent of one of the cute little stucco bungalows on Orange Grove Avenue . Fifty dollars a month with a small yard of their own and two orange trees , tiny ones but each with a real orange . Sammy was waiting for them when they got home . With a face full of bad news . " Tough luck , kid , " he said . " I 'm afraid your scenes did n't go over like I thought they would . " He let Julian feel just lousy enough before adding : " But I have n't lost faith in you . In fact just to show you where you stand with me I 'm going to throw in ten bucks a week extra with that twenty-five . " That was more money than Julian had ever made before , enough for him and Blanche to take a flat of their own in one of the cheap apartment houses above Hollywood Boulevard . Sammy started calling Julian his secretary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he thought it would be good practice for Julian to go on writing through the script and promised to go over his scenes with him and give him pointers , to help him learn the trade . When the script was finished and Sammy was waiting for his next assignment , Julian did n't like to sit around without writing so he started working on an original called Country Doctor because he thought it would help Sammy plead his case at the studio . He was almost too frightened of Blanche 's beautiful and brutal candor to tell her the story , but she surprised him by saying , Julian , if you were only as smart as you knew how to write ! It does n't matter howp116much money there is in this story as long as you make sure it says  --  By Julian Blumberg . So the big shots will finally find out my pupsie is a writer . " Julian wrote easily , and it was his sort of stuff , simple and human , and he had it finished in a week . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to show to Sammy . He had decided it was n't when Sammy came to him and said , " Say , I read that yarn of yours Blanche showed me . It 's pretty fair  --  got a couple of nice moments . I 'll see what I can do with it . " " Well , " Julian said , " weeks went by and it looked like he 'd forgotten all about my story , so I started helping him with his next screenplay because there did n't seem to be anything better to do . And then one day Blanche happened to be reading through the trade papers and found this : He handed me a ragged little clipping . I was beginning to feel like a district attorney . " Exhibit B , " I said . Sammy was running through the room again as I started to read : " Sammy Glick makes it two in a row as his latest original , Country Doctor ... " and handed the squib back . What a two-scene that must have been , Julian 's stammering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Listen , Julie , do n't be a schlemiel all your life . Everybody thinks I 'm hot at the studio right now . So I saw a chance of smacking them for a bonus that means twice the dough they 'd pay a Julian Blumberg . " He made the name sound like a cussword . " Jesus Christ , what the hell have you got to bitch about when I 'm putting the money in your pocket ? " " But it is n't fair ... " No fair , " Sammy mimicked . " Like they say in sissy schools . No fair ! For Chris'sake , grow up , this is n't kindergarten any more , this is the world . " That was one of the most philosophical observations Sammy ever made.  |p117I  was beginning to feel like a groggy fighter waiting for his manager to toss in the towel and Julian seemed to sense this , for he said , " Well , there is n't a whole lot more to tell , Mr. Manheim ... " My God , more ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be fiction I would have broken in ten minutes ago to tell him his story was hopeless hyperbole . But you could tell Julian Was telling the truth . It 's strange that a writer as gifted as Julian could be so stupid that he was incapable of telling anything butc truth . I believed him because truth is never hard to recognize. othing is ever quite so drab and repetitious and forlorn anddicrous as truth . " I guess you must have thought I was a little shell-shocked when you saw me after the preview last night . Well , maybe I was .  --  cause that picture was the biggest shock in my life , Mr. Manheim . How do you think you 'd feel going in to a movie cold and suddenly starting to realize you 're hearing all your own scenes ? " 011 , God , I thought , I 'm going to explode . Sammy Glick is aline bomb in my brain and it 's going to go off any moment and low me to bits . " The whole picture , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was just doing for practice  --  actually showing on the teen  --  all mine  --  every line , mine  --  you know what I felt like lug , Mr. Manheim ? I felt like jumping up right in the middleml screaming . I wanted to tell everybody there that the only line lick wrote on Girl Steals Boy was the by-line on the cover . I felt like telling all of them that now I know why he had me fly out such a hurry  --  because when he got the other writer bouncedknew he could n't stay on the picture alone  --  he did n't dare . " " Why did n't you ? " I said . " I suppose you'd 've been rushed to the psychopathic ward , but it would have been worth it . " " I just got sick to my stomach , " Julian said . " I mean actually rowing up , in the men 's room . And when I came out Blanche de inc talk to Sammy right away . I 've seen Blanche mad , but vc never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better wait and see Sammy in the morning . But she said either I saw him right then and there  --  or she 'd go home and move out . You see , Blanche is a funny kid , Mr. Manheim . To look at her you would n't think she was anything but a nice , frail little Jewish girl . But ... " " So you did have a talk with Sammy last night ? " I said . " I caught him for a moment in the lobby on his way out , " Julian said sadly . " Sammy , you 've got to listen to me ! How could you do this to me , Sammy ? Telling me they did n't like my scenes when they used ... " Sammy looked around the lobby coldly , saw the little group nearby surrounding Sidney Fineman . " I do n't want to discuss it here . " " But Sammy , I ca n't go on this way . Blanche ... " " I said shut up . " Then he looked up and added , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed it . " Julian looked around . A gray-haired gentleman with a smiling pink face was joining them . He slipped his arm around Sammy with fatherly affection . " Looks like we have a hit , son , " he said . " And everybody 's talking about the writing . " " Thank you , Mr. Fineman . Julian , I do n't suppose I have to tell you who this is  --  Sidney Fineman ? " " I 'm very glad to meet you , " said Julian . " How do you do , " said Fineman . Julian felt he was being cordial and oblivious to him at the same time . " How did you like the picture ? " It was hardly a question the way Fineman put it , more like the perfunctory How-are-you in passing an acquaintance on the street . And it demanded the same kind of " Fine-thanks " answer , There was a pause . Julian was hesitating . Wondering if Blanche was watching him . Repeating to himself what he knew he ought to say . Fineman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bully in the classroom whose eyes say " See you after school . " " Very much , " Julian said.  | " Fine , " said Fineman . " There are a couple of things I want to talk over with you , Sammy . Will you excuse us ? " And Julian was left standing there alone in the lobby , not knowing what to do until he spotted Sammy 's friend , Al Manheim , in the crowd . Even then he might not have introduced himself if Blanche had n't insisted that he go over and try to tell him the whole story . " And God knows you have , " I said . " So what are all the fireworksbetween you and the Missus ? " " That 's the part I have n't told you , " he said . " The part that 's just happened . " " Oi vay ! " I said . " You see , Sammy was over to see me at half past eight this morning . " Now I remembered another morning that Sammy had been up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep an appointment with Julian  --  leaving me behind in his apartment to dwell on my biliousness and his sudden interest in Julian 's welfare . " He was awfully friendly . He said he was still convinced our destinies lay together and was willing to raise me to fifty a week to convince me . He said he had just sold Mr. Collier a story called Monsoon without having anything down on paper . But he had to have something written by the time he saw him again , and he thought we might knock it out together over the weekend . And , oh yes , he told me that there are plenty of ghost writers in this town who make more dough than lots of pretty well-known B writers . Well , I was n't wild about the idea , but fifty bucks is fifty bucks , so he made me promise I 'd call at his office at three o'clock this afternoon and give him my answer . Then I told Blanche . She went nuts . I told her with fifty bucks a week we could rent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have heard her . " " To hell with the cottage ! Maybe it would help pay the rent if I walked the streets too . That 's what that great pal of yours wantsp120you to do . Only worse . I 'm beginning to feel I 'm living with a ghost Look at you , you 're even beginning to look like one , so pale , and losing weight and stammering worse than ever . It 's this lousy job . You want to go through more nights like last night ? You think it 's worth fifty dollars a week to vomit your supper in the toilet ? " Next time I wo n't get so upset , " Julian said . " Now I know how I stand . I 'm a ghost writer , and meanwhile ... " " Meanwhile , " Blanche said in a voice that gave Julian the shiv vers , " if you let him shmeikle you into this , I 'll be in New York . I 'll catch the bus tonight . " The waiter came to take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " I 'm not hungry , " he said . " I ca n't eat . " Then I realized that I had hardly eaten anything either . " Will you help me , " he said , " Al ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " All I know is that I 'm going to try . " " I thought because he was a friend of yours , " he started to say . " Here 's a nickel , " I said . " Get Blanche on the phone . Tell her she was right . Tell her that whatever happens you two are sticking together . And tell her that somebody who 's never met her but knows her awfully well sends his love . " Then I called Pancake , whom I had n't been able to clip from behind in spite of Sammy 's coaching , and told him I would be unavoidably detained from the studio this afternoon . I realized this meant giving him a free-kick at my posterior , but if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with something on the ball , you begin to wonder just what the hell you think you 're working your ass off for . And other questions equally searching . The receptionist 's pencil poised over the pad of studio passes . " Mr. Glick . Who shall I say is calling ? " Since Sammy was waiting for Julian the chances are he 'd only brush me off . I did n't like to do it , but I had to figure what Sammy would have done if he were in my spot. p 121 " Mr. Blumberg , " I said . I walked down the corridor to his door , slowing up as I reached because I was scared . Here I was going out of my way to do something I hated more than anything else in the world . Avoiding controversies has always been an obsession with me . The only es I could digest were when I was liking everybody around me. ill you please tell me why you had to get yourself into this ? I night . Who the hell do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't so far off at that . As I stood there turningknob I knew that my best excuse for knowing Sammy Glick s as a kind of sell-appointed first-aid station , trying to revive the victims he left behind him as he kept hitting-and-running his way the top . When I walked in on him he gave me a hollow " Hello-Al , " looked around for Julian , questioned me with his eyes , and caught on . " Your collaborator is n't coming , " I said . " He 's on his way over to sec his wife . To tell her she does n't have to leave him . Because you 're going to promise that the next picture he writes he not only arts paid for but gets his name on . " Sammy had looked at me in a lot of interesting ways since that first meeting , but I had never seen anything like this before . I have never had a gangster pass death sentence on me with his eyes , but now I know what it is to see not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracting and ossifying till they looked as if they could be plucked out and fired through a shotgun . " Are n't you satisfied just being a Boy Scout ? Whatta you wan na do , get your Eagle Badge too ? " The Sammy Glick I met when I first came to Hollywood was a cream puff compared to the one with whom I now found myself caged . He was still in his early twenties but no sign of youth remained . The little knives of ambition had already begun to cut lilies into his face and the way he hunched over his cigar somehow suggested middle age.  | " Sammy , " I said , " at the rate you 're going you 'll die of old age before you 're thirty . " He planted himself so close to me that I instinctively backed away . His voice spat in my face . " Listen , you son of a rabbi . When I want sermons I do n't have to listen to amateurs . I can buy tickets for the big shots in the racket  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could think of to break him down , flattery , nostalgia , the brotherhood of man , the camaraderie of the newspapergame and even , as a last resort , the need of Jews to help each other in self-defense . " Do n't pull that Jewish crapola on me , " Sammy said . " What the hell did the Jews ever do for me ?  --  except maybe get my head cracked open for me when I was a kid . " What makes Sammy run ? The childhood , Kit had said , look into the childhood . Sammy took his eyes from me only for a moment , but it brought relief . He looked past me , almost thoughtfully , as thoughtful as a man rushing through life like Sammy could ever be . " Jews , " he said bitterly and absently . " Jews , " he said , like a storm trooper . That was all he said but I knew it was much more than that . I knew he was speaking his hate and his fear and his rage of anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paced around me impatiently . " Let me tell you something for your own good , " he said . " Wan na know why you 're a flop out here ? Because you pay too goddam much attention to other people'sbusiness . When I was a kid I felt kind of gypped because I could n't go to college and make the basketball team . I was a helluva basketball player once . But when I look at you I think maybe it 's a good thing I did n't get my mind all cluttered up with crap at that . I may not know a lot of cushy words , but , by Jesus , I know about life . Take Darwin , for instance . I did n't have to read any books to know all about the survival of the fittest . " I felt lousy . We were in the same room all right but we could n't seem to connect . I knew I was making a mess of it , that all I wasp123doing was convincing him that I was a lunatic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that he was going out of is way to be kind to me . And I suppose he was , according to hislights , those crazy blinding lights of his . " What do you mean fittest ? " I said . " Who 's more fit to write screenplays , you or Julian ? " His hand tightened around his cigar the way his voice did ground his words . " Listen , pal , you 'll be doing yourself a big favor if you get out of here . Because I 'm liable to be in a position to do you some good one of these days . And when I am I do n't want to have to remember what a jerk you 're making outa yourself . " " I do n't leave this office until Julian 's taken care of , " I said . The statement was not as heroic as it sounded because it was n't given quite enough voice . It was n't fear that stifled me , but a terrible sense of inadequacy . That was something Sammy never had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even when everyone else washe used his voice as if he were yelling down a crowd . " You can tell Julian for me , " he said , " that if he do n't like the fifty bucks he can crap in his hat , pull it over his head and call it curls . " That phrase has its ghost writer too , I thought , for it was a folk cry of the New York gutters I had heard before . But Sammy spoke it with a terrifying eloquence . I said all the four- , five- and seven-letter words I could think of , most of them outside in the corridor , after the door had slammed behind me . I stood there trying to begin thinking what to do next . I ( lout know whether I thought first of Kit and then saw her name on the opposite door or vice versa . Like most inspirations , the impulse probably followed the stimulus so rapidly that it seemed to be snatched from the sky . I do n't know why I had n't thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as tough as Sammy in her owns way . I had to admit that the characteristics that had made Inc hesitate about her were the ones that might do Julian the mostgood.  |p124The  secretary told me she was very sorry , but Miss Sargent left word for her to admit no one this afternoon , not even to put calls through . I said this was an emergency and must have made it pretty strong for the secretary asked , " Is it a matter of life or death ? " " Both , " I said . This seemed to bewilder her sufficiently to stir her to action . A moment later the door to the inner office swung open and Kit appeared , dressed in tailored slacks , with a pencil stuck in her hair and no makeup . " Sorry to pull the big-shot stuff on you . But all you have to do to start a salon around here is leave your door open . " We shook hands and she signaled me into the office . It was full of smoke and an atmosphere of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with typewritten notes , sat a stenographer still writing in her shorthand pad . " While we 're talking it might not be a bad idea to start typing up that last scene , Ellen , " Kit told the stenog . " Be ready for you again in fifteen minutes . " She led me to the couch and told me to sit down . " Do n't mind my standing up , " she said . " I 've been pacing up and down this office so much all day I ca n't stop . I feel like Charlie Chaplin still going through the motions after he leaves that factoryin Modern Times . " She demonstrated his nervous reflex-action gag . I asked her what she was working on . " On something really respectable for a change , " she said . " Young Tom Jefferson . You know Tom has always been my secret passion . I 've been after them to make a Jefferson picture since the day I checked in here  --  but they were always afraid of it for the British market . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Howard to play the part . So it looks as if it 's going through  --  if I can only hammer out the goddam story line . " She glanced at her watch , and her tone changed . " But this is n't what you came in to talk about , " she said , " so I better give you the floor . Because I really will have to run you It of here in fifteen minutes . " She paced while I talked . I was watching to see if the revelation lull shock her , but her only comment when I finished was , " I 've en wondering who was doing Sammy 's stuff . That Blumberg kid xlks sad enough to be a real humorist . " " I 've just been in talking to Sammy , " I said . " No dice . " " I 'm afraid you 're too nice a guy to do much good in this world , " she said . " It takes a cold bitch like me to get anywhere with him . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know you would n't , " she said , " you 'd only think it . " She perched on the couch beside me for a moment . " You 're not the iceberg you 'd like to have us think you are , " I said . She smiled at me as if she was going to laugh and then rememberedshe did n't have time . " How much time have I got to make ail honest man of Mr. Blumberg ? " " Blanche is about to give him up as a lost cause any moment , " I said . " Could you get to Sammy this afternoon ? " " Sorry , " she said . " I make it a rule never to let anything cutInto my work . I do n't even take calls from the Guild office . Theonly way to get ahead in this business is to do one thing at a time . " " Sounds a little like Sammy , " I said . " A little bit of Glick would be a good thing in all of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled . " I know , a very little bit . " " I could call you at home tomorrow , " I said . " Want to give meyour number ? " " That 's not time enough , " she said . " You 've given me a tough assignment . Tell Blanche to cool off and hang on . I 'll give you a ring when it 's under control . " She saw me to the door without any last-moment embarrassments , told Ellen she was ready for her and shook hands with me again . " So long , Al , " she said . " Sorry I have to rush you off this way . Do n't let Julian 's worries throw you . "  |p126When  I looked back her door was closed and her swift , lowpitchedvoice was already beginning to dictate again . I helped Julian talk Blanche into unpacking her bags and then I returned to the wars with Pancake . Kit did n't call me for ten days . But when she finally did she said : " Tell that bashful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning , ready to take off his coat , hang his inhibitions behind the door and go to work . " " What did you have to do , promise to marry him ? " " You know better than that , " she said . " Sammy is only infatuatedwith me and respects me . Marriage is one of the trump cards he has to hold until the pot is big enough . " " And Julian actually has a real job ? " I said . " And gets paid real money ? And does n't do his writing as if in training for the Germanunderground ? " " One hundred dollars a week , " she said . " No contract , just week to week , but that does n't matter as long as he 's teamed with Sammy . Sammy 's option was lifted for another year and I have a hunch he wo n't let Julian stray very far from him . " " A hundred bucks a week ! " I said . " That is n't hay . Even if Sammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If the ratio of talent to bombast is only one to four , " she said , " talent is coming up in the world . " " I guess you 're right , " I said . " We should be thankful for small miracles . Like having a credit line read  --  by Sammy Glick and Julian Blumberg . How the hell did you swing it ? " " The Guild 's supposed to protect writers from unfair practices , " she said . " Not only from employers  --  but from other writers . " " A very pretty sentiment , " I said . " But since when was Sammy a sucker for sentiment ? " " From the moment I promised him Julian would get up and tell all at the next membership meeting . One of the planks in our Code is to stamp out ghost writing . Ghosting is the writers ' Fate Worse Than Death . "  |p127But  the Guild is n't recognized , is it ? " I said . " You have n't any power . So what good will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of half a dozen studios and half a dozen restaurants , " she said . " And as you probably know , writers are talkative fellows . And when six hundred writers start saying the Lone thing ... " " I see , " I said . " So did Sammy , " she said . I said it seemed odd for her to put the screws on Sammy that way after the compassion she was expressing for him just the week before . " That 's like saying because we know the cause of a disease andfeel sorry for its victim , we should n't quarantine him , " she said . I thought : I was the one who felt sorrier for Julian . And Kit wasthe one who did him some good . " Okay , " I said , " I 'll cry uncle . " " Not until you join the Guild , " she said . " After all , you 've had a practical demonstration in your own home . " " I have n't got anything against the Guild , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm an individualist . " " So is Al Smith , " she said , " and he belongs to everything from the Grand Street Boys to the Liberty League . " " Pancake tells me that screen writers should n't have a Guild because they are n't employees . " " He did n't happen to say what they were ? " she said . " Artists , " I said . " Tell that to the producers , " she laughed . " When am I going to see you ? " I said . " I 'll give you a ring before the next Guild meeting , " she said . " Maybe we can all go together . " " Jesus , " I said , " I seem to meet nothing but B-girls out here . " She laughed . " I guess we 're all B-girls for something . " " Well , thanks a helluva lot for going to bat for the kid , " I said . " It was damn nice of you . " " Forget it , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel a little foolish and a little peeved . " The Guild is always at your service . See you , Al . " As soon as she hung up , I dialed Julian 's apartment to break the news . " Hello , Julian ? " I said . " Hello , sweetheart  --  come on over and drink to the future of a writing team that 's going to make Hecht and MacArthur look like a couple of office boys . " " What the hell are you doing there ? " " I just came over to tell Julie I 've decided to give him a break , " Sammy said . " From now on he 's going to be my collaborator . You ought to see him , he 's tickled to death . " " You better get a grip on yourself , " I said . " One of these days that generosity is just going to run away with you . " After I told them I was too busy to join their party ( Sammy was blowing them to a spread at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beanery , listened to a once-famous vaudeville team who were singing once-famous songs for tips and tried to drown my reaction to Sammy 's most recent philanthropy in Barney 's onion soup.  |p129Sammy  had little chance of disturbing my dreams those next few months , for the studio was having one of its periodic drives to cut overhead  --  which seemed to mean shaving stenographers ' wages first and gradually working their way up to firing small-fry writers like me  --  so I had been working like a bastard trying to hang on . The Megaphone had labeled my first effort Fair Meller , and even though I had refused to take an ad , that seemed to be giving it the benefit of the doubt . The situation was so tense that I got the jitters every time an inter-office memo arrived , for fear of being informed that I was no longer employed . Kit would call me two or three times a month , but that was nothing to gloat over , since all it was ever about was her goddamp130Guild . I was still carrying the membership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise out of her when I told her that I liked a lot of people , but I liked them one at a time , not all bunched together . I finally went , of course . For almost five hours I sat with three or four hundred others in a badly ventilated gymnasium listening to speeches without even the consolation of sitting with Kit be cause she had to be up on the platform . I felt that if the Guild had a place in Hollywood it had yet to discover what it was . Time low-paid writers wanted the Guild to be a real bread-and-butter union , and the congenial **26;6832;TOOLONG guys thought what writers needed most was a communal hangout like the old Writers ' Club where they could sit around and get to know each other . The **33;6860;TOOLONG writers with famous names seemed to be most interested in increasing their influence in picture productions and spoke fine , brave abstract words about the scope of the medium and dignifying the position of the screen writer . The meeting seemed a little too much like a caterpillar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Kit called again about six weeks later I said , " Do n't tell me , let me guess ; another meeting ? " She said , " The Guild situation is getting hot . Some of the boys are beginning to criticize it because it 's too much like a union  --  and some because it 's not enough . " I told her I did n't feel like a meeting tonight and she said to meet her at Musso 's on the Boulevard at seven , so we could get there around eight-thirty . Kit had left word for Sammy to meet us for dinner , but as we were sitting down the headwaiter gave us the message that he was tied up with Franklin Collier in a Monsoonconference . " How 's he getting along ? " I said . " There has n't been anything like it since the rise of Irving Thalberg , " she said . " But he 's been very unhappy . " " You 're breaking my heart , " I said . " He and Julian could go on being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I suppose if he saved his dough he could retirep131ire he was thirty . But that is n't enough for him . He ca n't stop M. Being bracketed with Julian is driving him crazy . " " Where 's it going to end , Kit ? " " That 's his cross , " she said . " Always thinking satisfaction is just mild the bend . Not so different from the whippet with his chanical rabbit . " " That 's good , " I said . " I want to remember that . " " A whippet , " she said . " That 's what he 's always reminded me , from that first moment he came in to put the bee on me for Merriam. " ' flat 's funny , " I said , " I always thought of him as an animal my a ferret . " " I wonder if that 's the difference between the male and the finale reaction ? " she said lightly . " You think more like a man than any woman I 've ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think that 's a compliment , you 're crazy , " she said . Every time a man discovers that a woman thinks , the only waycan explain it is that she happens to have a male mind . You just do n't know me , Al . I 'm feminine as all hell . " " It looks as if the only way I 'll ever know you , " I said , " is for the Guild to hold meetings every night . " " ' That reminds me , " she said . " We ought to be on our way . " I tried to grab the check but she was too fast for me . I told herI did n't like the idea of having a woman take me to dinner , my defense of the old-fashioned ways only seemed to amuse her . " Why should you pay it ? " she said . " I asked you , did n't I ? " The meeting had a tenseness , which could be felt in the hall like sir pressure , as the president began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fight for recognition and the logical step of joining the Authors ' League of America . Until that moment the Guilders had kidded themselves into thinking that they were one big happy family . But the president had hardly finished when angry gentlemen were screaming to bep132heard . Their anger seemed almost inexplicable to me . You would have thought that the president had recommended joining the Communist International , instead of the conservative Authors ' League . We must remain a purely Hollywood organization , they yelled . We must not fall under the domination of outside forces We do n't want to slip into the clutches of Eastern racketeers and Reds . One of the loudest attacks on the Authors ' League plan wits made by a man with a paunchy body and a paunchy face I recognized Harold Godfrey Wilson , whom Sammy had pointed out to me that first day at the Vendome . As far as I could remember , all that the president had suggested was that the Guild look into the question of what kind of assistance it could obtain from the Authors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr Wilson apoplectic . He began by telling the story of his life , low he had come to Hollywood in the early twenties , working as an extra , then as a gag man , gradually fighting his way up to become one of the most important writers in the industry , and now , by God , no bunch of Broadway snobs , who thought they were tool good for Hollywood , was going to sit around the Algonquin and tell him what to do . I did n't have a chance to hear much of Kit 's rebuttal because that was just about the time Sammy came in . He was wearing a wrap-around camel's-hair coat with a yellow scarf . He stood there in the doorway a moment and then he picked me out on the aisle and took the seat I had been saving for him . The chair in front of him was empty and he turned it around and stuck his feet up on it . I could n't help noticing the shoes . They were new again . A style I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You ought a get yourself some of these , Al , " he said . " Crowwells . You ca n't buy them out here , but if you give them your measurements they 'll send them to you from New York . I 've got a standing order for a couple of pair a year . " I just pointed toward Kit on the platform . " As long as the Guild is a democratic organization , " she was saying , " there are n't anyp133rerences we ca n't take in our stride . And we can go on being democratic organization just as long as we all stick together ; ' t let anybody scare us and hammer out our program right here the floor . " She seemed to have caught the mood of the membership beuseher plea for unity got the best hand of the night . " Looks like Kit is our Joan of Arc , " I said . Sammy looked around at his fellow members with very little e . " Sure , " he said , " she knows how to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a bunch of sheep . Throw one good scare to them and they 'll run out of this place so fast you 'll think it 's fire . " " With a pair of Cromwell shoes in the lead , " I said . Up p till that moment , though I had to admire what Kit was trying to do , and though I thought unions were a good thing in general , I did n't see much need or much chance for a screen writer 's ' organization . But now I was defending it . I suppose if Sammy had expressed a preference for Heaven , I would have ' inched into a defense of Hell. u. clay I was laid off at the studio I felt so low I decided I had we Kit . Whoever answered her phone told me I could reach  --  r at Mr. Glick 's , and when Sammy 's Jap informed me that the aster had gone to Palm Springs for the weekend I felt still lower . called Billie . I had never seen the old part of Los @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market with its tourist stalls which all that remains of the early Spanish town , where marimba lids play their gay and melancholy tunes in front of sidewalk es , tamales are sold like hot dogs and you get the impression that every Mexican in the world is trying to sell you a souvenir . I t was a little too much like a set on the back lot to make me ry happy at first , but a couple of slugs of tequila made a differcc . Billie , who seemed to be in love with all men nicely , began teach me the rhumba , and she used her few words of Spanish on the waiter and after burning my stomach with enchilada and my brain with more tequila I was holding her large plump hand and saying , " Billie , hey Billie , listen Billie , d' ya love me ? " " Sure , honey , " she giggled . " You 're cute when you 're drunk . " " I 'm not drunk , Billie , " I said . " I know every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can tell you everything we 've said since we sat down . Okay . So I 'm not drunk . I 'm just serious , that 's all I 'm in love with you , Billie , seriously , and if you do n't believe Inc uI 'll call you tomorrow and say the same thing when I 'm sober . " " Do n't be serious , honey , " she said . " Love is much nicer when it is n't serious . " " But goddam it , I love you , " I said loudly . " I want to marry you . As I reached my hand out to hold hers and make it more convincing , I turned over my half-filled glass . " Look at that , " I laughed as the thick liquid rolled slowly across the table . " Looks just like lava . No wonder I feel hot . I 'm drinking lava . " " You 're in love , Al , " she said . " You 're in love with somebody , all right . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you talking about I 'm in love with somebody ? " " It 's a funny thing , " she said , " but whenever a fella gets feeling good and wants to marry me , I know he 's in love with somebody . " What the hell makes her know so much about love , I wondered . She may never write a book about it , but speaking strictly physically , spiritually , romantically and psychologically she must know more about love than Havelock Ellis and Bertrand Russell put together . " I 'm not in love with anybody , " I said . " But if I were in l0 cc with anybody it would be with you , sweetheart . Because , well , hell , you 're old-fashioned . You may not know it , baby , but you 're the nineteen-thirty-six version of the old-fashioned girl  --  the **26;6895;TOOLONG , " I added and broke myself up . " Mmmm a tango , " she said with her whole body behind it.  | " I think I 'll just sit this one out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'd only be in your way . Just let me sit here and watch . " Later , a voice that seemed to come from behind me said , " Al , you 'd better pay the check . They 're closing up . " " My God , " I said , " Billie , you scared me . Jesus , I 've been sleeping . I must have been sleeping for hours ! " " We only finished dancing a second ago , " she said . " You were st starting to close your eyes . " " But I 've been dreaming , " I said . " Know who it was about ? Sammy Glick . He was climbing up a rope and I was chasing him , only the rope did n't seem to be tied to anything  --  just going straight up in the air . And every time he got near the end , it just kept getting longer . And then I fell off ... " " Senor , your check , " the waiter said in a tolerant but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Billie , I do n't think I ever asked you before . Do you know what makes Sammy run ? " She looked at me puzzled , not knowing whether to take it seriously or humor me . " That 's all right , " I said , " take your time . I 've been at it for years . " " Do you know ? " she said . " Of course I do n't know , " I said . " But I 'm working on it , little by little . You know what I need , Billie ? A subsidy from the Carnegie Foundation . Then I could have a whole staff helping Inc . Because it 's a big job , Billie . Once we know what makes Sammy run it will be a great thing for the world . Like discovering the cause of cancer . " " We better go home , " Billie said . " Billie , " I said , " can you keep a secret ? I think Kit is the only person in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a coldhearted bitch she wo n't tell . " When Kit called me for the next meeting I was either not myself or too much myself . I said , " I should think you could get a girlp136at the Guild office to take over some of this secretarial work for you , Kit . " " What is it , Al ? " she said . " You sound sore at me . " I 'm not sore , I thought . I think I 'm falling in love with you . There is a very subtle difference . " I guess I 'm just in sort of a mood today , " I said . " I think maybe I 'll pass this one up , Kit , if it 's all the same with you . " As usual I browsed around Stanley Rose 's until I had an appetiteand then as usual I went next door to Musso 's . " Evening , Mr. Manheim , " the waiter greeted me . " Going to the Guild meeting tonight ? " Amelio was a good union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an organized town . I said I was , in order to avoid indigestion over my chicken wings , for Amelio was the restaurant 's indisputable forensic star . On my way out I got it again . I stopped to say hello to three writers who always ate at the same table by the door . " Want to have a drink with us ? " they asked . " And then we 'll all go over to the meeting together . " I told them I would probably see them over there . I started walking down the Boulevard and turned in at the narrow alleyway leading to Henkel 's Art Gallery . The gallery was in a funny little bungalow with an easygoing , out-of-this-world atmosphere , which featured surrealist and abstractionist stuff and Mr. Henkel , blond , middle-aged , dumpy and vague , who spoke about art with a cigarette in his mouth so rapidly and indistinctly that I was rarely able to understand him , though occasional phrases always sounded significant . I had only been in Hollywood a short time , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time it was my erstwhile collaborator , Pancake . " Well , " he said , " it seems there are some writers left who are still more interested in the better things than in forming a union like a bunch of plumbers . " I looked at my watch . I could still make it if I hurried . " As ap137matter of fact , " I said , " I just came in here to kill a couple of minutes before going over with the rest of the plumbers . " I must have arrived only half an hour late because the meeting had n't begun yet . People were still standing around in little groups , talking . I picked Sammy out right away . He must have swallowed a magnet when he was a little boy . I started over . He was with Harold Godfrey Wilson and a tall , lean fellow who would have had the face of a typical Yale man if it had n't been for the pale , sick skin and the tired patches under the eyes . Sammy proudly introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of the finest pictures Hollywood had turned out . I remembered that he had won the Academy Award for the best screenplay a year or so ago . They went on talking about the Guild . " I 'm all for the Guild , " Paine said . " But I 'll be damned if I like how it 's being run . They 're letting too many people in . What the hell , every lucky bastard who happens to sell one story is n't a screen writer . The producers wo n't take us seriously until we limit the membership to writers who 've been employed at least a year , or get a thousand dollars a week . " " If this bunch of Reds have their way we 'll be marching down Hollywood Boulevard in their May Day Parade , " Wilson said . " What do you mean , Reds ? " I said . " Well , maybe not Reds , " Paine said . " Harold here always gets a little excited . But they 're goddam parlor-pinks and that 's just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save the Guild . " " Excuse me , Mr. Paine , " I said . " I just joined the Guild on my way in tonight and I admit I do n't know too much about it . But it seems to me you want to save the Guild by kicking out the little guys like me . And they 're just the ones the Guild ought to be helping the most . " " Apparently not all the lower-bracket writers feel the way youdo about it . Young Sammy here is with us , are n't you , Sammy ? " Young Sammy was with them , all right . Young Sammy was138 I I BUDD SCHULBERGp138applying for the job of bugle boy in the proud little army that marched under the banner of $2500 a week . After they wandered off Sammy shook his head and said , " Al , you 'll never get anywhere that way . Those guys have an in with some of the biggest producers in town . They know what they 're talking about . They do n't get twenty-five hundred a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Twenty-five hundred a week , " he said . I could feel him going crazy inside when he said it . " What are you making now , Sammy ? " I asked . " A lousy five hundred , " he said . " But it is n't the dough . Hell , as long as I stay single I can manage on five hundred all right . But the producers use five-hundred-a-week writers to wipe themselves with , Al . " Kit was right , I thought . You could n't blame a man for having a clubfoot , or a tapeworm in his mind . " You 're only a kid , " I said . " You 'll get your twenty-five hundred , you crazy son-of-a-bitch . I 'll bet you get it before you 're thirty . " " You know you can get good credits out here for years without getting in the big dough , " Sammy said . " But I 've been thinking about it . I 've been looking over guys ' shoulders while they hit the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside . With a hit play , for instance . That 's how these producers think . They see somethingthey like in print or on the stage and right away their tongues are hanging out to pay the writer three or four times as much as the guys trying to make a rep in their own business . " " What makes you think you can write a play ? " I said . " Hell , plenty of dopes write plays , " he said . " Talented dopes , " I said . " Talent can get you just so far , " he said . " Then you got to start using your head . " The meeting was being called to order . There seemed to be a larger crowd than last time . It looked as if the Guild was on its way.  | " What have you been doing for yourself ? " Sammy said . I did n't give him the usual optimistic crap because I wanted to hear what he would say . I told him after my option had lapsed I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally had landed at National , a little action-picture lot , on a flat-deal basis at a thousand bucks a script . Which means that you work twentysixhours a day trying to get your dough as fast as possible . " Any time limit on rewriting ? " Sammy said . I could n't remember any . " Then they 've got you by the balls but good , " Sammy said . " Once you get your grand they can keep you on the picture as long as they like . " " I know , " I said , " but what the hell can I do ? Maybe that 's a job for the Guild . " " If you ask me , " Sammy said , " the Guild has one foot in the grave  --  and it 's goosing itself with the other . Maybe you ought to write a play too . " The funny thing is I had been writing one . I had been writing one for three years . It was about a rabbi like my father and anti-Semitism in a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fraternity , peace and beer on Saturday night . I wanted to make the content of the play everything that I had seen and felt , and the form everything I knew . And I did n't want to tell anybody about it until it began to come alive to me . Because it seems to me too many writers drain their excitement and energy away in conversation . " I 've been working on one for a couple of years , " I said . " Do n't futz around with it too long , " Sammy said . " Try to peddle it . They buy lousy plays for pictures every day . And six months from now the chances are that they wo n't remember what kind of dreck it was . All they 'll remember is that you are a playwrightand look at all the lousy playwrights out here in the big money . " 140 I I BUDD SCHULBERGp140I do n't know whether Sammy had the play already written the night we talked about it or whether he ran right home and dashed it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a couple of months later that I received an engraved invitation in the mail . Mr. Samuel Glick was requesting the pleasure of my company at the opening of his three-act comedy-drama Live Wire at the Hollywood Playhouse . Sammy Glick , prominent scenarist and playwright , I thought tenderly and hatefully , my little Sammy Glick . I was still admiring the tasteful typography of his announcementwhen Sammy called . His voice was full of exulting raucous chimes out of tune . " Hiya sweetheart , how 're they hanging ? Well , are you all set for your greatest evening in the American theater ? " I said I had his invitation . " It 's shaping up something terrific , " he said . " Everybody says it looks like the biggest opening this town ever had . I gave Finemanand Frank Collier a row each and they even promised to join my party at the Troc after the show . I sent Irving Thalberg and Norma Shearer a couple of ducats and they have n't sent them back , so it looks as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get away with all those tickets ? " I said . " What did you do , buy out the house for the night ? " " To tell you the truth , " he said , " I got a little dough in the show myself . I talked my agents into backing it with me fifty-fifty . I hadda brainstorm , see ? I told them the best goddam way in the world to hit the producers for six figures was to put the show on right under their noses with a helluva fanfare . My agents can smell big dough a mile away . They went right out and grabbed a firstclassBroadway producer to front for us . " " Sammy , " I said , " you 're a smart guy . At least if you 've made a mistake so far I have n't noticed it . So why in hell do you want to go telling me all this for ? " " In the first place , " he said , " you 're a good guy . " He said it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for putting the clip on me for Rosalie or Julian . If that 's yourp 141pleasure , go ahead . I just figure your brain 's a little soft , that 's all , but it 's okay by me . I still like you . You 're good for me . If I tell you something in confidence you do n't shoot your mouth off to the first big shot you meet to try to get an in . " If he had hated me I might have had some satisfaction out of it . But he had more important people to hate . " And in the second place , what the hell if they do find out ? I 'd just tell ' em it shows how much confidence I got in my own work . " " And in the third place you 're so goddam pleased with yourself you have to tell somebody and I 'm the best listener you 've got , " I added . He chuckled . " I love you , you fresh bastard , " he said . " By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a play did you dig up for the occasion ? " " A million laughs , " he said . " I knocked it out in exactly four weeks and everybody who 's seen it says it 's sensational . There 's so much excitement about it that my press agent Stan Dickey says he 's having an easier job getting space for it than for Once in a Lifetime . " " You need a press agent like Fred Astaire needs dancing lessons , " I said . " You ought a get hold of Dickey yourself , Al , " Sammy said . " He knows his way around . People are suckers for the printed word , Al , and that even goes for the top guys . They believe what they read , even when they 're on their guard . If they read it often enough . I 've had Dickey plugging me ever since I took Julie into the studio with me . I made a smart deal with Dickey . I told him he could keep working for me as long as he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sometimes it made me sore when Sammy talked that way , sometimes it just made me wonder how the hell homosaps got that way , sometimes it left me sick to think what a tremendous burning and blinding light ambition can be where there is somethingbehind it , and what a puny flickering sparkler when there is n't . Sammy 's flame was deceptive because you were always looking at it through the powerful magnifying glass of his own ego.  | But when the telephone wires failed to transmit the magnetic current it was like standing off and looking at a small , cold star . This time , listening half to what Sammy was saying now , half to everything he had ever said to me before , I thought of Sammy , distinguished and dead at fifty , a front-page story which Stan Dickey had written and Sammy previously okayed , with governors and bankers and people in high places as honorary pallbearers and everyone mourning the loss of a captain of industry , an Elk , a self-made man and a Great American . " Al , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called you . Do you wan na be a really good guy ? " " What do you want me to do ? " I said . " Take Kit off my hands tonight . " " Sure , " I said , " I guess that 's okay with me . But what 's the story ? " " I 'm taking Rita Royce , " he said . He said it in the same tone of voice as the first time he ordered St. James Scotch . Rita Royce was one of the better known of the new crop of aphrodisiacs , a sort of streamlined Theda Bara . Kit pushed open the door of her Ford convertible . She was wearing a short fur jacket over a white evening gown that emphasized her tan . She had her hair a different way , up on her head in a smooth roll , and it was almost a shock to see how feminine she could look when she wanted to . She said , " Hi . " " What 's with you and Sammy tonight ? " She answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Does n't Rita Royce look simply divine ? Is n't the young man with her Sammy Glick , the one who 's supposed to be so brilliant ? " There was n't any bitterness in it at all . She made you see it the way it really was , amusing and just a little pathetic . " I 'm surprised he did n't pair you with Gary Cooper , " I said . " It would have been good publicity . "  | " He did want to palm me off on some glamour-boy who 's supposed to be on his way up at Metro , " she said . " But I 'm afraid I 'm something of a chauvinist about actors . Even intelligent ones . In fact , sometimes they 're worse because they know more words to use about themselves . So I held out for you . " " I 'm deeply grateful to you , ma'am , " I said . " Otherwise I might not have been on hand for the unveiling of another milestonein my best friend 's career . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " they 're like telephone poles through the window of a train . " Sammy had asked us to his apartment for cocktails before dinner . I have never shown the slightest inclination to sketch , but when Sammy came strutting toward us in a new full-dress suit , his chest puffing out his stiff white shirt like a pouter pigeon , with his hair slicked , a blood-red carnation in his lapel and a look on his face as if he had just swallowed his producer , I wished for one moment my fairy godmother would turn me into ToulouseLautrec . Even the customary patent-leather evening shoes were n't good enough for him tonight . He had discovered dancing pumps , those dainty , ultra-evening slippers with the pointed toes and the little black bows . The cocktail session was fun to watch . It was fun to see Sammy trying to use manners to match his dress clothes . Funny to see him trying to form sentences without his four-letter words , leaving his conversation ridiculously stilted . And poor Rita , who seemed as if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glamour . If only she did n't have to try so hard to live up to that amazing body of hers . Rita raised her glass and read her line as if it were the only one she was going to have in the picture and she had to make it remembered . " To our young genius  --  success . " I caught Kit 's eye as we drank and we smiled at each other guiltily . As Rita drank she fell back on that hackneyed bit of business of smiling up over the rim of her glass with her eyes fluttering . You could feel sorry for Rita and like her , or embar-144rassed for her and dislike her , depending on your disposition at the moment . Sammy acknowledged her toast with one of his own . " We ca n't drink to your success , because that 's already established . So we 'll drink to its continuance . " I could count back the years on one hand to the time when I was teaching the young genius and litterateur not to say ai n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk sipping my drink I could n't help noticing his clippings . There were items about Sammy from papers all over the country , mailed to him by a clipping service . When Sammy caught me looking at them he came over and shoved a paper under my nose . " See this ? " he said coyly . It was the Hollywood Megaphone . I began to read the lead editorial in the corner . The editor was taking potshots at the Writers Guild again . " What makes these wild-eyed members of the Screen Writers Guild think they can get away with biting the hand that feeds them ? " it asked . " We are not against the Guild . We are for this industry . If the Guild were for this industry too , instead of trying to ruin it by joining up with the Eastern playwrightswho hate Hollywood and always have , we would be for the Guild too . " " What is all this fuss about the Authors ' League ? " I said . " What possible good would it do the Guild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading ? " Sammy said . " I meant at the bottom of the page  --  with the red circle around it . " It was half a dozen lines headed : GLICK THUMBS DOWN $75,000 . Sammy Glick , local boy-wonder scribe , puts thumbs down on major studio offer of 75 G 's for his play Live Wire , it was understoodlast night . Prefers to hold picture deals off until curtain goes up for first time at Playhouse Fri. night . I always love those journalistic outs  --  it was alleged , it was learned in semi-official circles , it was understood . " Who was it understood by , " I said , " except you and Stan Dickey ? "  |p145Sammy  slapped me on the back , playfully but jolting me , and his laugh was a little too loud for the evening-clothes atmosphere . " One of these days remind me to rub you out , " he gagged . " You know too much . " We drove to the theater in a sleek black Lincoln Sammy had hired for the occasion . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitement around Rita , started by a plump young lady in slacks and a gangling , scabby-kneed girl who shoved their autograph books in her face while Sammy stood looking on , drinking it in . One frantic little fan , taking no chances , even wanted Kit 's autograph . " You do n't want my autograph , " Kit told her . The child insisted that she did . Kit looked at me helplessly , took the pencil and scribbled her name . The child stared at the page , puzzled a moment , cried out feverishly , " That was nobody ! " ripped the page out , crumpled and threw it away and fought her way into the middle of the next circle . As we took our seats photographers were prowling up and down the aisles hunting celebrities . Sammy and Rita were trying very hard to seem interested in what each had to say and watch the cameramen out of the corners of their eyes at the same time . When the flashlight boys finally sighted them Rita tilted her head with just the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . But Sammy took it big . He looked at that camera like a lover . The man who took that picture may have been just another publicity hack but that picture of his was worth saving as a real photographic study . In fact I clipped it out of next morning 's paper for that collection of Sammyglickiana I am going to turn over to the Smithsonian when the species finally runs itself into extinction . The most striking thing about that photograph is that it is n't so much a picture of two people sitting together as two individual portraits that merely happen to be side by side . Rita is staring off at an imaginary leading man with a wistful gleam in her eyes . And Sammy is looking right at you , sneering joyfully . The head is cocked slightly at an angle , like an alert Boston bull . The eyes gloat . The sneer comes only from the mouth , which veers ever so slightly off center.  |p146This  photographic study was captioned : Lovely Rita Royce Shares Spotlight with Samuel Glick As Young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opening . With Them Is a Friend . The unidentified Friend , of course , with his head turned away from the camera watching Sammy Glick , is myself . The play was what Sammy needed , all right . It was one of those things about two red-blooded guys who are always scrapping and loving each other , in this case a couple of announcers in a radio station getting each other in and out of jams with enough gags and surprises and general hell-raising to keep the audience sufficientlyamused . I was thinking how much the play was like its author , nothing really there to offer , but slugging the onlookers into submission with sheer noise and velocity , and back of all this I kept thinking something tells me this is awfully familiar and then the show was over and someone in the house , probably Stan Dickey , started to call Author , Author , and the cry was picked up and Sammy was taking a bow and all of a sudden it 's a big success and I 'm sitting next to a hit playwright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's modestly denying that he must have worked very hard on it , saying it just seemed to come to him , five or six nights ' work and everyone 's amazed and pleased and someone , not Stan Dickey any more , for by now it 's spontaneous , says a new genius has come to Hollywood and Sammy says , " Oh , I would n't say that exactly . " We waited in the car while Sammy went backstage to congratulateand get congratulated by the cast , and when he returned he was not the same as when he left us a few minutes before . I 'll be damned if even his voice had n't changed . It seemed lower and more dignified . He was n't just one more of those bright **29;6923;TOOLONG any more . No more worries about being classed with Julian . He was ready for big time . No more trying to wangle invitations to Harry Godfrey Wilson 's clambakes . He was already thinking of asking Wilson and Paine and McCarter and the rest of the upper crust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course Sammy was n't going to waste any time establishing his new social position . In fact we headed straight for the Trocadero , where Sammy was throwing a celebration party for himself . He seemed almost more elated about bagging the Finemansand the Colliers for it than he did about his play . I guess it was just as important at that . We were there before any of the others , so we went into the bar to wait . Sammy ordered champagne cocktails and then Rita said , " Excuse me , I have to comb my hair , " and went out to the ladies ' room . She could say , " Pass the salt , " and make it sound exotic . " I 'll chaperon you , " Kit said , as she rose and followed her out . It was funny to watch Rita parading through the room like a peacock and know she was only going to the can . Funnier to watch Kit striding after her . It was a gait better suited to slacks than evening gowns . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it might turn into fat some day if she did n't watch herself . But Kit made you feel she was always going to be this way , hard and slim . Sammy looked after them appraisingly . " There 's the difference between handsome and luscious , " he said . I would n't give him the satisfaction of letting him know I agreed with him . I just sat there with my wine , feeling righteous and jealous . Sammy said , " Well , Al , you 're the only one who has n't told me what you think . " " I think it 's just like something else I 've seen , " I said . He started to say , " That 's so much horse  --  " and then he remembered he was a prominent playwright . " After all no play can ever be entirely original . " " That 's true , " I said . " They can only be entirely unoriginal . " " You 're crazy as hell , Al , " Sammy insisted . " Just because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the actual writing of that stuff with Julie you got it fixed in your mind that I ca n't write . " My mind skipped from Julian to the newspaper office to plagiaryand then all of a sudden it came to me.  | " My God ! The Front Page ! " Even then he would n't give in until I had traced the parallel , scene for scene . " Okay , pal , " he said . " Maybe I did follow the construction of Front Page . Only I changed the characters . And I jazzed it up a little more . " " Those people did n't know what a genius you are , " I said . He looked around furtively . " Listen , Al , " he said . " Before it did n't matter . I was only playing for marbles . But if you do any talking about this I 'll kill ya  --  so help me Christ , I 'll run you out of this town for good . " Then he suddenly dropped his voice and smiled at me , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I know I 'm no angel . I 'm only human like anybody else . But if I ever get to be one of the head guys out here you wo n't find me forgetting my pals like some of these other bastards . " " Last time we had an argument , " I said , " you seemed to think I was too dumb to do you any harm . Why the hell should I tell anybody what a bastard you are ? Let them find out for themselves . He relaxed , even patted my hand reassuringly . " Okay , pal , " he said . " I 'd trust you like my own mother . It 's just a funny thing about this racket  --  the bigger you are , the jumpier you get . Only just remember , what I said about loyalty still goes . " I 'll remember it all right , I thought . How could I ever forgeta combination as unique as loyalty and Sammy Glick ? Rita came back , gradually , stopping at three tables en route . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you going to write a play forme ? " " When he can find one , " I said . " I do n't want to write for you until I feel something great , " Sammy said , " something that 's  --  you . " She moved closer to him . That 's the only real play you 'll ever get from him , I thought.  |p149Kit  rescued us by announcing the arrival of Sammy 's guests . The Trocadero was the place to be seen that season , a chic , handsomely tailored night club with creamy walls , subtle illuminationthat retouched the women 's faces like fashionable photographers . A startling south wall made entirely of glass looked out and down at the houselights and the street lamps and the red neon smears of Hollywood , Los Angeles , Beverly Hills , Culver City and the rest of the sprawling communities in the long valley between the Hollywood Hills on the north and the ridge dotted with oil wells sloping up behind MGM , fifteen miles to the south . Sammy sat at the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colliers and his new sense of authority , being witty and charming and intelligent . I think I even heard him expressing an interest in rare books for Fineman . The chances were he had had his secretary doing some research for him on the subject . A moment later he was leaning toward Collier , discussing the technicalproblems he must have faced in trying to photograph penguinsin their native environment . That was a new gift Sammy was beginning to acquire . He was learning to abandon the direct sledgehammer approach . It was still there , of course , but he was learning how to camouflage it . He was developing an amazing ability to appropriate and broadcast ideas and cultural attitudes which he never held long enough to absorb . I heard him discussing a current best-seller with Mrs. Fineman , which I would have bet anything she had read and he had n't , but that did n't stop him from doing most of the talking about it , employing a razzle-dazzle literary double-talk technique that had good , simple Mrs. Finemanon the run . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either . " What always amazes me , " she said , " is that with all the turnoverin Hollywood from year to year , almost from month to month , the faces in here never seem to change . " I looked around the room to see whom I was with . Kit pointed out to me the famous free-lance Hollywood photographer , Katz , a feverish little dwarf of a man who would look undressed without his Graflex and whose degree of interest in you as a photographic subject had become an accurate test of your rating in the industry . " Last time I was here , " Kit said , " someone pointed out to Katz that Major Adams was in the room  --  remember , one of the men who practically founded Hollywood , I guess , worked with Griffith for years and probably did more for pictures than any other producerbefore Thalberg ? They say he 's down-and-out now but some of his old gang keep him going . Well , Katz barely looked up from his reloading . Who , Adams ? ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ta save my bulbs for the Tom Brown  --  Anita Louise party coming in later . ' And he said it so loud that poor old Adams turned around . " We watched the people together , being very catty of course about the little ingenue with gold stars pasted on her bare shoulders . And the beautiful young juvenile singing into her ear the words of the popular song they were dancing to . And the look of aloof superiority that came over the dancers ' faces for the rhumba , flashing their heads expertly from side to side , so conscious of the figure they were cutting on the floor . And the ex-hatcheck girl on her way to stardom with her magnificent ( but dead ) pan , swirling around the floor with a dashing and toothy screen villain whose face seemed to be set in a permanent sneer . And the foolishly oblivious couple , he a half-bald , red-faced grinner , fugitive from middle age ; she a young , plumpish and pretty blonde with a silly champagne smile and a gift for abandon . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fourteen-year-old who should have been in bed instead of awkwardly trying to simulate the rhythm of the rhumba . And .. . " What do you think our chances are of taking a powder ? " I said . She took the table in and smiled . " He who hesitates , " she said , " is trapped here in the Black Hole of Trocadero until morning . " We rose together , conspiratorially . " Do n't bother to say good night , " she said . " So we do n't break up the party . Let 's just say we 're going out to get a little air . " Outside it was good just to stand there a moment and let thep151wind sweeping down the Strip from the sea blow the liquor fumes and the smoke and the chatter of simultaneous voices out of your mind . We hopped a taxi back to the Colonial House to pick up Kit 's Ford . She nosed the car into the boulevard and paused . " Where shall it be ? " I said , " Any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Sammy Glick . " She said , " I think I can fill that bill without too much trouble " ; and we shot forward into the fast-moving traffic . We drove up the steep winding road to her house near the top of the Hills . The night was clear and it seemed as if the world was full of nothing but little pulsing lights above us and below us . It was so beautiful you thought you ought to say something about it , but there was nothing good enough to say . I felt as if we were floating between two starry skies , flowing into each other at the horizon . " Mmmmm , " I said . " Wait till you see it from the studio window with the lights out , " she said . " Better than the Trocadero  --  and no cover charge . " It was a cozy and inviting little house , consisting of one main living and dining room with beams across the high triangular ceiling , and two small rooms , a bedroom and a paneled study besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch beyond that window , " Kit said . " In another month I 'll be sleeping out there . You can become surprisingly fond of Hollywood from that porch . " She made highballs and we took them out there with us and leaned against the railing . It did top the view from the Troc . We could barely make out the neon lettering Trocadero half a mile below . " It seems wrong to know he 's behind those lights and not be able to see him or hear him , " I said . " Shhh , " she smiled , " I think I can hear him . "  |p152We  really paused and listened a moment . " I think that 's only the wind rushing , " I said . " Though it may be him at that . " " He and Rita are dancing , " she said , watching the Troc as if she could actually see them . " Skirting all around the edge of the floor by silent agreement , to make sure of being seen by as many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaning over like ship 's passengers looking out to sea . " What did you think of the play ? " I said . Instead of answering my question directly , she said , " I wonder what would happen if Sammy used all that energy and imaginationto create something  --  not just to devise ways of reaching the top without creating anything . " We kept going in to refill our glasses and returning to the rail and the view again , not growing intoxicated but only more intimate . " Kit , " I said , " we 've known each other almost a year now . We 're pretty good friends . And yet all we know about each other is Sammy Glick . I do n't think we 've ever talked about anything else but Sammy Glick . He 's an obsession with me  --  and I know a hell of a lot about him now I would n't have known without you  --  but , well  --  I 'm beginning to feel he 's a kind of defense we use against each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something private that went with the porch and it was easy to talk . I told her about leaving Middletown after my father died , going to New York with not enough money to last me over a month , pounding the sidewalks begging for a job , making a goddam pest of myself at every newspaper office in town because I was greatly in need of fifteen dollars a week . I told her how I used to get up at five o'clock to train racing pigeons before going to school and how , if I ever hit this town for any kind of money , I would like to have a small house out in the valley somewhere where I could have a pigeon loft again . I told her a little of how balled up I felt inside because there were times when I wanted to say what I hadP 153to say as honestly as possible , and times when I felt as ambitious as Sammy without being able to free myself from the sense of relationship with everybody else in the world , which made it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe I talked her ear off so that she had to open up in self-defense . She spoke in a monotone , keeping her head profiled to mine , and I felt that what she was saying came not only from her brain and her mouth but rooted deep in her , intestinal . " My father 's goal was the United States Supreme Court . I guess he came closer than most people do to their goals because he finally did make the State Supreme Court . Through a lot of hard work and a lot of smart politics . I do n't think either one alone would have been enough . My father and mother shared one life between them , which sounds very romantic except the life they shared was his , exclusively . Her job was to see that his diet was observed and that he was not allowed to be disturbed when he was working and that the men who could help him were adequately feted and the wives of his associates duly luncheoned and teaed . In other words , she performed all her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a thought of her own or a job of her own or even a conversation of her own , I never knew it . Poor Mother . Their marriage always made me think of a motorcycle with Father at the controls and Mother sitting in the sidecar , not asking where she was going but only if he was sure he was warm enough without the extra scarf she brought along . " " That sounds rather like a typical happy marriage , " I said . " Oh , terribly typical , " she said . " But the happiness part is pretty much bunk . At least for the person in the sidecar . " She told me how it was with her father dead . " That was when I was sixteen . Arranging his funeral was the last function Mother had in the world . After that she was through . There was n't anythingleft for her to do . And when she was n't reminiscing about him there did n't seem to be anything for her to say . I was really fond of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be back on the train on my way to school again . I felt sorry for her of course  --  but that did n't keep her from driving me crazy . Afterp154college Mother wanted me to go to law school . She had it all planned . I 'd go into my father 's old firm and we 'd live together and she 'd take care of me . To be very ruthless about it  --  what she really wanted to do was turn me into my father , so she would have a place again . Well , I decided I had to be ruthless about it . I was already started on my book and I wanted to be away from her  --  on my own . I could n't see why the hell men should have a monopoly on independence any more . I made up my mind to stay out of sidecars . Have you ever thought of the difference between the two words spinster and bachelor ? It seems pretty significant that spinsterhas a thought association of loneliness , frustration and bitterness . Bachelorhood is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you a sense of adventure and freedom ? So I decided I 'd be a bachelor . I do n't mean sex orgies . Most girls go through that period , either with actual experiences or in their mind ; they 'll slow down after a while if you let them alone . I mean that when I met a man that appealed to me  --  well , you know how men feel about it . I did n't want to be a pushover , because then it would n't mean anything any more ; look at the rabbits . But I did n't want to set up any barriers of fake coquetry either . " She paused and finished her drink coolly . " If that sounds too immoral just make believe I 'm very tight  --  which I probably am . " I said , " It sounds plenty moral for my money . " " I think so , " she said . " Not the Hays Office kind , of course . But under the bonnet of organized morality lurks a very filthy mind . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the porch again . " When you were talking before , " I said , " you know , about men that appealed to you ? I could n't help thinking about Sammy . " She laughed . " You mean the person we were n't going to talk about ? " I said keeping him out of an entire conversation was too much to ask . And now that he had come up , I wanted to know . We were absolutely cockeyed , but completely coherent because that 's the kind of mood we had set in the beginning . P155When she did n't answer me I said again , " What 's the real story on you and Sammy ? " " You do n't really want me to talk about it , " she said . " You know it 'll only make you uncomfortable . " " Uncomfortable ! " I said . " Why should it ? " " Okay , pal , " she said . " But do n't blame me if it makes you sore . As you probably guessed , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has n't much to do with friendship or love or any other of those virtuous relationships . Most people know that , but they do n't like to admit it . Well , the first day Sammy came into my office to save California from annexing itself to Russia , I was ready to tear him limb from limb and at the same time I had this crazy desire to know what it felt like to have all that driving ambition and frenzy and violence inside me . " She broke off , staring down tensely , her composure finally ripped . " Jesus , " she said quietly , " you get to know a man that way . And it 's strange to see the same selfishness and cruelty and power working out there too . " There was a long pause . No embarrassment , just that she had finished . Finally , she said , " Well , are you sore ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " But I 'm glad you told me . " " So am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy to tell things to . " She paused . " I feel as if I 've opened a window and hung my mind out to air . " The wind was fresh and cool , rippling by like a mountain stream and we stopped to rediscover it . " The Chamber of Commerce boasts about the sunshine and the palm trees and the Chinese Theater , " she said . " And the things that have the most vitality they 're always on the defense about  --  the long rains and the night winds . " In her white gown she reminded me of a sail as she pivoted to catch the wind squarely . She threw her head back and my eyesP156were drawn to the neck line curving up to her chin as if this were some intimate nakedness suddenly exposed . " Kit , " I said , and I bent to kiss her . She seemed preoccupied with something out there and oblivious of me . But as my mouth reached hers , she turned her head , casually , as if by accident , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that , nothing about that ever . She inspected her glass and said , " Let 's freshen our drinks , " and we went inside . " I 'm worried about the Guild , " she began as if we had been talking about that all evening . I said I had seen the blast in the Megaphone that morning . " That was n't a blast , " she said . " That was just the pop of Flanigan 's little trial balloon . But Hollywood never likes to do things in a small way . Something tells me that when our blast comes , it will really be a production . " " What do you think will happen , Kit ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " I wish I did . All I know is that if it comes to a showdown over the Authors ' League , a lot of Guild guys who have been using their heads and their voices may have to start using their guts . " " But there 's no sense looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets that bunch Sammy was sucking around sore at the Guild we 'll never get anywhere . " " I 'm not so sure , " she said . " I 'm beginning to wonder whether the only way the Guild can please them  --  is to go out of exis-tence . " Just as a white evening gown was wrong for her , mascara , powder and lipstick were more out of place than ever when she pressed her lips together and set her jaw . " We might as well recognize we have some of the most unique union members in the history of organized labor . Like Brother Glick , swimming around in that fish bowl of champagne down there . " Lights were going out all over Hollywood . As I watched , the two o'clock curfew erased the blazing neon longhand of theP157Trocadero . Sammy Glick was probably leaning back in the plush seat of his rented Lincoln blowing cigar smoke into the face of the goddess millions of American guys of all nationalities were making love to as they fell asleep in flop houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " let 's have another drink . Let 's drink to a helluva wonderful country  --  and a cockeyed time . " P158That was the month everything happened . It started crazy right off the bat . I got a good job , the best I ever had . Kit swung it for me . After Masaryk died , it struck me that the story of his life ought to be a natural for pictures . His ties with American democracy gave it special significance for us , and with Mussolini shooting off his big guns in Ethiopia and Hitler his big mouth in Germany , an anti-fascist picture seemed like a good idea . I told Kit about it , and as usual she did n't show too much excitement , but a couple of weeks later she bowled me over with the news that she had passed the idea on to Sidney Fineman and he had given her a favorable reaction and wanted to see me . Fineman said he had thought of doing Masaryk before , hadP159even registered it , in fact , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . Fineman was a refutation of everything I had ever heard about producers . His office was large but in good taste , with real books in the bookcases and theatrical prints on the walls . He could express a thought without making you find the words for it and an emotion without resorting to profanity . He knew much more about Masaryk than I did . He did n't want to be yessed . He told me he could only hire me week-to-week but not to get panicky , that he would n't even ask to see what I had done for at least four weeks . " Even then , " he said , " I do n't care if you only have a handful of pages as long as there 's something worth going on with . The danger in this story is that it will be a series of lectures on democracy . Moving pictures have n't got time for sermons . Try to get in the habit of thinking in terms of pictorial action . " He gave me an example I 'll always remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand a week . The first job the playwright had to do was an opening scene in a picture where he had to establish that the husband was tiring of his wife . Fifteen thousand dollars later the playwright brought in a twenty-page scene . Fineman thought the dialogue was brilliantbut way over length for the start of the picture . The playwrightprotested that you could n't cut a line out of his scene without ruining it . Fineman showed the scene to his director , Ray MacKenna , one of the few men left in the business who got his training in the Mack Sennett two-reel comedy school . Mac sent the scene back to Fineman with one of his own . It was typed out on half a page . It read : INT . ELEVATOR MEDIUM SHOTHusband and wife in evening clothes . Husband wearing top hat . REVERSE ANGLEAs elevator door opens and classy dame enters . CLOSE SHOT HUSBAND AND WIFEGet husband 's reaction to new dame . Removes hat with flourish.  | Wife looks from dame to husband 's hat to husband . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me over his curved pipe . " Mac could n't write a complete sentence , " he said . " But that was great writing  --  for the screen . " I could n't wait to get out of his office and start writing the greatest screenplay of all time . I had n't felt like that since I ran into an English teacher in college who had the effect on you of a literary laxative . You felt you would have to run out of class before it was over and rush back to your room and let it all out of your system . Kit 's enthusiasm for motion pictures had always been a little hard to take . But now I remembered something she had said somewhere along the line , " The most exciting way ever invented to tell a story is with a moving-picture camera . " I could n't wait to get into my office and begin telling it . Sammy Glick may get everything else , I thought , but by God this is a pleasure he 'll never know , the joy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so beautiful now and so lousy later , the tremendous pleasure and labor of creating something you believe in . Sammy looked in around lunchtime . He was n't dressed like a writer . More like a fight champ or a sweepstakes winner . The crepe soles on his white kid shoes seemed to be half a foot high and the flower in his lapel stood out like a red light against his white suede jacket . " You look like a fugitive from Esquire , " I said . He had to laugh because it was supposed to be a gag , but I do n't think his heart was in it . " Welcome to the big leagues , " he said . " I hear you sold Finemana bill of goods . I want you to know I put in a good word for you . Hear you got a terrific story . " You could feel him selling your story back to you the same way he would his own . " I have n't got any story yet , " I said . " Just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's terrific , sweetheart , " he said . " I hope you make a million dollars . " Then he paused to look at me compassionately . " But I hear they got you working for peanuts . Three hundred and fifty a week . " I had to admit my disgrace , though I could n't figure out how he found out so fast . " I got a pipeline from the front office , " he said . " Me and Dan Young 's secretary are like this . " His hands performed an obscene gesture . " I mean Young 's secretary and I. I wound up with her at the last studio Christmas party and she still thinks I 'm in love with her . " " Sammy , " I said , " I 'm trying to work . " " Al , why do n't you cut it out ? " Sammy kidded . " Your sense of fair play is going to ruin the racket for the rest of us . " He dragged me to my feet affectionately . " Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ introduce you around the commissary . Cooped up in here all day is n't going to get you anywhere . You got to spread your wings a little bit . " I hesitated . I wanted to think about Masaryk . And when you ate lunch with Sammy Glick , there was only one thing on the menu , Sammy Glick . " If you need a convincer , " Sammy said , " I told Julian to save a couple of seats for us at the writers ' table . " Julian had n't changed . He looked a little healthier , he was wearing a new suit which was just like the old one and his handshake did n't seem so frightened , but you would never have taken him for a hit writer and that 's what he was becoming . Studio environment seemed to have no more effect on him than his tenement neighborhoodhad . He and Blanche had never been so happy , he said . They had rented a little cottage overlooking the ocean near Topanga Canyon and they had a baby coming along in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p162I  said I could n't believe it . Everybody said it was absolutely impossible out here to do any writing of your own . " I know , " he said . " That 's what everybody says . But I do n't understand it . Every Saturday , unless I 'm doing a rush job , I leave here at noon . Blanche and I go for a long walk along the beach , I take a quick dip  --  I 've been doing it since the first of March  --  and then I write until I go to bed . You could n't want a better place to work than right there over the ocean . " Sammy had n't even sat down with us yet . He was all over the place like a headwaiter . We could hear him yelling to somebody across the room . " He spends two hours here every day , " Julian said . " This is where he really goes to work . He 's the commissary genius . I do n't know whether you 've noticed our screen credits or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Screenplay by Sammy Glick and Julian Blumberg . You know where he got all those story credits ? Right here in the commissary . " The story of how he did it was so intriguing that we both forgot to order . Sammy would walk up to a director and say , " Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich in Titanic . Do I have to say any more ? " Then he would just walk away from the guy , significantly , and leave it in his lap . The director has been desperate for a socko story all year . Tracy and Dietrich in Titanic . Jesus , it sounds like something . Natural suspense . And two great characters . Maybe Spence is a good two-fisted minister who tries to straighten Marlene out . Marlene is a tramp , of course . He 's real . She 's anything for a laugh . Then , even though the boat is going down you bring the audience up with a hell of a lift because Marlene suddenly sees the light . Meanwhile Sammy bumps into a supervisor . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . " He went off his nut about it . Spencer Tracy and Marlene Dietrich in Titanic . Do I have to say any more ? " And he drops the hot potato in the supervisor 's lap and runsP163again . The supervisor knows Sammy has n't missed yet . And he 's been trying to get a cast like that ever since he 's been made a supervisor . So he drops by Tyler 's table . " Sammy Glick tells me you 're hot for his Titanic story , " he says . " Yeah , " Tyler says , " I think the kid 's got something . And it 's right down my alley . " By this time Tyler is practically thinking up the acceptance speech he 'll make on receiving the Academy Award . " I could get a great picture out of that , " he says . " Remember what I did with Strange Voyage ? That 's for me ! " All this time Sammy is hopping from table to table , pollinating his story like a bumblebee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody who can possibly help him if he has to say anything more and running off before they can answer . Everybody is now asking everybody else if they have heard Sammy 's Titanic story . And by this time , through unconscious generosity , they have contributed to the story two characters , a beginning , middle and a climax . Now Sammy manages to cross the path of the General Manager in Charge of Production . Sammy has heard that he 's been a little burned lately because people are saying he is losing touch with studio activities . " How do you do , sir , " Sammy says . " I suppose Tyler and Hoyt have told you my story for Dietrich and Tracy . Titanic ? Everybodywho 's heard it seems very excited about it . " He has heard about Glick , of course , and he never likes to appear ignorant of anything . " Yes , I have , Glick , " he says . " Sounds very interesting . I 'm going to call you all in for a conferenceon it some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all anyone knows is that everybody else thinks it 's great . And since everybody has gone on record , no one is willing to admit just how little about the story he knows . So the safest thing is to let Sammy get something on paper , which means that Julian has to start dreaming up a story called TitanicP164while the trade papers and Parsons naturally pass on to their readers what Sammy has told them , that everyone on his lot is saying his epic drama Titanic is absolutely the greatest vehicle either of those two great stars has ever had . There was no bitterness or anger in Julian 's story . It was full of mild wonder and deep resignation . Sammy finally got around to us . He introduced me to everybody at the long table , selling me to them and them to me . " I want you to meet a very sweet guy , " he would say . " I want you to meet the sweetest guy in the world . " The talk around the table was almost all gags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would get a laugh . One of the writers had ordered wine and a young producer who had just been graduated from the writers ' ranks asked him , " What are you Guild members drinking these days  --  producers ' blood ? " It got a good laugh and you could hear him repeating it with variations . " At the Guild Board meetings they toast Der Tag with producers ' blood . Hey , Joe , know what Brown is drinking . . . ? " Everybody kidded about the Guild back and forth , but I felt that gagging was really the official court language and that underneathit all you could feel the friction growing . " Just wait till we join the Authors ' League , comrades ! " Sammy shouted . " Then all us downtrodden writers can become producers and we 'll punish the producers by making them get down on their hands and knees  --  and write ! " Some of the laughter was automatic , some frightened , some reactionary . That was the month I will never forget because it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy and hopeful and terrifying . You can choose your own adjectives for the front-page story in the Megaphone that was waiting for me on my desk one morning , for like everybody else I could n't start my day without reading the little trade journals from cover to cover . P165GLICK GETS $80,000 FORLIVE WIRE FROM WORLD-WIDERETURNS TO HOME LOT TO ADAPTOWN PLAY AT $1250 A WEEKThat , as Sammy would say , was the convincer . I decided that the history of Hollywood was nothing but twenty years of feverish preparation for the arrival of Sammy Glick . Sammy came in a little later , of course , making the rounds to take his bows . He was wearing a new outfit , gray checks of contrastingsizes for the coat and pants . And the flower which was becoming a fixture . " Sammy , " I said , " I read the bad news this morning . May I be the first to console you ? " He thought I meant it as a gag . But I assured him I was serious . " I thought this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " But I see you 're only getting twelve-fifty . " I was right . All the excitement of that astronomical dough was over already . He was really eating his heart out about that extra seven-fifty . Of Hollywood 's one thousand screen writers , there might be three or four dozen getting twelve-fifty . But the twogrand-a-weekboys were really the inner circle . It was the differencebetween the Big League and Triple-A . " They wanted me to sign a new contract , " he said , " but I would n't do it . Why should I tie myself down ? " The Guild was asking its members not to sign contracts that bound them for more than two years , so that at the end of that time they would all be free to take a strike vote if that became necessary to win recognition for the Guild . That was called Article XI I. It was going to be called a lot of other things before the month was over . Kit was a very persuasive girl , but I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his own mother , much less nine hundred fellow writers he was breaking his neck and his heart to outdistance . And I told him so . " Hell , no , " he said . " That 's not why . If you ask me , the Guild has a helluva nerve telling us to do anything like that . If I signedP166a contract now it would probably get me there in a couple of steps , probably fifteen hundred and then seventeen-fifty . But I 'm catchingthe express now , baby . I 'm getting off at my station in one stop . " That day it seemed to me that when we were talking about the Guild 's struggle for a foothold in Hollywood and Sammy 's struggle for a stranglehold , we were talking about two different things . That only showed how much I had to learn about Hollywood and the Guild and , in spite of all these years and all my lessons , Sammy Glick . A few days later the Megaphone had a new headline that they were so happy about , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of it . OPPOSITION GROUP FORMS WITHIN GUILD ! Responding to a rising tide of resentment among Guild members against their Executive Board for selling out their autonomy to the group of Eastern racketeers and Reds who controlled the Authors ' League , the news story chortled , the responsible element has formed a Committee of Five who have pledged themselves to rescue the writers ' ship from the hands of the crackpots and adventurers and steer it back to the port of sanity again . The five distinguished gentlemen who were so unselfishly volunteering their time and prestige to rescue their fellow artists from destructionwere Lawrence Paine , Harold Godfrey Wilson , John McCarter , Robert Griffin and  --  Sammy Glick . Things had been moving so fast that it did n't even seem strange to me any more than this copy-boy punk of mine should be taking it for granted that he was one of the spokesmen for the Guild elite without , as far as I could detect , ever having written a line . As I watched Sammy at the big-shot writers ' table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell it was all going to end and how many pairs of shoes Sammy must have collected by now and whether he was twenty-four years old or twenty-five . I caught up with Kit on our way out and we fell in step . " Take a walk with me , " she said.  |p167We  walked out past the sound stages and the machine shops and the labor gangs to the back lot . We walked past the New York street and up through the Latin Quarter of Paris until we came to a South Sea Island with a little beach leading down to real water . We crossed a little bridge to the island and sat down on the sand in front of a native hut . The hot April sun was just what the set designer ordered . I dug my hands into the warm sand and lay on my back , looking up through a palm tree supported with piano wire , at the cloudless sky . " Where are we ? " I said . " This used to be Hollywood , " she said with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If a rescue ship comes by , " I said , " hide . " She gave a little laugh that seemed to release her inside . We both lay back and laughed in the sun , not so much at what we were saying but at the idea of being on a desert island together . She started to say something else and I got ready to laugh again but she crossed me up . " Those sons of bitches . " " Who ? " I said . I was still on our island . " The Committee of Five , " she said . " What do you think ? " I said . " The panic is on , " she said . " Some of the boys seem to think they 're just sucking around for better jobs , " I said . " Others think it 's the Executive Board 's fault for pushing things too fast . You do n't know what to think . " " I know what to think , " she said . " But what are they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do they get out of it ? " " I do n't think you can settle that with one answer , " she said . " Because they 're all doing the same thing for different reasons . Start with Larry Paine , for instance . " Listening to her gave me the impression of watching a river moving too swiftly , cutting its banks down sharp and straight , uncompromisingly . " Larry 's a good writer . But a complicated one . There 's nothingP168like a rich man 's son who 's done a little starving , just enough to scare him into becoming a self-made man . He 's a recluse and the kind of a drinker who reaches for that bottle when he wakes up in the morning . Something 's gone wrong . The way he laughs , for instance . It gets louder and harsher until I do n't know what it becomes , but it is n't laughter . And those eyes , everybody notices those sunken , hurt eyes . He 's been nursing his paranoia along for years . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his individuality ! " She ran through the other four more rapidly . " Harold Godfrey Wilson is an old boozer who had written himself out ten years ago , and Jack McCarter is a young boozer who never had anything ill him to write out and just coasted in behind Wilson . " Bob Griffin , she thought , was one of the most competent writersin the industry , naturally conservative but with a **34;6954;TOOLONG . " I think the only trouble with Bob is that he has read one too many editorials in the Megaphone about our being cannibalistically inclined toward producers and wanting to replace Louis B. Mayer with Joe Stalin . " And I believe , " she concluded , " that you can hazard a guess at Mr. Glick 's motives . And that is the Sanity Five that has volunteered to lead the writers to their New Jerusalem . " " How much support do you think they have ? " I said . " Nobody knows , " she said . " They still have ten days to work over the membership before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organized before . It 's hard to say how we 'll hold up . Sitting up there on the platform with the Board all year , I 've had a chance to watch the membership react . They blow hot and cold . Maybe that 's because they 're high-strung and they 're individualisticand , except for the handful of left-wingers , none of them knows a labor tactic from a sacrifice scene . " And of course they have n't learned to work together . With longshoremen or fruit pickers that probably grows right out of their jobs . But with us it 's just the opposite . We 're pitted against each other . Two or three times I 've worked on the same script with somebody else without either of us knowing it . That 's likeP 169rubbing two fighting cocks together . I 'd say it 's fifty-fifty right now as to whether the Guild weathers the storm or not . " She looked at her watch . " Time to go to work , " she said , and jumped nimbly to her feet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed enough of the industry for one day ? Or shall we go back to the office and commit sabotage by writing the stinkingest scenes we possibly can ? " " I only hope Mr. Fineman does n't think my treatment of Masaryk is sabotage , " I said , as we started back toward the writers ' building again . Those were the Ten Days That Shook Hollywood . It was earthquakeweather . Writers woke up excited or went to bed frightened . They fought battles of words in which the injuries sustained were nervous stomach and insomnia . One of the first casualties was Julian , who dropped into my office on his way home that Friday evening . " How would you like to come down to the beach for lunch tomorrow ? " he said gravely . I said I would like to but I had planned to come back to the studio because I wanted to get my treatment in before the end of the month and the rumpus all week had put me behind schedule . " I 've asked Kit too , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over with you . " " Okay , " I said , " I guess I can work late tonight instead . " We drove out in her car with the top down . We drove past Westwood Village , the home of UCLA , which is either the model for Hollywood 's version of campus life or vice versa ; past Sawtelle , the Old Soldiers ' Home , where veterans of our more recent wars live out their days watching cars go by ; past Santa Monica with its swanky swimming clubs and its public beaches , where bronzed and pretty girls in little bathing suits wear sailor hats and munch hot dogs as they skip barefooted across the blistering pavement to the sand . Then we turned north up the coast highway curving top170the shore , bordered by matchbox cottages , snug and dilapidated , with names like Crow 's Nest and Joe 's joynt . Finally we reached a group of cottages which were a little newer , with the paint not yet eaten away by the salt air , and one of these was Julian 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The long narrowdining room faced the sea , which was so close to us that big waves would shake the walls and send the surf swishing up below us . Blanche was one of those efficient little Jewish mothers who look as if that was what they were meant for from their first moment of puberty . Julian was dressed more informally than I had ever seen him before , in a loose-fitting dungaree suit and beach sandals , but he would never look really sporty . In spite of his natural graveness , he did his best to be jolly through lunch , but his sensitivity was of too simple a kind to conceal his uneasiness . Later , sitting on his porch overlooking the ocean , we heard the cause of it . " You know , " he said , " all the time that I 've been working at World-Wide I 've been working from week to week , without a contract . Two days ago , " he continued sadly , " they offered me a seven-year contract . Beginning at five hundred dollars a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in his mouth and looked out at his ocean . All of us knew what he meant . There had been lots of rumors flying around World-Wide that writers were being offered unusuallyattractive contracts in order to tempt them into breaking the Guild provision . But I had n't really believed it . This was the first actual case I had heard of . Kit and I had been called in to help Julian wrestle with his conscience . I did n't say anything . I watched Kit . " Unless all of us are free agents two years from now the Guild is licked , " she said . " God knows , none of us want to strike . But if we are n't even in a position to threaten one , we 're just charging a machine gun with our bare hands and we might as well fold . " P171Julian looked as if he were going to burst out crying . Blanche was upset . " That 's all right for you to say , Miss Sargent . You 're all established . But Julian is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . . . Jesus , what a hell of a complicated world , I thought . Here is a kid who is finally getting the break he 's been waiting for and deserves and he 's dying to take it , and who the hell can blame him , and Kit , that coldhearted humanitarian , is n't going to let him . " Julian might still be ghost writing if it were n't for the Guild , " she said . " Of course , if we ever have a Guild shop in Hollywood , all the interests of writers will be protected ; but the ones it will help most are the boys like Julian , who are n't able to take any kind of a stand alone . " " Then what does he pay his agent ten percent for ? " Blanche said . " Agents can help just so much . But when we were asked to take that fifty-percent cut my first year out here , the agents were swept along with the rest of us . You probably do n't remember , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have to take it . " Julian kept turning his head from Blanche to Kit as if he were watching a tennis match . I tried to make out which side he was on . He looked miserable when Kit spoke and even more miserable when Blanche retaliated . " You know I 'm for the Guild , " he broke in . " I joined as soon as I was eligible . But , God , when I think of the difference between five hundred a week and losing my job ... " " Who says you 're going to lose your job ? " Kit said , almost angrily . " Sammy , " Julian said . " He had a talk with me yesterday . He told me what a damn fool he thought I was , if I did n't sign it . He said he had it confidentially from the front office that if I did n't sign it I 'd never work for World-Wide again . " Oh , Sammy , you frantic marathoner , I thought , you bastard I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can you possibly ask him to turn it down ? " Blanche said . Blanche is right , I thought . Blanche is right and Kit is right and never the twain shall meet . " I 'm not asking him to turn it down , " Kit said relentlessly . " That 's something you 'll have to decide yourselves . All I can do is tell you what turning it down means . " Nebbish , poor Julian , I thought . When we left , the sun was taking its evening dip , slipping down into the ocean inch by inch like a fat woman afraid of the water . Instead of turning back toward Hollywood , we started north , just driving anywhere with the top down and the sunset just beyond our reach . The ocean and the clouds were red when we started out , soon after deep purple with a splinter moon giving the night a subtle , indirect lighting . We drove up past Malibu , left the last houses behind . The beach had disappeared and in its place were turbulent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the road stretched pasture lands and cultivatedfields . As we took a hairpin turn Kit said , " There 's my little beach down there . " I saw nothing but steep rocks below us piling into the water . " You ca n't see it from the road , " she said . " The rocks are too high around it . I found it one hot day driving up to Frisco . It 's a beautiful place to go swimming in the raw . " " How would you like to go in now ? " I said . She put her foot on the brake . " Okay , " she said . " It might be warm enough . " " But how can we get dry ? " I said , a little panicky . " We have n't any towels . " " I 'll look in the rumble , " she said . " I think I have some with my tennis stuff . " " I hope so , " I said unconvincingly . She found them . I almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the little beach that lay concealed and vir-P173ginal below . Natural hydraulics working overtime for a couple of million years had scooped it right out of the cliffs . " Quite an improvement on our last island , " I said . " Unless that moon is being held up by piano wire . " " I 've named it Glick 's Lagoon , " she said . " Because it 's the last stronghold of individualism . " " Was Sammy ever down here with you ? " She shook her head . " I pointed it out to him once . But he did n't want to stop . No one ever taught him how to play . " We undressed silently , seeing each other only as silhouettes . She was ready first and did n't wait for me . Out of the corner of my eye I saw her moving swiftly toward the water , her tanned arms and legs and head blending into the dark , the rest of her body that had been concealed from the sun looking from the back like a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hipless , V-shaped from her waist to her broad shoulders . The water was so cold it made my heart feel like an ice cube . I plowed madly , determined to stay in as long as she did . Her stroke was a smooth rhythmic crawl . She swam out beyond me and back and said , " Ready to go in ? " " Yes , " I said with half a dozen y 's through chattering teeth . " But I 'll have to dive down and find my feet first . I think they both dropped off . " " They 'll probably come in with the tide , " she said . Five minutes later we were dressed again , warm and dry withtowels around our heads and our bodies tingling . We sat therewith our arms around our knees , catching our breath . " What are you thinking about ? " she said . " Julian , " I said . " How awfully sorry I feel for Julian . " " Poor little guy , " she said . " That 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Jesus , you were cold-blooded . I almost felt like telling him to take that contract . " " That 's what he asked us down to tell him , " she said . " He was right on the borderline . One word of sympathy would have been enough to tip him the other way . "   " I do n't like it , " I said . " I 'll be damned if I do . This is n't just a character you can X-out and rewrite . This is a guy 's life you 're playing around with . " " Whatever we do , " she said , " we have to do it all the way . If we want a Guild we have to fight it through . We ca n't have half a Guild . It 's like a strike . You either scab or you try to stop the scabs . But you ca n't strike and feel sorry for the scabs at the same time . " " Why not ? " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life they are n't getting . The poor scabs are in the same boat . I saw strikers beat hell out of a scab in my hometownonce . He was just a desperate , hungry little guy . Being a scab was n't his idea of what he wanted to do in this world . " " That 's pity , " she said . " Pity is always good for a couple of Christmas baskets for the poor . But that leaves **32;6990;TOOLONG days to take care of . Your attitude is very picturesque , from a distance . But try bringing it closer home . What do you think Sammy is but a desperate , hungry little guy ? " It was true . He was going around being desperate in a $150 tailor-made suit . He was hungrier than ever after five-dollar dinnersat Marcel 's . " But Sammy is still in the Guild , " I said . " I think you ought to try to get together with his bunch . Work out some sort of a compromise , maybe . It does n't seem fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sammy joined the Guild when it did n't cost anything , " she said . " Everybody was doing it and it was absolutely safe . But now I think he 's getting ready to jump . All he 's waiting for is a nice , soft spot to land . " " Just the same , " I argued , " his bunch is still a powerful minorityin the Guild . I think you ought to give them the benefit of the doubt . " " The trouble with you , " she said , " is that you 're too goddam good . But I 'll think it over . I 'll put it up to the Board . " p 175The headline in the Megaphone the following Saturday read : PREDICT CIVIL WAR AT GUILD SESSION TONIGHT ! But we did n't have to wait that long . All the writers on our lot  --  some fifty or sixty of us  --  were called together in one of the projection rooms just before lunch . And I can think of nothing better calculated to take away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us seemed to be strung together with high-tension wires . The program began with Dan Young , the barrel-bodied , red-faced , right here at this studio to his present importancewas a devastating argument for writers giving up the Guild foolishness and making the studio one big happy family . He even hinted that those who refused to participate in his family life ( on his terms ) would find themselves led by the hand to the studio gate and told never to darken his payroll again . After he finished , to cautious applause , he introduced the next speaker , the white-haired boy of the happy family , whom he laughingly described as " a member of your own ranks who seems to have a little more sense than the rest of you . " Sammy Glick informed us that we would get further by voting the way the studio was asking us to . If he had used the first person singular instead of the plural he would have been right . On the way out Sammy caught up with me and took my arm protectively . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " After all everybody 's got to look out for Number One . " " Sure , " I said , " but we ca n't all have a genius for it like you have . " I strolled back to the office with Kit . " We could n't have done better if we had organized that meeting ourselves , " she said . " That won more votes for us than it did for them . I was afraidP176a little pressure like that might run the boys out of the Guild . But it only seemed to pull them together . Now they 're really sore . " " Where do you think Sammy is going to end up ? " I said . " It depends on what kind of a deal he can make with Young , " she said . " He 's probably holding out for **39;7024;TOOLONG ! " The police department had taken the Megaphone 's prediction of civil war at the membership meeting seriously . Twenty or thirty policemen had planted themselves ominously around the hall to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six hundred writers filling the auditorium . Just before the meeting opened Kit stopped at my seat on her way to the platform and said animatedly , " Well , Al , it looks as if it 's going to be run your way . " Then she was up there , facing the microphone . She ran her hand back over her hair once firmly , the way she always did before she began to speak . She spoke with an emphasis and implication of surprise that caught the membership immediately . " For the past four weeks , which we will always look back on fondly as the Days of the Terror ... "  --  she waited for her laugh  --  " there has been mounting confusion on the question of Guild autonomy . To satisfy those critics of the Authors ' League amalgamationplan who honestly fear the loss of our independence , I propose that we vote tonight only on the principle of affiliation with the League , reserving the right to postpone official action on it until the membership is reassured that this does not mean the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow , Mars or the dining room of the Algonquin . " I thought of our talk that evening at Glick 's Lagoon . Now I knew what she meant by getting my way . Lawrence Paine was recognized from the floor . Everyone leaned forward , expecting him to light the fuse that would set off the explosion . His gaunt , melancholy face was almost expressionless.  | " I would like to second Miss Sargent 's motion , " he said and sat down . Almost the entire audience rose spontaneously . The applause lasted several minutes . Dignified writers jumped up on their feet and whistled . They were n't cheering Paine . They were cheering the miracle of unity and peace . The next move was a great piece of showmanship . " It is very appropriate , " the President announced , " that the second motion we must vote on tonight will be made by a member who this morning turned down a major studio seven-year contract doubling his salary . " Julian walked onto the platform . His reception was deafening . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else , we like to think of ourselves as the blase , sophisticated people . And the first teaspoonful of emotion lays us right in the aisles . He stood up there self-conscious and heroic and stiff with stage fright , a typewritten sheet of paper trembling in his hand . " I move , " he stammered , " that this meeting approve the action of the Executive Board in ordering us not to sign contracts bindingus and our material for more than two years from today and that this Article XII remain in effect until the Producers ' Committeeopens negotiations with us for a minimum basic agree-ment . " This motion was seconded by none other than that courageous champion of the underdog , Samuel Glick . Now I am ready to face my Maker , I thought . For five years I 've been waiting for Sammy Glick to make one positive gesture in the direction of the Brotherhoodof Man . Now I can die in peace . It might have been a positive gesture , but it was n't exactly a modest gesture . That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regeneration stuff that has made so many pretty endings for the movies . Sammy raised his hand importantly to halt the applause . " As the spokesman for our Committee , " he said , " I wish to add that at a conciliation meeting with your Board just before we came in tonight , all differences were ironed out and our Committeep178pledged its support to the two motions on the floor . As loyal members of the Guild we are ready to carry out this pledge . " The audience sounded like a rooting section just after its team scored the winning touchdown . Sammy stood there at the mike longer than he had to , taking the bows . Suddenly everybody was loving everybody else . The cops must have thought the world had really gone nuts . They are sent to prevent screen writers from butchering each other and the crazy bastards do nothing but get up and make love to each other . Everything after that was passed by acclamation . Someone got up and urged that all the Guild officers be re-elected as a gesture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit took the mike again to propose that Paine , Wilson , McCarter , Griffin and Glick be added to the Executive Board , to demonstrate the Guild 's concern for safeguarding the interests of the minority elements , and we all roared Aye again . The meeting was topped by an almost unanimous vote in favor of the two motions , and as much of the audience as possible adjourned to celebrate in the bar across the street . We all piled into the gaudy little joint and turned an early May evening into a New Year 's Eve midnight , only this time we really had something to celebrate . Sammy and Kit and I buried the hatchet in a bottle of Scotch . " Hey , Kit , what did I tell ya ? " I kept repeating myself , being very gay and probably very boring . " This way everybody 's happy . Is n't this just what I said ought a happen ? " Or I 'd pound Sammy 's sturdy little chest and tell him , " Sammy Glick , you of bastard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what I think of you ? Well , when you were shoveling it at the studio this morning , I says to myself : There goes the biggest sonofabitch in the whole goddam world . It 's like the movie ads . Know what I mean , Sammy ? See Sammy Glick in Ima Sonofabitch . Even bigger than last week , bigger ' n when he played Al Manheim for a sucker in the Record office , bigger every minute . But tonight ! Tonight you really fooled me , Sammy . You finally came through and I 'm proud of you . Hey , bartender , hit us allp 179again and put your goddam money away , Kit , this one is on me . " And Sammy , drinking and kidding but never abandoned , " Well , Al , I 'm really tickled to death . I think you and Kit had me pegged wrong about being against the Guild , but now that it 's patched up I know our outfit 's going to go places and I 'm all for it . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sammy were actually going to stop running . Maybe he 's decided he 's gone as far as he needs and now he can cut off the motor and stop running people down . That thought made me very happy . It 's wonderful what a few drinks of Scotch will do on an empty brain . The following day was Saturday and , after we knocked off at noon , Sammy took us to the swank tennis club he was very proud of joining . I could n't see where Sammy had had time enough to attend to his private needs properly , much less learn tennis , but he had . VVe started volleying , and I thought this is one place where Sammy eats humble pie , but he started right off hitting them back one after another without much style but with plenty of confidence . " When the hell did you learn this ? " I yelled across the net . " I just started taking lessons two weeks ago , " he said . " From the best teacher in the country . Five dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't have to , " I said . " I 've been playing tennis since I was a kid . " As a matter of fact , I looked very lousy . My eye was off and I was wild as hell . " I 'll play you for dough , " he said , " and beat you . " I 've always thought tennis is a better indication of character than handwriting or any of those other things they use . For instance , I liked to just get out there and slug the ball until I worked up a good sweat knocking most of the balls outside withoutpaying too much attention to the score . Of the three of us Kit was the closest to a tennis player . She served her second serve justp180as hard as her first , chasing after her ball to the net and holding her ground with a good sense of volley and a stiff net game . Sammy was always reminding you of the score , especially if he were ahead . He played a smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puny shots count by mixing up maddeninglobs with shrewd little drop shots . We played a couple of sets of doubles with one of the good club kids , whom Sammy promptly chose as his partner , and then Kit beat Sammy 6  --  3 and then Sammy turned around and beat me io  --  8 , in spite of the fact that I looked three or four times as good as he did and had him set point half a dozen times . I really think the margin between us was that he objected to losing more than I did . He had to win the little things just as much as the big ones ; and the more I thought of it , the more incredible it seemed that he had backed down on his Guild position the way he had the night before . A few nights later I was sitting in bed reading when there was a knock on the door . I grabbed for my robe , surprised that anyone would be knocking , more surprised to find Kit . " Well , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink ? " She followed me into the kitchenette while I poured one for each of us . " I 'm afraid we congratulated ourselves a little too soon , " she said . " Tonight Sammy and his playmates came to their first Board meeting . And it turned out to be their last . " I could feel it coming . I could feel him running again . " Well , they walked out on us , " she said . " Just got up and calmly announced they were resigning and walked out . Just told us what we could do with our pledges and took a powder . " She was still too overwhelmed to be really sore . It was the first time I had ever seen her really ruffled . " My God ! All of them ? " " All except Bob Griffin . He was absolutely furious . He said , Boys and girls , everything in Hollywood always seems to run toP181the super-colossal . I only regret that the Committee of which I have been an active member had to give you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised that he was going to stick with us to follow through the compromise program that the so-called Sanity Committee had pledged itself to . He was really magnificent . I had a hunch about him . You may not always agree with him but at least his convictions are never for sale . He ended up by saying , They say keeping pledges is a Rover-Boyish sentiment . I guess I 'll just never grow up . ' " " Do you think Sammy and his pals were bought out ? " " I do n't know , " Kit said . " I 'm too mixed up to think anything tonight . But I felt Griffin thinks so . " " What 's the pay-off going to be ? " I said . She shook her head back and forth several times wearily . " Oh , hell , I do n't know , Al . I guess it 'll be interesting to see . If we live through it . " We did n't have to wait very long . The next morning there were rumors flying around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in resignations . First I heard ten and then I heard a hundred . Writers gave each other funny looks as they passed the stories around . What do you think , pals ? they were asking each other silently , think we 're licked , think it 's getting time to quit ? It was funny , that hot-and-cold business , the same pressure that made them so tough the day of the meeting was beginning to break them down now . Even though Sammy , Paine , Wilson and McCarter could n't have had more than forty or fifty followers , their unexpected run-out had sprung a leak in the hull for fear to rush in . And before the leak could be repaired it was torn wide open with another broadside . Dan Young called us all into the projection room again . His big red face was wrinkled in a triumphant grin . " Boys , " he said . " If I thought that every writer in Hollywood wanted this Guild , believe me I 'd be for it myself one hundred percent . But how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't even agree among yourselves ? Some of the biggest writersP182have quit already  --  and we understand more resignations are coming in every hour . Now what do you say we forget about the whole business  --  try to make World-Wide one big happy family the way we used to be ? " He paused and smiled again . " Okay , boys , that 's all , " he said casually . " You 're going to be given resignation forms on your way out . You can turn them in to me any time within the next forty-eight hours . " He did n't say what would happen to us if we did n't . He did n't have to . Sammy Glick would attend to that , the Sammy Glicks . We sat there passively , not thinking together any more , but each one alone and afraid , each one thinking of his own wife and his own script that was just beginning to come along so well and his own house in Beverly or Westwood or overlooking the ocean . We walked out as if those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each one of us thought he was the only one to have . I tried to sign that form all afternoon . I knew I was a dope if I did n't , but somehow I just could n't get around to it . I stuck a sheet of paper in my typewriter and started to write about Masaryk . But I found myself wondering what Masaryk would do if he had been asked to resign from the Guild . So I put on my coat and went home early . I did n't feel like seeing anybody so I got a little food out of the icebox and had supper alone , just me and that damned piece of paper . Then I sat there in a ringside seat for the wrestling match between my conscience and my ambition , a fight to the finish , with a forty-eight-hour time-limit and finally I left them there on the canvas with a headlock on each other and called Kit . " Kit ? Did I wake you up ? " " No , I just got in . I was running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Listen , Kit , " I said . " I 've been wanting to talk to you all night . I guess I 'd like to be a hero and flush this goddam resignation blank down the drain . But there 's no use kidding myself . I feel likeP 183a tug-of-war , the whole damned business , the rope and both teams pulling . " I expected her to give me a good shot in the arm , but all she said was , " I know , Al . It 's very tough . " " Oh , Christ , " I said , " I suppose I 'm making it a lot tougher than it is , but I was just beginning to get the feel of this picture thing . This Masaryk job was  --  it still is exciting as hell , and Finemanis a swell gent ; there 's an awful lot I could learn from him . And yet I just ca n't see myself pulling a Sammy Glick . " " It is n't quite that bad , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hear we have two hundred resignations already . I do n't feel like telling anybody to go out and be a martyr . " " You did n't worry like that about Julian . " " That 's different , " she said . " That 's when it looked as if we were going to win . We had to take that chance . And then , well , maybe I am being a little selfish about it . " That was a landmark . I would always remember it as the first sign of affection . " Are you going to sign it , Kit ? " " No , " she said . " But frankly , I 'm in a much better spot . Three or four of my best credits all happened to come along this year . And they seem to feel that Keeler and I are clicking as a writerdirectorteam . Of course , this may change their minds . But it does take less courage for me to hold out . " " In other words , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm afraid that 's a lonely battle you 've got to fight out with yourself , " she said . " But I would n't feel you were ratting out if you did . It 's too late for that . " " Okay , Kit , " I said . " Thanks . I 'll think it over . See you tomorrow . When I went in to the studio next morning the form was still unsigned , but I had made up my mind . For a guy who did n't care six months ago whether the screen writers were organized into aP184Guild or a sewing circle I had gone down the line for them every way I could . It had to stop somewhere . After all , I had come out here to be a writer , not a second John L. Lewis . So I took the paper out and scribbled my name at the bottom quickly , as if trying to keep myself from knowing what I was doing . Then I went to work and I began to see my story again because my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Sammy Glick came in . I had n't talked to him since his famous coup d'etat . I had passed him in the hall a couple of times and had thought of saying something insulting , but what was the use . I had said it all the day he marched in when I was n't looking and invaded four inches into my column a long time ago . Anything I would have told him now would have just given him a laugh and maybe given me ulcers . He came in with a smile stretching from his right ear to that flower he always wore in his lapel . I went on typing . He slung his leg over the corner of my desk . I looked up . In his hand was my resignation blank . " Well , I see you 're being smart for once , " he said . I tried to remember if Sammy had ever handed me a complimentbefore . " That 's just what I dropped in to check with you about , " he said . " I did n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Has n't Julian signed it ? " I said . " I 'm washed up with that sap for good , " Sammy said . " He 's hopeless . He does n't know to wipe himself . " Nebbish , poor Julian , a hero with quaking knees and a stomach full of butterflies . " Well , now that you 're using your head for something besides butting against a stone wall , " Sammy said , " I think I can put you onto a good thing . Julian was beginning to get too much dough to work with me anyway . I need somebody in the lower brackets  --  to balance what I 'm getting . So , while I was getting my massage this morning , it hit me like a ton of scripts . Why the hell do n't I get Al ? He needs a break and he 's just what I need . So you 're being transferred to our unit tomorrow . We 're going to have ap185helluva picture  --  we just got word this morning that we can get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an A credit right off the bat . And , if you click , I 'm liable to let you in on something really big that I 'm not able to break yet . " " It 's very nice of you to rearrange my life for me this way , " I said , " but what about Masaryk ? " " Listen , my fine-feathered frand , " he said , " between you and me and Louella O. Parsons you 're just writing for the shelf . That anti-fascist stuff has n't got a prayer . Why do you think Metro scrapped It Ca n't Happen Here ? It 's lousy for the English market . A producer who just got back told me that at lunch the other day . England does n't want to get Hitler and Mussolini sore . " He yanked his lapel-watch out of his breast pocket . " Jesus , I better run  --  I 've got a date with Frank , Frank Collier  --  to look at the rushes on Monsoon . The stuff is coming through terrific . Keep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was off . I stood up and looked at that resignation blank . I studied the signature that Sammy had complimentedme on placing there . I had a crazy impulse to make an airplane out of it and send it diving down into the studio street . But instead I just folded it double and began to shred it into the wastebasket . I really felt sorry for Mr. Fineman when he had to call me in and tell me I was being closed out . This was not his way . He felt guilty and powerless . " I 'm afraid Masaryk is going on the shelf for a while and I have n't got another assignment for you at the mo-ment . " He wanted to say more , but even if he had been able to , it would have been superfluous because the sympathy in his eyes , in his handshake , said it for him . All I ever ask of a writer is that he deliver , he was trying to tell me . All I ask is that he loves to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the industry that means anything , and if that kind of loyalty comes through his work , whether he spendsp186his nights in Main Street brothels or Writers Guild meetings is none of my business . " But I want you to know I liked your work , and I 'd like to do a picture with you some time . All the luck , Manheim . " For the next two weeks my agent tried to get me an interview at the studios , but everywhere he went he got the same answer : They were n't taking on new writers just now . I sat by the phone like an extra boy hoping for that call from Central Casting . When it rang a voice started talking a mile a minute . " Oh , you dumb son-of-a-bitch , you glutton for punishment , you momser you . " " Where the hell are you , in a pay phone ? Where you do n't want to waste time saying hello ? " " Listen to him , " Sammy said . " He 's going down for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Al , I do n't know whether I 'm just getting soft or whether I 'm queer for you . But I 'm going to give you one more chance . " " I did n't do it , mister , honest , do n't hit me again , " I said . " Listen , Al , " he said , " I do n't see what you have to be so goddam cheerful about . I kept telling you . But you would n't listen to me . You had to stick your neck out like a giraffe . Now you really bitched yourself up . But good . But I 've got some influence in this town now and there may still be an outside chance of cleaning you up . Now here 's what I want you to do . Larry Paine is having a little get-together at his place tonight and I thought you might be doing yourself a hell of a lot of good if you came ... " This seemed to be a good chance to find out what the boys were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curiosity as to how this was going to quicken the already mercurial pace of Mr. Glick . Paine 's home was an old plantation in Bel Air . The butler showed me into the bar , where I found the Four Horsemen , Paine , Wilson , McCarter and Glick , entertaining fifteen or twenty other writers . I spotted Lorna Flint , the old silent star who was in the writing game on a raincheck , George Pancake and my epic poet , Henry Powell Turner . P187After two or three drinks , the party turned out to be a meeting . Lawrence Paine called us to order and congratulated us on being the founding fathers of a new writers ' organization , the Association of Photodramatists . We , he informed us , were to have much the same aims as the defunct Screen Writers Guild , except that we would be a more select group , with a more discreet program . Then Sammy nominated Paine as President , Jack McCarter seconded it and Sammy announced that he had been unanimously elected , although my right hand had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nominated Henry Powell Turner for Vice-President . Turner rose , jowly and almost bald now , and I noticed how his fingers trembled as they reached to clutch the back of the seat in front of him . " I regret that it will not be practical for me to accept this office , " he explained . " For I am quitting Hollywood for good , to devote myself exclusively to poetry again , as soon as I finish my present assignment . " So the Vice-President of the Association of Photodramatists turned out to be Sammy Glick . After Wilson and McCarter were honored with the remaining offices , we were all invited to sign up as charter members . Pancake signed with a flourish and handed me the pen . " I thought you were opposed to writers ' organizations ? " I said . " This one is different , " he said righteously . " You said it ! " Sammy cut in . " These guys know what side their contract is buttered on . " He looked down the list officiously . " Where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In my wallet , " I said . " What the hell is the matter with you ? " he said . " I 've just been through one war , " I said . " I do n't think I could take another . " " There 's not going to be any war , " he said . " I got it all fixed . "  | " How about recognition ? " I said . " The Guild 's been battling over that for years . " " That shows you how smart your Guild is , " he said . " We 're going to be recognized right off the bat . I got it straight from Dan Young . What do you think of that ? " " I think that 's very interesting , " I said . " What were you and Young doing discussing the recognition of an organization that had n't even been formed yet , much less elected spokesmen ? " " I thought it would n't do any harm to sound him out on the idea , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " So you and Young decided that it was wrong for the Guild with nine hundred members to representall the writers in Hollywood , but all right for your Photodramatistswith twenty members ? " " That 's because they know we have the industry at heart , " Sammy explained . " They know they can trust us . " " Oh , " I said . He put his hand on my arm intimately . " Come outside a moment , Al . I want to talk to you . " We walked along the edge of the pool . Sammy 's tone was conspiratorially important . " You know I told you the other day I had something I was n't ready to break yet ? Well , it still has n't quite jelled , but there 's a good chance I wo n't be writing much longer . I 'll be on the hiring end ... " Sammy paused to take a deep , proud draw on his cigar . I wondered if this was the price of his sell-out tactics in the Guild . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed only fitting that he should become a supervisorby climbing over hundreds of other writers . All I could think of to say was , " I 'll be god-damned . " " Shut up and listen , " he ordered . " If this thing goes through , I 'm thinking of keeping a writer with me all the time . You know , someone who 's loyal to me . What 's the percentage in going down with the Guild when you can waltz into a set-up like that ? So why not be smart for once and join an outfit that 's strictly class ? " p 189 " Sammy , " I said , " why not try not being smart for once ? Just once . " Sammy 's voice knifed cold through the night air . " Okay , Al , I was only trying to help you . But if you have n't learned by this time that it 's every man for himself , it 's no skin off my ass . It 's your funeral . " Sammy thrust his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Photodramatists , taking long brisk strides with his head down as if he were bucking a stiff wind . It was the great-man walk he was developing . The next evening there was another little meeting in Hollywood . But this gathering was small for another reason , it was not a beginning , but an ending . The Guild had called its members to a final reckoning . It wanted to learn whether it was still in existence . A handful of us stood around the door hopefully as the survivors straggled in . When the meeting began the room was so empty that the Presidentasked us all to move up , so we would n't look so desolate . It was a sad and splendid little meeting full of the warmth and understanding toward each other that people have to dig deep in themselves to tap , which they only reveal when their farms have been washed away by flood or their homes blown off the earth by bombs or when somebody dies . I looked around and smiled at friends I had never met or talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to be . Some of those who had been the most belligerent and loudest were gone . But Bob Griffin was there , for some reason he would probablynever be able to explain even to himself . And Julian , a shade paler than usual , faint from fright at his own courage , wanting nothing more from life than that little yellow house with the surf splashing up below it , martyring himself because he could n't learn how to run , forward or backward . Kit topped the evening off with a little hail-and-farewell speech190 I I BUDD SCHULBERGP190that somehow managed to sound hard-boiled and idealistic at the same time . " In four hectic weeks we have seen our Guild murdered by a small group of willful ( for want of a better name ) men with only one allegiance  --  to themselves . Our President has asked me to deliver the funeral oration but I 'm afraid any elegy would be out of place because I have a feeling that the corpse is going to be very obstinate about being buried . " Afterwards Kit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our beer . In one corner of the joint somebody was playing a Louie Armstrong in a jukebox and in the other those two exvaudevilleheadliners were singing familiar songs that everybody has forgotten . And yet there was something nice and peaceful about the place . The only discordant note was a recent discovery of Julian 's that began to round out the picture of Sammy Glick , union member and all-around Brother of Man . " Yesterday when I went back to clean out my desk  --  by the way , I 'm no longer employed by World-Wide  --  I could hear Mr. Wilson shouting at the top of his voice  --  you know he has the office next to mine . Well , I could n't make out what he was saying , but I thought I heard something about Sammy and it sounded interesting , so I used a trick I learned in that mystery picture we did : I put an empty glass against the wall and pressed my ear against it . " Wilson was doing the worst cursing I ever heard . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling Sammy every dirty name under the sun . After a while I began to get it . Son-of-a-bitch-bastard ! ' Wilson was howling , For ten years the one thing I want is to be a producer . I figure the best way to get my break is to lead the stampede out of the Guild like the studio wants . And then , when it looks like I 'm all set , a little jerk who could be my son , God forbid , beats me to the punch ! ' " It seemed a rather devious way of becoming a producer  --  but there it was . We all got hysterical at Julian 's picture of Wilson foaming at the mouth because Sammy had appropriated the fruitsp191of his treachery , but it would have been funnier if it had n't contained so much horror , the horror of a foetus called Sammy Glick sprinting out of his mother 's womb , turning life into a race in which the only rules are fight for the rail and elbow on the turns and the only finish line is death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " It 's getting so a man is n't even safe being a louse any more . " " Wilson ought to picket in front of Sammy 's office , " I added . " Sammy Glick Is Unfair to Organized Double-Crossers ! " The next day I got a call from my agent . " Hello , " he said . " How are you at dishwashing or making paper flowers ? Because I 'm afraid you 'd better start looking for another trade . " " Is it that bad ? " " Tough , " he said . " Very tough . Jesus , I did n't know you were one of the ringleaders of the Guild . " " Neither did I , " I said . " So I 'm really on the blacklist ? " " If there was a blacklist , I guess you 'd be on it , all right , " he said . " But they do n't need anything like that in this chummy little business . All it takes is a couple of big shots happening to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chasen 's and passing the word along . That 's why you should have played ball . " " I know , " I said . " I 've been following the career of the greatest ballplayer of them all . " " What the hell are you talking about ? " he said . " About Joe DiMaggio , " I said . " Skip it , pal . " I guess I was just thinking I was back where I came from again , watching the kid run for a high one in the old Stadium . It was to be the last dinner before I caught the train for New York in the morning . " Where shall it be for dinner ? " I said . " Let 's make it some place special . " " Oh , I think it 's only fitting that you pay your respects to the192 I I BUDD SCHULBERGp192Derby , " Kit said . " It 's the Hollywood version of the farewell visit to the college chapel . " We sat in the Derby watching the people watch each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit said . " If you watch an animal while it eats , it stops . But here in the Derby several hundred people pay and pay well for the privilege . " " And of watching everybody else , " I said . Everybody turned to stare at the foreign star who had just come in with her husband and her new lover . She walked between then with a haughty pride , the way one does with Russian wolfhounds . " Look at that poor bastard , " Kit said , pointing out the husband , a big director in Europe who had n't been able to get a job here and who seemed to be laughing gaily at something the lover had just said . " He knows everybody in the room read about his wife and that other guy in Parsons ' column this morning , and he 's feeling just terribly modern and Noel Coward . " " And lousy , " I added . I looked around the Derby , at the familiar faces , at the faces I had never seen before but which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at the caricatures on the wall which seemed to be unconsciously mocking them all . Then I suddenly heard a familiar voice . " Saw your picture , Dave . Tuhriffic ! " I knew who it was before I spotted him , several tables down the aisle . No voice carried quite like Sammy 's . He had stopped at Dave Roberts 's table , draping himself over it to embrace the famous director . " There he blows ! " I said . " Blows is right ! " Kit answered . " Tuhriffic ! " Sammy was exclaiming . " You made me cry . You know what a tough audience I am and I swear to God when that little kid comes home Christmas morning and finds her doll broken , you got me "  --  he indicated the general direction of his heart and tapped it several times meaningfully  --  " here . " He gave Roberts 's hand a tender good-bye squeeze and rejoinedp193his own table . Rita was waiting for him , and a tall , elegant EnglishmanI had seen at the Larry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dapper stiff white collar and flashy suit . " Who 's he with ? " I said . " The one who looks like a bodyguard is something Sammy just dug up , " Kit said . " Called Sheik Dugan . Sammy seems to be breaking him in as a high-class stooge . Out here they 're as necessarya social prop as valets . The other one is Sir Anthony Abbott . Came over with quite a fanfare about being the greatest writer in England . So far the chief contribution he 's made to Hollywood seems to be a five-goal rating for Zanuck 's polo team . " " Remember that time you told me you knew a lot of Sammy Clicks , " I said . " I thought you were crazy until I started thinking about that gang at Paine 's the other night . They were all so different  --  a titled Englishman and a famous poet and an aestheticnance and a tough , drunken ex-reporter  --  but they all really had the same idea Sammy had . They were all running . Sammy was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kit nodded . " I wonder if the thing that makes Sammy so fascinating for us is that he is the id of our whole society . " " What do you mean ? " " Well , you know how the id is supposed to be the core of your basic appetites which the superego dresses in the clothes of respectabilityto present to the outside world ? Somehow Sammy never had time to get dressed up the way all those others have , Wilson and McCarter and Sir Anthony , all their sammyglickness covered up with Oxford manners or have-one-on-me sociability or Christian morals that they pay their respects to every Sunday morning when they do n't have too big a hangover . I think that 's what first hit me about Sammy . He was n't something trying to be something else . He was the thing itself , the id , out in the open . It might not be very pretty but there it was . " " So Sammy 's got id , " I said . " And that 's what keeps him running . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy , " she laughed . " To find out why Sammy really runs so much faster than anyone else , you 'd proba/bly have to know what kind of infancy he had , and whether his kindergarten teacher used to slap him , and under what conditions he learned the facts of life , whether he ever suffered from malnutrition  --  the whole works . " " That 's all I have to worry about when I get back to New York , " I said . " Except for the little matter of finding a job . " Sammy had paid his check and was making an exit . He looked over at us , waved fleetingly and ran . I watched Sammy at the entrance , standing under the big caricature of Franklin D. , looking the place over as if he were about to stick it up , while his man Sheik was helping him into his brown suede overcoat . Then Sammy adjusted with casual care the green Tyrolean hat that his face would never suit , Rita floated out of the ladies ' room and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wearing now , " I said . " Probably some little number whipped up by his official cobbler , with laces of human hair plucked from the heads of leading ladies . " " He must have twenty pair , " she said . " What is that special yen for shoes ? " " Maybe he 's trying to find a pair he ca n't wear out in a day , " I said . " If I solve the mystery in New York I 'll shoot a wire . " We were on our porch watching the lights black out over Hollywoodagain . We talked about everything , about the Guild and about Sammy and about screen writing and about the revolt of the generals that had just begun in Spain , but it was n't like any of the good talks we had had before , because words that night could only be a buzzing of irrelevance . I kept noticing the wordless things , the casual , unladylike way she leaned over the porch wall , not caring what the wind did with her hair . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bony handsomeness of her face ; how long we were conscious of the closeness of our hands before they finally met , and then how much harder it was to talk . P195And finally I said , " Kit , I 've been trying to think of fancy ways of saying this for the past two hours . God , I 've wanted you a long time ! I guess you know how long , and I thought tonight ... " She looked at me and I saw how beautiful her eyes could be when they were n't being hard and I met the look , inquisitively , and she turned away to stare out at the lights far below . " Hell , this is n't a roll in the hay for me , there 's plenty of that around . This is , well , maybe the best way of saying good-bye ... " There was a pool of nausea in my stomach that suddenly became anger . " After all , I 'm not a Sammy Glick that hits and runs . " I thought she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Look , darling , I was never going to mention it again , but as long as you have . . . With Sammy there could never be any complications . You know how he is , monolithic , just tosses it off , never lets you get inside , no emotional entanglements to slow him down . But you , you 're such a sentimental dope , you 'd be calling me long distance before you passed Kansas City , wanting to make an honest woman of me . " She looked up at me , almost shyly , and grinned . " Or I 'd be calling you . " That was all it needed and her lips seemed to be there waiting and I had a flash of that first moment we danced together when she had almost seemed to take the lead . It was the same struggle now , the impulses controlled so long finally pouring out in unexpectedviolence , and then suddenly she relaxed . " Feminine as hell , " I could remember her saying , and I could feel myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in the bedroom and I was fumbling impatiently with her dress but she stopped me , saying , " Do n't , Al . Let me do it . I 'll be right back . " I did n't understand then , but I did a minute later when she returned , her body trim and cool and confident . " Hello , " she said in a half-whisper and we looked at each other as she switched off the main lights . There is always that fear of anti-climax , that it wo n't click , but from the first moment both of us knew that was something we would never have to worry about . It was the way she went at a script , or fought for the Guild or played tennis . Then she stretched to turn on the lamp near the bed . " Hello , " I answered and we both smiled , our new , intimate smile . She reached over and laid her hand on my shoulder affectionately . Sammy may go through every girl in Hollywood , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the give-and-take companionship , the overtones . Slip ' em a lay , I could hear him saying . Sure , I get in three times a week , gratis . We must have been lying there a long time , for the electric lights had become part of the night before and the dawn was a pale blue canopy over our window . " Kit , " I said . " Maybe you were right . Maybe I would be calling you by the time I reached Needles . So why do n't you save us both a lot of time by coming along with me ? We 'll get married when we get in . " She hesitated a long time , but I could tell she was n't thinking it over , just trying to find the words to let me down easy . " Al , " she said , " you could stay here and let me support you until this thing blew over , but you 'd be miserable . You would n't feel you had a place . That 's the way I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knows you could find plenty to do around New York . " " Yes , but I 've spent four years trying to be a screen writer and I 'm just beginning to learn how to be a good one . Now that Jefferson is clicking , I 'm getting assignments that really give me a chance to do something . " We were as much apart now as if a bundling board had been there between us . " This is what I was afraid of , " she said . " Startingsomething we ca n't finish . I thought you 'd understand . " " I was n't going to , " I said , " but , oh , hell , if you were just willing to trail me around and wait for me to come home for supper  --  I suppose that would n't be you any more . " p 197She clasped her hands in back of her head thoughtfully . " I 'm going to miss you , " she said . I sat there in the diner looking out at the pink-brown desert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a Los Angeles paper . I had caught the Hollywood habit of opening it straight to the film section . Sammy 's picture was in the lead column , denying the rumor that he and Rita Royce were secretly married . " I respect Miss Royce tremendously , " Sammy was quoted , " and we seem to have a great many mutual interests , such as the new play I 'm writing for her . " The words read like an old refrain : " But we 're just good friends , very good friends . " And then I came to what Sammy would call the topperoo . Mr. Glick , the column cooed , is the young miracle man who has just signed a writer-producer contract with World-Wide . " Last night on the phone he would only laugh modestly when I asked him to confirm my tip-off from reliable inside sources that this new contract will begin at $2000 a week . " I could just imagine that modest laughter . Sammy could only have one kind of laugh for $2000 a week and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I sat on the observation platform thinking of the evening when two thousand dollars a week had only been a terrible passion sizzling in his belly and it was consoling just to lean back and let the distance between us widen tie by tie . I listened to the sound of the wheels carrying on their endless conversation with the tracks . At first their rapid chatter sounded like nothing but metallicand monotonous double-talk . But later , as my ear became accustomed to their language , I realized that they were asking each other , over and over again , What Makes Sammy Run ? What makes Sammy run what makes sammy run what makes sammy runwhatmakessammyrun .. . P198It may sound like sour grapes but it was good to get Hollywood and Sammy Glick behind me . The first day I hit New York I must have walked a couple of hundred blocks . It felt great even though I was broke and New York can be a lonely and ugly town for the guys without money . But I ran into some of the old gang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you needed it than when you did n't , and pretty soon I was back in the old groove , pounding it out for the Record again , beginning to work Hollywood out of my system . I mean I was able to look at a guy without wondering whether he was a five- or a seventy-five-hundred man , and I could sit back in a movie and enjoy my fifty-five-cent dream without torturingP199myself with the knowledge that the best scene in the picture had gone the way of all censors or that the writing which was credited to a famous Broadway playwright because he had a sole screenplaycredit clause in his contract was really the work of half a dozen busy little B-writers . But best of all I congratulated myself on getting Sammy Glick out of my life , or rather , getting myself out of his . Once in a while I could n't help reading about him , of course ; one of the fan mags would name him on its list of Hollywood 's Ten Most Eligible Bachelors , or he was off to Hawaii for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name in the columns from time to time , but on the whole I was able to conduct my life as if he had never been a part of it , settling down with the comforting thought that he would never be again . This thought persisted for almost four weeks . Then one night some of us were sitting around the office a trifle on the alcohol side and the conversation took a sudden turn for Sammy Glick . One of the boys had just seen a picture of his , Touchdown , Irish ! a drama of Notre Dame 's Four Horsemen , with exactly the same plot as Hold ' Em , Yale ! Sammy 's football picture of the season before , and of course we began to swap anecdotes of his days on the Record , all told with a sense of indignation , humor and envy . And then we got to arguing , God knows why , about where he came from . There were votes for the Bronx and Washington Heights and the Lower East Side and the usual bets were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I had a brainstorm . Did n't we used to keep a file on all our employees ? Nobody knew , of course , so I yelled across to Osborne on the copy desk , " Hey , Oz , do n't we keep some sort of file on all the guys that work here ? " and Osborne was n't sure , he had only been on the Record a couple centuries , and I could hear the question running through the room , " Hey , Jack , we got a personnel filing system in the joint ? " and Jack saying he had heard of something like that , but he would n't know where it was . We finally found a copy boy who had actually seen the file and he guided me to a remote part of the building where I was left to continue my quest for Sammy Glick . For this was part of the quest , though I was in no condition to realize it then as I thumbed foggily through the yellowing cards , thinking I was just ending a pointless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible mysteries of the child Sammy . The cards shuffled slowly through my fingers , Gang , Gifford , Glennon , and then I reached Golden and wondered how I had missed Glick so I went back more slowly and then I discovered why . I had hardly been reading the names , mostly searching for that one quick syllable and the cards went Glennon , Glessner , Glickstein , only this time it registered and I yanked the card out , vaguely annoyed with myself at the excitement that came with it . NAME SAMUEL GLICKSTEINOCCUPATION COPY BoyADDRESS 136 Rivington St.LAST OCCUPATION Western Union messenger PHONE noneAGE 17HT 5 ' 7 " WEIGHT 126 Tbs . PARENTS ' NAME MTS . MAX GlicksteinADDRESS Same as aboveI wondered when he had dropped that " stein " from around his neck . Something that Sammy once said about his father came back to me and I wondered what had happened to Max . I thought , just for the hell of it , of copying off the card , but that was too much trouble so I just slipped it into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accumulate a great many things in our pockets , all of them absolutely useless , but which we transferconscientiously from suit to suit . That is how I happened to reach into my pocket the following Sunday and find the card still with me . Now , psychologists may say that I purposely brought thep201card with me that Sunday because of a subconscious determination to trace Sammy back to his roots . And the psychologists may even be right . It is very hard to say . All I know is that when I went strolling through Central Park that morning my only conscious purpose was to watch the ducks and feed the pigeons and get a little air , and that it was a genuine surprise to find SAMUEL CLICKSTEIN , Copy Boy , 17 , in my hand when I reached for a cigarette . And when I turned casually out of the park and began strolling down Fifth Avenue , it was without the slightest knowledge of where I was heading . But by the time I had walked down to 38th Street I was beginning to suspect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like putting a jigsaw puzzle together and some of the pieces were still missing . I was down to 34th Street , my mind trailing a ghost , the swift , fresh phantom of a pasty-faced copy boy , my body following foolishly after my mind . Half an hour later I was walking into the world of his childhood , a foreign world of clotheslines , firetraps , pushcarts and pinchfacedchildren that stretches for too many blocks along the East River . I walked down Avenue A , down Allen , down Rivington , wondering at the irony of the fascist charge that the Jews have cornered the wealth of America ; for here where there are more Jews than anywhere else in the world , millions of them are crowded into these ghetto streets with the early American names . The Glicksteins lived between a synagogue and a fish store , in a tenement laced with corroded fire escapes and sagging washlines . It looked as if one healthy gust of wind would send its tired bricks tumbling down into the narrow street . The hallway gave off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of decay , of too many uncleaned kitchens too close together . I found the name Glickstein on the mailbox , pressed the buzzer for 4C and started up the moldy wooden staircase that groaned protestingly as I climbed to the top floor . A frail round-shouldered young man with sick skin opened the door as far as the safety-latch would permit . He looked suspiciouslyat me through the crack.  | " Yes ? " Suddenly I was overwhelmed with the ridiculousness of this visit . I had an impulse to turn and hurry off . But it was too late . I had already begun to explain who I was , why I had come . As if I knew , as if I could . " My name is Manheim , " I faltered . " I . . . I knew . . . I 'm a friend of Sammy Glick 's from Hollywood . " " From Sammele ! " I heard a woman 's voice cry out . " Israel , quick , open up the door ! " As I entered , she rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed , so she could not have been sitting there for the air . After all these years she must have been still curious about what was going on down there in the street . The indoor complexion of her emaciated , wrinkled face was emphasized by the black lace shawl which she wore , peasant-fashion , over her head . My appearanceseemed to frighten her , for she hurried over to me , looking up into my face with an anxiety that made me uncomfortable . " Oi weh 's mir , my little Sammele ! Something has happened to him ! Tell me , mister , please . He sent you to tell me , maybe ? " " No , no , Mrs. Glickstein , " I said , wondering what had made me walk into this . " There 's nothing wrong with Sammy , absolutely nothing , he 's getting along fine . " " Please , I 'm his momma  --  so if something 's wrong with my Sammele I want I should know . " " Believe me , Mrs. Glickstein , " I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . Sammy could n't be better . " " Ach , " she sighed , slowly regaining her composure . " Excuse me , please . When I hear you come from Sammele I get so excited ... " " We have n't heard from Sammy in so long that Momma 's been worried about him , " the sallow-faced Israel explained . " But Sammele 's a good boy , " Mrs. Glickstein added hastily . " Every month regular comes his check in the mail . Only he is all the time so busy he never has time for writing . " She looked at me and her face creased into the deeper wrinklesP203of a smile . " So maybe my son sent you , you should tell me somethingfrom him ? " Here I go again , I thought . Sammy 's trusted friend bringing the message of devotion from the faithful son . Why do I always have to be defending the bastard ? " He said to be sure and tell you how well he 's feeling , " I heard myself saying . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to write he wants you to know he is always thinking of you . " In her excitement she had forgotten her customary hospitality . " This is his brother , " she said . " Israel . " Israel nodded like an aged Jew in prayer . He was like an old , bent man with a young face . " Izzy , go in the kitchen and make some tea , like a good boy . " I watched Israel as he quietly obeyed his mother 's orders . If physical similarity had anything to do with resemblance , he and Sammy would have looked very much alike . But I would never have recognized them as brothers , for Israel 's face seemed to reflect despair and bitterness and the gentleness of resignation , and it was strange to see how these qualities had molded his face to one so different from the forward thrust of Sammy 's . The small front room was cluttered with ugly furniture . The warm , sticky smell I had noticed in the hallway downstairs was only the faint essence of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotting woodwork and too much living in one place . The street below vibrated with the harsh , raw noises of kids yelling at each other in a stoop-ball game , merchants driving their hard bargains , women shouting their gossip from stoop to stoop , radios turned up as loud as possible to drown each other out , automobile horns honk-honking to remind everybody that their marketplace , their playground , their social center , their arena , was still a street . Mrs. Glickstein , sensitive with the suffering of thousands of years , guessed what I was thinking . " Sammele wants we should move uptown , " she explained , " but it is better here with the synagogue right next door , so I do n't have to do no walking , and the Settlement House where Izzy worksP204right around the corner , and everybody on the block I am such good friends with like in the old country . " Israel brought in the tea , in steaming glasses , and some salami and yellow bread . Mrs. Glickstein and Israel poured their tea into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held between their teeth . Then she ceremoniously lifted a picture from the wall . It was a group photograph captioned Lower Grades , P.S. 15 . " See if you can tell which one is him ? " Mrs. Glickstein challenged me playfully . I looked across the rows of serious little faces , wondering whether I could pick him out . It was a cinch . My finger went right to him . He was on the left end of the first row , standing a little closer to the camera than anybody else . It looked weird to see that same intense ferret face on this little body in short pants and long black stockings wrinkled over the knees . " That 's him , " I said . " And also here , " Mrs. Glickstein said mischievously , pointing to the opposite side of the same row . I looked more closely . By God , there he was again , only this time his face was distorted in a big grin . " He ran around behind the bleachers so he should beat the camera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had seen that same exultant look on his face before . The moment he watched his name flash on the screen for the first time , the night of his dramatic triumph when the flashlights flared around him and Rita Royce . His face told you that this was a triumph too . When the picture was posted on the school bulletin board Sammy 's achievement must have monopolizedthe comment , and the triumphant sneer on that dark little puss revealed that this had already become his goal . Mrs. Glickstein wanted me to tell her how much Sammy weighed and whether he was any taller and if he were a good boy and had he met any nice Jewish girls . And she went on talking about what a fine baby he had been and what a smart , hardworkingboy , distilling the story of his youth with the unconscious censorship of a mother 's pride . In English she sounded awkward and ignorant , but when she discovered I understood Yiddishp 205 ( though I had practically forgotten how to speak it ) she became articulate with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All the time we talked , Israel sat there hardly saying a word , noisily sipping his tea or chewing on the dry bread . But the twisted way he smiled at his mother 's naive account of her little Sammele , an occasional comment he could not resist , gave him away . When Mrs. Glickstein boasted of the regularity with which Sammy 's check arrived every week , Israel nodded scornfully , mumbled grimly , " Sure , sure , he 's very thoughtful . " I watched him more and more as Mrs. Glickstein talked , wondering how long this hate for Sammy had been fermenting . He was the one to talk , I thought , this was my man . At sundown we heard a new sound , a singsong chant of many low voices in weird cacophony . The Orthodox Jews were beginningtheir evening prayers in the synagogue next door . Israel rose to join them . I said I would like to come along . He nodded , flustered and pleased . When I left , Mrs. Glickstein blessed me again , asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a paper bag into my hand . " Strudel , " she said , " still hot . I made it today . Sammele used to say I made the best strudel in the whole world . " When she tried to control herself , her eyes only moistened more . " And maybe you will tell him some time he should try to come home and see his Momma . " It was like a very little moan for a very deep wound . I went out wondering how many other cruelties of Sammy 's she had accepted with the same mild protest . The synagogue was a bare , shabby place , airless with all the windowsshut , where forty or fifty men , mostly aged and bearded , faced east to the Holy Land , humbled themselves before their fierce , demanding God and wailed their songs of endless sorrow . I stood there swaying with them , but only mechanically , for I was raised in the Reform Temple that these traditional religionistsp206would spit upon , and in recent years I had even strayed from this watered-down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Days now but coming to believe that if love for your fellow man is in your heart you need no superstructure to dramatize it for you . And if it is n't , no God and no church can put it there . So I stood there swaying and wondering . What is a Jew ? The anthropologists have proved it is not a race , since the only scientificcategory is the Semitic , which includes Arabians and Assyrians , some of the most fervent anti-Jews in the world . And if it were merely a religion , all Jews like me would have to be excluded . And if it is only a unit of national culture , it is withering away in America , for the customs and traditions that the Glicksteins brought over at the end of the nineteenth century may have been inherited by Israel , droning in his yarmulka at my side , but were thrown overboard as excess baggage by anyone in such a hurry as his younger brother . Afterward we went across to a little bakery , because that was the most convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poverty of the neighborhood had swallowed Israel . He had worked for the Settlement House fifteen years . When he was a child he had developed tuberculosis of the skin , and doctors had been telling him to find a better climate , but something held him here , like an umbilical cord between him and his people , which he would not cut . " It is hard to explain , " he said . " I would always be thinking about them . I would worry about them . " He talked without an accent but with the wailing tone and cadence of the Jewish chants . " How much can the Settlement do ? " I said . He nodded wearily . " I know . Sometimes I feel like I 'm trying to bail out the Hudson with my bare hands . " The singsong of his voice emphasized the futility . " This one has no clothes to go to school . So , when you get the clothes , he ca n't go to school because the father has no job . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged helplessly . " The same every day , only worse . The Reds say to me , What is the use of your Settlement ? It is just a patch on the old tire . What we need is to throw the old tire on the dump heap and start with a new one . ' I do n't know , sometimes I think maybe they are not so crazy . Only more violence ? I have seen too much already . And meantime who is going to get the milk for Mrs. Fleischman 's baby , or find someone to take care of little Irving whose mother died yesterday . . . ? " He stopped short , swamped with the hopelessness of it . " Israel , " I said , " have you always felt this way about it ? " " I guess I got it from the old man , " he said . " If he had lived a long time ago they would have written about him in the Bible . Everybody on the East Side called him Papa Glick . I can remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry home for supper , even when we did n't have enough to go round . I remember once he even dragged an Irish bum in off the Bowery for the Passover feast , and the ceremony made the mick bawl . Whenever anything went wrong , the neighbors always yelled for Papa . They even called him in the middle of the night like a doctor . Poor Papa Glick . " " Where is he now ? " " He 's been dead since Sammy was thirteen . " " How did he die , Israel ? " " He was run over . Coming home with his pushcart one night . Poor Papa . It was like he really wanted to get run over . " " Why ? " I said . " What was the matter , Israel ? " " What is the use ? " he said . " What 's passed is passed . So now that my brother is a big man I would only sound jealous . " " But you really would n't want to be Sammy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I eat a live pig first . " " How was it with him and your father ? " I said . " What kind of a kid was he ? You can tell me . " What I was trying to say was that I was on his side and he seemed to understand . Israel was one of those Jews who can not look angry . When they want to look angry they only look more melancholy. 208 I I BUDD SCHULBERG " He broke Papa 's heart , " he said . " He made Papa not want to live any more . " " What happened ? " I said . " What did he do ? " " It 's a long story , " Israel said . " I know it 's a terrible thing to say about your own flesh and blood , but , before God , if he should drop dead this minute I would not even sit shiva . " When we finally left the bakery it was dark and the pale kids looked like hobgoblins playing around the lampposts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad , angry story , full of tears and curses and , as I walked slowly toward the subway through those jumbled ghetto streets , it made me shudder to pass all those little creatures who might be Sammy Glicks . Israel 's story was just fascinating and unsatisfying enough to make me want to go on playing Sherlock Holmes , only this seemed more important than tracking down a murderer . And there were still large gaps to be filled . But Israel had given me some promising leads . He had told me about Sammy 's first teacher , Miss Carr , who was still at P.S. 15 . And about Foxy Four Eyes , the degenerate son of a tailor , always the idol of the younger boys who used to hang out at his old man 's shop on the corner . The first chance I had I was down again . I walked through the yard of Sammy 's school . The boys had gathered to watch a fight . " Kill the dirty sheeny , " they were yelling , " Kick him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ireland , to the Pope . Blazing with hatreds so quickly inherited , it was easy to make the mistake of thinking they were in the blood . The little boys did not fight like children . It looked professional . They fought grimly , weaving , jabbing , dancing away . They clinched , pounded each other 's kidneys , broke , and punched with perfect timing . These were not children but seasoned battlers , battle-scarred veterans of seven or eight , for the East Side is like one gigantic prize-ring through the ropes of which everyone has to climb at birth . On the fence at the back of the yard , a child who looked as if he had not been on this earth more than half a dozen years was conscientiously inscribing the usual obscenity in chalk letters , aP209foot high , which stood there like a desperate challenge to a hostile world , summing up in two brief words the attitude toward life that Sammy had probably begun to learn at the same age and place . I really had n't expected to find her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiry , talkative and not as nervous as you would expect her to be after struggling for control of those hostile , overcrowded classes for so many years . As she talked on , memory of Sammy sharpened , reminiscences of him she thought she had forgotten began to return , and she passed them on willingly , partly because she took special pride in her memory , partly because Sammy 's childhood exploits still had a fascination for her . One story she said she would never forget . Sammy 's first day in school . After she told me , I knew I would never forget it either . And I knew that even if Sammy had forgotten it , it had become a part of him . As I was leaving , Miss Carr said , " So now he 's a famous movie writer . I used to think Sammy might become a brilliant scholar . But as he got up in the higher grades he began to lose interest . That 's our problem down here , you know . I 'm afraid P.S. 15 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the real school . And that 's where Sammy was a star pupil . " She took off her glasses and began to clean them carefully and I suddenly saw how old and tired she was . " But I guess there 's nothing we can do about it . Sometimes I sit here looking out that window and feel so hopeless  --  the things they learn out there in the street . " Then back into the street again . Searching for another kind of classroom where Sammy received a liberal education . It was still there too . The old tailor had died and the shop had been handed down to Foxy Four Eyes , whose shifty , crossed eyes leered out at you through lenses half an inch thick . He was chinless and puff ycheekedand when he started to talk he exhibited a mouth full of bad teeth and a vocabulary that made Sammy sound like the Archbishop of Canterbury . The walls of the little shop were decoratedwith intimate pictures of female anatomy cut out of Film Funs and Police Gazettes with loving care. 210 I I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , " I said . " He told me to look you up if I were ever down this way . " " Well , for Chris'sake , " he said , " good old Sammy ! He sure was a hot-shot , that Sammy ! I always said he 'd sock the jackpot , but I sure never thought he 'd get his in the movies . " His laugh was shrill and indecent . " Boy , I 'll never forget the time ... " I left Rivington Street behind , but not the smell of Rivington Street , not the noise , not the faces . Not Sammy Glick running through Rivington Street . For days after that wherever I was , whatever I was doing , it kept coming back to me . I saw the Dead End Kids in a movie . Oh , hell , I thought , compared to Sammy these are nothing but a bunch of Honor Scouts . Their speech may be a trifle more colorful , but they are n't really evil , not the way I know childhood can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of childhood , barefoot boys with feet of tan , playing pirate , swimming holes , bullfrogs in quiet ponds and Sunday hats , puppy loves , schooldays , dear old golden rule days , my bashful beau , my ring-around-rosie queen in calico , Tom Sawyer and Penrod and Andy Hardy with America 's No . I Star , Mickey Rooney , do n't miss that heartwarming picture of family life coming to your neighborhood theater on Rivington Street , a sole screenplay credit , by Sammy Glick . Where was the childhood of Sammy Glick ? Step right up , ladies and gentlemen , and see the man who was never young . It was flashing through my mind like a montage nightmare , Sammy 's face looming up behind all those quick and terrible scenes of his unchildhood : Max Glickstein was a diamond cutter in the old country , proud of his trade and his religion . After the pogrom that took his firstborn , Max brought his wife and other son to America . The child died in mid-ocean . " We must be brave , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe God is trying to tell us that we will carry none of the troubles of the old world into the new . We will have newP211sons , little Americans . In America we will find a new happiness and peace . " They found Rivington Street . But no diamonds to cut . In time , Max got a job cutting glass at ten dollars a week . " Glass , " he complained . " Glass any jackass can cut . But diamonds ! " For years he cut glass every day but Saturday , when he worshippedhis God , and Sunday , when the Christians worshipped theirs . And his wife bore him two sons , first Israel and five years later Shmelka . The midwife did not think Shmelka would live . He weighed only five and a half pounds . " Nebbish such a little one , " said the midwife . " Were he a little kitten we would drown him already . " But survival of the fittest is a more complex process with thinking animals . Even one who thought as simply as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth until he choked , hollered , and began to live . Because he was puny , Mama spent so much time with him that his growth was precocious . He walked before his first birthday . Talked before his second . When he was three and a half , he changed his own name . One of Israel 's friends always teased him with " Whadya say yer name is , Smell ya ? " One day Mama called , " Shmelka , come here , " and he paid no attention . She called his name again . " Shmelka is n't my name any more , " he said . " No , " Mama said , " then what is it , please ? " " Sammy , " he said . Sammy was the name of an older kid across the hall whose mother was always yelling for him . The strike came when Sammy was four . The glasscutters wanted twelve-fifty . Papa was a foreman now , making sixteen , but he remembered how it was to live on ten dollars a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started and prices rising . He walked out with his men . " Mr. Glickstein , do n't be a dope , " the owner said . " In another two , three years you will becoming maybe a partner . To cut your own throat , that is not human . And what kind of foolishness is this when I can get plenty immigrants " ( the owner having been here twenty years could look down on the aliens ) " to take their places ? " Papa Glick ' s voice was deep and sure as if he were reading from the Torah . " To be a partner in a sweatshop , such honors I can do without . " But the owner was right about one thing . There were too many others . The strike dragged on six months  --  a year . . . They never saw those jobs again . Neighbors helped the Glicksteins the way Papa had always helped them . And he picked up a few pennies as the cantor in shul on Saturday . But he would gladly have served for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dignitary with his impressive shawl , his yarmulka and his great beard , there life was rich and beautiful . The rest were just the necessary motions to keep alive . And this they barely did . Sammy played in the streets without shoes . For his fifth birthday he was given a pair that Israel had outgrown . But they were still several sizes too large for him , and the way they flapped like a clown 's made the other kids laugh . Sometimes when Sammy would run after his tormentors the shoes would fly off , and Sammy would pick them up in a rage and hurl them at his nearest enemy . Papa Glick finally gave up any hope of resuming his trade again . He was too old . America was a land for young men . Finally he got himself a pushcart like all the others . He sold shirts , neckties and socks , nothing over twenty-five cents . But there were too many pushcarts and not enough customers . So Sammy started peddling papers . He was three feet , four inches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why Israel should n't do it instead . But soon Israel was going to be bar mitzvah . After school let out at three o'clock he studied in the cheder until suppertime . Papa was so proud of him . The melamed had told him Israel had the makings of a real Talmudic scholar . And it was well known that the melamed was a man who never had a good word to say for anyone but God . " God has blessed my son with the heart and brains of a rabbi , " Papa boasted . Sammy lugged his papers up and down Fourteenth Street yelling about a war in Europe . Ile used to come home with a hoarse throatP213and thirty or forty cents in pennies . He would count the money and say , " God dammit , I 'm yellin ' my brains out for nuttin ' .. " Papa Glick would look up from his prayer book . " Please , in this house we do not bring such language . " " Look who 's talkin " Sammy said . " Know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wouldn'hafta peddle papers if you was n't such a dope and quit your job . He says his of man tol ' him . " " Silence , " said Papa Glick . " He says that strike screwed us up good , " said Sammy . Papa Glick 's hand clapped against Sammy 's cheek . It left a red imprint on his white skin but he made no sound . By the time he was six he had learned how to be sullen . " Papa , please , " Mrs. Glickstein pleaded . " He 's so small , how should he know what he 's saying  --  he hears it on the street . " " That 's so he should forget what he hears , " said Papa . Several weeks later Sammy came in with a dollar seventy-eight . Papa , Momma and Israel danced around him . " Sammy , you sold out all the papers ? " said Papa in amazement . " Yeah , " Sammy said . " There 's a guy on the opposite corner doin ' pretty good ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' So I asks a customer if there 's anything in the paper about that . So when he says no , I figure I can pull a fast one too . So I starts hollerin " US enters war , ' and jeez you shoulda seen the rush ! " But that was a lie , " Papa Glick said . " To sell papers like that is no better than stealing . " All the guys make up headlines , " Sammy said . " Why do n't you wise up ? " Sammy worked a year before he entered school . That first day at P.S. 15 , Sheik kept staring at him . He wanted to listen to what Miss Carr was saying , but he could n't concentrate very well because the Sheik ' s small black eyes kept boring into him . Everybody knew the Sheik . His old lady was Italian and his old man was Irish and the neighbors would always hear them fighting at night over who was the better Catholic . The Sheik was older than anybody else in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times . The kids did n't call him the Sheik because he was hand-P214some , but because it was whispered around that he already knew what to do with little girls . There was even a story that he had knocked one up already , but this was probably circulated by Sheik himself who was a notorious boaster and had a habit of appropriatingall his big brother 's achievements . The Sheik sat there all through the hour actively hating Sammy . Sammy had taken his seat , the seat he had had for the past two years . Ile had told Sammy , but Sammy had refused to budge . " O.K. , yuh dirty kike , " Sheik whispered harshly through his teeth . " See yuh afta class . " It was lunch hour . Some of the kids were getting up a game of ball . Sammy wanted to play . After school there was cheder . And then papers to sell . Sammy was going to be a ballplayer when he grew up . He had a good eye and he was fast . But now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older , half a head taller . Sammy appraised him . He would probably get the bejesus kicked out of him . But he was n't scared . Just sorry he could n't get into that ball game . Ile followed Sheik into a vacant lot across the street , all boarded up and full of old tin cans and whatever anybody had ever felt like throwing there . As soon as they got inside the Sheik let one go . It cracked against Sammy 's nose , and blood spurted . Sammy 's nose felt bigger than his whole face and he could n't see , but he moved in swinging . Sheik caught him on the nose again . Sammy went down with Sheik on top of him , kicking and swinging , spitting into the bloody face under him , his whole body quivering in a frenzy of hate , shrieking until it became a chant , " You killed Christ . You killed Christ ... " When Sammy finally stopped fighting back , Sheik left him there and went to eat his lunch . Sammy tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't stop , so he had to walk back to the schoolyard that way . Miss Carr ran over and dragged him into the ladies ' room . While she washed off the blood he stood there terribly white and terribly silent . No tears . Just his mouth set hard and his eyes ugly . " I think your nose is broken , " she said . " It do n't hurt much , " said Sammy. pI 215 " You 'd better come into the office and lie down . " " Jeez , look where I am ! The guys better not see me in the girls ' can . " She didn ' t know how to treat him . She was new here and she had never seen kids like this before . If he would only cry she could comfort him like an injured child . But he would not let her . " Hey , what the hell 's the matter with that guy sayin ' I killed Christ ? The dirty bastard . " " You must not talk like that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should forgive each other and live in brotherly love . " " Yeah ? " said Sammy . " How about Sheik ? Do n't he believe in Christ ? " " Well , yes , " said Miss Carr , " but ... " " got ta sit down , " said Sammy , " my head 's spinnin ' . " Miss Carr tried to put her arms around him but he drew away . He was like a little injured animal snarling at the hand that is trying to help it . " You wo n't have to worry from now on , " she said . " I 'm going to have a talk with Sheik . And I think I 'll ask some of the bigger boys to look after you . " His voice made her sympathy sound patronizing . " Who ast ya to ? I 'm no sissy . I c'n take care-a myself . " Sheik felt called upon to avenge Christ every day . Sammy acceptedhis beatings as part of the school routine . He never tried to avoid them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the terrible calm of a sparring partner . He would come home every night with his eyes swollen or his lip cut and his mother would hold him in her arms and cry , Sammele , Sammele , but he never cried with her , only held himself stiff in her arms , a stranger to her . After a while , there was no satisfaction left in it for Sheik any more . It had become manual labor , slaughterhouse work . Sheik began to look around for more responsive victims . It even left Sheik with a strange kind of fear for Sammy . Somewhere along the line it had become the victim 's triumph . Sammy would talk back to Sheik any time he liked . There was nothing Sheik could do but beat him up again . All the suffering that Sammy had swallowed instead of crying out had formed a hard cold ball of novocaine in the pit of his stomach that deadened all his nerves . Life moved faster for Sammy . He was learning . The Glicksteins ' poverty possessed him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the lookout to make a dollar . The way the little Christiansput on Jewish hats and mingled with the Jewish boys to get free hand-outs in the synagogue on the holy days gave him an idea . On Saturday he went down to the Missions on the Bowery and let the Christ-spouters convert him . At two bits a conversion . He came home rich with seventy-five cents jingling in his pockets . His father , struggling to maintain his last shred of authority , the patriarchy of his own home , demanded to know why he was not at cheder . Sammy hated cheder . Three hours a day in a stinking back room with a sour-faced old Reb who taught you a lot of crap about the Mosaic laws . You do n't go to jail if you break the laws of Moses . Only if you got no money and get caught stealing , or do n't pay your rent . " I hadda chance to make a dollar , " Sammy said . " Sammy ! " his father bellowed . " Touching money on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man snatched the money and flung it down the stairs . Sammy glared at his father the way he had at Sheik , the way he was beginning to glare at the world . " You big dope ! " Sammy screamed at him , his voice shrill with rage . " You lazy son-of-a-bitch . " The old man did not respond . His eyes were closed and his lips were moving . He looked as if he had had a stroke . He was praying . Sammy went down and searched for the money until he found it . His mother came down and sat on the stairs above him . She could never scold Sammy . She was sorry for Papa but she was sorry for Sammy too . She understood . Here in America life moves too fast for the Jews . There is not time enough to pray and survive . The old laws like not touching money or riding on the Sabbath  --  it was hard to make them work . Israel might try to live by them but never Sammy . Sammy frightened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were thieves or tightwads and rich Jews who would not talk to poor ones , but she had never seen one like Sammy . Sammy was not a real Jew any more . He was no different from the little wogs and micks who cursed and fought and cheated . Sometimesshe could not believe he grew out of her belly . He grew out of the belly of Rivington Street . When Papa Glick found out how Sammy made his seventy-five cents , he went to shul four times a day instead of twice . He cried for God to save Sammy . Sammy remained a virgin until he was eleven . But no storks ever nested in his childish fancy . When he was still in his cradle he could hear the creaking of bedsprings and his parents ' loud breathing in the same room . Cramped quarters forced sex into the open . When Sammy ran to find a place to hide from the Jew-hunting gangs with rock-filled stockings who roamed the streets on Hallowe'en , he bumped into a couple locked together in the shadow of the tunnel-like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to trip over their legs as he raced across the roofs . The first day in the street he learned about the painted women who called out intimate names to men they did n't know . When he was ten he used to turn out the light to watch the lady across the court get undressed . She was fat , and when she let her great flabby breasts ooze out of her brassiere they flopped down like hams as she bent over . Curiosity and then desire began to creep into Sammy 's wiry , undeveloped loins . He even went up to one of the women around the corner and offered her the quarter he had been given to buy groceries , but she just looked down at him , put her hands on her hips , and laughed . " Send your old man around , sonny , you 'd fall in . " A couple of days later Sammy was hanging around Foxy 's shop when Shirley Stebbins came in . Shirley was several years older than any of them , maybe sixteen or seventeen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more flesh to have a voluptuous figure . People said her family was having a tough time because she was going to high school when she should be working . She was n't hard the way the other girls were hard , boisterous and suggestive . Everybody onp218the block called her Sourpuss because her mouth was always set in a sullen expression of contempt . Foxy Four Eyes had advanced the theory that she was frigid . He said it happened when her father climbed into her bed one night when his wife was in the hospital . " Foxy , I 'm in a jam , " she said . " I need ten dollars bad . " " Bad , huh ? " he said , managing to give it an off-color inflection as he put his hand on her . " A guy can do an awful lot with ten dollars . " He winked at the kids as if he had said something witty . A guy called Eddie who was fifteen and knew his way around got it first . " I 'll get in for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face left no doubt about the pun . It had started as a gag , but Foxy egged them on until the nine of them had subscribed six dollars . Foxy 's cheeks burned with excitement and his cockeyes looked out at his proteges proudly . All right , sister , I 'll be a sport , " he said . " I 'll throw in the other four  --  just to see ya oblige the boys . " She looked at all of them . They were jumping around her like frantic little gnomes . Sammy hardly reached her shoulder . " All right , " she said in a tired voice . " Let 's see the money , you cheap bastards . " In the back room , when it came his turn Sammy was scared . He was sprawled across her , fidgeting foolishly . Foxy Four Eyes could hardly talk , he was laughing so hard . " Hey , fellers , lookit Sammy tryin ' to get his first nookey ! " Sammy could feel the blood flushing his head , and her silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to her ludicrously , she half-rose on her elbows and said , " Somebody pull this flea off me . I 'm not going to make this my life 's work . " Foxy and Eddie laughingly dragged him off , still struggling for her , like a little puppy pulled from its mother 's teats . Shirley counted the money carefully and left a little more bitter than she came . " Thanks , you cheap bastards , " she said . Sammy ran after her . " Hey , that ai n't fair ! I ought a get my four bits back . "  |p219But  that was the initiation fee Sammy had to pay to be inducted into the mysteries of life . After the war , prices went higher , but there was no change in the pushcart business . The talk at meals was always money now . The Glicksteins were behind in their rent . A newsboy 's take was no longer enough to complement the old man 's income . The boys had to find regular jobs . Sammy and Israel both answered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For hours they cussed and fought each other for places near the door because their parents had sent them all out with the same fight talk , spoken in English , Yiddish , Italian , and with a brogue  --  Sammy , Israel , Joe , Pete , Tony , Mike , if you do n't get that job today we do n't know what we 'll do . Israel was just ahead of Sammy . They had been waiting since six in the morning for the doors to open at eight . They were chilled outside , nervous inside . When the doors opened at last and Israel was finally standing before the checker , he was told : " Sony , kid  --  ai n't hirin ' no Hebes . " As Israel hesitated there , crying inside , Sammy suddenly threw himself at him and knocked him down . " What the hell you do that for ? " said the checker . " That dirty kike cut in ahead of me , " Sammy screamed . The checker looked at Sammy curiously . Sammy stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Fer Chris'sake , you look like a Jew-boy yerself . " " Oh , Jesus , everybody 's always takin ' me for one of them goddamsheenies , " Sammy yelled . Then he broke into gibberish Italian . At twelve years of age Sammy made one bat out of hell of a messenger . For the first few months he just did a good fast routine job . Then he began to catch on to ways of branching out . He started dropping in at the cat-houses on his way home . He would ring the bell  --  any bell  --  and tell the maid : " Willya find out who rang for a messenger boy ? "  |p220In  a couple of minutes the maid would return and say , " Ca n't find nobody who says they called you , sonny . " Then he 'd put up his squawk . ' Mean to tell me I hadda come allerway down here for nuttin ' ? Somebody in here musta called  --  the boss sent me down here on the double-quick . Whatta you wan na do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up good and loud until the madame came out . The kid is probably right , she 'd figure . Maybe one of the men did it for laughs or got drunk and forgot . The gag was almost always good for two bits anyway . And lots of times the madame would yell , " Anybody want the messenger boy before he goes ? " Then some of the customers would remember to wire their wives or the girls would want to send out for ice cream or a magazine . After Sammy got inside he had another stunt that nearly always worked . He would stand in the middle of the main room and start singing a song . His voice was lousy , but he was n't shy about using it and he usually sang something with a gulp in it , like " You made me what I am today  --  I hope you 're satisfied , " which always got the girls . So the guys would toss him something to please them  --  or to shut him up . Sometimes on Saturday nights he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage . It made Sammy feel pretty good hanging around with the guys on the corner Sundays with a little dough in his pocket . One Sunday morning Sheik singled him out . Sheik already had the secretive , mannered poise of a racketeer . " Follow me over tuh the park , " Sheik said . " I wan na talk to ya . " Two years before when they had been the heads of rival gangs , Sammy 's men had cornered Sheik on a roof . Everybody knew what Sammy had taken from him and they were all ready for Sammy to tell them to send the Sheik back to his block with a hole in his head . But Sammy just looked at Sheik kind of funny and said , " Go on , get runnin ' , you bastard , get the hell outa my block . " It meant that Sammy was beginning to understand the secret of power . Having Sheik beaten to a pulp would only have evened theP 221score . Without ever having thought it out , Sammy seemed to know intuitively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over in the park Sheik said , " Listen , Sammy , I watched you a long time . You got balls . You 're O.K. with me . " " Come on , what d' ya want ? " said Sammy . " What 's on ya mind ? " " I 'm fed up with this stinking hole , " Sheik said . " I 'm gettin ' outa here . I 'm gon na pull off one little job and head west . And I wan na cut you in . " Sammy listened to the plan . It was just a glorified version of the old pushcart snitches . Sammy was to go into Levy 's and ask for something that would make Levy go back into the storeroom to look for it . Then Sheik would run in and lay one on him and tie him up while Sammy was rifling the cash register . Sammy listened soberly . " Not me , " he said . " That 's sucker stuff . Why the hell take a chance goin ' up the river when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Like what ? " said Sheik . " Lookit Johnny Maloney , " Sammy said . " He 's off your block . His kid brother tol ' me Johnny makes a couple a hundred smackers every election day  --  just for takin ' people around ' n ' votin ' ' em . And lookit Salica . He ai n't so much older ' n ' us . Salica must be gettin ' richer ' n ' a bastard . Every time a guy gets laid around here it 's dough in his pocket . What 's the percentage in havin ' the cops against yer when you can do something like that and have em with ya ? " Sheik succeeded in getting away from there all right . He got three years in the State Reform School . So did Leo Kaplan , the kid Sheik got to take Sammy 's place . Three weeks before Sammy 's thirteenth birthday Papa came in too upset to eat . " Tonight when I come out of shul the rabbi wants to talk to me . Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he says , but your sonp222Samuel can not be bar mitzvah . He never comes to cheder . He does not know his bruchas . The melamed says he knows no more about the Torah than a goy . ' " Bar-mitzvah is the Hebrew ceremony celebrating a boy 's reachingthe state of manhood at the age of thirteen . He shows off all his knowledge and makes a speech which always begins , " Today I am a man ... " and everybody gives him presents and congratulatesthe father and feels very good . It is as vital to the Orthodox Jews as baptism is to the Christians . " Oy vay ! " Papa cried . " That I should live to see the day when my own flesh and blood is not prepared to become a man . " " Aw , what 's that got to do with becomin ' a man ? " Sammy said . lust a lotta crap . I been a man since I was eleven . " " Oh , Lord of Israel , " Papa said , " how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a man who went to synagogue twice every day of his life , should have such a no-good son . " " Yeah , " Sammy said . " While you was being such a goddam good Jew , who was hustlin ' up the dough to pay the rent ? " " Silence , silence , " Papa roared . " I guess I got ta right to speak in this house , " Sammy said . " For Chris ' sake I 'm bringin ' in more money ' n you are . " " Money ! " Papa cried . " That 's all you think about , money , money . . " Yes , money , money , " Sammy mimicked . " You know what you c'n do with your lousy bar mitzvah . It 's money in the pocket  --  that 's what makes you feel like a man . " The day that Sammy was to have been bar-mitzvahed Papa went to the synagogue and prayed for him as if he were dead . He came home with his lapel ripped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all week because he could n't face the shame of it . But the next day he had to be out in the street again , an extension of his pushcart . People saw him push his cart through the street with his eyes staring dumbly at nothing . The driver who hit him said he sounded his horn several times , but the old man did not seem to hear . P223When he was carried upstairs to his bed Israel and Mama sat there crying and watching him die . Afterward , Israel did n't know what to do , so he went up on the roof to look at the stars . He found Sammy there smoking a butt . " Is it over ? " Sammy said when he saw his brother . Israel nodded . He had not really broken down yet , but the questiondid it . He cried , deep and soft , as only Jews can cry because they have had so much practice at it . Israel was eighteen , but now he was a little boy crying because he had lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veteran ; he had learned something that took the place of tears . When Israel realized that he was the only one crying he became embarrassed and then angry . " Damn you , why do n't you say something ? " Israel said . " Why do n't you cry ? " " Well , what 's there to say ? " said Sammy . " At least , ca n't you say you 're sorry ? " " Sure , " Sammy said . " I 'm sorry he was a dope . " " I ought a punch you in the nose , " Israel said . " Try it , " Sammy said , " I bet I c'n lick you . " Sammy sat there dry and tense . " Aw , do n't work yourself into a sweat , " he said . " Sammy , " Israel pleaded , " what 's got into you ? Why must you go around with a chip on your shoulder ? What do you have to keep your left out all the time for ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Sammy said . " You do n't see me getting smacked in the puss . " " But we are n't fighting now , " Israel said . Israel was right about not knowing Sammy . There were no rest periods between rounds for Sammy . The world had put a chip on his shoulder and then it had knocked it off . Sammy was ready to accept the challenge all by himself and this was a fight to the finish . He had fought to be born into the East Side , he had kicked , bit , scratched and gouged first to survive in it and then to subdue it , and now that he was thirteen and a man , having passed another kind of bar mitzvah , he was ready to fight his way out again , P224pushing uptown , running in Israel 's cast-off shoes , traveling light , without any baggage or a single principle to slow him down . I was sitting in the corner at the end of the bar and , like all thinkers who are on the verge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar and picked up my empty glass . " Henry , do you know what I 've been doing for the past two hours ? " I asked . " Yes , " said Henry , " getting plastered . " " No , " I said , " working out a theory that will end hate in the world . " " That 's the same thing , " said Henry . " Now , Henry , I want you to listen carefully , " I said . " Because Fate has chosen you as the first one to hear my message . Do you remember Sammy Glick ? " " Do you ever let me forget him ? " Henry said . " Okay , " I said . " When Sammy Glick first walked into my office he turned my stomach . But just think if when he walked in I 'd known as much about him as I do now . " I punctuated my speech with thoughtful gulps . " We only hate the results of people . But people , Henry , are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really give them a break we have to judge the process through which they became the result we see when we say So-and-so is a heel . Now the world is full of people hating other people 's guts . Okay . Now , Henry , answer me this , what if each of them took the time to go down to Rivington Street  --  I mean each person 's particular Rivington Street , Henry ? We would begin to have compassion in the world , that 's what . Not so much soda this time , Henry . " " I do n't think you better have any more , Mr. Manheim , " Henry said . " Okay , " I said , " you patronizing bastard . No great thinker is ever appreciated in his own time . " I went to the phone and put through a call to Hollywood 3187 . " Hello ? " she said . " Hello , " I said , waiting expectantly. 1p 225 " Hello , " she said . " Remember I said I 'd call you if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Al , you 're drunk ! " And then with a slight reprimand : " Dar-ling ! " " And , " I gloated , " I know why Sammy hates unions and why he treats all women like pros and all men like enemies . Kit , you gave me a terrific steer . And I have n't only learned about Sammy . I 've learned something about the machinery that turns out Sammy Clicks . " " Congratulations , " she said . " Do n't you think you 'd better reverse the charges ? You ca n't afford a long-distance call like this . " " Of course I ca n't , " I said . " Anybody would call you up if he could afford it . But to be unable to afford it and do it anyway  --  that 's love . " " You still have n't changed ? " she said . " No . Have you ? " " No , " she said . " If I ever have a husband you are definitely it . " " That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , " I said . " Here lies the husband chosen by Kit  --  if she ever had one he was definitely it . " " You 're very clever , " she said . " Have you ever thought of coming to Hollywood ? " " Darling , " I said , " for Chris'sake ! When do we get together again ? " " As soon as our jobs bring us together again , " she said . " jobsyou should be doing can make worse ghosts than ex-lovers . " " Now that I 've got a line on what makes Sammy run , maybeI should begin on you . " " I 'm not running anywhere , " she said . " I 'll be right where you left me . But you might work on Whither Is He Running ? " " That reminds me , " I said . " Whither is he ? " " Well , there 's been another shake-up at World-Wide , and Sidney Fineman has his old spot back as head man . And I 'll give you one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he making out ? " I said.
