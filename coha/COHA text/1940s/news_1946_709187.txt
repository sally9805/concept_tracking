txt In this seacoast city , famed for its salmon canneries. and all along the Pacific Northwest coastline , tuna fishing . has grown from nothing at all a decade ago ' Into a big new industry . Back in 1935 tuna were such rarities In North Pacific waters that some anglers could n't tell them from baby porpoise-q . Now when schools of the big fish run off the Oregon-Washington shore , little boats and big tuna clippers by the hundreds set out to reap , the harvest Only six years ago there was n't a tuna racking plant in the Northwest . Fish were ' either sold fresh or shipped to California for canning . Now a score of canneries handle an annual tonnage approaching that of Southern California . former source of almost all U. S canned tuna . They Hook a Special Kind of Tuna Northwestern fishermen , moreover , catch a special kind of tuna  --  the albacore . This species is said by the industry to he the tastiest of the big tuna family . It has an exceptionally white meat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , striped or bluefin tuna . It 's something like contrasting breast of chicken with the dark flesh of wild dunk . Albacore fetches double the average price of other tuna species , because of its good eating qualities and comparative rarity Fresh albacore now brings 9300 a ton at dockside . It was increased from $325 to that ceiling by the Office of Price Administration in October , 1944 . Pre-war albacore prices averaged 390 to $120 a ton . The fishing industry thinks the price will stay up for some time There is n't enough tuna to go around now , and demand is unlikely to fall as long as the public 's post-war buying mood continues . Just why tuna were n't caught in commercial quantities off the Pacific Northwest shores until a few years ago is one of those happenstances . The chances are they 've been running there for thousands of years  --  at least as long as there has been a Japanese current Japanese Current firings Tuna North That broad stream of warm water which skirts the North American shoreline is the reason why tuna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are found in greatest ' numbers off the coast of Southern California and Lower California in Mexico . Waters of , the Japanese Current average 52 to 60 degrees temperature , about ten degrees higher than along the Oregon-Washington coast . Salmon fishermen work three to five miles off shore None of them ventures out to sea n to 100 miles into the Japanese Current . In August . 1936 , however . a Californian hunting sardines landed a ton of albacore off Coos Bay , Ore . That was the first commercial catch of tuna in these parts , and It set oft the present boom . In 1937 , the first full tuna-fishing season.1 1.353.522 pounds of albacore were landed , and In 1938 the total leaped to 61 million pounds . It kept rising steadily each succeeding season until the big year of 3944 when ideal fishing weather  --  calm waters *Ind clear skies ? resulted in a record Northwest catch of 33.7 million pounds . The weather was bad in 1945 Almost from start to finish of the season winds and storms harassed fishermen . /Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food that tuna could n't he lured by fishermen 's bait . In any event , the catch dropped to 1R million pounds . about 1 million Ash Albacores run from 10 to 30 pounds each and , the average is 18 . Habits of Fish Are a Mystery The tuna is ' a mysterious critter . It spawns at sea . but , as far as scientists know , it has no cycle habits such as salmon which are hatched , live , spawn and die in a pattern as fixed as the tides . If tuna have migratory habits , nothing at all is known about them . They do , however , run in great schools , sometimes millions of fish . These schools appear in Pacific Northwest waters in midsummer usually by mid-July or soon thereafter . Starting in late June the Columbia River Packers Association sends out its cut-. ter " Unger " day after day into the Japanese current on scouting missions The sharp-eyed crew carries thermometers to gage the water 's warmth . The higher the temperatures rise , the more chance tuna will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " spreads dockside , nearly 2,000 boats of all sizes put out from Astoria. joined by hundreds of others from W  --  ashington state ports . The tuna runs continue into the fall months . Although in Southern California considerable amounts of tuna are caught in nets by purse /miners. nearly all the fishing in the Plielfir Northwest is with hook and line , a method deep-aea fishermen call ' jig fishing . " Early in the season tuna will grab at any bright , shiny lure Some fishermen a few years ago even used popped popcorn to attract the fish As the season wears on , though . the albacores grow cagier or perhaps less hungry . They want only live bait , and that turns tuna fishing Into an expensive business . Live-bait fishing requires larger boats . Some clippers cost as much as $80,000 . They must be big enough to carry halt tanks and ice to refrigerate a catch of 20 to 25 terns of tuna . because they stay two or three days at sea , hours of seining close along the coast , to scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the bait tanks until the Japanese current is reached and the small fish are dumped overboard Tuna come to the surface and , as one fisherman explains , go into " a frenzy of feeding ' ? In this state they will grab at any hook . plain or baited Weather is the mater factor in live-bait fishing . If it gets too rough , heats have to seek shelter in the Columbia River , and the change to fresh water in the tanks kills the halt . Before the vessel can set out for another try , the bait must he replenished . This happened often last season . When the tuna are taking the hook . catches are huge . It 's not uncommon for a large clipper to land ten tons before noon High boat of the 1915 season caught 40 tons in one day , which figures out to *15.600 at the dock .

Boats in Southern California often have to travel 1.500 miles for a catch Thomas F.
