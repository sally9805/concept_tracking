txt Unique steps were taken today to see that Congress and the people were informed fully , before Congressional test votes were taken , on the facts and implications of President Truman 's $400,000,000 program for Greece and Turkey . The entire Republican majority of the Senate was set up as a factseeking board . Senator Arthur H. Vandenberg , president pro temporei of the Senate and chairman of its Foreign Relations Committee , invited the fifty other members of the Republican conference ( the Senate majority ) to pose any question on any aspect of the program in writing . He said the questions could deal with the emergency that caused the drastic shift in United States foreign policy or with the ultimate implications of the execution of this policy . Searching Hearings Pledged These questions , Mr. Vandenberg pledged , will be put to responsible officials of the Administration at public hearings . It was expected that such hearings by the House Foreign Affairs Committee could begin next week . The preliminary , or skeleton , bill now being studied would give President Truman discretionary powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastern countries but within certain limits . These limits are that specified sums would be for arms and economic aid . These powers , the Administration believes are needed at the outset of the program so emergencies that may arise can be dealt with promptly . After the program is in smooth operation the Administration will be glad to accept Congressional Iguidance and directives , it is understo6d . A grant of complete discretionary power to the President , even at the start of the program , might engender considerable debate and perhaps delay it beyond the deadline , March 31 . The meeting of the Republican conference was in private . Reports ' indicated that Senator William E. Jenner of Indiana raised a question to this effect : Is it true , as has been reported from apparently authoritative quarters , that the United States Government learned as long ago as last October from Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin that Britain would withdraw from her commitments in Greece as of March 31 , but withheld this information until recently and then " created " an emergency , with Congress put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply from a State Department spokesman : " There is obviously a misunderstanding about what the British Government told us . The British have for many months indicated that they desired , and proposed , to withdraw troops from Greece as soon as they possibly could . " Mr. Bevin and other British officials have said so publicly in Commons , at the United Nations and elsewhere . " However , the British note of Feb. 24 was the first notification received by this GOvetn.ment that the British GOvernment was forced to withdraw financial and economic aid as of March 31 to the Greek Government . " Other questions were raised at the meeting . One was : " What would happen if we did nothing about this $400,000,000 program ? " In advance of a reply from the executive branch , Senator Vandenberg was said to have replied : " The United States would run a greater risk if Congress ignored the Presidential proposals than if it approved them . " Pending , too , were questions such as the following : If this aid is given to Greece and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economic and indirect military help to other countries ? France was mentioned as a possibility . What are the ultimate implications of this " new worldwide Monroe Doctrine ? " Mr. Vandenberg put no deadline on further questions . " I want to have the answers given in public , " he said , apparently with the backing of the whole Republican conference , " and when the votes are taken I want to see them based upon the conclusions of a fully informed Congress , backed up by a fully informed American people . " The House Foreign Affairs Committee called into closed session top officials of the State , War and Navy Departments for a canvass of the Administration proposals . Dean Acheson , Acting Secretary of State ; Robert P. Patterson , Secretary of War , and James Forrestal , Secretary of the Navy , appeared with advisers and other aides . Proceedings remained hush-hush . Serious-faced committee members refused to comment . It appeared , however , that the program for Greece and Turkey was beginning to take form . At some points the program was likened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and criticism frOm others . A chief concern in some Congressional quarters was the military aspect . The program calls for military missions to Greece for advice on coping with the guerrilla warfare on the northern Greek borders . It was reported from today 's meeting that pledges were given that the United States would . not send troops into Greece . The military missions , it was explained , would be purely advisory . Although the March 31 deadline is accepted in Congress as a " real " one for action , other matters were in the way of the Near East program . The House Foreign Affairs Committee still had on its hands a bill calling for $350,000,000 for relief of liberated nations , including Greece . Representative Charles A. Eaton of New Jersey , chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee , ex , - pressed hope that this measure could be disposed of next Monday . Other members of the committee expressed the belief that it might take longer . The House is acting first on the Truman proposals for the Near East because of its limitations on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senate and House efforts continued to head toward a meeting of the March 31 deadline .
