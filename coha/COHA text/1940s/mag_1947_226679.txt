New Year 's Greetings <P> Sirs : <P> May I predict a possible slogan for the 1948 presidential campaign- " Put things right with-Ike ! " Ike Eisenhower , of course . Do n't ask me which party will shout it ; that , time will decide . . . . <P> <P> ALLEN K. PHELPS Cleveland Heights <P> Martyr or Menace <P> Sirs : <P> Congratulations ! TIME 'S cover Dec. 16 depicts John L. Lewis in flames-a martyr for labor . . . . <P> <P> ( REV . ) DAVID J. GRIFFITHS <P> Mansfield , Pa . <P> <P> Sirs : <P> . . . Could it be that you are letting imagination cavort and are picturing John Lewis burning in the flames of hell ? . . . <P> <P> MARTIN E. COPENHAFER <P> Los Angeles <P> Sirs : <P> I positively shuddered when ... I looked at that face of Lewis on the front page . To think that a country like ours could produce such a specimen ! I am not talking about his physical features , because no man can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we grow in years , and . . . John L. Lewis has developed the cruelty of a man mad for power . . . who cares not what happens to the rest of humanity . . . . <P> M. B. GRAHAM <P> No Reflexion on the Flavour <P> Sirs : <P> In your issue of Dec. 16 , in a very able analysis of the difficulties of the British Empire ( page 30 ) , your reporter states : " British justice , tramp steamers and Scotch whiskey loosely bind a diverse association of peoples . . . . " <P> This , in TIME , must shock all thinking men . Nor is this the first time in recent years that this same gross error has marred your factual pages . I humbly suggest that TIME reporters may search throughout this perilous world , from icebound Greenland to hellbent Reno , from Glasgow to Shanghai , and not find so much as one bottle of Scotch whiskey with which to fortify themselves in their admirable pursuit of truth . <P> There are , of course , bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credibly informed , Irish whiskey . And , above all , there is-for the comfort of men of good will within and without the British Empire-Scotch whisky . <P> <P> MICHAEL ARLEN <P> New York City <P> TIME yields to no one ( certainly not to Author Arlen ) in its admiration for Scotch but likes bourbon and rye too ; and life is too short to spell whiskey two ways. - ED . <P> Attention : Mr. Hearst <P> Sirs : <P> In the Dec. 16 issue of TIME there was an article about the new Hearst comic strip . William Randolph Hearst speaks of the boy Dick being the son of the keeper of the Liberty Statue . It is not the Liberty Statue ; it is the Statue of Liberty . He is not the keeper ; he is superintendent . My name is not Dick ; it is , <P> JACK MARSHALL <P> Bedloe 's Island <P> New York , N.Y . <P> <P> Relativity <P> Sirs : <P> ... In the Dec. 16 issue of TIME I find the following statements : First , from the Sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His ball-carrying backfield mates are virtually middle-aged men ( average : 28 ) . " <P> Now , in the same issue , I quote from the Books Department : " Erich Maria Remarque gave middle-agedly of his bnght-but-second-best in Arch of Triumph ? '
