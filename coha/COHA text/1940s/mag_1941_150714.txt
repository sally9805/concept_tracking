The U.S. soldier in uniform . Model 1941 , tends to be casual to the point of slouchiness , conspicuously lacks the ramrod posture of the German soldier or the U.S. Marine . But the equipment the U.S. soldier slouches in is , according to the U.S. Army , the best in the world . To outfit and maintain a U.S. soldier , from toilet kit ( 63 ) to overcoat ( $12.54 ) , and buy his organizational equipment , from shovels ( 68 ) to hymnals for the chapels ( $33.75 a set ) , costs $262.35 a year . Complete with Garand ( $96 ) , the Army rifleman 's equipment ( including maintenance but not ammunition ) sets the U.S. Treasury back $258.35 a year . Average annual civilian expenditure on clothes ( estimated ) : $80 . The soldier 's bill for clothing only : $157.71.
