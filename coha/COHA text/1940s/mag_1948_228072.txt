One of Canada 's best-dressed women ( TIME , Jan. 26 ) was out last week ringing doorbells , talking with housewives , speaking to Tory meetings . Fiorenza Drew , wife of Premier George Drew , had taken on the job of lining up votes for George in this week 's provincial elections . <P> " Fiorenza , " said a Toronto Tory last week , " is the best thing that ever happened to George . " She has an easy grace and charm ; her husband is reserved : his enemies call him haughty . In a recent 4,000-mile campaign swing through the Lakehead and northern Ontario Mrs. Drew made scores of speeches on the same platform with the Premier . " I just stand up and chat , " says Fiorenza . " I do n't get into the issues of the election . I let George do that . " She was a big success . Said one of her listeners : " A lot of people , if they had their choice between George and Fiorenza , would pick Fiorenza . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born in Florence , educated in Europe and the U.S. She speaks French and Italian fluently , finds both an asset in her barnstorming . " Did you know , " she asked , " that there are 5,000 Italians in the Soo ? They love to hear their language spoken . " <P> A good mimic , she often wows French audiences with take-offs of people who heckle husband George . She has never been heckled herself . Fiorenza 's chats in English run about five minutes , those in French or Italian seven to 15 . She hugs a mike like a crooner , turns it over to George with , " Now you did n't come here to listen to me . I 'm going to sit down and let the men do the work . " <P> In the five years since Drew became Ontario 's Premier , his wife has been knee-deep in politics . At the same time she is not too busy to keep an eye on her two children , Sandra , 8 , and Edward , 10 . During last fortnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , was constantly picking up little souvenirs to take them . " I feel as if I 'm working 26 hours a day , " she said . " But I like it , you know . "
