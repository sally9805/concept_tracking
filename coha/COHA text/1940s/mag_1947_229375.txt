If figures mean anything , organized religion in the U.S. has little to shout hallelujah about . The Twentieth Century Fund 's monumental 3-year study ( America 's Needs &; Resources , published this week ) adds a few sorry details to a sorry story that U.S. churchmen already know : <P> Membership . Church membership figures have always been computed in a way that would make a certified public accountant shudder : different denominations keep their records in different ways , and few churches agree on just who should be counted a church member . Listing only those 13 years or older , the overall muni ber of church members ( Protestant , Catholic and Jewish ) dropped in the decade between 1930 and 1940 from 534 per 1,000 of population to 507 . <P> Biggest numerical gain between 1926 and 1941-42 was scored by the largest single sect , * the Roman Catholics , with 4.3 million . But by percentages , Roman Catholicism is doing no better than the general trend : during the same period , " the 43 larger Protestant denominations showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percentage gain of the Roman Catholic Church 23.3% . " <P> Ministers . In 1900 , the U.S. had 137 clergymen per 100,000 citizens . Today the ratio has fallen to approximately 104 . Ministers ' salaries average less than $2,000 ( much less in rural areas ) , for which the average congregation gets two Sunday sermons , an adult Sunday-school class , personal consultation , active leadership in civic organizations and youth groups . <P> " A rather high proportion of clergymen , " says the report , " have never had any special training for their jobs . . . . According to a study in 1926 of the education of 105,000 clergymen in the Roman Catholic Church , 17 white Protestant denominations and in three Negro bodies , the typical Roman Catholic clergyman has had a better educational preparation for his responsibilities than the Protestant minister . " Since 1926 , the training of rural ministers has shown " marked improvement . " <P> Money . As Government and secular agencies have been taking on more &; more of the burden of social welfare , church expenditures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise in consumer income of $10 billion between 1929 and 1941 , contributions to churches and social welfare institutions dropped from $1.5 billion to $1.2 billion . And to churches " families at the lowest income levels contributed more generously than those at the highest . " <P> <P> *Second largest , the Methodist Church ; third , the Southern Baptist Convention ; fourth , Jewish Congregations .
