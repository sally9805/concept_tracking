it means a part of my girlhood that can still stir wings within me . " She opened the door and they stepped into what seemed to Hatcher a small stone-walled Gothic chapel . Opposite him was the stained-glass window he 'd seen flash into color one night , and before it stood something like an altar , a priedieu bet ween lighted big candles spiked upon tall candlesticks of ancient wrought iron . Hatcher was puzzled but reverent . " This was my oratory when I was a young girl , " Mrs. Florian said . " At fifteen I became a Romanist and offered up long , long prayers here . Of course I 'm a pagan now . Every sensible person is ; do n't you think ? " " Yes , " Hatcher replied , and just stopped himself from saying " Why , certainly ! " again . " I 'm a pagan , " she repeated , facing the priedieu . " Only pagans can find any reality in this brief flight of a swallow'swing across the light , this little flicker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him gravely . " Being a pagan , I 'm never false to myself ; I 'm never cowardly enough to resist my impulses . You understand that I had one . the first moment I saw you , do n't you ? " " An impulse about  --  about me ? You mean you had an impulse to bring me home with you ? " " Yes  --  even to bring you here , to my oratory , with me . I wondered . " " You did ? You wondered  --  " " I wondered if you were somebody with whom I could be utterly myself . " " Well , I certainly hope so , " Hatcher said . " I 'm sure I  --  "  | " We 'll see , " she interrupted , speaking softly . " I 'm a pagan but  --  is n't it strange ?  --  I 'm still religious . I 've never once in my life come into this place without saying a prayer . I do n't know to whom or to what I pray ; but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let me . " Hatcher felt alarmingly clumsy . " You mean  --  right now ? " " Yes , I do . " She smiled at him ; then was grave again . Turning away from him suddenly , she advanced a long , sweeping step toward the priedieu , sank with disarming grace upon one knee before it , raised both arms high , widely apart ; then slowly brought the palms of her hands together , and closed her eyes . Her shapely lips moved , and the uplifted hands , pearly in the thin still candlelight , remained poised for moments ; there were rhythmic faint gleamings in the trimly waved thick black hair , and Hatcher knew that never before had he seen so beautiful a kneeling figure . He was startled but touched , too , by so much faith in his sympathetic understanding ; and she was quickly upon her feet again , as gracefully as she 'd sunk down . " There ! " she said , and smiled wistfully . " Does that prove what I wondered about you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " she interrupted . " You 're only thinking you 've just found out how theatrical I can be ! " " I 'm not , " he assured her . " Indeed I 'm not ! I would n't have any such idea . " " You 're sure ? Then perhaps I 'll tell you what I prayed . " Again she seemed doubtful of him . " Americans nowadays use an expression , I believe  --  ' putting on an act ' . You 're sure you do n't think that 's what I 've just been doing for you ? " " No , no ! Never ! I would n't  --  " She smiled again , and nodded , satisfied . " No , I see you do n't . You do understand . You 're very different from your uncle . He used to tell me that my little oratory was  --  was near-silk ! " Her smile departed . " Uncle Victor ? " Hatcher said . " No , I 'm really not a bit like him ; you never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you can not . I found that out long ago . He does n't seem to have changed a great deal . " " Well  --  " Hatcher did n't care to put in much time , just now , talking about his uncle . " You said perhaps you 'd tell me what you prayed . " " Perhaps I shall . You 're taller than your uncle , more an Ide than a Linley , and yet there 's something about you that 's like him . I thought I noticed he limps a little more than he used to . " " Yes , " Hatcher said . " Ile got smashed up a bit in the other World War , you know . " " Yes , I know . I suppose that 's still found a part of his fascination for the girls ? " " Girls ' ? " 1 Etcher was puzzled . " Of course they like hint and make the sort of fuss over hint they do over older people ; Ina if you mean do they get gaga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of his age . " " I see , " Mrs. Florian said . " No , of course they would n't  --  on account of his age . I suppose , though , in older circles  --  among faded widows and married women  --  " " Oh , yes ; everybody likes him . "  | " Naturally . " She gave Hatcher a side glance and smiled again . " We wo n't waste any more words on him . We 're more interesting , ourselves , are n't we ? Do you like my little oratory ? " " I think it 's great . " She looked down , then up ; and laughed charmingly . " And me ? " This took his breath . " I think  --  I think you 're the goods ! " he said , and , again feeling off key , he tried to do better . " I think you 're rather glorious : " " Nonsense ! " " I do ! " " Then  --  " She stopped laughing . " Then I 'll tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a new friend . Since I came home I 've heard another American expression . See if I use it correctly . I prayed that I might find a new friend . So what ? ' " " Do you mean  --  " he began . " Yes , I do ! " " Oh ! " Hatcher said . They stood looking at each other then in a silence that seemed spontaneous between them and was understood by Hatcher as a ceremonial hush following the completion of an emotional compact  --  one that was to be effective his whole life long . This look , full of earnest promises on his part and mysteries on hers , was slowly beingsevered when another Philippine Islander , not he who had opened the front door , spoke from the entrance to the corridor . " Madam serve ' . "  |p104MRs  . FLORIAN explained that her diningroomwas a vast and lonely place still occupied by scaffoldingand step-kidders ; they dined in a small but rosy bower , lighted by candles and a brisk little fire . The guest , no expert , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but he was n't able to give then ) much attention . 1 le was not himself  --  at least not as he 'd heretofore known himself . He wished to talk brilliantly , but could barely talk at all ; and , when he did , he heard himself with misgiving . He could n't remember ever listening to himself before when he spoke ; he wished he 'd formed the habit , for even his pronunciation of certainsimple words seemed execrable . He heard himself burring his It 's and nasally shortening his A 's , and , when once or twice he tried to improve his utterance , he blushedp105in shame of the affectation . He felt fluttery under the breastbone ; his head seemed to be filled with light  --  rosy amber light , a little foggy . Sometimes he did n't know what the lady across the table was saying to him ; he was too preoccupied with just the sound of her voice and the sight of her face above the bowl of yellow-hearted pink small chrysanthemums in the center of the lacy table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She told him of her life in France , now and then speaking of it intimately . " How quickly a whole phase of one 's existencecan become dreamlike ! " she said , finishing this subject . " Already it seems a mere vapor of my imagination that I ever lived in that villa at Vesinet . Sometimes I wonder how on earth it 's happened that here I am again in this American Midland town that I was born in ; but of course I had to come somewhere  --  and here was this house of mine . I could n't stay in France , and naturally I had to become an American citizen again , with a man as grasping as Colonel Florian trying to seize upon everything  --  oh , yes ; even after the decree of divorce ! I suppose one learns to live through almost anything , even through scenes of unspeakable sordidness . One must n't go into the details of a disillusionment , though , not even with a  --  friend . " " Please do , " Hatcher said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't mean  --  I mean  --  " " No , no . " She smiled , and rose from the table . " We 'll talk of lovelier things . If you 've finished your coffee we 'll just sit by the fire and pretend we 've known each other ever since we were born . Could you ? " Hatcher could ; and , upon a gesture from her , the twop106Islanders who had begun to clear the table moved a delicatelittle sofa from the wall and placed it before the fire . Hatcher and Mrs. Florian sat down , side by side . She waved her cigarette toward his and the two thin streams of smoke were joined for a moment before disappearing upward in the firelight . " People 's lives are like that sot net lutes , are n't they ? " she said . " They float to each other mingle a while  --  then separate like that and go up the chimney ! Are our two lives like that , perhaps ? " " Our two lives ? " Hatcher spoke in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope - " " I help me , " she said , and leaned back . " Almost all the faces at your mother 's this afternoon were familiar to me ; but I 've forgotten so much  --  the names and who people are and what they are . I must begin to know about them again of course , since I 'm to live with them . You 'll tell me ? " " Sure . I mean " " 1 tried , " Mrs. Florian went on . " This morning , for instance , I took the telephone book and began to pick out the names I remembered ; Intl bring to mind the faces that belonged to theme . Curiously , I recall quite a number of names that ae n't iii the telephone book any more . By the way , your uncle 's was one of them . " She laughed absently . " Does he feel himself to be so terrifically importantnowadays that he wo n't have his name in the telephone boot : ? " " Uncle Victor ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calls that he  --  "  | " Good Lord , no ! " Hatcher said . " I mean , certainly not business calls . He has n't even got an office any more . " " He 's retired ? " " Retired ? No . Plumb flopped ! " Hatcher said . " The Depression  --  " " Really ? " Mrs. Florian spoke quickly . " But he al-ways  --  " " Uncle Victor 's an architect , you know , and for years there has n't been any building going on , to speak of . " " I see . " She was meditative for a moment . " I 'm glad he did n't come to-night . I suppose you heard me asking him ? If he 'd come it would have prevented  --  this ! " With light fingers she just touched the back of Hatcher 's hand . " I suppose when ladies want to get hold of him  --  if they still do  --  they call him at his club . I think it used to be the Carlyle Club ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find  --  " " No , it 's out , " Hatcher said . " It 's gone and he does n't belong to any nowadays . I 'm afraid you 'll have to get used to a lot of things being different ; I 've had to do that , myself . For instance , most of those people you met this afternoon at my mother 's , old Butternut Lane and Company , of course they 're still putting up a front all right ; but a lot of it must be just window-dressing  --  certainly with those who depend on real estate for their incomes . Speaking of that , there 's something I 'd like your advice about . " " My advice ? " A somewhat dry amusement might have been detected in Mrs. Florian 's expression . " My advice  --  about real estate ? " " Yes . You see my father owns a lot of vacant housesp1o8 that we could n't even give away because they eat their heads off in taxes and interest on mortgages ; but I have a theory that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all freshened up in new paint you can always rent it . Do n't you think so ? " Her response was not elaborate . " Very likely . " " What I want to ask you , " I ! atelier went on eagerly , " it 's that there 's a certain shade of grayish putty-color I 'd use on the stain body of the house , with a grayish apple-green for trim ; and I never saw more taste in color than you 've got in this house , so do you think  --  " " Your uncle 's an architect . " Mrs. Florian showed more animation . " Why do n't you ask him ? " Hatcher felt a little let down . " I did ; but I do n't think I got hint to put his mind on it much . As I was saying , real estate in this town 's gone blooey complete . I hope you do n't own any " " No ; except t his house , " Mrs. Florian said . " My grandfathernever believed in real property @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country ? " Then , as Hatcher looked blank , she laughed as if slightly amused by an inconsequent recollection . " I seem to recall that he used to talk about building a house on some ground he owned along a pretty creek , miles out of town . He alwaysloved the country , and now , since his club 's gone , I just wondered if perhaps he 'd built that house he planned . " " Lord , no ! " l latcher laughed ruefully . " He does n't own any land in the country nowadays , or anything worth anything that I know of . All he seems to have left is the old Linley house ' way down on Sheridan Avenue ;  |p109and  I happen to know the gross income from that 's amounted to exactly fourteen dollars in four years . I do n't know what the poor old bird does live on ; but he seems to get along somehow in his own way . " " Where ? " Mrs. Florian again spoke quickly . " At your house ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives down on Sheridan Avenue , a few blocks from the terrible old Linley place . I suppose as boardinghousesin that part of town go , it 's not so bad ; but  --  " " A boarding-house ? " The idea seemed to startle Mrs. Florian . " Victor Linley ! Why , Sheridan Avenue was beginning to be a wreck even before I left here ! " " Oh , good old Uncle Victor takes it all right , " Hatcher said . " Got a dog they let him wash in the cellar and you 'd never know from him he 's not perfectly contented . " " No , " she assented . " I 'm sure you would n't  --  from him . " " Me , I do n't get him , " Hatcher said , and for a troubled moment wondered if it could be possible that Mrs. Florian had brought him home with her less on his own account than his uncle 's . Then , feeling the strongly personal glow of her eyes upon him , he dismissed the suspicion ; nevertheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like a lot of these other people that seem to be just taking it lying down and still smiling . Why did they ever let the country get into this condition ? Of course I 'm just beginning to be a miserable kind of rent collector down in that very section . I try to collect rents all up and down Sheridan Avenue every day , and is it a bum job ! I 'm trying to learn my father 's business from somewhere belowthe bottom ; but I  --  " He paused , and the firelightp1loupon his earnest young face made clear his expression of conscientious modesty . " I do n't suppose I ought to talk so much about myself ; but -- well , you 've made me feel  --  Well , if I could , I 'd like to tell you  --  " " Yes . " She leaned forward , resting her elbow upon her knee and her cheek upon her hand , with her eyes in warm shadow . " You must tell rue all about yourself . Everything . I want to know everything . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd known each other all our lives ? " " Yes . " Hatcher 's moved voice was almost a whisper . " Yes , somehow I feel as if we had . " " Yes , " she said . " When did this happen to him  --  to Victor Linley ? How long has he been living in a boarding-house on Sheridan Avenue ? " " Oh , quite a while , I gather . You see , I 've been mostly away a long time , myself - wasting my energy in college while the whole world was going to pot . I  --  I 'd like to tell you how I feel about that . 1 --  " " Yes , you must . Everything , " Mrs. Florian said , and rose . " First I want to play to you . " " On a piano ) " I hitcher asked , and wondered why on earth he 'd thought of such a question . " Yes , I see ; of course it would he . Yes , certainly 1 " Then he finished by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and rightly feeling that he could n't have been more banal . Ile followed her through another corridor and into a big square room so ( lark that for a moment or two the furniture was indistinguishable . The only light was that of a blue-shaded small lamp upon a distant table , and near this lamp a great black wing seemed to rise , poised forp111flight  --  the lifted lid of a concert piano . Mrs. Florian touched his arm . " Sit here , " she said , and , as he took the chair she indicated , he discovered with a groping hand that part of it was metal . Then his eyes , accommodating themselves to the interior twilight , began to perceive that the room and its furniture were " modernistic " , the dim forms were " starkly functional " , and here was another vivid token of the rich variety of the owner 's esthetic nature . She went to the piano , sank upon the bench before the keyboard , was a faintly seen still shape there for moments ; then her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first played completely mystified Hatcher . There seemed to be no harmonics at all ; certainlythere was never the hint of a melody and nowhere could he hear ; Inv resemblance to even what he was accustomed to think of as modern music . There were thunderous passages than ended indecisively ; then there were patterings from t he upper reaches of the keyboard ; then there were both but without any cohesion , or , so far as he could perceive , any meaning . " That 's Bretsch , " she said , stopping abruptly . " He has n't been heard much in America . Do you sec any resemblance to me ? " " To you ? " Hatcher asked . " Well , I  --  " " Bretsch calls it One Woman ' . " Mrs. Florian laughed.  | " He dedicated it to me . It 's his impression of me , he insists . Well , my friend , does it teach you to know me a little ? " " I wish it could ! " Hatcher spoke out so earnestly and so loudly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrified him , and the directness of what he said struck him as almost vulgar . He felt that he ought to say only subtle implying things to Mrs. Florian , especially in this spacious darkness and after such advanced music . " I mean I do n't get it , " he went on , trying to improve his effect . " That is , I get it and I do n't get it . There 's kind of a something  --  it 's a something  --  " " Yes , " Mrs. Florian said . " Everybody knows Bretsch is a great man ; but I 'm not there . He and I were too brutally different ; so how could he ? We were always quarreling . I 'm glad you did n't find me in it . Tell me : Do you get much music here ? " " I ? Well , you see , I have n't been back here long enough to  --  " " I used to starve in this town , " she said . " For music  --  among other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a Russian string quartet to play afterward  --  nothing but classics ! I told him I could n't bear it . I understandthe place is trying to be more civilized nowadays and has something like a real symphony orchestra ; but I reserve my opinion till I 've heard it . I went into the art museum they seem to rather brag about now ; and a young man there told me that they were at last hoping to acquire a Picasso . About time ! I found they did n't even know anything at all about Mordling and how far he 's gone beyond Picasso . Mordling told me at Biarritz last year that only two museums and one collector in America had pictures of his ! What do you think of that ? " " Well , I  --  I suppose it 's pretty grim ; but I  --  I ought to say that I myself  --  I do n't  --  " She did n't listen ; she shrugged her shoulders . " Ii I starve again it 's my own fault for coining back here when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course . Well , that 's enough repining . Now we 'll he sentimental . " With that , she began to play , expertly and with exquisitefeeling , fragments familiar to 1 hitcher , though he could n't have named them except as probably bits from Chopin and I.iszt most likely . When she stopped he was panicky , afraid he 'd say the wrong thing ; therefore he only murmured " Great ! " in a voice so low that he did n't know whether she heard him or not . She rose , came towardhint and stood before him . Ile got out of his chair . " Do you know the most frequently repeated line in Shakespeare 's plays ? " she asked . " I think it is , Give me your hand . ' " " Is  --  is it ? You mean you  --  " Ile took the hand she extended . " I must n't keep you any later to-night , my new old friend , " she said . " Alen tire easily if they 're quickly given  --  much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 hitcher was breathless . " You 'll make it a date ? I mean  --  " " Yes , " she said . " Could you conic about four o'clock ? I 'd like to take you driving with Inc . Would you ? " " I would ! " I hitcher said , with an emphasis that again seemed to be almost vulgar ; but he was reassured by thep115fact that her hand remained firmly in his for the moment of silence that followed and was their parting . Out of Mrs. Florian 's house , he could n't go home at once . His head and chest were both tumultuous , and the autumnal night air was delicious upon cheeks that tingled from within . He walked the whole length of Butternut Lane , then back again to where it debouched from the boulevard that came out from the city , and , as he passed along a familiar hedge , near this upper end of the Lane , he heard faint sounds of a jazzing piano and hints of singingvoices . The windows of the Aldriches ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he felt an ' easy condescension toward what was going on there  --  Harry Aldrich at the piano , with his doting wife and Dorcy , and Pinkie Wilson , and probably some more of " the crowd " whooping and " swinging " , having themselves a big time . To Hatcher their pleasures seemed childish , even ignoble , and yet befitting . Why should n't little people have their little enjoyment of the kind of things they enjoy ? Nothing about himself could have seemed more ridiculousthan that he 'd lately been rather jealous of Pinkie Wilson . Lately ? Yes , lately by the calendar  --  but already that feeling appeared to have been an experience in another life , a dull small life from which he 'd suddenly and marvelously emerged . There was n't anything really to object to about Pinkie Wilson . A perfectly decent fellowin his pretty-faced dumb little way . Dorcy Aldrich was a good girl , and Hatcher liked her ; but if she wantedp116to grope about with Pinkie Wilson , why should n't she ? Hatcher felt nothing but benevolence for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt something else , at least temporarily , when he finally entered his father 's house . I lis mother sat alone in the living-room , with a book face down upon her lap , and , though she smiled when he spoke to her , there was a wan anxiety in her face ; it reached him even through the exaltation of his mood . " What 's the matter , Mother ? " he asked . " I 'm afraid you must he tired to death after standing up through all t kit party this afternoon . " " No , I 'm not tired , I ' archer . " " Then what 's the " He paused . Disturbing recent events , for sonic hours forgotten , recalled themselves to his mind . " See here , Father 's in some kind of jam and you know what it is and it 's eating you up . Well , I ought to be helping ; but how can I if you do n't tell me ? I would n't dare ask Fat her again , and down at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I 'm only there about fifteen minutes twice a day , and , though Barry Aldrichsays I Ii , boy ! ' to me when he 's going in or out , the only person I ever get to talk to 's old Mr. Barley , and he 's in his second childhood and never knew anything anyhow . Yet I 'm supposed to be learning the business ! Well , if this is a business trouble , ought n't you to tell me ? " He put his hand upon his mother 's shoulder . " Why wo n't you come clean with me ? What is it that 's griping you like this ? " " Nothing , " she said , in a voice so frail that it was almost unheard ; then she looked up , smiled again and tried to speak casually . " Did you have a pleasant evening ? Didp117Sarah Florian seem pleased with our having had the Tea for her ? " " Pleased , Mother ? Why , naturally . I 'm sure she was . " " Did she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't exactly  --  " He was vague . " Did she  --  " Mrs. Ide paused , looked down at her hands , which were folded rather tightly above the book upon her lap . " Did Sarah  --  Do you think she 's pleased to be back among the old friends of her family ? Did she happen to speak of any of us  --  the Aldriches , for instance , or your Aunt Ada  --  or your Uncle Victor  --  or anybody ? " " Aunt Ada ? No , I do n't think so , Mother ; but it seems to me we did talk a little about Uncle Victor . Yes , E remember . I happened to mention that he 's living in a boarding-house down on Sheridan Avenue and she seemed surprised to hear it . " " Was that all  --  just surprised ? " " Why , yes . What  --  " " Nothing , " Mrs. Ide said . " We all used to know her pretty well , you see , and I just wondered if she still takes some interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us she spoke of ? " " Yes , I believe so , Mother . You see , with a woman like that you find so many things to talk about because she 's  --  " Hatcher , with sudden caution , denied his desire to continuewarmly upon this theme . He yearned to talk to his mother of Sarah Florian , to ask a thousand questions about her and to learn everything of her that he could ; but something within him warned him to shy away from the subject . He had an impression that it would n't be loyal to ask questions that might n't be answered sympa- thetically ; intuition strongly suggested that he 'd be happierif he did n't talk about Mrs. Florian to anyone at all  --  or listen , either . Somebody 'd be certain to tell him about that Spaniard again . " Yes , I believe Uncle Victor was the only one of the family we mentioned , " he said , and added quickly , " You really ought to be in bed by this time , Mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set her book upon a table beside her , rose and in a troubled way looked as if something had pleased her . She kissed her son . " Goodnight , dear . Valk lightly as you pass your father 's room . I 'm afraid so many people this afternoon tired him , and then of course there 's the dreadful expense . Goodnight , dear . " . . . I hatcher , in bed , did n't fall asleep so quickly as was his custom ; but he was glad to remain awake . Ethereal , he seemed to float through Mrs. Florian 's great house , following a stirringly graceful black velvet figure and a white neck with dully glistening black hair above it  --  following through corridors into candle-lighted rooms , one of them with an altar and a stained-glass window , another with rosy firelight that played upon crystal and silver and white lace and pink chrysanthemums , and flashed twinkling little highlights into a pair of softly inscrutable dark eyes that looked at him long and mysteriously . Mysteriously ? Yes , mysterious with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le remembered lightheaded pretty little Mrs. Aldrich 's jocose allusion to Sarah Florian 's " affairs of passion " and again he recalled his Aunt Ada 's sniffy reference to Sarah Florian 's marrying a Spaniard " almost overnight " ; but hep119thought himself already above being indignant with either of these traducers . People dislike what they do n't understand , he thought , and how could these commonplace neighborhood ladies understand a magnificent , ( lark , glowing woman like Mrs. Florian , a brilliant woman of the world who dwelt deeply and richly in exotic life and not in their provincial corners . They were mere petty local extroverts ; whereas she was really of a hardboiled paganism , bold and frank  --  yet at the same time she was touchingly religious and so wrapped in darkest velvet that she 'd never be revealed except to the eyes she herself selected . Now , so long as he lived , he 'd never forget her answeredprayer for a new friend  --  nor what Shakespeare most often wrote : " Give me your hand " . Again and again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the lovely voice hushed in the almost complete darkness of the music-room . " Give me your hand " ! Then , as he came nearer to his sleep , another literary allusion drifted into his charmed mind  --  a recollection of one of those old Nineteenth Century books that had been required reading during a long-ago phase of his education , " Henry Esmond " . Yes , Henry Esmond had married a woman quite a little older than Henry Esmond was , and it had been a happy marriage . With this last somewhat coherent thought , young Hatcher Ide passed into a state of slumber.  |p120He  MIGHT almost as well have remained inthat slumber throughout the next day . As he went his rounds he presented to view , if anybody had understood , a fine sample of dual personality . One of his selves , mainly body , performed the functions of a struggling young business man while the other , gone poet , floated among mirages of pink chrysanthemums , Gothic glass and kneelingbeauty , to the accompaniment of an ethereal grand piano . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a side street off Sheridan Avenue , downtown , and found Gilpin Murray and Gilpin 's cousin , Mary , scraping off dampened wallpaper in a dismayinglittle parlor . Mary , looking tall in a green smock , and with herp121sleeves rolled high , did n't stop work when Hatcher appeared ; but Gilpin willingly paused to explain her and for conversation . " Do n't worry ; she is n't in on my contractwith you , Hatch , " he said . " She 's only helping me out because of cousinly admiration for me and love of my new art . She has a day 's vacation from the Library on account of it 's the County Chairman 's funeral or something . Tried to get Amy too ; but Mother stuck her to sew . " With the air of a collector displaying a masterpiece , he stepped backward and waved a hand toward the horriblewall . " Well , how does it look to you ? " " To me ? " Hatcher asked . " Look ?

You did n't know it even after you put the water down on a velvet chair for somebody to sit on . " " I did n't , " Hatcher said . " I do n't know what you 're talking about . I did n't . " " Did ! Mary saw it , too . Did n't you , Mary ? " Mary Gilpin , not turning her head , went on industriouslywith her scraping . " Yes , I did . " " There ! " Gilpin said . " Want any more proof ?

Good-bye . " Mary stopped scraping and turned her head . " Amy ca n't get away ; but Dorcy said she 'd make a four with us this afternoon . We thought we 'd have time for nine holes before dinner . Meet us there at five ? " " Meet you ? " Hatchcr asked . ' There ? Where ? " " At the municipal links in the Park , I latcher . " " Oh , no , " he said absently . " Thanks , I 'd like to  --  but I ca n't . I 'm sure you 'll enjoy it ; but I have to see Mr. Floatus now before twelve o'clock , so good-bye . " He wandered away as driftingly as he 'd come in . The cousins were left staring at each other , Gilpin wonderinglybut with some humor , Mary without any humor at all . Mrs. Florian rater 1 archer almost at the door when he arrived for their afternoon drive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a radical to censure Pinkie Wilson for playing polo during the Depression , he felt no disapprovalof this lady for her need of two spruce maids to aid her final preparation for the outdoors  --  one to bring her a muff and the other to hand her a bag of enmeshed gold and platinum links . On the spot , and without internal argument , I hitcher revised his view of economics . He perceived that not the rich but those who work for them benefit- most by luxurious expenditures ; the worker gets his living , the spender only superfluous finery . The costly meshed bag had made employment for many people , beginning with the miners who brought forth its metals ; and in his generous new mood Hatcher couldp123easily have forgiven Pinkie the polo ponies that kept stablemen off relief rolls . So swift , sometimes , is the emotional swing from left wing to right . Mrs. Florian murmured to her handmaidens in French , a Filipino opened the door , and another Islander , new to Hatcher , preceded her down the steps and opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat , excluded from the interior by glass , sat not the mulatto chauffeur of last evening but a white man in black livery . Hatcher , having disposed of his previous economics , felt that a magnificent woman had the right to surround herself magnificently ; luxury had an artistic propriety as the background for Mrs. Florian and was a perfect part , so to speak , of her picture . Of that picture , the foreground , holding and compelling the center of his gaze , or anyone 's , was of course the miraculous face , which he now for the first time saw in the light of day . Something of mystery was retained , however . The sable collar of Mrs. Florian 's coat was high and close , and a dotted mesh veil descended half way to her chin . Old George stood beaming at the gates , and , as the car passed between them , he removed his cap and bowed enthusiastically . Hatcher waved to him through the closed window . " Until last night everything about your gorgeous house has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old George , " he said . " Old George is a lifelong friend of mine . " " Is he ? " Mrs. Florian 's tone was thoughtful . " I understandthe workmen found the place in a state of neglect . I do n't care especially for this English lodge-keeper effect , bobbing at the gates . I suppose he thinks he has to do it to keep up the pretense of being of use . " " Yes , the poor old fellow , " Hatcher said , and thought appreciatively of the kindness that had kept the halfdecrepitretainer on pay ( luring so many years . " Poor old George , he 's been delighted a lot over your coming home . Have you told your driver where you want to go ? Out Silver Creek way , perhaps ? " " No , not to-day , " she answered , as the car turned southward from Butternut Lane . " I told him to drive into the city . I think last night you said that down in the grimy old part is where you work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " You  --  you want - " I ! archer had to begin again . " You want to sec where I - " " Yes . " From behind the wide-meshed veil there came a glance that dazed him . " I want to see where you spend your days working in the smoke . Should n't I care to ? We had a little ceremony of friendship last night , did n't we ? " Then she spoke more briskly . " Besides , I want to go all over the old part of town and have you tell me about the changes . I suppose very few people that I used to know live down in the smoke nowadays . " " Why , no ; not any of ' em . " " My sentimentalism may shock you , " she said . " I want to see where you work  --  yes , and I want to see the old dead street where I played as a child . I was born down there , and , though I was only a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day I feel I 'd like to see what 's left of poor old Sheridan Avenue . Do you mind ? "  | " Do I mind ! " This brought him another dazing glance from her . On Sheridan Avenue she had her chauffeur stop twice , once before a sooty " used car " sales lot , the site of the house where she 'd been born , and once before the old Linley house . Here she made the delay a little longer . " Unbelievable ! " she said , and shivered as she peered intently at the big repellent relic . " The house had been vacated before I went away ; but it was n't like this . There were some trees left and a number of the people one knew still lived in the neighborhood . When I was little we childrenmet for our dancing class in the ballroom on the top floor . Your mother and your Aunt Alice and your uncle were older , of course , and not in the class ; but their sister , Nancy , the one killed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a member . Alice married a man out West , did n't she ?  --  and , by the way , I think you said your uncle lives somewhere in this horrid stretch . Where ? " " It 's a boarding-house , " Hatcher said . " We passed it coming down ; it 's a few blocks back . Just over on West Eighth Street I 've had a doorway and window-trim painted those colors I was telling you about . I 'd like to get your ideas about that , and if you like we could look in on a couple of working-people I 've got scraping off wallpaper inside a house near there . They  --  " " You want me to meet them ? " Mrs. Florian was indulgentlyamused . " You already know them . Anyhow , you met ' em yesterdayat my mother 's , and their families are old neighbors of yours . It 's Gilp Murray that lives just across Butternut Lane from our house and his cousin Mary Gilpin from next door beyond . I 've got Gilp on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilp 's got Mary on his , at least for to-day and without pay any time ; so you see what a head for business I have , after all ! If they 're still there we could give ' cm a look-in . You  --  you were so awfully kind as to say you - you felt some interest in where I work , and I really would like to get your opinion on what colors we ought to use for the interiors . Besides that , just below here there are one or two more of the old big houses left . If you 'd like , we 'll  --  " " No ; it 's too harrowing ! " She tapped upon the glass before them ; signalled the driver to turn about . He did so and they went northward . For a moment Hatcher felt a little disappointed by the sketchiness of her survey of his field of endeavor ; but she smiled and her shoulder touched his . " Sights as sordid as this always half-suffocate me , " she said . " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen enough to know what splendid determination must be a part of your character  --  to keep you doggedly spending your days in such an environment . At my first sight of you I had the feeling that you care for fine and beautiful things as much as I do ; so now I know what your hours and hours down here must cost you . You mentioned that Victor Linley lives somewhere about here . If we happen to pass the place  --  " " It 's yonder , " Hatcher said . " Up ahead . Now you can see it . There . It 's the house just beyond the filling-station and  --  " " That ? " She leaned partly across Hatcher , staring from the window . " That scrawny brick house with the red grocery on the other side of it ? "  | " Yes ; that 's it . " " Victor Linley ! " Mrs. Florian spoke the name in a sort of gasp ; then she leaned back and laughed briefly and oddly . " Victor Linley ! " Hatcher had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You do n't really like him ? Uncle Victor 's generally supposed to 've always been pretty popular . Did he ever do something you did n't  --  " " Oh , dear me , no ! " she said quickly . " It was only the contrast that struck me . You see , when I came out he was one of the older men ' of course and immensely looked up to as always the glass of fashion and the mould of form . That ugly cramped boarding-house down here in this dinginess , it seems just a  --  a bit inconceivable ! Do you know somewhere out of the smoke where we could go for a cup of tea ? " " Ye  --  es . " Hatcher had a qualm ; then hastily recalled that there was as much as four dollars , of his own , in his pocket . " Yes , there 's a place called The Green Heron about two miles north of Butternut Lane . I do n't know how good the tea is . " Mrs. Florian said it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could talk ; but after they 'd been given a red lacquered table in a rather crowded room at The Green Heron she was by no means talkative . As for Hatcher , he was n't aware of how silently he sat and looked at her ; nor of the proof she gave him that her preference for candle-lighted dim rooms in her own house was an esthetic choice rather than the defensive precautionof a woman who knows she can no longer be beautifulexcept in shadow . Late sunshine came copiously through the large western windows of the tea-room ; Mrs. Florian pushed her veil above her eyes , widely opened the fur collar from her throat and glanced at Hatcher as if she asked gravely , " Did you think I did n't dare ? " He 'd had no such doubts and therefore did n't perceive her challenge . " You 're not drinking your tea , " she said . " I 'm not ? " I ! archer drank seriously , and again occupiedhimself with gazing at her . Mrs. Florian 's silence gave consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and then ; but after a time she asked , " Who are your amused little friends ? " " Where ? " " In the doorway , just going out . " Hatcher turned a ! dank face slowly to look over his shoulder . Passing out through the doorway were several girls and a boy or two , all of them in a mirthful slight commotion . ' Hie last of the girls , flushed with her gayety , looked back at Hatcher , met his stare of vacant inquiry and uttered a giggling squeak . She flicked him the wave of a gloved hand that for an unknown reason seemed mocking , and then was gone . crowd of canaries . The one that waved to me was Lennie Aldrich , Dorcy 's cousin  --  I mean , she 's related to Mr. and Mrs. Aldrich next door to you on the other side from our house . They 're always whooping ; they do n't count . " Then , as Mrs. Florian smiled upon him , he had a shortness of breath , and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counts except  --  except  --  " His voice faded out ; though not because hep129suspected that what he was saying had n't much novelty . " No , nothing else does , " she said satisfactorily ; and he felt that another almost unbearably dear and far-reaching ceremony had taken place between them . When he left her at her own door , at the end of a succeedingalmost talkless half hour together , he was again unable to go directly home . Just before the door closed upon her , she 'd looked over her shoulder to ask : " You 'd like my playing to you again ? " " Like it ? Would I like it ? " " Then to-night  --  about nine ? " " Oh ! " Hatcher said . " Oh , thank you ! " With long , exultant steps he strode through the twilight . To-night , upon her own initiative , he 'd again be with her in a companionship of two alone . Three times she 'd asked him  --  and all in the space of the one day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dizzying significance ; no one could be so humblemindedas not to perceive that . Her three invitations were assuredly the promise that this new companionship  --  a finer , loftier and yet more warmly enticing one than any he 'd ever known before  --  would continue and grow closer . How close who could say ? Already it was an intimacy when most was expressed in looks and silences , not words . He 'd be content , nay exhilarated , to keep it just as it was ; and , radiantly foreseeing that he was to be with her in following days as often as during this first one , he felt that he was entering the door of an exquisite new life in which he could be happy so long as he and she could share moments that seemed complete comprehen/sions of each other , could have little ceremonies of friendship  --  andhe could look and look at her . Through lovely dusk and caressive darkness young Hatcher went , more borne than walking . The dull everyday evening meal at home was almost over before he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his almost forgotten family.  |p131YOUTH  , even in a Depression , even in " realistic " hardship  --  alas ! even in war  --  must still dwell in illusion ; but when the illusion is sweet the hours of delight are keener than they can be again . So , naturally , the breaking up of fond absorptions in the unreal startle the young into sharp agitations and despondencies . Hatcher Ide so lost himself in the excluding new life he thought he lived with Sarah Florian , through the few fleet weeks between their first hours together and the evening of the dinner Harry Aldrich and his wife gave for her , that the very drawing-room preliminaries to the dinner brought him the sensations of a person summarily banished from home by the authorities . He had only a word from her  --  and no look at all . Her head was turned another way to speak to somebody else as he reached her ; and a regardless 2 group of people he defined as " old marrieds " immediately intervened . He felt himself thrust aside as too young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dining-room , when the company went thither , exasperatinglyconfirmed this impression . In the movement to the feast he was but an unnoticed item in a clamorous rabble of young at the tail of a parade distantly headed , not without some effect of jovial stateliness , by the host with the honored lady upon his ann . Hatcher , searching for his own proper place at table , went from disappointment to disappointment before he discovered the card marked with his name ; and , when he did find it and was seated , he thought he might as well have been sent to cat outdoors , he was that far from SarahFlorian . She was upon the beaming Harry 's right at the head of the long cent r ; tl t able ; and some thirty middle-aged and older people sat honored there . Plainly they were thought more her peers than were the chattering young groups at the smaller tables that encircled the large one like inferior sparklings clustered about the light of a great gem in the setting of a ring . Only at intervals could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , niggard glimpses of the dark lady who absorbed hint just bits of her face , a gleam of white foreheadunder rhythmic black hair , a highlight upon a lustrous eye , a corner of a mouth , pale rose , and a provocativecontour of rounded chin . He had the impression that most of the time she was talking busily to his Uncle Victor , who sat upon her right with only the top of his head visible to I latcher.  |p133The  nephew felt his exile to be an exclusion founded upon his merely numerical age , and his sense of the injusticewas acute . The wise laws of his country permitted him to vote : Was n't that enough to let him be thought fit to associate with adults ? His feeling was a little like that of a bright boy who 's been encouraged to shine in grown-up company , and , while doing so , is abruptly sent up to the nursery to join the other children . He was the one person present who 'd been exalted to bright intimacy with the guest of honor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew her , daily sharing a hundred unspokenthoughts with her  --  yet here he was on the outer fringes , and with obscurity almost conspicuously thrust upon him ! Harry Aldrich had promised to make this dinner " splendiferous " and had kept his word ; the splendor was an additional annoyance to Hatcher , and so was the mechanized excitement of the many voices . The more he looked about him , the more mortifyingly his sequestration stressed itself . He was n't even at Dorcy 's table  --  apparently was thought to be of so little weight in the world that he was n't asked to sit at the same table with the daughter of the family giving the party ! Would Mrs. Florian perhaps observe this genuine slight and deducethat he was held to be of no consequence , not only by his host and hostess but by his own contemporaries ? Dorcy 's table , placed near the head of the great central one , was noisy with laughter and importance . Dorcy seemed to be making a rosy whoop-te-do over everything , especially over Pinkie Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexplicably outrageous , she had Gilp Murray , Hatcher 's own mere employee , at that table ; and thep134mere employee was seen and heard to join Dorcy in approvingconvulsions caused by something Pinkie Wilson said . Gilp was acting like a dirty hypocrite , Hatcher thought . True , Dorcy 's best friend , Mary Gilpin , was placed next to the self-defined outcast , upon his right ; but that did n't assuage his feeling of being snubbed . Gloomy and not caring who knew it , he talked disjointedly to Mary , who 'd lately spent another holiday helping her cousin to remove wallpaper . " Gilp says he 's on the top of the wave , " she told I ! atelier . " I le says these houses he 's helpingyou do over are going to put him on pay before long because they 're sure to rent . Ile thinks you and he ought to patent that contraption for steaming the wallpaper before it 's scraped . The color you 're going to use on the interiors is good , too- really quite lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hatch . " " Ought they ? " lie asked . " I do n't seem to hear ' em doing it . Where are they all ? " " Where --  " Mary began , laughed , and then , after a glance down the room to where the hilarity at Dorcy 's table was increasing , looked serious and changed the subject . She talked for a time about college psychology courses and had such absent responses that she thought it better to let hint brood ; she began to speak to the boy on the other side of her . Hatcher was granted a seclusion that lasted until the girl at his left , Dorcy 's cousin , Lennie , startled him by a sudden dig of her elbow into his ribs . " Right you are , darling ! " she said . " Do n't try to eat or talk or anything . Just sit in that same old trance . "  | " What old trance ? " Hatcher looked at her unamiably . " Do n't jab that spike into me again ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The same one a lot of us saw you in that day at The Green Heron , darling , when you did n't have the faintest idea who your lifelong friends were or what a lovey-dove sight you were making of yourself . I hear it goes on all the time . " " You mean now , for instance ? " Struck suddenly in almost a vital part , Hatcher instinctively did his poor best to be offensive . " You mean I 'm making a lovey-dove sight of myself with you right now , beautiful ? Trying to look deep in your marvelous eyes and everything ? " " No , presh ! " Lennie laughed in a manner that convinced him he 'd been right in never thinking much of her . " My worst enemy could n't accuse me of being that old . " " That old ? " he repeated slowly ; then caught her meaning , and was speechless . " Me , I 'm just a squablet , " Lennie explained . " I could n't hope to make you the talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion in public and nobody 'd start chattering about you every time as many as two people get together , the way they do now . How do you like all of a sudden living in the great white glare of the spotlight , Hatch old son ? " " See here , " Hatcher began , indeed helpless . A choking apprehension of what she 'd say next was upon him . " If you enjoy talking gibberish  --  " " Gibberish ! " Lennie exclaimed gayly . " Can it be I 'm the first to tell you that you 've become practically But- 6 ternut Lane 's star celebrity ? Driving with her every afternoon , closeted with her every night in the dark recessesof the palace , groveling under tables in tea-rooms to find her gloves when she drops ' em  --  " " See here  --  " Hatcher floundered , all the more impotent because of fury . Strange fears , too  --  fears of hearing **25;6424;TOOLONG risen within him . " I always knew this was the worst hell-hole of gossip on earth ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; unfortunatelyfor me I do n't , and I 've never been in any tea-room with her oftener- than  --  " " Wipe the red off your face , pal ! " Lennie was in a minor ecstasy . " What a shame all these old spite-cats are starting to say you 're on the road to turning into a rich , rich lady 's gigolo ! So soon after college , too , poor child ! " She affected a confidential and compassionate manner . " It 's a crime a person ca n't go out driving afternoons regular with another person and not be seen all over everywhere looking all gaspy ! Part of it , I bet you , it 's nothing but the vulgar prattle of servants  --  all this about your being there every single night  --  because one of those Filipino boys is crazy about Aunt Eleanor Aldrich 's maid , Ella , and loves to run and tell her  --  " " What 1 " I hatcher exclaimed . " You admit yourself that servants " " Sure , I latch ! Maybe that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news fresh every morning . Think it might he the reason you 're not sitting at her table tonight ? Do listen to ' cm ! Ai n't it a shame she 's having herself such a big time with the Wilson pulchritude ? Me , I say it was a hellish cruelty not to put you at the bigp137table with the old folks , where that marvelous Mrs. Florian is . Of course it 's perfectly natural for you to go goofy over her , Hatcher , because it runs in your family , I hear . " " What ? " " Oh , yes , " Lennie said . " My mother told me yesterday that just before the giddy Sarah started in marrying around everywhere she was supposed to be engaged to one of your relatives . " " One of my rel  --  " The recollection of wild imaginings of his own rushed upon the staggered Hatcher . " You 're crazy ! My father  --  my father never  --  " " Your father ? " Lennie was first astounded , then uproarious . " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even older than she is ! How long since your father was a bachelor and in a position to be engaged to anybody ? About twenty-five years ? " Her laughter was louder and louder . " No , little Rollo , it was n't your father everybody thought she was going to marry ; it was your uncle . Just only your uncle , that 's all ! " " You  --  " Hatcher began ; but his self-possession was gone . In a quavering voice , " You 're  --  just crazy ! " was all that he was able to say . " No , dearie ! " Lennie returned , smiling upon him cruelly . " It was my mother told me . Look at her . She 's sitting at the big mature table next to your own poor father that you 've been traducing . Does n't she look fairly sane ? She told me it was never announced but everybody was sure Mr. Victor Linley and the giddy Sarah were just about to put up the banns when , bingo ! the gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Mexican ! She never  --  " " Never in her life married a Mexican ? " Lennie leaped at the chance he gave her . " Never in her whole life ? Not once ? Not one single Mexican ? Just stuck to French and Span  --  " " You 're a marvel ! " I Locher contrived to interrupt , and , horribly aware that he was trembling all over , steadied his hands by resting them upon the edge of the table . " Just to think that all this noise could come from such a little chest and throat ! " " Sweet of Nam ! " Lennie squealed . " I wish you could see your face ! Goggy-eyed over sacrilege , what ? Here 's a cute one for you , adorable : it 's by special request that your Uncle Victor 's sitting next to the guest of honor . II ' hose special request , presh ? Why , hers ! Aunt Eleanor could n't help telling . Piquant , what , under the circumstances ? Would n't it be rapturous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and maybe some day you 'll be calling her ' Aunt Sarah ' ? " " What a cut up you are ! " Hatcher had strength enough to say savagely , as he turned his shoulder upon her . Cackling voices blasphemed in sacred hidden grottoes where he was an acolyte . His nerves seemed to rock ; he was bewildered , insulted , thrown down , stamped upon and scarified . With Lennie 's laughter stinging into his reddened left ear , he swung to Mary Gilpin , a movement that was in reality a flight for shelter . Behind this always cool , high-minded girl he hoped to collect himself and be at least a little ready if Lennie struck again . " I suppose you 've heard some of the tripe I 've been talking with that pinwheel on the other side of me ? " he asked  | " Yes , " Mary Gilpin said . " If you 're really worried about Mrs. Florian 's age , Hatcher , I think you can calculateit with some accuracy . I had n't happened to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course it 's legendary what flutters he caused for years after he came home from the last war . I believe , though , Mrs. Florian was n't much over twenty-two or twenty-three the first time she was married and left here , and she 's been away only a dozen years or so . You see that comes fairly close ; she could easily be no more than thirty-five  --  or even as young as thirty-four . " " I 'm not interested ! I 'm not interested in people 's ages ! " " No , Hatcher ? Of course everybody 's been talking about her these weeks she 's been home , though I understandthey always did  --  even when she was quite a young girl . She 's the sort of person who creates that . " " Creates what ? " " Talk , " Mary said . " She emanates something ; everybody'sgot to look at her . It 's as if she herself so intensely feels that she 's the star of the play that her emotional conviction of her starship spreads a thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her just at the moment ; but they 're all conscious of her all the time  --  and she could hardly bear it if they were n't . You see that inevitably makes anybody who 's much seen with her talked about , too . Do n't be angry with Lennie , though ; she 's only being loyal . " " Loyal ! What a ridiculous  --  " " No , " Mary Gilpin said . " She 's not the only one who could feel hurt on Dorcy 's account , Hatcher. "  | " What ? " He stared at her hotly . " On Dorcy 's account ? Why , Dorcy  --  Why , weeks ago she practically dropped me for  --  " He laughed roughly . " Oh , what 's it matter ? " Mary gave him a steady look . " Are you going to let Dorcy go ? " " Let her go ? What do you lean ? I have n't got her . Never did have . She 's " " Are you ? " Mary Gilpin asked . " Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Cripe 's sake ! " I ! atelier felt he had enough to bear without having these two girls try to make him feel guilty- guilty of what ? Had n't he a right to his own life ? What was everybody trying to do to him ? " See here , " he began . " I 've always been Dorcy 's friend and always will be ; but I certainly  --  " Into his left ward ribs little Lennie Aldrich spiked her elbow again . " Listen ! Ca n't you listen even to the music ? " " What music ? " From a corridor outside the dining-room there came the strains of a harp , a flute , a violin and a ' cello playing an old Irish air to which famous words had been set by Thomas Moore . I , ed by their hearty host , the guests at the center table applauded , the young followed ; and many of the diners went so far as to lift their voices in the old song . " Get it , I latch ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those endearing young charms '  --  my gosh , who thought of that ? It 's in honor of her . Under the circumstances , what a boner , huh ? Listen , Hatch , here 's the best part ! "  |p141She  joined her shrill voice to the others . " And around the dear ruin each wish of my heart '  --  " Hatcher listened to the accursed music as long as he could ; then shouted brutally , his face almost touching Lennie 's . " Will you close that trap , or ca n't you ? I 've got some ear and you 're flat . You 're flat , I tell you ! For Gripe 's sake  --  " The music stopped ; so did Lennie , and Mary Gilpin touched Hatcher 's arm . " Sh , Hatch ! " she said . " Mr. Aldrich is going to make a speech . " Harry Aldrich , big and smiling , a glass of champagne in his hand , had risen ; and , after subduing the greeting shouts of " Yay , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " obtained silence . " Just a quick one , " he said . " After that the tables 'll be cleared away for dancing in this room by all ages , and bridge outfits are set in the living-room for addicts . The library is reserved for fiancees and fiances , and the breakfast-room for really interested drinkers . . . Who let out that cheer ? .. . But first , let 's be serious for just one moment . A dear old friend has lately returned among us . More than that , she 's a dear old family friend ; her family were for three generationsthe friends of the families of nearly every person here , and she herself spent her bright girlhood with us . Now she returns to us more beautiful and more alluring than ever . May her life among us be as much happier for herself as her presence will make our own lives for us ! Neighbors , old friends , young and old comrades in the life of our city , I give you the health of our old new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ! " Here the speaker seemed affected by emotion ; his voice trembled . " God bless you , Sarah ! " He lifted his glass , drank , and all the company , except Mrs. Florian , stood to honor the toast . Then she , rising , said , " I thank you ! " in a clear voice , and sank almost to the floor in a sweeping curtsey . When the prolonged approvingcollegiate shouting of " 1'a-a-ay ! " had died away , the exodus front the room began , with I. tarry Aldrich leading and Sarah Florian upon his area . Hatcher had looked at her when she rose and stood , before sinking in her exquisitely supple curtsey ; then he 'd turned his face away . For him she was a worshiped white statue splotched by insulting hands  --  hands that also strove to daub soilingly something fine , pure and , as he 'd vainly thought , untouchable , within himself . Until the resultant turbulence in his breast was quieted he felt that he could not go near her . Among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilpin Murray who , in high spirits , was unusually tactless . " Grand party , I latch , what ? Like old times ! Who 'd think there was any Depression ? Had us a big time at our table . One thing I 've got to hand Pinkie Wilson , he 's there when it conies to wise-cracking ! He can certainly be funny , that bird , when he wants to , and so can Dorcy . " " At whose expense ? " Hatcher , hot in the head , lost all discretion . " Mine ? " " Yours ? " Gilpin Murray was taken aback by his friend 's intensity . " Well , everybody 's , Hatch . Sort of a riot over pretty much the whole field ; ca n't deny you might have been mentioned . " " Mentioned ' ! " Matcher said . " Ah , yes  --  ' mentioned ' ! "  | " Why so jumpy , Boss ? Do n't get sore and fire me . " " I wo n't ! " Hatcher said bitterly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Ada . " Of all the balderdash ! " She projected a rapid fire of under-cover indignation . " I never dreamed Harry Aldrich could make such a goose of himself  --  throwing money around like this ! As if the Tea your mother gave for her was n't enough ! Now , look at that ! " She made a gesture toward the end of the room where musicians had grouped their chairs and begun to tune their instruments . " Lansor 's full orchestra and four or five extra pieces ! I should think Eleanor Aldrich would give Harry fits for slopping over in that toast the way he did . Everybody here knows what piffle it was ; at least all the grown-up people do . Almost shedding tears over what a dear thirdgenerationfamily friend she is , when everybody knows that at heart she 's always been exactly like that old parvenu barbarian of a grandfather of hers ! Did you notice your father during dinner ? " " What ? " Hatcher tried to move away . " No , I  --  " Aunt Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked perfectly ghastly , and even Eleanor saw it and asked me what on earth 's the matter with him . He told me before we came he wanted to get away the first instant he could . Now I 've lost him , and your mother too , in this shuffle . See if you ca n't find them for me and tell them I 'm going home with them . " Hatcher left his Aunt Ada ; but he did n't go to look for his father and mother . He wished to be alone and in the ( lark ; yet , even though he could n't bear to go near her , he had n't the will to leave a house that contained Sarah Florian  --  his feet would n't take him . After a desultory wandering without speaking to anybody , he stood in a corridor and stared through a doorway that gave him a view of her back as she sat at a card-table . Harry Aldrich was her partner and they played against two sleek whitehairedgentlemen known to 1 ! archer as golfing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aldriches have any sense ? Two nineteen-year-old girls , unaware of Hatcher behind them , were also staring through the doorway . " They say she 's a wall at bridge , " one of them said . " Golly , what wicked shoulders ! Look , if a woman keeps her figure at least t ill she 's getting towards forty  --  " " Right u ! " the other murmured covertly , but Hatcher heard her too well . " That 's another disgusting advantage a woman her age has over us . We fledglings never seem to know what to do with our shoulders ; we keep flopping ' cm around . " I ' hey loot : meager and minus self-confidence compared to the chastely voluptuous sculpture she has to offer . " These shapely divorcees ! No wonder poor little Hatchie Ide  --  " ! Lacher heard no more . Quivering , he moved down the hall . Was everybody in the world talking smearingly about him - and about people 's ages ? Hateful voices tormented his mind 's car with phrases  --  " easily be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time she was married " .. . " been away only a dozen years or so . " A dozen years ago I-Iatcher had been ten years old ; and , at twenty-two , not twice twelve , " a dozen years or so " means a vastness in time . To be twelve years older than twenty-two ,  |p145maybe  " even as young as thirty-four " , is imaginable but unthinkable . These echoings upon the problem of age were not the worst . " A rich , rich lady 's gigolo " ! Lennie 'd raked him with that and then her malice had gone to the utmost limit of hideous comedy : " Maybe some day you 'll be calling her Aunt Sarah ' ! " A sudden recollection came smitingly upon him  --  of Uncle Victor 's turning red when asked a simple question about Mrs. Florian  --  and Hatcher remembered how often she had talked to him of his uncle , how many questions about him she asked . He remembered , too , the faint suspicionshe 'd had , sometimes , that maybe she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than  --  than as a man ! Was that what he was to her  --  a nephew ? Had he been too happy in his believing , of late , that he " completelyunderstood " her ? In reality had he come no nearer to that , nor to her , than on his first evening with her when she 'd seemed to him a beautiful mystery  --  unbelievablykind , inexpressibly lovely , but a mystery ? Aunt Ada 'd told him sharply that his Uncle Victor Linley had never been in love with Sarah Lash ; but did Aunt Ada know ? Did even his mother know ? He doubted it . But there were two people here to-night who knew the truth  --  Uncle Victor and Sarah herself ; and Hatcher had to know , could n't sleep until he knew . If Uncle Victor was still in the house he could find him and have the truth from him.  |p146He  had no difficulty in finding his Uncle Victor . Attracted by a sound of ivory clickings as he went down the corridor , Hatcher entered Harry Aldrich'sbilliard room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I le was chalking a cue before resuming a meditative practise with two gleaming white spheres and a red upon a strongly illuminated green cloth , the rest of the room being in shadow . " Good evening , Nephew , " he said . " I believe you do n't play this  --  " " No , I do n't . The fact is I  --  " " Looking for somebody ? " Uncle Victor asked . " If I 'm not too intrusive I think that a few minutes ago I saw her dancing with the scion of the still affluent Wilson dynasty and looking  --  well , almost as pretty as her mother . Eleanor 's the sky for prettiness , is n't she ? Perhaps I shouldp147retract the expression Wilson dynasty ' . Since the Wilsonsderive from the Erdvynns , perhaps dynasty ' is n't just the proper word ; but  --  " " Never mind proper words , please ! " Hatcher said . " I 'm not exactly in a mood to care about proper words . " " No ? It 's just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hough . " Mr. Linley , leaning across the bright table , planned a shot deliberately , made it with precision . That habitual calmness of his fine profile , as he thus occupied himself , had a baffling effect upon his nephew . " I do n't know if you 'll be willing to listen , " Hatcher said . " But I came here to  --  to  --  " " Willing to listen ? " Mr. Linley again chalked his cue . " Indeed yes . Something to tell me ? " " No ; to ask you . " Hatcher felt that the only way to ask was to ask . He tried to blurt it out . " I want to know  --  Well , the fact is , I came here to ask you a question , Uncle Victor . " " Why not ? " The uncle planned another shot , sighting carefully . " By all means ask it . I know really so little about anything that I ca n't guarantee a correct answer . " " You can to this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice 's steadiness . " You  --  you 're one of the only two persons that can answer the question I came here to  --  to ask you . " " Two ? " Mr. Linley changed his plan and aimed his shot from another angle . " There are only two authorities on your subject , then , and I 'm one of them ? Who is my colleague ? " " It 's  --  " Hatcher paused . " That does n't matter . I want to ask you  --  Perhaps you 'll tell me it 's not my affair ; per/haps you 'll tell me to get the hell out of here ; perhaps you 'll  --  " " No , I wo n't , Hatcher ; not at all . What is it ? " The uncle made his shot , again with success ; then stood upright , cue in hand , and looked at the nephew . Hatcher , in shadow himself , saw the quiet blue inquiry of the eyes , likewise in shadow , on the other side of the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a question I 've got to ask . I would n't if I did n't . I would n't be intrusive any more than you would , yourself ; but  --  but some things are important . " " So they are , I Locher . In fact , I think almost everything is . I do n't know of anything at all that would n't be important if we could get at the whole truth of it . If we 'd habitually examine what we pass over as negligible trifles we might improve our conceptions of the universe and consequently our conduct and contentment . " Uncle Victor had begun to speak with a brightened interest , even with eagerness . " Of course the thought is n't new ; but , for instance , by observing the behavior of my friend and dog , the small Locksie , every morning just after he wakes up in his easy chair across the room from my bed , I " Please listen ! " Hatcher said . " I do n't want to talk about that . I simply want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said encouragingly , as his nephew once more paused . " I 've been able to gather that you have on your mind a question . It seems to distress you , rather ; and you 've told me that only one other person knows the answer . The other , presumably , is n't within reach at the moment ; so you intend to put the question top149me but find a difficulty in so doing . Perhaps I can help you . Your mother 's informed me of the pressure you 've kindly been bringing to collect the rents on the old Linley house . Possibly your problem concerns it . Would I be right in guessing that the only other person who could solve it is my self-centered delinquent tenant , Mrs. Schapp ? " " Damn ! " Hatcher said . " No , you would n't ! " " Then I 'm all at sea . " Mr. Linley again applied himself to the billiard table . " If you could somehow bring yourself to put your question into spoken words  --  " " I will , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the serene face once more bent down to the shining levelled cue , knew that he could n't . Uncle Victor 's placidlydetached impersonalness was too much for the nephew , who now helplessly felt that he was appearing to be just a boy . " Damn that noise ! " he said , referring to clamors from the not distant dining-room where the orchestra seemed to be growing " hot " . Hatcher wiped his forehead . " How can anybody think ? The fact is , I came here to ask you  --  to ask you  --  " " Yes , Hatcher ? " Groping for almost any plausible question to substitute for the one he could n't put , Hatcher caught at a straw . " Well , you 're supposed by all the family to do a lot of thinking about everything . I 'd like to hear  --  to hear what you think about the state of business in this country . " " Dear me ! " Mr. Linley was puzzled . " I should n't call that an intrusive question . There must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you sincere in this flattery  --  that I 'm one of the only two persons who can answerp150you . Would the other perhaps be Mr. Morgan , or the President of the United States , or  --  " " All right ! " Hatcher said . " Go ahead ! Rib me all you care to ; I 'm just a young fool you would n't talk seriously to , of course ! " " I would n't ? At the slightest prompting I 'd talk seriouslyto anybody , Hatcher , and by the barrel . You tempt me to answer your question by explaining the idea that man progresses only through adapting himself to nature , learning and obeying natural law . In a Depression produced by the natural law of supply and demand , experimentersdeclared that they would overcome the law by disregarding it . " I hey would do that and they would do this in spite of the law of supply and demand  --  which is now actively avenging the insult , so business does n't recover . It - nay grow worse through two causes , one being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power . Seeking it , they cunningly belittle liberty , knowing that free people , temporarily hungry , will enslave their future for bread in the present . The other cause may be that in countries where the love of liberty has never grown , the politicians , already having complete power over their own people , naturally wish to extend it over all the rest of us and have made this war to which , so far , we seem to be paying too little attention , since presently we , too , may become " " Damn ! " I hatcher cried again . " Ca n't you stop ? Now I will ask you what I came here to ask you ! " To the nephew it seemed unbelievable that any intelligent woman could ever have been in love with so discursive a man as this uncle of his . " I will ! I  --  I  --  "  | " Ah , then after all I 've failed to catch your purport , Hatcher ? " " Somewhat ! " Hatcher said savagely . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on What's-Behind- ' 1'heNews ? I came here to ask you a question , a personal question , I tell you , and I want an answer ! I  --  " " Yes ? " his uncle said . " As personal as you like , Hatcher . What is it ? " " It 's this . It 's simply this . " Once more Hatcher failed ; he could n't do it . Facing the indomitably cool detachmentof his uncle , he could n't  --  and again he caught at any straw . " Well , it 's this . I did n't mean business in general ; I meant  --  Well , you 're one of the family and I meant I 'd like to hear  --  to hear what you know about the state of my father 's business . " " You would ? " Mr. Linley put his cue in the rack and dusted the chalk from his fingers with a fine white handkerchief . " I see . You meant that your father 's the other person who knows the answer but you feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the knowledge you 've imagined that I have . Are n't you in a position to know rather more about the matter than I ? " " No , I 'm not . " At the moment Hatcher 's interest in this subject was indeed slight ; but he felt he 'd have to continue to show some or appear completely ridiculous . " I do n't know any more about the business now than I did the first day . I thought  --  I just thought maybe you  --  " " No . " Mr. Linley had become serious . " Something 's occurred that worries you about it , Hatcher ? " " Well  --  Father 's been looking harried and sick , and one day , you know , he came home and seemed to have had some sort of shock not exactly physical  --  " " Yes ; so your mother told me at the time . Ah  --  I 've noticed that she 's seemed distressed , of late . Of course there 's always the Depression ; however , I understand that business in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growingbetter . Harry Aldrich was elatedly telling everybody so at the table this very evening ; but I happened to glance at your father just then and he looked as though such optimism made hint sick . Of course it 's a strain to be fighting off insolvency year after year and  --  " " Bankruptcy ? " I Iatchcr said . " Oh , well ! Everybody 's in the same boar . I suppose we 'd manage to live somehow ; they all scent to . Fat her 'd mortgage the house or  --  " " No , I believe that was done as long ago as ' Thirtythree , I Iatchcr , when almost all of Butternut Lane fell very much indeed into the same boat . I 'm afraid your father 's house is like most of the others  --  already mortgagedfor more than it 'd sell for , because nobody 'll buy such houses nowadays . About this recent apprehension of his , do n't you think your mother might have more than an inkling of " Yes , I do . " " So do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you asked her what- " " Asked her ? " Hatcher echoed impatiently . " She could n't answer me . Says nothing 's the matter and cries . I 'm to run and play with my toys . Everybody treats me as if I were about four years old ! " He looked angrily at his uncle , turned on his heel and strode to the other end of the room . " Yes , and that 's about how old I feel right now , too , if you care to know ! "  | 3Mr . Linley did n't seem aware of the outburst but stood apparently lost in thought , his preoccupied gaze upon the illumined green cloth of the billiard table . " Your youth may not be the reason why she does n't answer , " he said ; though Hatcher , muttering profanely to himself , did n't hear him . " Some things sometimes dare n't be told to anybody , young or old . " " What ? " " I was just thinking , " his uncle said musingly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your mother ; no man ever had a better brother-in-law . The Aldriches , too . I was Harry 's Best Man , and Eleanor 's lovely as a flower  --  and as fragile . Odd contradiction . How can anything be that wrong with the business when Harry and Eleanorare so exuberant ? And yet  --  there it is ! " He looked up , met his nephew 's staring eyes absently . " It 's significant that you should have noticed it , too . Yes , very significant . I 'm glad you 've spoken of it to me . I  --  " Abruptly these ruminations came to an end ; Mr. Linley took a flat watch from the pocket of his white waistcoat , glanced at it and spoke briskly . " Ha ! I believe I can say goodnight to Eleanor now without being accused of not having enjoyedmyself . Locksie has a clock in his system and knows to the minute what time to expect his final evening stroll on Sheridan Avenue . He 's expecting it now and might disturb the other boarders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the half-hourly trolley . Going my way , Hatcher ? " " No , I 'm not . I 'm going ; but I 'm going my own way , " Hatcher said , and he added , as his uncle left the room ahead of him , " And the hell with it ! "  | ... The moon , high and bright over the frosted earth , made a smooth slim path down Mr. Linley 's silk hat as nephew and uncle said goodnight to each other outside Harry Aldrich 's driveway gates and went their separate ways . Hatcher walked slowly , came to a halt and looked up at the moon . From down the street the light tap of Mr. Linley 's walking-stick upon the pavement was becoming inaudible ; the tons-torn beat of Lansor 's orchestra thumped faint Iv through the cold air , and f-Hatcher 's urge to follow an impulse was strong . I le wanted to go back ; he wanted to stand for just one more long moment looking through an open doorway at the back of a beautiful head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ string v girls whose own shoulders were always on the jerk . After first finding it impossible to leave that house , he had become unable to remain within it . Now it seemed impossible to continue to move away from it . Time and again , since his infancy , he 'd thought he must be really in love ; but he 'd never felt anything comparable to the racking that now possessed him . Never , indeed , for Dorcy ! Maybe at times he 'd been almost in love with her ; maybe some day he might have drifted into being more so , if he 'd never seen Sarah Florian . What he felt for Sarah Florian was measurelessly deeper than the utmostemotion any girl of his own age , or younger , could have caused within hint , he was certain . Only a woman superbly matured could inspire such a passion ; and so he did n't wish Sarah Florian younger  --  he only wished himselfolder . Then neither could be smirched . Where on earth was there a more agonizing position than that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once been on the point , people said , of marrying his uncle ? Of course anybody 'd call such a man an infatuated little damn fool . Hatcher thought of his father and mother and of the worrying he 'd done about the anxiety they could n't conceal . Only a business trouble ! He still pitied them ; but how really petty any mere business trouble was , even a bankruptcy , compared to the tragic condition in which he found himself to-night ! He knew that he 'd have thought his position comedy if another had occupied it ; might even have laughed at the sufferings of a penniless young man horribly talked about for being in love with a beautifulmillionaire woman probably at least twelve years his senior . Yes , of course people were laughing at him  --  giggling , stringing him , trying to make him feel guilty  --  even a grand girl like Mary Gilpin trying to do that and despising him  --  everybody trying to destroy the finest experience he 'd ever known , something that was now the very life of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the oldest thoughts that it inspires ; poets long before the Renaissance worked embroideries all through I latcher 's question : How could that moon look down now , and thousands of years ago and thousands of years hence , and not weep for the anguishes among the childrenof earth it beheld from its icy height ? The moon remained emotionless , as cool as Uncle Victor Linley himself . Hatcher walked on . How long could he bear the state of things  --  and the state of his own feelings  --  without doing something ? Doing what ? He had n't known how to make himself ask his own uncle a simple direct personal question ; what could he say to Sarah Florian ? Well , he could say the truth to her , the crazy truth  --  and he 'd go to her and do it . The words he 'd use began to conic into his mind : " Do you remember that first evening you gave me ? Do you remember our little ceremony of friendship ? Do you remember all the freighted moments we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've done to me ! Everybody in this town 's laughing at me . Old spire-cats are calling me your gigolo . Well , let ' cm ! I do n't care . To me not a damn thing on this earth matters except one  --  and that 's you . Yes ; here I ann . I 've got an education that 's no use to me and thirty-one dollars in them bank . They tell me you were once engaged to nib ' uncle . Well , if that 's true it ca n't be helped now . It makes me just that much more ridiculous ; but you 've utterly fascinated me . I only know that my life 's yours to do what you will with it because , damn it , I love you ! I love you ! I love you ! What are you going to do about it ? " hitcher considered saving this to her to-night ; he thought of going into t he " I , ash place " , sitting on the cold stone steps until Sarah Florian came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern in the moonlight , and begin with , " It 's 1 ! Yes , ( half frozen but --  " Then rose in his mind the picture of her as she sat composedly at the bridge table with her fine motionless back to him ; and , for reasons he did n't try to explore , he postponed his climax to the morrow.  |p157WHEN  the morrow came something appeared to stand in the way , preventing him ; and this was the technique that had been evolved by Mrs. Florian to regulate , so to speak , their meetings . All of these had been upon her initiative . Just before he left her she 'd say , " To-morrow ? " or perhaps , if he 'd been driving with her , " To-night ? " Sometimes she 'd telephone , " Would you care to come to me  --  immediately ? " or " Would you like to spare time for a drive and tea to-morrow ? " Now at their last parting she 'd said nothing , and five whole days passed without word from her . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method upon him had been so effective that in spite of everything he could n't bring himself to go to her door and ask for her . She 'd delicately implanted within him an awareness that he was to come to her when she signalled and not otherwise  --  or something might be spoiled ! Before he knew Mrs. Florian he could n't have imagined himself in such a coil  --  to be in love with somebody next door and incapable of moving an inch toward her unless she happened to send for him ! Love , it appeared , was crazy nowadays , like everything else : business and politicsand the wars in Europe and Asia . Youth was as helplessly baffled by love as by the insanity of the generalworld ; and how had it lucklessly befallen him that he had n't been born at least twelve or fourteen years earlier ? If he 1 ere that old , he thought , he 'd not only be safely beyond t he reach of ridicule , but he 'd surely know how to ring a lady 's door-bell . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even to telephone her ! In other fields than love he did better than he knew , and the days that passed without summons from next door might well have pleased him as portents of a businesscareer . " The house with the freshly painted doorway and window frames and interior refurbishment was leased by a solvent tenant . " Snapped at it ! " Mr. Barley said . Then , on the st rength of this plain testimony to the worth of I ! atelier 's idea , Mr. Barley assumed the responsibility for allowing hire to extend his other renovations and to double the number of his renovators . " I have n't been able to gain your father 's attention , " the old man said , " but on the strength of this rental I think we may dare go that far without undue risk . " One squad , for exteriors , Hatcher put under Mr. Floatus , the one-armed painter , and the other , for interiors , under Gilpin Murray , who was proud of his sub/ordinates , though they consisted of the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-and-downers sober , and the widows , though elderly , were diligent . Hatcher , setting-to with this group , himself , proved that he was a thorough **29;6451;TOOLONG . One of the colored women helped to clean him with turpentine , and gave him kind advice : " Some people got the brains to work with their han 's an ' brains , bofe , " she said , " an ' some only got the brains to work with their brains . You jes ' keep you ' han 's in you ' pockets , honey . " Mr. Barley , visiting the scene of experiment , said the " new generation " was going to take hold the right way , nobody need be uneasy any more about that ; and Hatcher should have been delighted so to stir this dried old man . Perhaps there was a slight elevation of spirits after the tribute , before its recipient remembered that really he was suffering all the time . He worked harder and walked faster on his collecting rounds in order to come home earlier in the afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone him ; but she maintainedher unfathomable silence . As twilight on the fifth lorn day began to dim the living-room where he did most of his waiting and hoping , his manner disturbed his little sister . " I 'd hate to ha f to go to my own room without even Mother making me do my home work there , Hatch , " she said plaintively , from the fireside . " Could n't you sit down ? " " Yes , do , please ! " Aunt Ada , the other occupant of the room , looked up from an embroidery that engaged her.  |p16o  " Young people seem to feel they ca n't live unless they 're restless nowadays . " " No , we do n't , Aunt Ada , " Frances said . " Look at me ; I 'm just sitting here quietly . Why did n't you come home to lunch to-day , I latch ? You ought n't to work so hard , especially not on Saturday . I 've seen Mrs. Florian six times now altogether , I latch ; she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most intimate friend at school said this morning her mother says she bets you want to get married to Mrs. Florian , I latch , and must be a simple idiot ; so I 've stopped speaking to her . " " Frances ! " Aunt Ada 's tone of reproof was mild ; she looked : unused . " Do n't talk so absurdly ! " " I was n't the one , " Frances explained . " It was Polly Wilson 's mother . I would n't like Hatch to get married to Mrs. Florian because then he 'd have to go and live at her house . Aunt Ada , what was it old George wanted Father to do about Mrs. I ' to Arian ? " " Never mind , " the aunt said . " Little pitchers need n't have such big " Mine are n't and he did , Aunt Ada . Poor old George was crying when he came in the kitchen , and I heard him , and lie asked if he could n't see Father , and Father came and talked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of times . I  --  " Hatcher turned sharply from the bay window . " What is all this ? What arc you talking about now ? What do you mean about old George crying and wanting to see Father ? " " Never mind ! " Aunt Ada used one of her formulas . " It 's nothing that concerns you , Hatcher , and it is n't thisp161family 's affair . Young people do n't need to know every  --  " " Damn it ! " Hatcher broke out , and he continued to speak harshly in spite of Aunt Ada 's pointing eloquently at Frances to remind him that there was an innocent child in the room . " I 'm sick and tired of all the hush-hush businessalways going on in this house as if I were still a schoolboy and had no right to know anything about anything or  --  " " It happened at lunch-time , Hatch , " Frances interposedeagerly . " I like it when you swear , Hatch . I 've heard lots and lots all over everywhere , Aunt Ada @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old George came to see him ; and another thing I heard him tell Father was he 'd been to the Aldriches but Mr. Harry Aldrich said he could n't do anything to help him . Old George was in a great deal of trouble , Hatch , and you could see Father felt sorry for him ; and so did I and so did Lora and our old Berry , because Berry came in the kitchen , too  --  he came in with George  --  and Aunt Ada and Mother heard them and came out there , and I thought Mother was almost going to cry on George 's account before they noticed I was there and told me I had to go out . Do you remember those Great Danes Mrs. Florian had when she first came , Hatch ? " " No , I do n't . What have they got to do with old George ? " " Nothing except he said she treated them better than him . She wanted ' em to trail around after her in the garden and everywhere , one on each side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much attention to her , she had 62 ' em sent where they came from and got her money back ; but George said they 'd be happy compared to him . I wish you 'd swear some more , Hatch ; it makes your voice sound so nice . " " I will ! " Hatcher said . " I 'll swear plenty if I do n't find out  --  " " Very well ! " Aunt Ada really wanted to talk about what had happened . " Since you ' must know , then , old George came here because he 'd just been discharged . He came to beg your father to intervene for him with Mrs. Florian . " " What ? " " Yes . It seemed he 'd been discharged just for leaving a door open somewhere last night  --  discharged and told to move his things out of that little cottage he 's lived in on the rear of the ILash place so many years . She ordered him to go immediately and declined to listen to him . He told us he supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it was t rue he did leave the door open ; but it had never happened before and never would again , if your father would only persuade her to take him back . " " Go on ! " I Lacher spoke sharply . " What 'd Father say ? " " He told George he 'd try to help him along till he could find another place  --  but at George 's age who 'd hire him , and for what ? George said he 'd rather die than give up his cottage , he 's so used to it  --  and the little garden he 's made for himself there so many years !  --  but your father told him he did n't feel at liberty to speak to Mrs. Florian about it . Naturally Frederic knew it would n't be the slightest use . "  | " Why not ? " Hatcher 's voice was loud . " Why would n't it be of use ? If she understood  --  " " You think she does n't ? " Aunt Ada laughed . " Certainly she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I suppose because she 's rather taken you up lately  --  an old habit of hers , by the way , so look out !  --  you think you understand her better than we do who knew her from A to Z when she was the worst spoiled brat and afterwards the worst spoiled flapperthat ever  --  " " See here ! " Hatcher said . " See here ! " Aunt Ada laughed again . " Ask anybody that knew her ! She was ingrowing enough on her own account ; but her grandfather spoiled her , just the way he 'd spoiled her father , who all his life thought everybody on earth had to get out of his way and finally thought so once too often ! That was when he and his giddy little wife were driving at eighty miles an hour on Jefferson Boulevard and a milk-wagon did n't get out of the way because it could n't . After that , her grandfather only had Sarah to spoil , and I must say she took to it ! If there ever was a worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care for anything on earth except to be a sensation and make people talk about her , and pose and have her own way willy-nilly over anybody 's dead body , and do any wild thing that came into her head  --  and so no wonder when that Spaniard came along she  --  " " That 's enough ! " Hatcher shouted . " You seem to forgetthat you 're speaking of a lady of whom I have the honor to be a friend ! "   " Is she , Hatcher ? " little Frances asked . " I 'm glad that 's all , because Polly Wilson 's mother told her  --  " " Damn ! " Hatcher said fiercely . " Damn and damn ! " he added , strode from the room and out of the house . He blamed himself as well as Aunt Ada . His intuition had told him from the first not to speak of Sarah Florian to anybody , not to listen to a word spoken of her if he could possibly help it , and now he 'd just let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What had happened , in consequence , were these fresh wounds . Was love , after all , as many poets complained , nothing but torment ? No ; other young men fell in love and everybody was pleasant about it , seemed delighted , said nothing that was n't agreeable . Why was he singled out to be rolled in thorns and showered with darts  --  even in his own home ? There was only one house , it seemed , where slander was n't spoken and indignity could n't reach him . In the darkness that had fallen he pressed through the widely bordering shrubberies and looked at that substantialhouse , intending only to look at it . No stainedglasspattern shone through the night from the nearer wing ; bur there were faintly lighted windows farther on , both upstairs and down . Hatcher went forward , slowly crossing Mrs. Florian 's wide dim lawn ; then he halted , looking up at a figure vaguely seen between the curtains at one of the windows of the second floor . He could n't be sure , but had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the figure as hers and that perhaps she saw him standing out there , a lonely shape in the cold darkness . The curtains closed ; and , at that , he went on ,  |p165ascended  stone steps and dared to push the button beside the door above them . He waited long enough to regret the desperate impulse and to decide upon retreat ; then a Filipino suddenly opened the door , and Hatcher heard her piano . The Filipino said , " Walk inside . I go see . " Hatcher went into the Louis XV room ; the Filipino retired and did n't reappear ; the piano continued to be heard . Its music was disturbingly elegiac . There were passages resemblingthe Death March in the " Eroica " , though Hatcher did n't identify them ; and other mournfulness was heard , sometimes borrowed , sometimes improvised , while the caller waited and waited and waited . At last , at the end of half an hour perhaps , an almost too poignantly familiar melody succeeded the funerary demonstration . The strains of " Liebestraum " caressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ineffable  --  then a third of the keyboard crashed as if struck by a passionate arm . There was a moment 's silence and Sarah Florian swept into the room , sank swiftly into a chair in a beautifulposture of pain , her head thrown back , her eyes closed and her extended arms resting listlessly upon the arms of the chair . " How did you know ? " she asked ; and her richly hushed voice expressed emotional exhaustion . " How did you know that I wanted you to come just now ? I sent a message through the ether ; you must have caught it . The first time I saw you  --  as you stood above the crowd on the stairway there in your house  --  I knew that we could do things like this together . I 'd have telephoned you ; but you felt my call and came . " P166Yes I think so  --  I believe I did . " The lovely exhausted voice convinced Hatcher that maybe he 'd obeyed something like a mystic urge . " Yes , I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt I do n't know just what . It 's mysterious but  --  " " Yet I kept you waiting . " She opened her eyes languidlyand repeated , " I kept you waiting . " " Yes . Five whole days . " " No ; I mean just now . " Mrs. Florian disposed of the five whole days by ignoring them . " I went on playing , trying to get myself out of a desperate mood before I could see even you . " " Desperate ? " The word shocked Hatcher ; it was unthinkable that this proud splendid woman should speak so strickenly . " You say you 've been feeling des-P167desperate ? I do hope you have n't  --  have n't been hearing  --  " " Hearing ? " Mrs. Florian looked at him with quickly widened eyes . " Hearing what ? " " Nothing . I did n't mean  --  " " Oh , yes , you did ! " she said . " You mean there 's talk  --  talk about me . Frogs ' chorusing in this little pond ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I ever cared or could care now for that ! Do you suppose I 'd change any slightest thing in my life because of gabble ? No , 1 do n't yield to froth . What plays dirges upon me is this futility  --  this vacuity  --  in my life ! " " Vacuity ? " Hatcher was n't resentful ; he only felt overlooked . " You mean there is n't much that appeals to you  --  hardly anything at all ? You mean  --  " " No , I do n't . Some things appeal too much entirely . I mean that I 'm getting nowhere , not achieving what I want  --  and is n't that dust and ashes in the mouth ? What a life ; what an emptiness ! What have I ? Nothing ! " " You ? " Hatcher said plaintively . " Nothing ? " It was on the edge of his lips to insist that she had one possession at least . He wanted to say : " You have me , Sarah Florian . I own nothing but my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it 's true that you got tough with old George and once fell for my uncle and then threw him off the boat , I offer my life to you . Take it and do what you will with it . It 's not much ; but could n't it be anyhow something ? " Hatcher was so near saying this that probably the reason he did n't was that he had n't the time . Mrs. Florian 's listlessness was gone ; she sat straight , made a protestive gesture with both hands and uttered an exclamation that sounded like anger.  | " Uhl " she cried . " These damnable days , and this one worst of all ! It began wrong  --  the most sordid episode this morning . I think you once said you knew that pettifoggingold George who 's been living on my place all these years . " " Yes . " Hatcher was greatly troubled . " I  --  I thought I 'd ask you  --  It seems he came over to our house all upset and  --  " " How exactly like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whining all over the neighborhood for sympathy ! I 'm furious with myself for standing the old hypocrite as long as I have . He was n't telling anybodywhat he 'd done , I 'll swear . Why did he say he was discharged ?  --  " I believe there was something about a door and  --  " " Yes , there certainly was ; but I 'll be bound he did n't say which door , or what he murdered ! It was the door to my hothouse . He 'd let my greenhouses all go to rack and ruin ; but I 've been having them restored , and only yesterday I had my florist begin to fill one of them with plants and flowers . George has been pretending to be a night watchman so he could put it over on me he 's doing something useful . He poked around in the hothouse ; then went out and left the door open for pipes to freeze in the bitter cold . This morning there was hardly a plant or flower he had n't killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " " Oh , I did n't know , " Hatcher said feebly . " I did n't  --  " . " That 's murder ! " she interrupted . " It may be worth it to get rid of him . Nobody could know the boredom I 've suffered from him and his airs of being the old familyP169retainer , his never-ending garrulity  --  to show how devotedand useful he is , so that he could go on sponging on me the rest of his life ! All this time he 's had his cottage and the same wages from me that my grandfather was foolish enough to give him , a hundred dollars a month ! I 've paid it year after year because Harry Aldrich wrote me that the place had to be looked after and George was honest . Honest ! Living on me , doing less than nothing , drawing all that money from me , and then finishing by murdering my flowers that had a better right to live than he had ! Do you think I should bear that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still sorry for George ; he could n't help but be so . Yet it seemed to him that in this passion for her flowers she showed a poetic kind of chivalry . " Of course I understand . I know how you feel . You went in there and saw everything all frozen and withered and  --  " " It was criminal ! " she cried . " So was his neglect of my house . Workmen told me the dust and cobwebs in my garrets and cellars were dreadful . What did he care , so he had his wages for nothing ? " Mrs. Florian 's indignation became even sharper ; her voice had lost the rich hushednessshe usually put upon it and was loud and determined ' . " Cheating ! He cheated me for twelve years  --  because I 'm a woman ! Well , so I am ; but that 's one thing I 'll not let anybody on earth do to me and get away with it . I 'll not be cheated ! " Her militancy astonished Hatcher ; for heretofore he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elusively moody sometimes but always sweetly so ; now she was flashingly in arms , a beautiful strong woman who could 0 and would give alms , he thought  --  would give tremendouslyif she chose  --  but knew her rights , would fight for them at the drop of a hat and could n't be beaten down , much less cajoled . She could be as sternly just as she could be divinely tender , and this showed the opulent variety of her nature : What could be more stirringly admirable ? Still there lingered within Hatcher a faintly felt sting of sympathy for old ( korge ;  --  but it certainly had been a pretty bad thing to kill all those flowers , and Sarah Florian was magnificent . I Iatchcr said so , in a voice as hushed as hers usually was . " I think you 're magnificent , " he said . Again she proved how various she could be . She jumped up : Ind in t %1't ) strides reached him where he sat facing her . She sank upon one knee before him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of his hands in hers and looked at hint dizzyingly . " You do n't mean that ! " " Mean it ? " the whirling Hatcher whispered , almost voiceless . " Oh , my dart  --  " Then she was more various than ever . Before he knew it she was on her feet again , had caressed his cheek with a light hand and had turned away . " You 're wrong of course , " she said quickly , and laughed with a little pathos . " Only sometimes I like to hear someone say it ! " " Sarah " 1 hitcher rose and he stood at her shoulder . " Sarah , I " " You 're sweet , 1 hatcher . " She turned to face him , smilingwistfully . " Of course I know that I 'm anything but magnificent . I 'm just a woman who wo n't be battered about . " Then her smile vanished ; she looked at him withp171sharpest inquiry . " Before I told you just now that George had murdered my flowers , were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no . No , I  --  " " I 'm glad you were n't , " she said . " It would have been the end of this friendship . That 's one thing I never could endure , criticism from a friend . The rest can say what they please of me ; but not my friends . My friends must accept me wholly or not at all . " She began to speak with great vigor , frowning , and more as if she declared herself to the world than merely to one rapt caller . " I do n't ask them to understand me ; I do ask them to take me as I am , and I 'll not have them pecking at me . I wo n't endure it ! If whole belief in me 's too much , then they 're not my friends ; they 're my enemies . Understanding 's more than I expect from either friends or enemies ; I 've never had it from a soul upon this earth . " " Are you sure ? " Hatcher said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't , " she interrupted , not abating her intensity . " In my whole life nobody ever did , no matter how I 've tried to reveal myself . Yet how simple I am ! I 'm just a huntress for happiness ; that 's all . How long and how hard I 've sought it  --  and how often I 've thought , for a moment , that I was almost on the verge of finding it ! ' Mien  --  collapses , treacheries I could n't even avenge , peckings , flaws found in me , emptiness where I thought there 'd be perfect beauty . Yet still I 'm a huntress . How bitter ! I was put into this life to find happiness and there is n't any . I hunt for a thing that has no existence any-where . "   " No ; you 're wrong , " Hatcher said , in a voice as faint as his words were brave . " I have it when I  --  when I 'm here with you . " At this , suddenly , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , was all smiles and pleasure . " You dear boy ! " she said . " You really do know how to be my friend . There ! " She took his hand and retainedit . " See what you 've dome : so quickly I 'm all soothed out ! I trust n't keep you any longer because I 've got to fly to dress and dine with those Wilsons and go to a concert with them . It 's the symphony orchestra . You 're going , perhaps ? " No , I believe we do n't subscribe any more . I  --  " " Nor any of your family ? " she asked , still keeping his hand . " Your Aunt Ada - or any of them ? " ' ' No , l do n't think so . She looked disappointed . " I only thought if I happened to see one of than it 'd be a little  --  well , almost like seeing you . A rather far-fetched pleasure , perhaps ! " Her fingers increased their pressure upon his own strongly ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She set her hand upon his breast , gave him a light push toward the door . " Run ! " Hatcher , as lightfooted now as lightheaded , was out of the house and across the great space of starlit lawn almost as swiftly as if he did actually run . An unbelievabletriumph was in his heart , and his physical eyes saw little of what they looked upon . At home , he thought of going to the concert where from the gallery he could perhapslook down upon a lovely head of symphonically arranged black hair ; but he could n't afford a ticket andP173really did n't need to do anything like that . His exhilarationrequired no such feeding . He was in great spirits , teased his little sister gayly , scarce knowing what he said ; and so , until more than an hour after dinner , was n't aware of what an extremity of gloom his parents had reached . He 'd consented to backgammonwith Frances before she went to bed and was playing the game hilariously with her in the living-room when they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall ; Frances jumped up , dropping her dice-box upon the table . Hatcher caught her by the arm . " Sit down , you squirrel . What 's the matter ? It 's your move . " " Let me go , Hatch . Did n't you hear the bell ? Father and Mother both promised I could be the telephoneanswererfor this house . " She called to her parents for corroboration . They sat together at the other end of the long room , Frederic Ide with a magazine and his wife with a book , though they were not reading but talking in lowered voices . " Did n't you promise I could be telephone-answerer , both of you ? " Preoccupied , they paid no heed , and Hatcher still detainedthe little girl . " What on earth do you want to be telephone-answerer for ? " " Please let go , Hatch ! It 's because that way a person gets to know a good deal of what 's going on and I like to . " " Just a natural-born gossip ! " Hatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier on anybody . You ought to be ashamed of what you 're going to grow up to be , Francine ! "  | " Stop calling me Francine ' and let me go ! It 's ringing again and if I do n't get there Aunt Ada 'll hear it in her room upstairs and beat me to it the way she did that last time Mrs. Florian called you , because Aunt Ada loves to just as much as I do  --  so please , Hatch ! " He released her . " Scram ! " She ran out lightly ; and then , as the room became quieter after the noise she and 1 latcher had been making , the voices of his father and norther unfortunately became audible to him . " It was grasping at a straw , " he heard his father saving . " The crazy hope that these years might have made a change in " " Yes , all thrown away ! " Mrs. Ide said , lamentant . " I might have known nothing could change such a woman . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hatcher jumped up and strode the length of the room . " What 's this ? " he said . " I 'm getting pretty tired of hearingsuch things ! Mother , if you do n't like Mrs. Florian what 'd you break your neck to give her that Tea for ? " His mother looked up at him . " I did n't know you could hear . You were n't supposed to  --  " " Yes , I know ! " he said bitterly . " I 'm never supposed to hear anything or be told anything . I 'm too young , of course . I 'll repeat my question : Mother , if you do n't like Mrs. Florian what ' d you spend all that money and energy giving that ' lea for her for ? " Mrs. Ide put her hand in her husband 's and hung her head . " We hoped it would please her . " Hatcher remained stern . " If you do n't like her , why did you want to please her ? " " That 'll do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dulled to be commanding . " Your mother and I are having a private talk . " " It 's too late for that , " Hatcher said . " You 've both got to be made to understand I 'm no longer a minor , and if your private talks include the-name of Sarah Florian I demand  --  " He was interrupted . Little Frances appeared in the doorway . " Hatcher , it 's for you ; but do n't let her keep you long or we wo n't get to finish our game unless Mother 'll let me stay up . It 's still my move . " " Who wants to speak to me ? " " Dorcy . " " Oh , all right ! " Hatcher said roughly , and went to the telephone . Dorcy 's voice sounded tense and queer ; there were quavers in it . " Hatch , can you come here  --  I mean to our house ? Would you come right away ? Will you , please ? Will you ? " " Well , I  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sickeningly afraid that he was going to have to tell her as gently as he could that he 'd never really cared for her in that way , said , " Yes , certainly , " and went forth.  |p176He  NEED N'T have feared that he 'd have totell Dorcy how sure she could always be of his true friendship for her , though unhappily not of more ; she was already counting upon the friendship . She was waitingat the door for him , opened it before he rang , and he saw that under a white fur wrap she wore a pretty pink evening dress familiar to him , but that her eyes were frightened and her lips twitchy . " Conk in just for a minute , " she said . " I want you to go somewhere with mc , if you can . " " I can . I will . " I latcher spoke promptly . " What 's the matter ? " " It 's about Father . I want you to go with me to bring him home , if we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who 'd stepped in and closedp177the door , could n't imagine what she meant . " Find your father ? " " Oh , Hatch ! " Dorcy was shaking ; she leaned against him , her cheek upon his shoulder , and he put an arm about her . " Hatch , it 's awful ! Mother and I did n't know what to do or who to send for to help us . Your father 's looked so ill lately Mother thought  --  And besides we 'd rather he did n't know . You wo n't tell him . Your Uncle Victor was out , the telephone at his boarding-house told us . We have n't any right to call on you , of course ; but  --  but you 've always been so good and kind and such a  --  a dependable neighbor and friend that I  --  " She looked up at him then , as he held her , and for a moment it seemed to him that his apprehension was realized ; that her wet eyes were really asking him if he was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighbor and friend  --  or if he would n't some time care to be  --  but , if such a question was indeed in that instant asked of him , Dorcy must have seen the answer quickly . She stepped away from him . " We do n't know where Father is , Hatch . He 's  --  he 's  --  " " He 's what ? " Hatcher was incredulous . Big , hearty , jolly Harry Aldrich was the last man in the world anybody'dever be worried or distressed about , he thought . " What 's the matter with your father ? " " He 's drunk , " Dorcy whispered . " What ! Why , I never heard of  --  " " No , nor did we , Hatch  --  Mother and I. He never in the world before to-night  --  " " Oh , see here ! " Hatcher , relieved , patted her shoulder . " Why , Dorcy , that can happen to anybody . With a man like your father it 'd be just an accident  --  a little more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good heavens , old girl , do n't take such a thing seriously ! What 's got into you ? Your mother certainly knows better than to worry about it , does n't she ? " " She 's sunk , Hatch ; completely . We 're both scared . " " But why ? Almost every man  --  at least once or twice in a lifetime  --  " " No , no ! " Dorcy said . " It was n't like that . Mother and he were going to the Symphony and so was I. It was seven o'clock and I was just starting for the Wilsons ' to dine there and go with their party  --  when Father came in . I never saw anything like the way he looked  --  it just was n't the same man . I le frightened us both . " " What ? But that 's nonsense , Dorcy . Anybody when he 's oiled up a bit does n't look  --  " " No , no ! " Dorn. put both her hands over her heart . " You just could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've seen plenty of people badly off , but not like that . Ile had n't been here a minute before Mother got just weak and I ran to telephone the Wilsons I had a sick headache . I Ic was tragic , I latch . He said the most terriblethings . " " What sort of things ? " " He kept saving there was going to be nothing but war in the , world and God was going to strike it down . It was more as if he 'd lost his mind than as if he 'd been drinking ; but of course he had  --  and he said he was going to stay drunk forever . Then he got to sobbing and laughingtogether and telling Mother over and over she must n't mind anything he said because everything would be all right to-morrow . Of course we did n't want thep179servants to hear him , and I ran to close the doors to that part of the house ; but I heard Mother call me and ran back . They were at the front door here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself loose from her and shouted he was never coming home again and ran out . l le had a taxi outside and was gone before I could get to it . " " I see , " Hatcher said thoughtfully . " Maybe you 're right ; maybe we 'd better go look for him . Where  --  " " We do n't know . We telephoned and telephoned even to all the hotels , getting him paged , and waiting and waitingand waiting . Then , when it was all of no use , I thought of you , and Mother said yes , you 'd be the one . I 've got her lying down in yonder , and I thought if you 'd come , you and I could take her big car and we 'd go the round of the bars and I 'd sit outside and wait while you went into the different places alone , because if I went in with you I think the mood he 's in would make him break away again or start up another scene like the one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we find him and you could persuade him to come out to the car and get in , why , then I 'm pretty sure I could handle him while you 'd drive us home . It 's all I can think of . I do n't know what else to try . " " I do , " Hatcher said . " There 's not the slightest use of your going , Dorcy . All I need 's the car . I 'll go through every rum hole in the town till I find him and I 'll bring him home and put him to bed , myself . Just you and your mother keep out of the way when I get him here and I ' 11  --  " Dorcy shook her head determinedly . " No ; you do n't know the state he 's in . It 'll need both of us. " 18o The Heritage of Hatcher Ide The Heritage of Hatcher Ide 181 " No , it wo n't . " Hatcher held up a hand , and laughed . He 'd just heard wheels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's a car right now and I 'll bet anything you like it 's your father . 1 He 's come home himself , probably a good deal sobered up . You 'll see . " Dorcy uttered a great sigh . " Oh , if it only is ! " They listened and heard laughter outside , Harry Aldrich'slaughter , and his voice calling something indistinguishablebut cheerful t the departing driver . Dorcy threw open the door , and I larry walked in , still laughing but nor steady upon his feet . He took Dorcv in his arms effusively . " Only child I ever had , " he said . " Best one , too ! Hello , Hatcher- young-fellow-me-lad ! Where 's your mother , Dorcy ? Got to swear myself I mean square myself  --  for being downtown so late , keeping dinner waiting and everythingall this time . Must be after seven o'clock and she 'll give me fits because we 're going to the Sylph  --  Symphony and she loves to be on time to music and I 've still got to dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the office ; simply had to be ' tended to . Been at my desk every minute since lunch , hours and hours and hours ! " He releasedDorcy and leaned against the wall . " Was n't I askingyou where 's your mother , or not ? " Mrs. Aldrich , with tears just swept from her pretty face , appeared from the living-room , stared unbelievingly and then , with a sharp cry of relief , rushed to her husband and flung her arms about him . " Oh , Harry ! " she cried . " Thank heaven ! Thank heaven ! Dear heart , you frightened me so ! " " Me ! " He was deeply puzzled . " Would n't frighten aP181pigeon ! When 'd I ever frighten my own baby , my own sweet love Eleanor ? What makes you tell such stories , honey ? " She clung to him ; then took a step backward and tried to be severe with him . " Harry Aldrich , where on earth did you get such a binge ? " " That 's incorrect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest , evidently hoping to look more dignified . " One does n't get a binge ; one gets on one . " His eyes , not focusingeasily , again became aware of Hatcher . " Well , well ; is n't this Fred Ide 's boy , young Hatcher ? Hatch , you 're too young . That 's the only trouble ; you 're too young . " Hatcher laughed . " No , I 'm not , sir  --  not too young to help you up to bed . " Mrs. Aldrich laughed too , and thanked him . " No , dear boy , " she added . " I 'll do that easily . " " You will not ! Never ! " her husband said ; but his gaze remained waveringly upon Hatcher . " Nobody will . Hatch boy , I 've always loved your father . It was your grandfather took me into the firm ; but Fred got him to . I love Fred Ide dearly and I always will , no matter what he does . We all of us make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your poor father  --  " Harry paused ; his arms slipped , spoiling the dignified posture , and he tried fumblingly to put his hands in his trousers pockets . " Well , anyway , I love Fred Ide . Whatever he does , or 's done , or 's going to do , I 'm still for him ; remember that ! Stay to dinner with us , Hatch . Eleanor Aldrich , you little skeezix , what you laughing at ? " " At you , because you 're just babbling  --  and because I 'm so glad you 're home , " she explained , as she putp182an arm about him . " Come on ; you 're going to bed . " " I 'm going to play the piano . Bed , no ! I would n't for  --  I would n't for the last twenty-two thousand dollars in the world . I wo n't ! " He continued to protest , seemingly unaware that all the time he was yielding to his wife 's pressure and moving with her down the hall toward the stairway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't they ? That 's exactly a quartet ; so we 're all going to sing . Sing as long as we live ! Sing anyhow that long . I wo n't go to bed ! Hate bed . " " Lift your foot and step up , " his wife instructed him , as they reached the stairway ; and they began to ascend , with I tarry insisting at every step that he would n't take the next one . In her great relief Eleanor Aldrich continued to laugh fondly , radiant because he had conk safely home to her . Nothing was more evident than that she loved him as much when he was drunk as when he was sober , and that Harry , drunk or sober , adored her . So , with a pang of envy in his heart , the young man gazing up at them thought that here was a picture of triumphant love , anotherexample of love that was n't baffling and painful . From the landing Eleanor looked back over her shoulder . " Do n't conic , Dorcy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I latch you were so kind . But everything 's all right , bless heaven ! " " Yes , of course it is , " I hitcher said , and turned to Dorcy . " I 'll be trotting along . " She was staring toward the upper flight of the stairway . " It 's so strange  --  his forgetting he 'd been here beforeand all that terrible  --  "   " Nonsense ! Did n't you ever hear of anybody 's drawinga blank before ? " " Yes , of course ; but not like  --  Oh , well ! " She extended her hand , withdrew it as soon as he 'd clasped it . " Thank you . You 've been kind . Goodnight . " " Goodnight , Dorcy . You 'd be foolish to worry any more about nothing . You and your mother are all right now . " " Are  --  we ? " she said , as he stepped out into the darkness ; and the slight hesitation before she added the second of the two words held the disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother it might n't be quite so all right for herself . The involuntarily conveyed slight hint of pathos remained with I hatcher botheringly , bringing upon him the same unwarranted sense of guiltiness that cool Mary Gilpin and spiteful Lennie Aldrich had incited , on the night of the Aldriches ' great dinner for Sarah Florian . Why should he feel guiltiness when he was guilty of nothing ? Dorcy , in trouble , had sent for him and he 'd been glad to come  --  he 'd always do anything on earth for her  --  but why had n't she and her mother sent for Pinkie Wilson , instead ? Because Pinkie 's parents were giving a party and might have objected to his leaving it ? No , that did n't seem to be the answer . Hatcher knew that in her moment of need Dorcy 's heart had still turned to him and not to Erdvynn Wilson ; this was what caused the sense of guilt . Once , he and Dorcy had both rather expected to be engagedsome day , he supposed ; but it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't was n't his fault ; yet here he was bedevilled for it ! What were people made of ? What was he himself made of , that he had to suffer for what he could n't help ? Not rid of baffements brought upon him by Dorcy 's pathetic " Are  --  we ? " he found others to oppress him . Castaway imaginings again began to land upon the shores of his mind , though no longer was any absurd old scandal concerning Mrs. Florian brought with them . Before his first sight of her , I hatcher had been able to imagine that even his good father might be penalized for an ancient amorous dalliance ; but the very air the son breathed throughout his whole boyhood at home had precluded any thought that financial dishonor could ever by any possibility taint the name of Frederic Ide or that of the first of Ide and Aldrich . " 1'o-night he had n't paid serious attention to I tarry Aldrich 's liquored maunderings in the moments of their utterance ; but afterward some of them seemed to repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no matter what his partner had done , Harry 'd loyally stand by him ? In wine there is sometimes too much truth : Did Harry mean that worse than insolvency was hovering , that there might be  --  some sort of scrape ? Once more , Hatcher began to be frightenedabout his father ; but the amorphous fear was only a malicious squeal : from one of the harpies that again flew to harry him . The exultant mood of a few hours ago was gone . A statistician 's chart of Hatcher 's feelings during this one evening would have carried a line from a point far down on the page to the upper margin , then dropped it all the way to the lower , not omitting some wobbles on both the upward and downward side of the acute angle . Thesep185deflections would mark the jolts in the young man 's emotions , in particular an almost submerged yet hurting doubt concerned with Sarah Florian . People did n't like her because of course they did n't understand her , and she was all the more perfect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . She 'd been absolutely right about poor old George , certainly ; but  --  but , after all , Hatcher found that he could n't think of the old luau without adding the compassionate adjective . " Poor " old George ! What had happened to him was just , of course , but maybe a bit tough if you thought of poor old George 's way of looking at it . In childhood and first youth , troubles usually seem to come one at a time because one is enough to fill the young heart . To be able to suffer from several simultaneously is sometimes a sign that the youth has begun his advance toward maturity . Not six months ago young Hatcher Ide , a grave old Senior , had stood with his Class for the eveningmusic on the campus , and had loudly sung , with but the airiest sense of the words : " When the cares of life o'er-take us , Mingling fast our locks with gray , Should our dearest hopes betray us , False Fortune fall away  --  " To-night Hatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , in fact , to be his age.  |p186Poor  old George , who 'd been more or lessin the compassionate thoughts of several of Hatcher'srelatives most of that clay , put himself bodily into thesight of one of them the next morning . Mr. Victor Linley , in this commercially idle and less fortunate period ofhis life , had developed a routine ; and a feature of it wasthat on one of his daily walks with his golden spaniel hepassed his sole possession in the way of real estate andgave it first a shiver and then a meditative glance . Hekept always to the opposite side of the street . Thatabominable-looking big relic , the old Linley house , wasa little the more bearable for the distance and the additionalintervention of smoke-thickened air . Mr. Linley'shabit was to give the house only the one brief melancholylook as he passed ; but , on this cold and therefore moreP187than usually smoky Sunday morning , that look was lengthened , as it had been upon the afternoon early in the autumn when he 'd seen his nephew trying to collect rent from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that afternoon , he paused across the street , and Locksic sat down . Old George came out from the marble vestibule ; and soot-streaked Mrs. Schapp , a half-eaten link of sausage in her hand , called cacklingly after him before she closed the door . Old George , stooping and slow , descended the steps and crossed the street to the waiting gentleman . " I was setting at the window looking for you , " George said . " She told me you ' most always come by , Sunday mornings , about this time . Hollering after me just now I got to pay my room rent in advance next Saturday same as yesterday . She need n't worry . " " No , George , " Linley assented . " Neither need you . The fact is , I suggested your taking a room there because I thought you could chalk up anything you might come to owe Mrs. Schapp against what she owes me . It was n't my idea that you 'd pay anything at all . " " Yes , sir , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can handle the three dollars and a half a week for the room all right . That leaves me about four to eat and dress on , and , as I 've got a little kerosene sort of stove , I can do it . My stomach do n't relish much but coffee anyhow , and my great-nephew 's invited me to have supper with him and his family whenever I get a mind to . Oh , I 'll do , sir ; I 'll do well enough except for missing what I been used to . That hits me kind of hard . " " Yes . Too bad ! " Linley said . " Do n't forget , though ,  | that when you want to spend that three dollars and a half a week on yourself instead of paying Mrs. Schapp , you have a right to do it . If she makes a fuss , just refer her to me . " " Thank you , sir ; but the financial part of my trouble is n't worrying me touch . You see , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and last year Mr. Aldrich told me to put it into the I feat and bight Company and I did , and it 's been picking up ; so I figure it 'll bring me in as much as four hundred dollars a year . You see , a man like me can figure out to live on that , sir . " George glanced over his shoulder and shook his head . " My , my ! It seems pretty strange to Inc , and must seem more so to you , to think I 'm living in the grand old Linley house . Why , my heavens , I remember when  --  " " Yes , George ; so do I. " " I bet you do , sir , " George said . " I guess I 'll get used to always hearing that squalling voice of hers whatever part of the house she 's in . It seems wrong to hear such sounds and think of what goes on in all the fine big rooms with the beautiful walnut wood-trim and parquetry floors -- and everything all so dirty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mansard roof where she 's got it all subdivided with wallboard partitions to make the rooms smaller and get more lodgers in . I guess , though , you know better about how she 's got the place fixed than I do and  --  " " No . " Mr. Linley 's smooth brow was shadowed for a moment ; his imperturbability flickered . " No , I  --  I have n't been in the house for some years . I do n't  --  "  | " No , sir . " The sympathetic George spoke quickly . " You would n't like it , and I guess the more you do n't see what 's inside there the better you 'll feel . On the other hand , sir , I just wanted to tell you I 'm all right . She keeps the house pretty cold ; but I own a couple of quilts and I can get nice and warm cheap whenever I choose to go to bed . Well , sir , I just wanted to thank you and apologize for having bothered you with my troubles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Every man must go to his friends sometimes , and , since you insist on paying Mrs. Schapp for your room , I 'm afraid you 're thanking me for nothing . " " No , I 'm not , sir . You see , I 've got your idea about not paying to fall back on , if ever I get pinched or sick or anything , and that 's a big comfort . Besides , I been thinking over one or two things you says to me yesterdayand it give me quite a brace . " George laughed a little ruefully . " In particular , there 's what you says about when a man 's in hard luck , what a comfort he can get out of his vanity if he learns he 's got the backbone to stand up and say , Go ahead , Trouble , get worse . You ca n't squeeze a yip out o ' me ! ' Guess that might be the last and only satisfaction some of us 'll get out of our life , speaking of myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it . Leaving that door open did n't do all she claims it done ; not by no means ! " " No , " Victor Linley said slowly . " No , I was sure of that , George . " " No , sir . Guess you know her all right ! Them pipes did n't freeze and it only damaged one or two plants near the door . Of course I ought to 've shut it tighter so the 90 wind could n't blowed it open ; but it looks to me like just an excuse . Yes , she 's been wanting to get rid of me all along . Everybody but her 's been mighty kind . What a woman ! Well , sir , good-bye for the time being . I did n't mean to intafere with your walk this long . " The interference had been a pleasure , Victor said ; and , to the spaniel 's delight , resumed the walk northward . A few minutes later master and dog were in their quarters in the brick hoarding-house and both began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire in the grate under the " fumed oak " mantelpiece in his sittingroom ; the kindling crackled encouragingly , and a drift of early snowflakes outside the grimed windows completeda picture of philosophic coziness . " There , Locksie , " Linley said , placing a cushion near the hearth for hint . " Excuse my dissipation . " He took the dissipation from an upper waistcoat pocket , a cigar of the one type he enjoved . For economic reasons he smoked on Sundays only ; then he allowed himself two of these rewarding cigars , and presented the first to himself as a complement to the morning walk . " Snug enough , Locksie , what ? " lie said . I le was , in fact , as his nephew had discontentedly observed , by no means a discontented man ; and he 'd made his lodgings pleasanter than the exterior of the house suggestedas possible . The bedroom was not uncomfortable , and in the sitting-room he 'd himself neatly built the book shelves that supported the well-bound remaining items of his once elaborate library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows that looked down upon the street , a long table extended , displaying unfinished archi/tectural designs , drawings in experimental stages and light sketches of details . True , everything in the place was slightly grimy to both touch and sight despite Mr. Linlcy 's own incessant tidiness and the struggles of a stout housemaid who 'd become romantically devoted to this boarder ; the air was tinged with a repulsive blue-gray , for the city smoke crept everywhere and could not be excluded . The fine cigar had lost no more than a third of its length when the fastidious bachelor , sighing , rose from his chair beside the fire to resume his war upon the creeping smudge . He brought a clean bit of soft cloth from a drawer of the long table and began to wipe carefully the framed photographshe kept upon the mantelpiece . These , five in number , were " amateur shots " ; but his expression as he cleaned them was token that he treasured them . All but one were of " family groups " . The first that he cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Upham , her handsome husband and their two homely little boys who 'd arrived late to the Uphams and were approximately contemporaneous with their small cousin , Frances Ide . The second photograph was of Victor'ssister Harriet , Mrs. Ide , her stalwart husband , Frederic , and their three good-looking children , Hatcher , Janey and little Frances . The third was of his friend Harry Aldrich and Harry 's pretty wife , Eleanor , and their pretty daughter , Dorcy , taken when Dorcy was a child . Victor Linley looked fondly at one after another of these little pictures , though his gaze dwelt longest on the third  --  that of the young Aldrich family ; it seemed to bring upon him a solicitous perplexity . The fourth of the photographs he touched lightly indeed , for it showed three people laughing together on the front steps of the old Linley house  --  his father and his mother and a young girl , delicate and fair , his sister Nancy . His moment of communion with the three figures was brief , as if a longer one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , when he set the picture back upon the mantelpiece , was as gently careful as if he feared its slightest fluctuationmight jar the dead themselves . The last of the framed " shots " was of half a dozen youthful officers in khaki scared about a sidewalk table before a French cafe ; and the soft cloth had but touched it when there was a knock upon the door and one of Mr. Linlev 's fellow-hoarders walked in  --  a thick-haired , hollow-eyed voting man whose scarlet tie was the more noticeable for its background of dark blue shirt . His facial contours expressed amused superiority , projecting upon the world the continuous self-congratulation of an intellect convinced that its capacity for deep thinking is n't likely to be matched anywhere . " Hi ! " he said amiably . " I was walkin ' up the Avenue a ways behind you , and I got onto something about you that handed me a laugh , Linley : you limp worse when you do n't think anybody 's lookin ' at you . " " Do 1 , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Nopec ; I just come in to see if you do n't agree we boarders better fix up a Round Robin against all this mashed turnip at table . If she wo n't listen , might picket her  --  ' Unfair to boarders ' stomachs ' , what ? " He looked over Linley 's shoulder at the photographed group ofP193officers . " Guess that 's when you got your limp , huh ? Guess you feel like a sucker when you remember you fought in that war , huh ? Make the world safe for democracy ' . That 's a hot one ! Gives you a laugh now to think you thought you were makin ' the world safe for democracy when you went over the top , do n't it ? " " No , " Victor Linley said reflectively . " That was just a civilian 's oratorical slogan , a mistaken afterthought . The army did n't go for that reason , you see . I do n't recall ever hearing it mentioned among us then . " " You do n't ? " Boerl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Then you must been like a lot the others  --  just let drums and bands and the old star-spangled banner shot-in-the-arm drag you into an imper'alist war without the slightest real idea what you were fightin ' for . Just sucked in to be cannonfodder , the same as these boobs right now in the phony war that 's on , over in Europe . Maginot line , Siegfried line , phooey !  --  British Tories and American airplane and steel plutocrats gettin ' rich , and all it amounts to is a sitdownstrike . But you wait till the cap't'list foreign gover'mentstry to demobilize ! I 'll give you a tip : when they try to demobilize , look out !  --  because right then the phony angle might be over . Certain parties on the inside track might decide it 's the psychological moment for sort of a class war  --  and , boy ! will that be a real one ! " " I 'm afraid this one is , " Mr. Linley said . " I 'm afraid this period you call phony ' ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Listen , Linley . Do n't kid yourself . Both sides , it 's only a couple gangsters walkin ' around each other and 94 both afraid to use their guns , while good old Soviet Russia'sjust lookin ' on laughin ' because Uncle Joe Stalin knows if them two ever did begin shootin ' each other up , why , his Big Day 's come ! Do n't trouble your head , Linley , because them two gangsters know it , too ; they wo n't fight . " Boerl glanced at the drawings on the long table and became approving . " Pretty good . First rate . Somebodyhand you a building job at last ? " " No . Just keeping my hand in . " " I sec , " Boerl said . " l rouble with you , Linley , the way I size you up , it 's you do n't know how to push yourself . As long as we keep this crackpot cap't'list system a man 's got to plug fur himself or he ca n't succeed , and you do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life again , some , and there 's several firms of architectsin this city already up to real business right now . Well , you 're as good as any of ' cum ; so why are n't you  --  " " No , I 'm not . " Mr. Linley looked ruefully amused . " It 's friendly of you to think so ; but I never was a really important architect , I 'm afraid , and now I doubt if my ideas would do at all . I 'm too crotchety and traditional , you sec , Mr. Boerl . I 'm not up with these times ; I never could bear to design flimsy houses and I do n't like purely functional buildings , either . No . " I lc shook his head . " I 'm afraid there 's no hope for me at all . " " None at all ? " Boerl asked , and laughed . " Well , you used to make a pretty good income out of architecture , did n't you ? " " No ; not very . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boerl said . " But they say you used to live pretty high , even sweller than this . If it was n't out ofP195your profession , you must have had big outside resources . Depression hit your dividends , did it ? " " Yes ; it seems so . " " Seems so ? That 's cool ! " Mr. Linley 's fellow-boarder looked at him with a condescending indulgence . " You 're a queer bird , Linley . Fact is , I think you 're one of the oddest guys I ever met . Everybody in the house likes you , and I guess they all of ' em think they know you ; but I happen to have just a few more brains than the rest of ' em , so I see that we none of us do . I do n't really get you at all . For instance , you 're the star boarder and you got a swell place here , perfectly elegant  --  but not a radio nor current literature , and you do n't go to movies ; yet you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're sort of haywire , kind of an innocentfoolish guy . " Boerl laughed . " Not me . I think you 're deeper than that . I expect maybe the truth is you 're what might be called a good deal of a philosopher . " " I ? " Linley looked surprised . " No . I believe philosophersare usually supposed to take a much less personal interest in things than I do . " " That so , Linley ? Well , then , maybe we 'll just have to classify you as sort of general good fella . That teacher across the table from me , though , claims you 're what they call a socialite . Guess she 's right . Take these swell dames , now , that drive up and send their chauffeurs in to get you to come down and  --  " " I 'm watched , then ? " Linley laughed . " The few times that 's happened , Mr. Boerl , I think the ladies were probablyrelatives of mine or  --  " " Oh , of course ! All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunts . Foxy guy ! " Boerl became humorouslyinsinuating . " How about the dark brunette in the platinum-plated town-car ? Saw you out in front on the curbstone talkin ' through the window to her , myself , day before yesterday  --  you bare-headed and serious as hell , and the slick mulatto chauffeur wise enough to act like he was interested in his radiator . Some baby , pal ! I took a good gander at her and she 's some baby , believe you me . Boy ! I sure yearned . You bet you 're watched , Linley , when you 're tall:in ' to tricks like that . Do n't try to tell me that black haired , black-eyed babe was just one of your relations ! For that matter , I guess some of them are pretty high flyers , too . " " I 'm afraid not , " Linley said . " I 'm afraid they fly rather low nowadays , Mr. Boerl . " " ' Thar so ? Well , anyhow , that teacher says they always been big bugs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old original capitalist families that used to run this part the country . " I le laughed genially . " Well , since Hitler and Uncle Joe Stalin jolted us with their pact , some of us are n't talkin ' so loud ; but our crowd still kind of expectsto take over this old t ' . ! . A. some day not so far off maybe , and run it scientifically on our own lines . I guess , though , you 're one of the few of the old oppressors we wo n't send to the guillotine . No , sir , you live in a good deal of style here ; but anybody can tell by lookin ' at you that you would n't harm a Ilea , and so we 'll go easier on you than on --  " He was interrupted by a tapping upon the hall door . Victor Linley said , " Excuse me , Mr. Boerl . This is very interesting and I hope to hear more of it ; but I  --  " Then ,  |p197as  explanation of the unfinished sentence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried her best to keep his rooms clean . " It 's a lady caller , Mr. Linley , " she announced deferentially . " It 's Mrs. Frederic Ide , sir . " " I 'll get out , " Boerl said , stepping toward the door . " No high society for me , thanks ! I 'll  --  " " Not at all , " Victor interrupted , as Mrs. Ide came in . " Wo n't you stay ? I 'd like you to meet my sister . Harriet , this is Mr. Boerl , one of my friends here and  --  " " Glad to made your ' quaintance , " Boerl said to her , obviously intimidated and in hasty departure , though her nod and glance were not discourteous . " Be seein ' you , Linley . " P198WHAT an unpleasant type ! " Harriet Ide sat down sadly . " I ca n't tell you , Victor , how it makes me feel to see you living in such a place and with such people about you ! " " Dear girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc . " I lc took a chair opposite her , beside the fireplace ; the golden spaniel jumped upon his lap and disposed himselfthere for renewed slumbers . " These rooms are comfortableand the people are interesting . " " Oh , Victor !  --  " They arc , " he insisted . " They lead as interesting lives as anybody does and have as interesting thoughts . My fellow-boarders are anything but commonplace , though I admit nothing 's commonplace if you really take time to look at it . It 's absorbing to see how perfectly myP199friends here fit into the pattern of all human life  --  just as the rest of us compulsorily do , of course , every man in his own way . I do n't know anything more dramatically a cross-section of the world than what 's narrow-mindedly called a second-rate boarding-house ' . It 's always fasci-nating . " " Fascinating ? Oh , Victor , what a word for this dingy- " " It 's a beautiful example of a microcosm ! " he protested , with unusual animation . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shapes produced by the single force that moves us  --  the force that 's sometimes called good and 's sometimes called evil but is always the same thing , the root of all human action , the thing that makes progress and decadence , and war and peace , and generosity and greed  --  and booms and depressions  --  and capitalism and communism and  --  " " Victor ! " His sister 's sad voice was a little impatient . " I really do n't know what you 're talking about . " " Why , about human egoism of course , Harriet . " His eagerness increased . " Every meal here is a treat , and I like my associates at table all the better for the openness with which they show how natural-born universal egoism controls the stuff they 're made of  --  a substance about as good as you 'll find at most tables . I ca n't tell you how much I enjoy  --  " " Oh , Victor ! " Mrs. Ide softly cried again . " You think I do n't know what this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Impoverishment , no ! " he exclaimed . " I used to live in buzz and bustle  --  a dozen different kinds of activity.  | What you call impoverishment gives me time for meditation ; and how does anybody get at realities without it ? We do n't know at all what we 're doing so long as we live busily in action , or in emotion , or by stimulants from our five senses . A man can live , instead , in his mind ; and for me this has been a happy discovery because I 've learned that I possess sonic mental resources  --  not importantones of course , except to me ; but they suffice . For most people these lean years have been hard and for some they 've been killing . " Thinking of what they 've done for just my inconsequent self , though , Harriet , I could easily find it in my heart to thank God for the Depres-sion ! " " What ? " she murmured vaguely , and , perceiving that she was n't listening , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , having thrown the remains of his cigar into the fire , stroked Locksie reflectively . " You 're on your way home from church , Harriet ? " " Yes , I  --  1 thought I 'd stop in and see you for a mo-ment . " " Just for a moment ? Something you 'd like to talk about ? " " No , not in particular , Victor . That is , I  --  " " Yes , there is . " Victor 's hand , about to move caressivelyupon the spaniel 's golden coat , paused and was still . " I 'm afraid I know there 's something in particular you 'd like to talk to me about , Harriet . " " No , there is n't , Victor , " she said stoutly ; but the firelightinto which she gazed showed him the sudden moistureupon her lower eyelids .   " No ? " He began to stroke the dog again . " I seem to gather from Hatcher that he 's perceived in you and Fred a considerable uneasiness . I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd rather not speak of it . " Her voice had a little sharpness . " There 's one thing , though , I think perhaps 1 'd bettertell you . I have n't mentioned it to you before , because what 's the use of adding to your distresses , especially if it might n't happen ? Now , though , I 'm afraid it 's going to . When Ada came home from visiting Alice out west she was worried . Things were going pretty badly with Jack Upham , and Ada was afraid there was going to be a crash . Well , it 's happened . That utility corporation had to make an economy drive , and Jack 's been dropped . I had a letter from Alice day before yesterday . She said that if he could n't find a new position quickly  --  and there was n't anything in sight  --  she was afraid she 'd have to ask if she could n't bring the children and the three of them visit us  --  she spoke of it as a visit , poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's going to be a problem to arrange proper room in the house for them , especiallyif Janey comes home for the holidays , and with only the cook  --  no maids to do the rooms  --  Oh , well , I suppose we can manage somehow . If it only had n't had to come upon us just now ! " Victor put Locksie down on the rug , and rose . " Well , Alice is my sister , too , " he said . Mrs. Ide jumped up . " You do n't think I 've told you about it in the hope that you could do anything for them , Victor ! Good heavens , do n't you suppose we all know you ca n't ? When you 're down to living like this  --  "   He was troubled . " I ought to be able  --  " " No  --  no , please ! " She put a hand on his arm . " I ought n't to 've told you . We can manage . We 'll find room in the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'll need . Jack 's a capable man and he 'll get into something . Ordinarily Fred and I 'd be able to handle it if it were n't  --  " " Yes ? " Victor said quickly . " If it were n't for what ? " " Nothing . " He took both of her hands . " I-Iarriet , this bad luck of the Upham family is n't what 's on your mind . You ca n't look me in the eve and maintain it . Wo n't you tell me ? " " No ; I ca n't tell anybody , " she said desolately , releasedher hands from his and moved slowly toward the door . " I ca n't , even though it may n't be long before everybody 'll know it . " " It 's that had , I Iarriet  --  and that close ? " " Yes . " For a moment she said no more ; then she turned toward hint with the air of one who absentmindedlyintroduces a negligible subject . " Oh  --  I suppose you have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I have n't . " " I suppose you 're going to , though , are n't you ? " In response he only looked at her ; and , at that , she made a remonstrance . " Oh , but do n't you think you really ought to , Victor ? She 's asked you , has n't she ? Has n't she done more ? Has n't she telephoned ? Has n't she even writtento  --  " " Yes , I believe so . " " More than once , Victor ? " He was silent , and Mrs. Idep203spoke impulsively . " Yes , I see she has ! That 's a good deal  --  from Sarah Lash  --  do n't you think ? " " Is it , Harriet ? Well  --  let 's not go into that . " " Others might envy you , " Mrs. Ide said . " Your own nephew , for instance . " " My nephew ? " Victor , after the briefest moment of surprise , spoke musingly . " Yes , I see . A good-looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course ! " " Yes , " Mrs. Ide said . " Poor Hatcher ! She 's quite taken him up ; so I 'm afraid he 'd rather begrudge the invitationsyou 've had . Poor boy , I 'm afraid he 's in quite a state . " " You mean he believes he is , Harriet . " " No ; I mean he is . " " Dear me ! " Victor said . " I 'd rather taken it for granted that he and Dorcy Aldrich  --  " " No ; not any more , Victor  --  at least , not any more for Hatcher . I do n't know about Dorcy . I 'm afraid the gorgeous Sarah 's overwhelmed him . Preposterous , is n't it ? " " No . " Her brother seemed to ponder . " I should n't call it preposterous . He 's not much like the boy in the old jokes , falling in love with the schoolteacher twice his age . Sarah 'd most easily capture a good young imagination . It 'd be natural , under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assented . " I do n't know why I 've mentioned it ; I did n't mean to , and I do n't really take it seriously . At Hatcher 's age  --  " " It 's highly sensitive , " Victor interrupted . " People usually feel pretty sharply at Hatcher 's age . " " Yes  --  but briefly , Victor . "  | " If they 're sound , " he said , " and of course Hatcher 's  --  " " Victor ! " Mrs. Ide stepped toward him . " Could n't you  --  could n't you bring yourself to be nice to her ? I mean could n't you at least go to sec her and be friendly and  --  and  --  " " And what , Harriet ? " " Oh , dear ! " she said , and the words were a moan of confession  --  confession t hat she was desperately asking a great deal of hint . " Could n't you ? " " No , I could not , " he answered . Her right hand , lifted to add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dropped to her side . " I must get myself home , " she said in a dead voice . " You 'll come out to us to-night for Sunday evening supper as usual , wo n't you ? " " Yes , dear . " Without any more to say she again turned to the door , which he silently opened for her . He went downstairs with her and out to the curb . She stepped into her car and drove away , not having spoken to him , or looked at him , again . He returned to his room and sat before his disappearingfire , regardless of the summons of a gong downstairs . Ignoring the sound 's more clamorous repetition , to warn hint that his mid-day meal would be both chilled and sparse if he did n't bestir himself , he became so deeply preoccupied that he had even no ear for his spaniel 's repeatedlyexpressed wish to return to his lap . This meditation , by no means the abstract thought of a detached philosopher , was informing Victor Linley that the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p205They  stood close to calamity , a hint of the nature of which began to be dimly revealed to him by what his sister had just pitiably implored him to do . He knew that it was n't on Hatcher 's account that she had begged him to marry Sarah Florian .   0N SUNDAY EVENINGS the Ides had supper , not dinner ; and , when Jancy or Hatcher , or both , were at home , Mrs. Ide sometimes asked four or five of their young friends to join the family party at the table and enliven mild " parlor games " afterward . This evening when Mr. Linley arrived , a little while before the time set for the meal , he was clamorously welcomed by his niece , Frances , as he removed his overcoat in the hall . She came running from the living-room and threw her arms about him . " ' Thank goodness you 've come , Uncle Victor ! " she cried . " There 's a whole crowd in there and I been trying to entertain ' em ; but Hatcher told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the party . Hatcher 's acting terriblefor a person a party 's for . Uncle Victor , would you like to know a secret ? "  | " Yes , indeed , Frances ! Always . " " It 's about Hatcher , " Frances whispered . " Mother asked all these people of his to supper on his account ; but she did n't think to tell him they were coming till late this afternoon and he said he did n't want ' cm , she better telephone ' em not to come ; but she said it was too late and he said all right , he might decide to go out somewhere any minute right in the middle of it and they 'd be on her hands and she deserved it . He stayed mad about it till they commenced coming and I think he still is , Uncle Victor , and that 's why he was so rude to me about my being the life of the party that certainly needs one . Do n't tell him I told you . " " I wo n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Frances again spoke aloud . " It 's stupid in there . There 's only one I can get to do anything and she is n't enough to make it a good game . " " Game ? " her uncle inquired . " What game ? " " **27;6519;TOOLONG , Uncle Victor . There 's Hatcher and Dorcy and Mary Gilpin and Mr. Wilson , the one they call Pinkie , and Gilpin Murray and Amy from across the street ; and only one of ' em 's willing to play . It 's Mary Gilpin , because most of the rest of ' em act like they just want to sit around and say What ? ' like Hatcher ; so I bet they 're in love or 've had their feelings hurt or something . Anyhow , it 's the way they act and it gets in my hair ! Uncle Victor , will you play **27;6548;TOOLONG with me and Mary Gil-pin ? " " Glad to , " Mr. Linley said . " Just a minute first , P2o8 though , if you do n't mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the living-room to exchange greetings with the young guests , whom he at once perceived to be as subdued in manner as his small niece had said . An uneasinessseemed to prevail , perhaps an emanation from the acting host , Hatcher . Standing with his back to the room , and apparently unaware of any hospitable duties , he was gazing out of the bow window . Mr. Linley trade the customary inquiries in regard to the health of parents , coining to Dorcy last ; and , as he took her hand , he looked at her somewhat attentively . His expressions of solicitude were a little stressed . " Mother 's fine , thanks , " Dorcy said languidly . " Father walked over with inc . I Ic 's here , though he is n't staying for supper and 's got to go home to take her to a party somewhere . I le 's in the library talking to Mr. Ide if you 'd like to see him . " " Yes  --  yes , I should . " Linley turned to Frances , who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , " he assented . " Just give me time to say hello to somebody my own age and I 'll lie back . " " I bet you wo n't ! " Frances protested . " If you go in the lib'ary with Father and Uncle Harry Aldrich you 'll get started into old people 's talking and you wo n't come . You'll- " " Yes , I will ! " Linley laughed , touched her cheek , went out into the hall and took a dozen steps toward the closed door of the library . Having gone this far , he heard voices suddenly become loud within that enclosure . He walked more slowly , and then , five feet from the door , stopped short . P209Two outcries , both harshly passionate and almost simultaneous , yet distinct in his ears , were what halted him . " You damned fool , have n't I told you how to save yourself ? " This was the voice of Harry Aldrich , altered but recognizable ; and almost at the same time Victor heard the answering fierce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I wo n't do it ! " There was an abrupt silence , one that projected a picture of the interior behind the baleful door : two hardbreathingmen staring at each other with inflamed eyes . In the hall Victor Linley heard a light gasp just behind him , and he whirled about to find that little Frances had thoughtfully followed him and stood there , awed . " We better not go in , " she whispered . " Are Father and Uncle Harry having a fight ? " " No . What an idea ! " Ile contrived to laugh . " They 're just arguing . Did n't you ever hear anybody talking politics before ? " " Yes ; but I never heard  --  " " Yes , you have  --  lots of times . People get excited when they talk politics nowadays ; but it does n't mean anything . " He took her hand . " Let 's go back now . We wo n't tell anybody , because pretty soon you 'll see ; when your father and your Uncle Harry come out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever . " " You think so ? " As they moved away , she pulled him toward an open double doorway on their right . " I 'd like to be sure , though , myself , Uncle Victor , if they 're going to be friends again or not . Let 's go into the drawing-room instead of back where the others are ; then we can look into the hall and watch them if Father comes , the way he usually does , to let Uncle Harry out the front door , because I heard Uncle Harry say when he came that he had to go home right son . We can kind of sit in the drawing-room because there are n't any lights lit in there , and then we can tell if they 're going to be friends again by how they act . Do n't you think they sounded awful mad at each other , Uncle Victor ? " " No , of course not . Not really . " He laughed again , reassuringly ; but let her have her way , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a sofa that let them see , through the open double doorway , the forward Dart of the hall . Frances sat close to her uncle . " They kind of scared me , " she said in a small voice . " Nonsense , dear ! They were only  --  " " Sh ! " she whispered . " They 're coming already . " Footsteps were what she 'd heard , not voices . The two men came quickly , into view , Harry Aldrich a step or two in advance . His face deeply flushed and his chin up , Harry strode to the front door and opened it with a jerk , as in headlong departure ; but he stopped abruptly and turned to face his tall partner . Frederic stood before him with head bowed and shoulders stooped in gaunt dejection . I lorry was breathing hard ; but he spoke in a quiet voice . " I just did n't want to leave any last stone unturned , Fred , " he said . " I really knew it could n't be done . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The answer was just audible . " Yes , I do . I 'll see you there at ten to-morrow morning . "   " If  --  " Harry hesitated . " If I 'm a little late do n't worry ; it wo n't matter . " " No  --  it wo n't matter , Harry . " " Well  --  " Harry hesitated again , smiled uncertainly ; then suddenly extended an arm and put a friendly hand on his partner 's shoulder . " Goodnight , old man . " " Goodnight , Harry . " The door closed ; Harry Aldrich was gone . Frederic Ide , walking slowly , returned across the oblong of the drawing-room doorway , and his steps began to be heard ascending the stairs . To the mind of his brother-in-law those ascending steps , pausing at intervals , suggested exhaustion  --  anda worn-out , distracted man who had to lean heavily upon the stairway railing in order to complete his ascent . " Was Uncle Harry going to cry ? " little Frances whispered . " His face was pretty funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was going to . I guess you were right , though . " " Right ? " Her uncle 's question was merely murmured ; he sat in a profound cogitation . " What was I right about ? " " Why , about how they 'd turn out to be friends even after they were yelling that way over politics . " " Yes , of course ! Of course they 're friends . " He patted her hand and rose . " We wo n't tell anybody about it . " " Why not ? " " Well  --  just to have another secret between us . Wo n't that do ? " " Yes  --  if  --  " Frances said . " I 'd enjoy to have it be anothersecret with you , Uncle Victor , if you 'll conic and play **27;6577;TOOLONG with Mary Gilpin and me right now . " " **27;6606;TOOLONG ? Hurrah ! " Victor was boisterous , hoping to make her forget . " Brilliant you and clever Mary Gilpin and stupid I , we 'll play **30;6635;TOOLONG hours and hours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ le took her hand , and , in spite of his limp , began to prance . Frances , shouting , capered beside him ; hand in hand they danced across the wick hall and into the living-room . There , however , the small niece was again disappointed ; for they 'd no Inure than sat down with Mary Gilpin to play their game when Aunt Ada appeared dismally in the doorway and summoned everybody to the diningroomfor supper . They 'd have to put up with her at the head of the table , she said , as Mrs. Ide had a headache and Mr. Ide did n't care for anything to eat . Then Aunt Ada added , to Victor , " Harriet sent you her love and asked me to tell you not to come up to see her , because she 's going to try to get to sleep . " " I see , " he said . " No , I 'll not disturb either of them . " At the table he joined Frances and Mary Gilpin in a struggle to breathe some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent , was like an open sepulcher of half-buried forebodings . The habitual cheerfulness of Amy and Gilpin Murray , already defeatedby the preoccupation of Gilpin 's employer , surrenderedthe last flag to Aunt Ada . Dorcy , almost talkless , carefully looked anywhere except at Hatcher ; and the young Wilson , at first insistently possessive in his manner toward her , became sulky , for he did n't whollyp213lack powers of observation . He ate doggedly , not speaking to anybody , or caring how visible he made his jealousy . Hatcher , paying as slight attention to his food as to his guests , appeared to be listening and waiting for a sound from without that would be a signal ; and this was , in fact , his impatient state of mind . He 'd thought all day that such a parting as he 'd had with Sarah Florian last evening must surely , surely be followedquickly by a summons from her ; but it had n't conic  --  not yet . He 'd meant what he said to his mother about leaving the party on her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he 'd have to leave it on Aunt Ada 's hands , instead , heaven help it ! but he 'd go just the same  --  if and when the call sounded  --  and he sat in suspense . Toward the close of the meal he was needlessly infuriated by a special solicitude of Aunt Ada 's . " Ca n't you eat anything at all , Hatcher ? " " Ca n't I what ? " " Eat , " said Aunt Ada . " You have n't touched your spaghetti or your sweetbread salad . Usually you devour them . Only last Sunday you hardly left enough for the rest of us . Dorcy 'll be wondering what 's the matter with you , Hatcher . Ca n't you  --  " " Eat your own ! " Hatcher thus became primitive . " What 's on my plate 's put there to do what I like with , is n't it ? It 's mine , not my relatives ' , is n't it ? If people attendedstrictly to their own food this world might be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell ringing in the hall , he sprang to his feet and strode to the door . In the same instant Frances , squealing , was also out of her chair and running to intercept him .   " Hatch , you sit down ! " she cried . " Mother and Father both appointed me telephone answerer for this house . They gave me the rights and you haf to let me ! You stop , Hatcher ! " Clamoring as she ran , she followed him into the hall ; then , within a few moments , both Hatcher and Frances reappeared in the dining-room and resumed their seats , Frances arriving first and looking pleased . " Just a wrong number , Aunt Ada , " she said demurely , as she sat down . " I Eicher told ' em so impolitely and hung up ; but when I answer people with the wrong numberI always laugh nicely and say they need n't excuse themselves or anything because I do n't mind . " " Junior does , though . " Erdvynn Wilson laughed artificially . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you , Junior ? " " Junior ' ? " I ! atelier said indifferently . " What do you mean , Junior ' ? My father 's name 's Frederic and mine is Hatcher . " " Yes . " Young Wilson laughed again . " What I mean is Hitler , Junior . " " What ? " " Yes , " Pinkie Wilson said . " Seems to be a rumor goinground among all these other rumors about you  --  that you 're quite the juvenile Hitler , the way you slavedriveone-armed painters and poor old colored women , fixing up those hovels you 're doing over that ought to be pulled down for slum clearance . " Falsely waggish , he looked about the table for encouragement . " Yes , indeed ; they tell me that as a business man this young feller Ide 's a typical little dictator  --  eh , Gilp ? "   " Terrible , " good-natured Gilpin Murray responded . " I 'll say this for him , though : he gets results . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along certain lines touched upon by all the talk going round about his recent spectacular private life ! " Hatcher , straightening suddenly out of a slump , looked at him across the table . " What do you mean by that ? " " Oh , nothing . Just trying to get a rise out of you  --  and it rather appears that I have ! What makes you so jumpy when you hear the telephone ? " " He is n't ! " Frances loyally defended her brother . " I mean he is n't always . It 's only sometimes . " " I 'll het ! " Erdvynn burst into loud triumphant laughter . " Only sometimes ' ! Right you are , young lady ! " Aunt Ada rose . " I think we 'll have to give up waiting for Hatcher to cat , since he has n't even begun . Perhaps he 'll show more interest in bridge , if Dorcy 'll kindly be his partner . " At the card table in the living-room , however , Hatcher 's manner was still discouraging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Ada and the young Wilson , while at the other end of the room Frances had succeeded in adding Amy and Gilpin Murrayto Mr. Linley and Miss Gilpin for the postponed game of **27;6667;TOOLONG . The adult participantsin this latter contest , striving to lighten the gloom and please the little girl , made themselves at times too noisy ; and , when this happened , Aunt Ada looked palely at them over her shoulder . Thereupon they would chide themselves for their thoughtlessness and be quieter ; but finally Aunt Ada did more than merely look at them . " Frances , really ! " she said . " Ca n't you subdue your voice a little ? How can anybody play contract with all that whooping and squealing going on ? Anyhow , it 's your bedtime . " Victor spoke up briskly . " I 'm afraid she means the rest of us , too  --  me in particular ! " His sidelong observation of the card table had suggested that something decisive ought to be done . Hatcher , almost oblivious of his cards , sat gazing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dorcy , still never looking at hint and with her eyes downcast , seemed to be bearing about as much as she could . Erdvynn Wilson , sullenly boiling , appeared upon the point of saying something openly destructive . It was for Dorcy 's sake that Victor made his diversion ; he thought she badly needed an excuse to go home and be alone . " Yes , I 'm sure your Aunt Ada means me in particular , Frances , " he said , and rose . " I was squealing worse than anybody . I do n't sec , though , how she knew it 's my bedtime , too . " Frances made a despairing uproar ; but , at the bridge table , I ) orcy at once put down her cards , said flutteringly that she must he getting home , and the unfortunate game dissolved to no one 's regret . Perfunctorily , Hatcher saw the evening 's guests to the front door and called drearily after them his manufactured objections to their leaving so early ; then , sighing , he sought his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproaches from his small sister . She was ascending the stairway a step or two in advance of him.  | " It 's all your fault the party broke up , Hatch ! " she cried , repeating herself ; but lowered her voice in response to Aunt Ada 's warning that she 'd wake her mother . " Anyways it 's your fault and Aunt Ada 's together . Aunt Ada made the fuss about noise that disgustedeverybody ; but you were the skull at the feast the whole time , Hatch . " " I was what ? " " You were a skull , " Frances explained crossly . " It 's Greek . The way they took their meals . We 've been havingit in school this week . You either kept looking at the wall or else you pulled your chin down long with your mouth kind of open , and frowning so that even Uncle Victor himself could n't brighten anything up much . You acted like that all evening ! " " Did I ? " Hatcher muttered , and he added , not for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got enough to make me . " He felt that the " cares of life " had overtaken him indeed ; and , alone in his room , pondered long upon the new one that by this time had become the most pressing of them . Last night he 'd come from Sarah Florian 's house ecstatic because that superbly matured woman had impliedbeautiful , unbelievable things . She 'd knelt before him , glowing , seized his hands in hers ; she 'd spoken marvelous words to him , putting a spell of caressive togethernessabout them both . She 'd admitted him to her inmost being , revealing her very self to him . He 'd thought : What did anything in the world count against this glory ? He was hers , a thousand times utterly hers ; and she  --  had n't she virtually told him that she could and might be his ?  | If that effulgence had been renewed to-day he would n't have been troubling himself about any old " cares of life " ; he could have sent them all to the devil  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she 'd formerly been engaged to his uncle . When he 'd left her , a rosy glow of love had seemed to spring upward like sunriseon the horizon of the morrow . But to-day had been the morrow and she 'd made it blank . Why ? Surely she must know in what suspense he 'd be waiting , all of today , after such a parting . I lad she let some mood of hers get in the way ? Was n't he of more weight with her than just one of her moods ? She did n't  --  did n't merely play with him , did she , leading him a while , then checking him at will ? No , it could n't be , because a perfect woman would n't do that ; and , with this thought , Hatcher was happier  --  happy enough , in fact , to believe that she 'd surely send for him to-morrow . So , in the end , youth 's celebrated elasticity brought his spirits up again , made him more fit to meet what was comingupon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh troops to come up singing from the rear , man 's spirit mist summion reserves of hopefulness and bright interpretations to bear what shall befall ; and in youth these reserves are readier to the summons , else the progress of the generations would be down hill . The intricate interplay of human destinies -- that is , the simple working of causes and effects  --  was bringing tragedy toward Hatcher Ide , that night , as he moved restlessly about his room , or sat , chin in hand , trying to cheer his thoughts of Sarah Florian . Across the hall his father was not asleep ; and , elsewherep219along Butternut Lane and all through the town , men of business and the professions , whether awake or in slumber , were harried by their own condition and that of the country . Not even the luckiest of them yet saw an end to the Depression ; but worse moved in the world . Upon the narrowed ocean and beyond it , bombs were crashing into flesh ; eastward of armed France , eastward of the Maginot line and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ endless mass production . A few miles from Hatcher , old George slept sadly in the despoiled Linley mansion ; while a little farther northward on that same smoky street Victor Linley sat before his drawing-table , not designing a house but busy with arithmetic , anxiously scribbling figures in a notebook . Nearer to Hatcher , much nearer  --  just beyond the dark lawns of the " Lash place " , in fact  --  big-shouldered , fair Harry Aldrich tenderly kissed his adoring wife goodnightafter a jolly party . . . . Reality sometimes mingles with the end of a dream , so that for the half-waking sleeper what 's actual is indistinguishable from what 's fantasy . Hatcher woke in the morning with the impression that he 'd been dreaming about his mother and that he 'd just heard her scream . He could n't remember what fantastic thing in his dream had caused the scream , and the sound in his ears seemed real  --  almost enough so to be alarming . Sunshine was strong outside his open window ; drowsily he looked at the little clock on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd overslept again , bestirred himself . He was getting into his bathrobe when he heard someone running in the hall outside his door  --  someone with a heavier step than his little sister 's . Running . That was queer . What was anybody running through the upstairs hall for ? He went to the door , stepped out and saw that the speeding person was his Aunt Ada . " What 's the matter ? " he called , as she reached the head of the stairway to descend . " Is anything wrong with Mother ? Where is she ? " " Your mother ? " she called back , letting him see her startled face for an instant . " She 's gone to the Aldriches ' . They just telephoned your father and they 've both gone . I 'm going , too . " He advanced farther into the hall . " To the Aldriches ' ? What for , this early ? What  --  " " Harry Aldrich is dead . " Hatcher did n't know what she meant . " What did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ada was half way down the stairs ; but her voice came back like a blow in his face . " He 's dead . " t SEVEN or eight cars stood in the Aldrichcs ' driveway when Hatcher arrived , breathless and still dressing himself ; and when he went into the house it seemed full of silent or whispering people . He did n't see his father or his mother or his Aunt Ada but caught a glimpse of his little enemy , Dorcy 's cousin Lennie Aldrich ; she was sitting on the stairway half way up to the landing and crying so hard into a blue handkerchief that although he hated her he felt sorry for her . Mary Gilpin , who 'd just descended the stairs , saw him and hurried forward to speak to him . " Come with me , please , " she whispered quickly , and took him to a rear hallway , where there was only a small table with a telephone upon it and a chair beside it . She closed the door . " I 've got a tedious job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother said you were n't up , and I was just going to send for you . I 'll have some breakfast brought to you here and I hope you 'll get a chance to eat it . I 'll relieveyou myself for half an hour at noon and you can get some lunch in the dining-room . We 'd like you to take charge of the telephoning . " " Mary ! " he said . " I do n't believe it 's happened . What was it ? What  --  " " It was in his sleep , Hatcher . That 's what you 're to tell people when they ask . You 're just to say that it must have been his heart , because when they went to call him this morning they found he 'd died peacefully in his sleep . The funeral will be at three o'clock Wednesday afternoon . You 'll have a great many calls because he was the most popular man in town . Just tell everybody what I 've told you . That 's all , except that your uncle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to the house ; but if newspapers telephone ask them to wait a minute , and go into the living- room where your uncle will be and tell him . He 'll conic and answer them . I le knows what to say and will attend to the papers if you 'll take care of the rest . " I latcher sat- down at the table . " Of course I will . But , Mary , please " The bell of the telephone was already ringing ; she paused for a final injunction . " Your mother and father arc upstairs with Dorcy and Mrs. Aldrich ; but of course you 'll say none of them can talk to anybody . Do n't forgetto call your uncle when any of the papers  --  " The voice already speaking into Hatcher 's ear came from a newspaper office ; he told Mary so , and , as she was at the door , it was she who hurried to send his uncle.  |p223Victor  came quickly and , standing , took the instrument from Hatcher . " Yes ? . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . . . Oh , it 's you , is it , Bewley ? . . . Yes , of course , any questions you like . . . Very sudden indeed . . . No , I have n't heard anybody speak of his having been depressed lately ; I should say he 's consistently been the most cheerful and optimistic business man in town . . . No , I do n't see why you should infer any such thing , Bewley . . . Oh , very possibly , very possibly ; but for the past six or seven years has n't almost everybody been raising every cent he could at the banks and elsewhere ? I do n't see anything exceptional in that . . . No , Fred Ide ca n't talk to anybody ; he 's too much overcome . . . Yes , you can send a man up here if you like ; I 'll see him , certainly . Tell him to ask at the door for me . . . Yes , as soon as you like . Good morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Mr. Linleyset down the instrument . " I wish you 'd  --  I do n't  --  How long have you been here ? " " About an hour . Eleanor sent her car for me . " " Well , then ? Do you know  --  " Hatcher 'd risen , and his uncle took the vacant chair with an effect of dropping upon it . " Harry was the best of men ! " he said . " The best of men  --  the kindest  --  No one could have foreseen  --  " " I just do n't get it . I  --  I  --  " Hatcher stammered . " Why , he  --  Was n't he in robust health ? He 's always looked so husky and  --  " " I think I 'll have to tell you , Hatcher . It seems -- -it seems to have been an accident . "  | " Accident ! " Hatcher cried ; then choked down his voice . " Accident ? " " Yes . He and Eleanor got home a little after twelve last night . He 'd been as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her goodnight . At some time after that he appears to have done a thing he 'd never done before . He wrote a message on a slip of paper and fastened it with a thumbtack on the outside of his door . It said that he 'd taken something to make him sleep and he did n't wish to be called in the morning because he wanted to get all the rest he could before an important business engagement he had to-day . When Dorcy got up and saw the paper on his door it frightened her because she 'd never known him to do such a thing and he 'd always been violently opposed to any hind of sleeping potions  --  so she opened the door and ! oohed in . Mr. Loffen says that by then Harry 'd been gone several hours . " " But , Uncle Victor , that looks  --  it looks  --  " " Yes , Hatcher . Loffen says it was morphine . Nobody knows where Garry got it . Probably now nobody ever will know ; but that is n't important . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mot to be an accident , I ! archer . " " But , my God , t tide Viet or --  " ! hitcher clapped his hand over his mouth , apparently knowing no other means to check his outcry . " It 's got to be an accident , " his uncle repeated doggedly . " What 's left of Eleanor 's mind is trying to believe it and we 're doing all we can to get Dorcy to see it that way , too . What helps us most is the fact that Harry had n't locked his door . "  | " He had n't ? " Hatcher said . " He even thought of that  --  to make it look like an accident ? " " Keep your mind on the one necessity , I latcher : that it 's got to be an accident . Dr. Loffen was one of I larry 's closest friends and he 's going the limit that the overdose was just a tired man 's mistake . All the insurance I larry had was hypothecated long ago ; so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Hatcher 's voice was so thick , and yet so broken , that the question was n't distinct . " What ? " Hatcher drew a long breath and made himself understood . " Then what is in it ? Why did he do it ? " Victor looked at the shaking boy compassionately . " Why does anybody do anything ? Is there ever a human action into which an almost infinite number of motives have n't  --  " " Damn ! " Hatcher said . " I did n't ask you for one of your philosophical disquisitions . I asked you why my father 's partner has killed himself ! " " I ca n't tell you . " The telephone rang again , and Victor rose quickly . " There ; sit down and take that call . Mary says she gave you your instructions . You 're only to answer all inquiriesby saying it happened in his sleep and must have been his heart . That 's true , and is enough . You 'll have to help us see it through , Hatcher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took up his task . The telephonic calls came steadily , with scarce time between for his mind to repeat to itself the shrieking questionthat beset it . Not until near midnight did the tele- phone abate enough for him to lie down on the cot Mary Gilpin sent to the small hallway for him ; and by seven in the morning the insistent little bell was ringing again . He was busier throughout this second day than on the first ; but by evening there was a slackening . He 'd had a peculiar disappointment , one he was able to feel in spite of an overwhelming weariness : Sarah Florian 's voice had n't been of the multitude he 'd heard . He 'd hoped for the reward of a few tense words with her , but they 'd not been spoken ; so probably she had come herself to condole , rich-voiced and gentle  --  had been in the same house with him and he had n't even known it ! " No luck , " lie sighed , and was n't aware that his thought was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go home ; henceforth she could easily take care of the lessened pressure , herself . Hatchcr went out limply , and , on his way to the front door , passed through the room where stood Harry Aldrich 's pinto . It was closed , and a tip-toeing tired sister of Eleanor Aldrich 's was arranging flowers in vases upon it . I Locher had no memory of ever seeing that piano closed ; the lid should never be lifted again , he thought as if the black shining case contained the dead relic of a merry and manly voice to be heard no more , forever . At the other end of the room Victor Linley sat flaccidly in a big chair , and Hatcher stopped to speak to him , in a voice appropriately hushed . " I guess those damn calls are about through , because everybody in the city directory 's rung up at least twice . I 'm gone in the head . " He looked about the room , the air of which was dauntingp227with the smell of flowers that already were everywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't this horrible ! Are n't you going to get any sleep ? " " Yes  --  later . I had quite a rest to-day ; I was downtownall afternoon . " Hatcher was drooping ; but he lingered . " Is it always like this  --  always people murmuring or whispering in the next room or in the hall , and you do n't know what goes on upstairs but keep thinking about it  --  and all these ghastly-smelling flowers ? Is it always the same ? " " Yes ; pretty much , " his uncle answered gently . " I do n't find that I get very used to it , though . " " Very ' ? My God ! " Hatcher said . " Me , I 've got a million voices in my ears , all squeaking , I ca n't believe it ! This is the greatest shock to me ! ' and Why , I saw him downtown only last Saturday and he was looking so well ! ' Ninety-nine out of a hundred all saying the same thing , and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ! Mary says I 'm to be one of the active pallbearers ' to-morrow afternoon ; I suppose you and Father are honorary ' . Pleasantjob for all of us . Of course I 've been present at  --  at things like this  --  two or three times during my life ; but I do n't think I ever realized before that people really do die . I almost wish they did n't . Listen to me  --  talking waggish ! I 'd better be getting home before I go crazy ; I 'm all in . See you to-morrow at the  --  Oh , damn ! Good-night . " . . . His own words , " See you to-morrow at the  --  " recurred to Hatcher as he and seven other young men , " friends of the family " , carried what was left of Harry Aldrich out of the room where was Harry 's beflowered closed piano and through the lily-scented dim hall toward the flaring light of the opened front door . They moved solemnly between two lines of middle-aged men who stood with heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncle , members of this formally stricken assembly . For a moment his glance met Victor 's and seemed to say , " Yes ; well , here we are at the  --  " as if it made things easier to avoid the word " funeral " in connection with jovial I tarry Aldrich . Hatcher realized that his uncle would n't omit the word ; middle-aged people , it seemed , could bear such words and what they meant . Middle-aged people could say terrible things and do them ; they could go about everywhere , laughing and being hail-fellow-well-met with everybody , and then without warning they could shut themselves up in a room and kill themselves . Young people , too , could kill themselves sometimes , of course ; but Hatcher 'd never known any young person who 'd done it . Middle-aged people could do it almost as if it were all in the dav 's work ; and then their middle-aged most intimate friends could stand up in two decorous files and , not weeping , sec than carried out to be slid into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never live to be middle-aged ; it seemed to him that probably he was the only person except Mrs. Aldrich and Dorcy- and that spitfire little Lennie  --  who 'd ever really cared about I tarry Aldrich . During this dismal passage he had other thoughts , too , without realizing that they were inconsistent . The rooms on both sides of the hall were filled with people so mo/tionless that no faintest rustling was heard from them ; but , passing the open doorways in their view , Hatcher felt a certain distinction in his present position . He could n't help feeling a little pride that he had been chosen for it , and he became slightly self-conscious . Sarah Florian , he thought , was certainly among the mourning throng , since she was a next-door neighbor and the Aldriches had so recently given a dinner for her . Though propriety did n't permit him to turn his eyes to look for her , it was gratifying , in a way , to know that she must be seeing him and that the sad office he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure he felt her dark and glowing gaze upon him and that she understood all about his being the one who was suffering the most for Harry Aldrich , in spite of the stoic face that had to be worn . On the way to the cemetery , disappointingly , he was forced to abandon this illusion of his . Looking forth from the window of his car in the funeral procession , he saw Sarah Florian . Behind her mulatto chauffeur , she was coming rapidly from the opposite direction , unquestionablynot from the ceremony Hatcher 'd been undergoing ; and his fleeting glimpse of her made him hope that she was n't thinking of him just then . Never more beautiful , she was looking straight ahead ; his swift impression was of a lovely face set in a determination that carried with it , vividly , an air of resentment . Hatcher , badly let down , had the plaintive idea that during her drive this afternoon she 'd happened to see poor old George somewhere and was brooding upon him , the murderer of her flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , a few minutes later ; and , when his final duties for the day had been performed , and the pallbearers ' car had set him down at his own gate , his mind 's eye could see nothing but the racked black figures of Eleanor Aldrichand Dorcy clinging together above a sinking coffin . He 'd had to turn his head from them  --  and he 'd kept his eyes upon the frostbitten sod upon which he walked as the funerary party left the grave . He was aware that Erdvynn Wilson moved from his place among the pallbearersand went to I ) orcy , and that Erdvynn helped her into the car that bore her and her mother away ; but , at the time , this did n't seem to mean anything . Now , at home , Hatcher shambled into the house , coughing , and , relieved to find the others not yet returned from the cemetery , went upstairs and washed his face in cold water . Then , not freed of a smarting of the eyes , he moved aimlessly about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unknown that was coming . He 'd often asked for it ; but , now that he knew it was coming , he was afraid he could n't stand it . He heard the front door closing , heard his mother and Aunt Ada begging- his father to go to his room and lie down , heard his father sharply refusing . " Now it 's coming , " Hatcher thought . He was near the head of the stairway ; he stood there , listening , and for a while heard nothing more . When his mother called him from below , her voice was n't loud ; but he started . " Hatcher , are you there ? " " Yes , Mother . "  | " Come down , please , dear . Your father wants to talk to you . " " Does he ? All right . " Hatcher descended as slowly as he could without pausing on every step . He thought of Sarah Florian  --  what did anything else matter so long as her beauty was in the world ?  --  and yet he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small . LIBRARY , as he entered , hisfather stood looking out of a window . Mrs. Ide was beside him with her hand upon his shoulder , and Aunt Ada , in an old brown leather armchair , seemed to have treated herself to a condit ion of pale collapse . The light through the windows was failing , and , when Frederic Ide turned to speak to 1 hatcher , the son could n't sec the father 's face distinctly . " You- - you want to talk to me , Father ? " " No , I do n't want to . I 've got to . " Hatcher had a slight sense of relief . His father 's tone was crisp , unexpectedly steady , not weakened or desperate . It was , in fact , the tone of a man of affairs who meets a crisis practically when it finally arrives , no matterhow shattering its approach has been .   " Well , I 'm here to be talked to , " the son said . " I think it 's about time , probably . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be kept from  --  " Hatcher 's voice trembled , though he tried to hearten himself with a little bumptious sarcasm "  --  from Frances and me , on account of our tender years . " " No . " Frederic Ide shook his head . " I wish it had been on account of your youth , Hatcher . It was n't . If I tarry and I could have raised enough money in the short time we had to do it in , I think we could have kept our difficultyto ourselves permanently . I had to tell your mother some time ago because she began to guess it ; but if I Larry and I 'd had a little better luck nobody but the three of us  --  your mother and he and I  --  need ever have known . Now , of course , all that 's blown up . I mean it 's just about to . " " Yes , sir ; I think I get you . You mean this family 's on the skids and got to take it , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustment , I hitcher ; and I 'm afraid that means you too , Ada , and that poor Alice wo n't be able to come here with her children . Harriet , she 'll have to be written to and  --  " " I see , " Hatcher interrupted , and tried to speak roughly . " Janey 's got to quit college and we 're practicallyon our way to Uncle Victor 's boarding-house . Well , what 's going to happen to Dorcy Aldrich and her mother ? I suppose the whole town 's practically certain by now that Harry did n't pass out with any heart failure . " " If it is n't certain , it ought to be ! " Aunt Ada spoke suddenly and shrilly . " Everybody ought to know it .   When a man brings ruin on his best friends and then takes his own life because he ca n't stand up and face what he 's done , I think the whole world ought to know it ! For my part , I blame Eleanor as much as I do Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perfect sultana , leading him into every extravagance and crazy  --  " " Ada , that 's cruel ! " I larrict Ide said . " Eleanor 's lightheartedand loved the easy life they led ; but she did n't know . I do n't think he ever spoke a word of business to her in his life . Eleanor 's no more to be blamed than a  --  " " Blame ? " Frederic interposed . " What 's the use of blaming ? If you 've got to pin the blame upon anything , it would be upon something usually thought good  --  a man 's love for his wife and their happiness together . Harry just could n't hear to let Eleanor down . She 'd got used to living in a kind of whirl of gayety and luxury  --  oh , they both had  --  and he did n't know how to stop it . It 's harder to stop than most people understand , and for such a man as I tarry it was impossible . It sounds crazy ; but only a month ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He kept up their way of living on somebody else 's money , Hatcher . He used securities we held in trust . " " Yes , sir . " Hatcher 's hands were trembling ; so he put them in his pockets . " You sec things like that in the newspapers right along ; but you  --  you hardly think they 'd ever happen in connection with  --  with a firm like Ide and Aldrich . I think I know when you began to suspect it , sir ; that day you were sick  --  " " No ; I never did suspect it , Hatcher . Harry 's spending bothered me at times ; but he often laughed to me aboutp235what a show they were making on practically nothing and he said Eleanor was a wonderful manager . I did n't quite see it ; but he was probably the most convincing man in the world ; I just went on bothering vaguely to myself and did n't press it . Then Harry found he 'd got himself into such a jam he had to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the face without having suspected . " Frederic Ide sat down , sickened anew . " I tarry saw the day coming on him suddenly when we 'd have to account for the securities he 'd used . " " Yes , sir . " Hatcher trembled more . " Whose  --  whose securities were they , sir ? A number of people 's ? " " Sarah Florian 's . " " Sarah 's ! " Ada spoke suddenly and shrilly again . " Yes , they 'd have to be hers ! Of all people ! " " They 'd come to her from her grandfather , " Frederic said . " Old Sheffley Lash thought a great deal of I larry , and Harry got him to let Ide and Aldrich handle about a sixth of the Lash investments . That 's what it amounts to  --  something like a sixth of Sarah 's holdings . I-Iarry 'd brought in the Lash account and from the first he had the managing of it ; so it came to be our habit that though he 'd usually consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got the income from it regularly and let it stay ; but the war made her decide to come back here to live , and she notified Harry from Paris that when she arrived she 'd expect him to have the whole account in shape to go over with her . That was when Harry woke up to find himself living in hell and had to tell me what danger we  --  "  | " Poor Harry ! " Mrs. Ide had begun to cry . " Ah  --  and poor you ! " " Poor all of us ! " her husband said ; then showed a pathetic flicker of business vanity . " I do n't believe any other two men could have come nearer doing an impossiblething than Harry and I did , trying to raise that money . He was only sixty-five thousand dollars short  --  about a tenth of what Sarah had with us  --  and , if it had n't been for the Depression and our already having had to scrape and borrow our damndest , we could have done it . Up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a trifle . As things are , it 's been just twentytwothousand dollars too much for us . That 's all  --  twentytwothousand !  --  because by working miracles during these few weeks since I tarry told me , we did raise fortythreethousand ; but that was the utmost possible limit to what we could get . It 's this last twenty-two thousand dollars that 's finished I tarry and sunk us . " His wife sat beside hint , caught his hand in hers ; but his sister was inspired with a desperate hope . " Fred ! " she cried . " If that 's all , could n't you even yet  --  " " No , Ada . Time 's up and we squeezed every single last thing so dry the dust choked us . The one expensive thing Eleanor 'd never cared for was real jewelry  --  she likes stage necklaces and gewgaws  --  and Harry was even two installments behind on the new car he got her this year . Ile owed everybody . He 'd been putting Sarah off from the day she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little  --  well , they did n't get very far with her ! Oh , yes , she thanked us nicely  --  but precisely when did we propose to have the Lash accounts for her inspec/tion ? Poor Harry kept his nerve and talked his jolliest to her ; but last Saturday morning when I was out , George Clise called at the office and notified him he was acting as Sarah 's attorney , and at ten o'clock Monday morning he 'd bring her downtown to see exactly what we held for her  --  or else ! " " Or else ' ! " Ada jumped up , and her echo of the phrase was a sharp outcry . " You need n't think I 've been completelyin the dark all this time ; I 've known more than you and Harriet think I did . If you care to learn the truth , I was half way down the stairs when you and Harry came out of this room on Sunday , and I was absolutelycertain you 'd had a terrible quarrel . You can try to defend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that just then you 'd been telling him what you really thought of him and  --  " " No , no ! " Ide said . " He knew what he 'd done ; he thought worse of himself than I did . On Sunday he asked me to do something I could n't do ; but he did n't really expect it . I see now it was just a despairing , automatic gesture to relieve the pressure in those last few hours . If I 'd known his life hung upon it  --  " " No , you could n't ! " His wife clung more tightly to his hand . " One thing I ca n't bear , Fred , is any more reproachingof yourself . " She spoke angrily to her sisterin-law . " Sit down , Ada , and stop making it worse . It was n't a quarrel ; they were both just suffering . Harry told Fred that legally they 'd go down together , the one just as much as the other  --  as if Fred did n't know it and as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he said Fred would have to join him in juggling some of their other clients ' securities to get that last twenty-two thousand dollars so that Sarah 'd be satisfied . Of course Fred could n't do that and  --  Ada , wo n't you please sit down ! " " No , I wo n't ! " Ada cried , and she stamped her foot . " I 've been suspecting something ever since that woman came home because she 'd have to pay too much taxes in France . I knew something was wrong and I was sure she had to do with it ; but I did n't know just what . Now that I do know , I 'll thank you not to tell me to sit down ! " " Please do ! " her brother groaned . " I wish to God you would , Ada . Have n't we got enough other  --  " " I 'll not ! " Ada said fiercely . " I 'll not sit down for anybody ! So it was all so that Sarah 'd be satisfied ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poorhouse , and the Aldrich family with ' em , and our father 's and grandfather 's firm wiped out , and you 'll be tried in a court of law , Fred , and Harry Aldrich killed himself  --  all so that Sarah 'd be satisfied ' ! My God ! " " Ada  --  for heaven 's sake ! " her brother begged . " No ; you ca n't stop me ! She gets everything back that you and Harry had of hers  --  all but this bit of money that means just nothing to her , not a hundredth of what she owns  --  and we 're all to die for it . What 'd you waste your time and money on giving her those crazy teas and dinners for ? Why did n't you ask me ? I could have told you she 'd sick her lawyers on you just the same . Oh , yes , by the time she kicked old George out , you all began to understand she had n't changed or softened one whit ; but 1 could have told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book ! I know  --  " " Ada ! " Her sister-in-law put forth this useless effort .   " Ada , please have a little self-control . Fred 's trying to tell us  --  " " What 's that to me ? " Ada cried . Beside herself , she did n't care , this once in her life , what Hatcher heard . " I guess you and Fred remember Foster Early , Harriet . When I was twenty-nine and she was twenty-one she noticed that Foster Early was taking me about a little ; and she got him over there to her disgusting Gothic oratoryand candlelight , and kissed him  --  and thank God I had too much pride to bear the sight of him when he came back and wanted to tell me all about it after she 'd thrown him over for Victor ! Oh , yes , Harriet , you need n't think I have n't seen what you 've been hoping Victor 'd do since she came home ! You need n't think  --  " " Ada ! Ada ! " Frederic begged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Ada was not to be silenced . " If you 'd asked me , Harriet , I could have told you Victor 's got too much sense . You thought that woman had come back here just to get Victor , and so you depended  --  " " I did not ! " Mrs. Ide protested lamentably . " I did n't think she 'd come back for any such reason ; but  --  but after she was here and saw him again I thought  --  Yes , I did think that her old feeling about him returned , and it did . You could see it . I was right . I  --  " Ada was scornful . " Yes ; you hoped he 'd marry her  --  I know you did ! You hoped so because you thought if he did you could go crawling to her and even she would n't send her new husband 's brother-in-law to the penitentiary . Harriet , I believe on my soul you 're still hoping that when Victor understands he 's the only life-saver left he 'll leap in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my part , I 'd rather die in disgrace than see her get him . She 's the  --  " " She is not ! " This was the best that poor Hatcher could do . Speechless during the tumult of his aunt 's fury , he now found part of his voice , though all of his mind failed him . " She is not ! " Ada turned upon him . " You defend her ? Why , you poor little softie , do n't you know yet that your mother 's right and Sarah 's been after your uncle again ever since she got home ? Ca n't you see she 's let you play around her just to keep tabs on him and because she never could let any male idiot alone that 's over sixteen ? You standing up for her ! Harry Aldrich 'd be alive this minute if it was n't for her . Do n't you know what she 'll have her lawyers do to your own father ? " " Nothing ! She would n't dream of  --  " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask him ! " " I will ! Father , do you believe  --  " " Hatcher ! " Mrs. Ide was feebly indignant . " You 'll have to begin to try to be a little older . George Clise called your father up this morning to notify him to be ready with all the Lash Estate accounts to-night at Sarah 's . " " There ! " Ada cried . " Tonight -- because all the effect on her of what Harry did was that she turned more suspiciousshe might lose a dime . She could hardly wait till he was buried . There 's the truth for you , my fine young man ! " " Let the boy alone , Ada , " Hatcher 's father said . " It 's Sarah 's money . She 's got a right to it . " " Yes  --  if it kills all the rest of us ! " Ada still facedp241Hatcher . " Now you see , do n't you ? She 'll have the last drop of blood out of  --  " " You sha n't say it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp ; he shook from head to foot . " It 's all false . She 's been slandered and slandered and slandered , and I 'm going to stop it . She would n't do a damn thing that would n't be  --  would n't be from the highest motives . I 'm going to prove it ! " " Prove it ! " I ! is aunt uttered a scream of laughter . " Prove it , you poor thing ? Oh , dear me ! " " I will ! " he shouted . " You insult her ; you try to put everything on her , every falsity and cruelty and meannessthere is ! Do you think I 'll stand for it ? Do you think I 'll let her stand for it ? " He swung to the door and jerked it open . " You stay here , by God , till I bring her answer to you ! " With that , disregarding his mother 's cries of entreaty and the protestive commands called after him by his father , Hatcher ran out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . In the library Frederic Ide put his hand on his wife 's shoulder . " Let him go . What 's it matter ? She 'll only know it an hour or so earlier . It 's all up anyhow , Har-riet . " Ada laughed again . " Harriet does n't think so . She 's still counting on Victor 's saving us . But she 's wrong ; she does n't know her own brother . Victor 'd die a thousand deaths before he 'd marry that woman ! " P242Lost in thought , a pale slight gentleman in black was approaching the front door as Hatcher plunged out of it . Victor Linley beheld without any evidence of surprise the impetuous rush of his nephew ; but , pausing , inquired mildly : " ( ; an I be of use to you , Hatcher ? " " You ? " 1 Lacher shouted , passing him at a run . " Hell , no ! " Mr. Linley remarked the contemptuous implication of this violence ; but his expression showed no resentment . The . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ avuncular thoughtfulness . Hatcher ran across the lawn and disappeared among the leafless thick shrubberiesthat separated it from the " Lash place " . His uncle , staring after him , hesitated , seemed to debate with an impulse to follow  --  then dismissed the idea and entered theP243house somewhat hurriedly . Hatcher , by that time , was ringing at Sarah Florian 's door . As upon the other occasion when he 'd come unbidden she kept him waiting ; but this time she did not prepare him with a distant musical expression of her mood : there was no piano prelude to her appearance in the Louis XV room . The big house seemed all silent except for Hatcher 's footsteps as he paced the parquetry floor ; his breathing , too , was noisy enough to sound as a disturbance in that still apartment where the long rose-gray curtains , closed , softly repudiated what was left of the light of day . Crystal , porcelain , gilt cabriole legs , petit point and Aubusson weavery intruded upon him as a background unfit for this interval . The delicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lighted candles , seemed unendurably artificial presences in a scene of such suspense and preparation ; for he was strugglingly preparinghimself to speak up roughly and say what his anguish pressed him to say . Her delay by no means gave him time to cool off ; but did permit a particular realization  --  thatin emotional moments with older people he 'd seldom said what he meant . He had n't been man enough to ask even his uncle a vitally important question ; he 'd never come anywhere near saying to Sarah Florian what he 'd burned to say . Every time  --  every single time !  --  he 'd fumbled it . With Dorcy or Mary Gilpin , or with other contemporaries , he could be in almost any kind of a stew , yet could and did speak out freely in their own and his own language . He made them understand him ; he was not to be manipulated or verbally baffled  --  but with a grown woman , thirty-four years old , he 'd made a flop of everything he 'd ever tried to say to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being young ; but youthfulnesswas n't going to balk him now . No , and he was n't so darned young any more ; he 'd lived enough lately  --  yes , and suffered enough !  --  to add youth-destroying years to twenty-two , and this time he 'd say his say ! He looked at himself in the dim mirror over the suave marble mantelpiece and swore he 'd say his say . As he swore it , he saw how his hair looked ; did hurried brushy work upon it with one hand and adjusted his tie with the other . " Yes ? " Sarah Florian spoke from the other end of the room . She had n't come through the doorway he 'd kept in view in the mirror . " Oh , gosh ! " I archer said despairingly as he dropped his hands and turned to her . She seemed more beautiful than he 'd ever seen her , and , at the same time , taller and colder ; her face , non-committal unencouragingly , expressednothing divinable . " Yes , you would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always got to look a fool to you  --  even now when I 'm going insane . " " Arc you really ? " she asked , but did n't seem interested to hear details . " I 'm sorry to 've kept you waiting ; but I 've quite a lot of things to attend to to-day . I 'd have told them to say I was n't at home , except that I want a word with you . It 's only this : I 'm afraid that something 's going to happen so that presently we may n't be as good friends as we have been ; but I 'd like you to bear in mind that it 's not my fault . "   " Your fault ? " Hatcher stepped toward her . " I came here to tell you that you have n't any faults  --  that you 're perfect !  --  and that you never did anything they say you did and that you never will . " " Oh ? " she said . " So that 's why you came ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak loudly , sometimes brokenly ; but he felt that at least he was speaking out at last . " You 're  --  you 're a grand woman ! You 're everything that 's brave and strong and  --  and generous and  --  and loyal  --  and they lie about you ! Well , I do n't intend to let them lie about you any longer ; but you 've got to help me . You 've got to hear what they say and give me the  --  the authority  --  to show them it 's all lies . " " I 'm afraid just now I have n't much time , " she said , and might less painfully have dashed a little vitriol upon him . " You  --  you have n't time ? Not after what I 've just said to you ? " " I fear I have n't . " " You 're too busy ! Oh , my God ! " He struck his forehead with his clenched right hand , and immediately disavowedthe gesture . " There I go ! I try to speak my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! I do n't do that with other people and I do n't believe I 've often done it with you ; but as soon as I make up my mind to tell you what I 've got to , that 's the way I do it ! I 'm a mess  --  I 'm a terrible mess and I know it  --  but I 'm going ahead and you 'll have to listen whether you 've got time or not . I want to talk to you calmly . Let me get my thoughts together . You see I 'm in torture , do n't you ? " " Torture ? " She seemed indulgent , though her air of being pressed for time was n't relinquished . " Rather a pushed word , is n't it ? At your age  --  " " Now for both our sakes , " he begged , " do n't start me making theater gestures again . My age ! Do n't you suppose I 've stood enough about that already ? I did n't come here to talk about my age . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing me . I came here to  --  " " Hush ! " she said ; and at that , and her imperative gesture , he stopped short . One of her Philippine Islanders stood in the corridor doorway . " Mista Linley , " he announced . Sarah Florian 's eyes dilated ; her mouth opened , and she stared at the man as widely as liatcher was staring at her . " Who ? " she asked , with a break in her voice that made two syllables of the word . Then she repeated it sharply . " Who ? " Victor Linley appeared from behind the Islander and came in apologetically . " If you 'll forgive Inc " he began ; but got no further . " Forgive you ? " Sarah Florian spoke loudly and haughtily . She wholly disregarded hatcher ; the unfortunateyoung man , gasping , perceived that so far as she was concerned and right in the midst of his utmost tragedy  --  he was no longer even present . " Forgive you ? " she said . " You condescend to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? " Mr. Linley 's face flushed a little ; but he smiled politely . " Yes , indeed ! I mean that if you 'll forgive me I 've taken the liberty of looking in for a moment to tell my nephew he 's rather pressingly wanted at home . His mother thought that if I 'd just step over and bring him  --  "  | " Bring him ? " she said . " You 're on a hurried errand ? You 've come for him and are going with him ? That 's why you came ? " " Why , yes . " " How damnable ! " She reached Victor in one of her graceful long strides , and with her open right hand struck him hard upon his unflinching chin . " How hateful ! " she cried . " It 's you that ought to have killed yourself . WhateverHarry Aldrich has done to me , you 've done a times worse . You keep me waiting , waiting , waiting , and then when you do deign to step into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy his mother wants him ! " " I 'm extremely sorry , " Victor began . " I most deeply regret  --  " " Most deeply ! " She mocked him . " Is that tone a continuanceof the condoling you 've been doing with the bereaved Aldrich family ? Do n't bring it around here . I do n't care for it . " " Yes , " Victor said gently . " I 'll take it away . Hatcher , if you 'll come now I think we 'd better  --  " " No , you do n't ! " As he turned to the door , Sarah caught his arm and swung him round . Her voice had lost its accustomed deep richness ; had suddenly become highpitched , raw and genuine . " I 'll have it out with you now ! You wo n't slide away from it . No man ever treated a girl as you did me . No , and no man 's ever treated me as you have since I came back here . You do n't get away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to listen ! " " Indeed , yes , " he said . " That is  --  if Hatcher does n't mind returning home ahead of me . Hatcher , your mother said  --  "   " I wo n't ! " Hatcher spoke fiercely . " I 'm over five years old , damn it , thank you ! I 'm going to say what I came here to , whether you stay and listen or not . I came here to  --  " " I know , I know , " his uncle said soothingly . " Another time may be better , though . If you  --  " Sarah laughed aloud . " Do you think I 'd be more tractableif he were n't here , Victor ? " Hatcher perceived that she was again aware that he lived . " What do I care ? " she cried . " Indeed I 'm quite willing to have one of your family here to listen ! " " I do n't want to , " I hatcher said . " I did n't come here to listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look at him ! " Sarah swept to Hatcher , apparently to use him as a rostrum , for she pointed and looked at his deprecatory uncle . " See that man ! I 'll tell you a little about him , my boy , and how he treats women who trust him ! When he first made love to me I was a girl  --  I was a devoted little idiot and was n't he a maiden 's dream , though ! " She laughed again ; then sobbed , but without interruptingherself . " Oh , hut he was a sweet thing with his hero limp and exquisitely adult calm  --  and all the girls keeping dead flowers from hint in their desks  --  " " Sarah ! " Victor said in mild remonstrance . " I do n't recallthat any such testimonials  --  " " The same old pretended modesty ! " she cried . " Still working the sane old affectation ? Do the ladies find it as fascinating as of yore ? " " I 'm afraid not as of anything , Sarah . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ! You 've always been one ; there wasP249never a natural or impulsive drop of blood in your body  --  and think of what you dared to call me ! " She appealed passionately to Hatcher , as if , for an instant , he representedJustice . " He did ! He called me horrible things  --  and just before we were going to announce our engagement ! Would anybody believe it of him , seeing him stand there so smugly ? Almost in so many words he called me a self-indulgent egoist , a man-collector , spoiled , and he said I was n't even truthful with myself . That was n't the worst : he said I was stingy  --  except with myself ! Yes , stingy ! I ! At first I thought he was joking  --  " She sobbed again . " Hatcher , really ! " Mr. Linley sent an urgently suggestiveglance from his nephew to the door . " Do n't you think you might  --  " " I wo n't ! " Hatcher said . " I 'm staying . " Sarah ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she cried . " There we were  --  going to be married  --  and that 's what he said to me ! I told him if he did n't take it back I was through with him , and he said he was sorry  --  sorry ' !  --  but that was what he thought . So I showed him what I thought of him  --  what I thought of the kind of lover he was ! There were others , I let him discover . " " Discover ? No , " Victor said , with neither reproach nor satire . " Dear Sarah , it was always apparent that there were others , naturally . " " Do you hear him ? " She appealed tragically to Hatcher . " He did n't mind the others ! That was flattering , was n't it ? I did n't stay to see how much he minded my marrying one of them ; I let him think that out at his leisure . "   " I did n't need the leisure , Sarah . I understood im-mediately . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You probably thought I was repenting at leisure ' ! " " No , no . I never  --  " " You did ! That 's just what you were thinking in your infernal , insufferable self-conceit . You were never more mistaken , Victor Linley ! I forgot you . I lived a full life and there were whole years when you were n't twice in my thoughts . " " Of course , Sarah . I had no idea you 'd  --  " " Stop interrupting Inc ! I forgot you , I tell you ; but when I came back here and saw you again I thought you 'd at least have the grace to try to make up to me for the old insults and  --  " " Insults ? Indeed they were n't meant to be . You asked me for the honest truth and I merely  --  " " Shame ! " She seemed about to strike him again . " Shame on you for your -- for everything that you are ! Do you think that any woman  --  any such woman as I ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come to see me ; you did n't let yourself be caught alone with me . If I wanted to talk to you I had to drag you from your villainous boarding-house and out to the public street ! That was nice for a woman of any pride , was n't it ? You hide away in a third-rate pension  --  " " No , I do n't , " Victor said ; and he smiled suddenly . " I moved early this morning . " " What ? " " I 've taken a room in the old Linley house . " Upon that , it was as if she 'd had physical blow for blowp251from him ; she wavered back from him . " You  --  You 're as poverty-stricken as that ? " He smiled again , amiably . " I 'm afraid so . " Sarah Florian stood straight and her breath came fast . " Then I 've received the worst of all your insults , and let me tell you it 'll be the last ! " " You must n't see it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable there . After all , the old house is solid and rather  --  " " Now damn you ! " she said . " You 've made it clear enough , I think . I 'm through with you , this time for good and all  --  through with you and your whole hateful family . This boy 's made it pretty plain to me how some of your relatives talk about me ! " " Ah , Hatcher ! " the uncle murmured . " What have you done ? " " Not half ! " the desperate Hatcher said . " Not half what I came here to do . I  --  " " Plain indeed ! " Sarah Florian , now , in voice and look , was bitter with more than Victor . A natural vindictiveness , most human , distorted the features habitually held calm for the preservation of their beauty . " This boy 's come straight from home before this , filled up with lies and poison and scandal about me  --  straight from your malevolent female relatives , Victor Linley . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other way your sanctimoniousfamily has been despoiling me  --  with Harry Aldrich 's help . But I intend to know  --  yes , this very night ! " Hatcher uttered indistinguishable sounds , strange ones , in his throat , before he became coherent . " You  --  you warn us ? " he asked , and with both hands undid the arrangement of his hair he 'd accomplished before the mirror . " I ca n't stand this . I got so I did n't care if you 'd been engaged to my uncle ; but if you 're still in love with him  --  or again in love with him  --  " " I ? Now ? " Sarah strode away from him , laughing . " You little utter fool ! " " I am not , " poor Hatcher said . " I have been ; but I 'm not . You talk at him as if I were n't here . When he comes in , you do n't pay any attention to me at all except to use me to get an effect on him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it sounds as if you 'd like to be even with him because he is n't falling for you . That 'd be pretty unworthy , I think . One of the things I came here to say was that I knew you were too high-minded to do what they said you would . I told ' cm I knew you better ; you would n't do such a thing . " " What such a thing ' ? " she said . " To my fa  --  " I ' archer began ; but paused abruptly . His uncle had stepped between him and Sarah Florian . A whisper reached Hatcher 's cars , but not hers  --  a whisper so commanding , so poignant that it was paralyzingly effective . " Shut up ! " Hatcher was silent . 1 ! is uncle turned about with a gesture of apologetic explanation . " Ile 's naturally a little confused and we 've interrupted you long enough , Sarah . His mother really does want him rather urgently . If you  --  " He made a little bow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be  --  "  | " Go on ! " she said passionately . " I 'm sick of you ! Be off with you ! Both of you ! " She did n't stay to see them out of the room , but turned to the door by which she 'd entered , passed through , and closed it clashingly behind her .   OUTDOORS , the compassionate uncle limped as fast as he could , to keep up with the striding nephew . There was still a little daylight sieved through the woody groves west of Butternut Lane ; the scrambled tips of old forest trees did n't merge with the sky but rose against it as if scrawled in brown ink with a haphazard pen . This effect went unseen by the younger of the two hurrying across Sarah Florian 's frozen lawn ; but the elder remarkedit with a melancholy eye and the thought that it was being repeated above a sylvan enclosure of marble shapes where to-day he 'd left forever the semblance of an old friend . Hatcher stopped suddenly in the shrubbery of the boundary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just become visible , and its springing into shape with P255a flare of warm light was what checked him . " I do n't want to go in there . " As he spoke he turned his back upon his uncle , and his utterance was impeded as by a cold in the head . " You go ahead . I 'm not coming . " " You would n't rather I 'd wait with you , Hatcher ? " " No , I would n't . " Hatcher used his handkerchief as furtively as he could and tried not to speak huskily . " You  --  you 're one hell of an old bird , it seems to me . You certainlymust have had your own way of being engaged to a woman . If you did n't care for her , what 'd you ever tell her you did for ? " " What for ? " his uncle said . " I was in love with her . " " What ? " " Why , naturally , Hatcher . Overwhelmingly in love with her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to her for ? " " Why , she asked me , " Victor Linley said in his mild way . " I had n't expected to be happy with her , of course , because I knew no one could be that ; and , though I was so deeply in love with her , I ca n't say that I ever admired her or liked her , Hatcher . You know it 's sometimes possible to be in love with a person you dislike , do n't you ? When she asked me for my honest opinion of her I thought she had a right to it . At least it would put our relationship on a firmer base for the future  --  and , fortunatelyfor us both , it did . " " But  --  " Hatcher was still turned away . " But she  --  she 's been after you ever since she came home . She wanted you back  --  up to just now . Up till you practically told her you 'd rather live in that old ruin downtown than  --  than with her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to actually marry you . " " Oh , perhaps , perhaps , " his uncle said lightly . " Some such thing may have been in her mind since her return . She may have felt that it was due to herself . I dare say . Nothing to do with mc , of course . " At this , Hatcher faced him . " Nothing to do with you ! What on earth do you think you 're telling me ? " " Why , that she 's had no feeling for me , Hatcher  --  one rather against me , in fact . You see , when she came home and found me still wobbling about , an old half-buried protest against me must have flared up . She could n't endurethat I should n't at last be so dependently in her possession  --  at least for a time  --  that I 'd be sorry I was ever critical of her . She felt she had to make me feel that ; she had to reduce me . In what I am , except in relation to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did have . " " What ! Why , when you came in that room she was like somebody I 'd never seen before . Me  --  she treated me as if I 'd been part of the wall . No interest in you ? That 's a hot one ! " " No , " Victor said . " She is n't capable of any , Hatcher . One does n't blame her for it because she was born so , and , what intensified it , she was helped to grow up that way . She is n't interested in anything except in its relation to herself , and she never will be . Most of us are more or less like that , even in our love affairs ; so there have to be some extreme cases , of course . She 's one of ' em ; that 's all . You 'll understand it better when you 're a little older , Hatcher . " Hatcher fell back upon mere profanity as the expres/sion of his weariness of this eternal repetition . When he more controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you have to be before all the damn gray-haired naggers on earth stop telling you that ? " " I do n't know , " Mr. Linley answered . " I 'm still telling it pretty often to myself . " " Well  --  " Hatcher paused , sunk in miserable thought . Then he asked faintly , " What do you think life is ? " " I have n't an idea . " " You have n't ? Not at your age ? Then what do you think we get from it ? What 's the use of it ? Old enough to have an idea about that ? " " Yes  --  a vague one , " the uncle answered slowly . " So far as I can gather , the thing to learn is how to gain some slight bits of information on your subject  --  lift '  --  from adversity . " " How nice ! A pleasant prospect to dangle before an infant of twenty-two ! The best we can look forward to is tough times , then ; and the tougher they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything about . Thanks , Uncle . Wait ! " Hatcher held up a forbidding hand . " Do n't tell me I 'll understand all these advantages better when I 'm older ! I want to ask you something that maybe you can answer more practically . When I was going to tell her I had n't believed she 'd set her damn lawyer on my father , why did you yell Shut up ! ' at me ? " " I only whispered it , Hatcher . I was careful that she should n't hear . " " I asked you why  --  " " Yes , I know . " Mr. Linley 's manner had once more become apologetic . " I do n't wish to increase your feeling that I take a somewhat uncharitable view of her ; but the truth is , Hatcher , she 's rather sharp in her own interest . " " Yes ; so you once told her , I believe ! Go ahead . " " Yes , Hatcher . She 's possibly almost too sharp where her money 's concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance . I 've been a little uneasy for some time ; and last Sunday your mother came to see me in the morning and  --  well , I need n't go into it ; but she might as well have told me she was in fear of Sarah . I heard your father and Harry being pretty strenuous later in the day , and when poor Harry took himself off that night the whole thing was only too suddenly clear to me . Of course for anybody who knows Sarah it 's plain what suspicions Harry 's death would intensify in her and what she 'd do about them . She 's always been rather too ready to think somebody 's cheating her . Apparently that goes with such a nature as hers , Hatcher . " " Does it ? I suppose when you were telling her the other things you told her that , too ? " " No , I 'd said enough , I thought . I 'm explaining why I had to tell you to cut the reference to your father , Hatcher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to even up scores with people , and she seemed to have gathered from you that your mother and aunt were n't in the habit of admiring her  --  " " Thanks for keeping me reminded ! " " I 'm sorry , " Victor said ; " but it 's unfortunately pertinentto your inquiry . You see , she had that injury  --  the unfavorable opinion held of her in our family  --  and alsop259the fancied old and new slights from myself to brood upon . If you 'd come out with it that there 'd been a shortagein her account with your father and Harry  --  " " If I what ? " Hatcher half-choked . " Why , my God , it would n't have been telling her anything she has n't alreadypractically guessed ! She 's had her lawyer notify Father he 's got to bring the account to her house tonight . She 'll know it then , wo n't she ? " " No , " Victor said . " I do n't want to be hard on her ; but I 'm afraid she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us in any way she can . Well , we 're all safe from her ; but if you 'd given it away to her that there 's been a shortageshe 'd at least have told it all over town pretty ruinously . Since you did n't say what you intended , she ca n't . " " Why ca n't she ? " " Because there is n't any shortage , I ! atelier . She 's in for a pleasant surprise , or an unpleasant one  --  depending upon which view of her you take . Another reason I was so rude to you : I thought your father might as well continue to have the benefit of her account . I know her pretty well , and I believe she may see advantages to herself in leaving it with him . Investments are difficult nowadays , and the old firm  --  " " I think you 're stark crazy , " Hatcher said . " Or else you just do n't know ! I tell you they raised everything they could with their last heart 's blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twenty-two thousand , three hundred and sixty-two dollars . It 's all right , Hatcher . Your father has it . " " He has not ! " " Yes . Go in and see . "   6o " I do n't  --  " Hatcher began ; but broke off and pressed through the crackling bushes , moving toward the house . His mother was standing outside the front door , peeringinto the dusk . When she saw the two figures , the taller one ahead and the slighter limping behind , she came running . It was not to her son that she ran ; she swerved round him , and , weeping , threw her arms about her brother . P261HATCIIER went into the house and met Frances in the hall . " I had to go to my friend Bettina Burney 's after school , " she said . " I bet they made Inc on account of Uncle Harry Aldrich 's funeral . Mother and everybody seems to be kind of crying or something around here now , and you , Hatch  --  Why , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do not . Where 's Father ? " " If I promise to tell you , will you play backgammon with me first ? " " I will not . Where is he ? " " In the lib'ary . After he tells you please go somewhere else , the way he did me , then will you come and play  --  " She stared after him , displeased . He was already out of her sight and within the library.  | His father sat writing at the heavy mahogany table ; but set down his pen and looked up at Hatcher anxiously . " Did your uncle get there in time ? " Hatcher dropped floppingly into the chair that stood farthest from the desk lamp . " I get you , " he said . " You mean did he get there in time to keep me from blowing the lid off by telling her I refused to believe she would n't give you time to try to fix up the last of what Harry Aldrich did to her damned stocks and bonds ? Yes . Uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tired man at the desk rubbed his forehead with a thin hand , closed his eyes and uttered a long and heavy sigh . " Well  --  thank God for that much ! " " Yes , for that much , " Hatcher said . " It takes Him to keep me from being an additional curse to everybody . Uncle Victor 's haywire ; he says you 've got the money . Do funny things in his head persuade him he brought it to you , himself ? It would n't strike me as very likely  --  not unless he hurried from the cemetery and held up a bank . " " No ; he had it , Hatcher . " " How could he ? Where 'd he get it ? " Hatcher sat up , leaned forward , and expressed a strong incredulity . " And if he had it , why in God 's name did n't you and Harry Aldrich ask him for it before l tarry  --  " " Ah , that 's hindsight ; but would n't anybody think it ! " Ide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work for his last cent , Hatcher , not even when he 's a close friend or a brother-in-law . That 's one reason . Another is that neither Harry nor I had any idea that Victor 's last cent would be enough . It 's a miracle , you see , that it just covers the hole . Victor 's a reticent man and the truth is I had a sneakingp263idea that maybe Harry was quietly lending him a bit from 1time to time  --  just to keep him going . I have n't a doubtnow that Harry thought I was putting up the little that I , it Victor needed . Another reason is that it was sheer **28;6696;TOOLONG not to speak of the shortage even to Victor . No , as a financial savior Victor just did n't occur to either of us . Pretty horribly ironical to think of , that he 's a savior too late for Harry , is n't it ? " " Yes ; if it does save us , Father . " " It stops her , " his father said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to give up his old way of living , he appears to have done it just in time to have Isomething under twenty-four thousand dollars left in municipal bonds . They brought him in the taxes he 's had to pay on that old nightmare of a house he insists on holding , and just barely enough besides to keep him in his cheap boarding-house . " Frederic rubbed his forehead again ; his hand drooped to his eyelids , and the tips of his fingers remained upon them . " No , even if we 'd known he had it I do n't believe either of us could have asked hint for it , Hatcher . I think Harry 'd have died before he 'd do a thing like that  --  and , as a matter of fact , that 's just what he did . " " So he had it in his pocket , " Hatcher said . " I mean I , Uncle Victor . I ran into him as I was starting to  --  I mean when I started over there . He must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He asked me if hecould be of service to me and I said , You ? Hell , no ! ' " 11 " Yes , he was bringing it then , Hatcher . He 'd beenafraid it would n't be enough , of course ; and when I told him that by God 's own mercy it was , he said it wouldI 11P264help us keep the truth from Eleanor and Dorcy , because Sarah 'd never know it and so could n't tell it  --  and I had to say I was afraid you were  --  were  --  " " Spilling it , " Hatcher said . " You had to say I was over there spilling it . So he came on the run to stop me . You must be pleased to have such a serviceable son . " " But apparently you did n't do any harm , Hatcher . " " No , I was prevented . " His father looked at him gently . " I do n't think you need reproach yourself for a thing you ca n't help . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damned young ? I differ with you . I think I need . Being young , I 'm naturally likely to be harmful . Does n't it follow that I 'd better begin to be old enough to despise myself ? " " No . Self-reproach is n't much use at any age , Hatcher , and the people who ought to feel it seldom do . If any of us is to be haunted by it , I 'm the one . All I needed to do , at the last , was to talk to Victor , and Harry 'd be alive . Why did n't I ? Well , I 've told you  --  but there it is ! You see if I go into the if-I-only-hads ' I 'm lost . If I 'd watched Harry more closely and if I 'd talked to Eleanor  --  in time !  --  and if I 'd done this , and if I 'd done that ! All the ifs ' slid past me , and 1 Larry 's dead and I 'm letting my wife 's brother go flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , the less we dare dwell on the if-I-bads ' , Hatcher . You have fewer of them , being young . " " They 're beginning to be a bit sharp , though , " Hatcher said . " It 's pretty tough on all of us to think we have to accept  --  " " Yes . " His father shook his head unhappily . " Victor had one argument I could n't have resisted even if hisp265others failed with me . He 's always cared a great deal for Harry and Harry 's little family , as he has for us . I knew what he felt when he spoke of his not having understood in time  --  in time for Harry , Hatcher  --  and I could n't answerhim when he said that every suspicion must be met ; and this does it . No one can say now that I taffy 's death was n't an accident , not even  --  " Frederic Ide 's weary voice stiffened in the moment of bitterness "  --  not even Sarah Florian . " Hatcher slumped in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother came into the room just then . " I tried to keep him , " she said . " He would n't stay . He 'd told old George he 'd take him to dinner at a cafeteria . " " Old George ? " Hatcher looked up . " What 's he  --  " " They 're fellow-lodgers , " Mrs. Ide said . " You know where your uncle 's gone to live , do n't you ? " " Yes , he spoke of having left his hoarding-house . Ile mentioned  --  " " He 's where he and I were born , I ! archer  --  the most dreadful house on this earth . " " It looks it , " Hatcher said . " Mrs. Schapp is one of myHis mother had begun to weep again , though quietly . " I told and told him we wanted him to live with us here , " she murmured through her handkerchief . " I told him we none of us could bear it if he did n't come . " " Why would n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other day , " she said . " I told him we were going to have to take in Alice and her children and that I did n't know how we 'd find room  --  and I was complaining of having no maids to do the housework ! Of 66 course he would n't come after that ; but I did n't dream  --  If I could have foreseen  --  " " But at least he ought to 've gone to some better place than that old mess of a Linley house , " Hatcher protested . " Why did n't he ? There are plenty other  --  " " He went there because he 'll not have to pay anything . That awful woman owes him so much he says he could have a room there the rest of his life and just charge it against her debt to him . Do you know how much money he has left now ? " " Well , it must be over a thousand dollars , Mother . " " Yes ! " Mrs. Ide cried . " Enough to take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant if he got sick or died . He meant he would n't let anybody else pay his funeral expenses ! " " Oh , see here , Mother ! Do n't go piling it on . " " He did mean that ! Do n't you know him yet , Hatcher ? When I told him we 'd all work to pay him back he said that if we brought Janey home from college he 'd never forgive us , and of course now , after what he 's done , we wo n't have to write Alice not to come and bring the children , because the business II go on and  --  and  --  " Harriet Ide sobbed aloud . " He 's saved everything but himself . " " Oh , sec here ! " I ! archer became practical and began to remonstrate . " He is n't going to starve . I He 's asked out a lot , and naturally he 'll come here for meals , anyhow most of ' cm . As for where a person just sleeps , that is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part I 'd just as soon  --  " " No , you would n't ! " his mother cried . " Not in that house ! Not if you 'd grown up in it when it was beautifulP267and had dear lovely people happy in it ! Not if every inch of it reminded you of their laughter and their singing  --  and of how they died . What crueler place could a sensitiveman go to  --  because he had nowhere else on earth to go ? What worse torture for him than to see it every minute all about him , dirty and bedraggled and insulted , and with grimy people sprawling and squalling over it  --  " " Harriet ! Harriet ! " her husband groaned . " It 's not forever . We 'll get him out of it . It 's only a loan , you know . Just give us a little time . " " Yes , for God 's sake , Mother ! " Hatcher said . " In the first place , Uncle Victor 's more philosophic than most people , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him back . He 's not going to be there forever . Now , for heaven 's sake , stop crying and listen  --  " " I ca n't ! " " Yes , you can . " Hatcher continued to plead with her and to present his uncle 's misfortune in its best aspect for her solacing , and for his father 's and also for his own . I lc needed some such bracing , himself . The warm and comfortablehouse where he sat was a little shabby , perhaps ; but he had a sense of meanness in remaining an occupant of it when he thought of his dainty uncle as one of Mrs. Schapp 's roomers . Victor 's boarding-house had been pretty tough ; but that blackened old Linley relic down in the smog  --  ! Hatcher 's voice lost conviction , grew feeble ; he decided that he was n't bringing much comfort to his mother or to anybody , and stopped trying . Before him , floating in the shadows of the lamplit room , the beautiful hurting face of Sarah Florian began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle-aged 68 gentleman whose eyes seemed to regard him reproachfully . . . . It was n't late in the evening when Frederic Ide returned from the examination next door . He had n't needed much time to prove that Mrs. Florian 's account with Ide and Aldrich was intact and in order , and that when she and her lawyer would look over her securities with him at the bank , next day , they 'd find nothing missing . " She leaves it with me  --  with the firm  --  as previously , " he told his wife and sister and son when he came into the living-room . He uttered a short sound that was the hint of a dry laughter . " She was openly surprised  --  somewhat invidiously so ! We hold about a sixth of her fortune for her ; I got the impression she 'd have been almost willing to find a little of it gone for the sake of seeing justice done to herself . Her manner was  --  well , call it annoyed . " Aunt Ada glanced at Hatcher ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does she leave the account with you , Fred ? " Ide answered with an increased dryness . " When it came to us it amounted to about five hundred thousand dollars . Harry and I did better with it than with any other  --  incomparably better than with anything of our own . We got it up to over six hundred thousand . That 's where it is now . " Ada began to babble . " And she 'd have had you indicted and tried  --  and I larry died !  --  for twenty-two thousand ! That woman ! She  --  " Hatcher was conscious of his aunt 's voice as it went intoP269more elaborate denunciation ; but the words carried little meaning to him . He was thinking principally of his uncle , Victor Linley , and engaged in a brief calculation . Six times six hundred thousand equalled thirty-six hundred thousand  --  something like four million dollars , then . Hatcher thought of his uncle and old George returningfrom their dinner at the cafeteria and going upstairs in Mrs. Schapp 's rooming-house , through sounds and smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd shut the front door ... and the mahogany railingof the dirty fine old stairway reminding Uncle Victor of all the delicate hands that had touched it  --  Victor 's mother 's hands  --  his dead sister 's handsHatcher rose suddenly from his chair and left the room ; something heavy seemed to be heaving upward within him , from his stomach to his throat . It seemed to be not a substance but a. thought- the increasingly weighty realization that Uncle Victor had saved the Ides and the Aldriches , and the firm of Ide and Aldrich , from ruin and disgrace ; and that there 'd been two ways in which Uncle Victor could have done it . Uncle Victor 'd had a choice . He was really a sentimental man , sensitive and highly susceptible to the torture of old memories ; and yet , without hesitation , he 'd chosen that haunted wreck of the home of his fathers  --  Mrs. Schapp 's roominghouse  --  inpreference to Sarah Florian . P270W HEN Hatcher came back to the livingroomhis Aunt Ada was there alone . She was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireplace , but had no difficulty in perceiving his instinctive movement to retire just after he stepped through the doorway . " No ! " she said commandingly . " You 'll come all the way in , if you please . I 've a thing or two to say to you . " He advanced a hesitant step or two . " I was only looking for something , Aunt Ada , and  --  " She came forward . " You have n't apologized to me , Hatcher . " " I have n't what ? " " You have n't apologized for the language you used to me this afternoon . " " When ? "  | " When you screamed and swore you 'd prove that woman next door a traduced saint and me a slanderer . Just before you galloped off , raving , to tell her what your mother and father and I thought of her . Have you forgotten the terms you used to me ? I should think that underthe circumstances the least you 'd feel is that as a gentleman you owe me an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head . Of the scene to which his aunt referred , his memory now brought him only semblances of explosion and concussion , fireworks in his head . He had indeed forgotten the terms he 'd used to her , and also the worse ones she 'd used to him . " Well -- all right . I 'm afraid I was excited . I apologize . I beg your pardon , Aunt Ada , if it does you any good . " Ada 's severity was n't eased . After long suppressions , old wrongs and new burned within her ; and , once this heat had burst into expression , she could n't turn the damper upon it . Hatcher had been a partisan of the enemy , and , even though he now stood helpless , he could still be punished for having been of the wrong party . " There are one or two things I want to tell you , young man , " Ada said . " I imagine you remember I once informedyou that your uncle was never in love with that woman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe that once he was . You 'd be very much mistaken . Nobody was ever in love with her  --  nobody ! For a while they just got caught ; but it never lasted long , because they could n't help seeing what she was  --  and that 's all that happened to your uncle . Nobody with any sense would call it being in love . I told you the truth . Do you understand ? "   " I 'd rather not talk about it , Aunt Ada . " " No ! " she returned shrewishly . " I guess not ; I should think you would n't ! Not when you think things over and look about you and see what you 've done . " He was humble . " What I 've done ? " " Yes ! What you 've done to yourself , for one thing . " Aunt Ada was never much given to relenting , and her emotions were now well out on an unlimited spree . " At the supper table last Sunday evening you may recall I warned you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did ? " he asked blankly . " No , I do n't  --  " " What ! You do n't remember my telling you that you 'd better change your manner or Dorcy 'd be wondering what was the matter with you ? Well , you did n't change and she did more than wonder . Oh , no ; you would n't listen to me ! Just gave me a black look for my pains ! And before that unpleasant evening was over , she knew perfectlywell what was the matter with you . Breaking your neck to get to that telephone the way you did ! You think Dorcy did n't see why ? Of course she did ! So did everybody else . I suppose you understand that now , do n't you ? " " I do n't even understand what you 're talking about , Aunt Ada . You need n't tell me , though . " " Oh , need n't I ? I suppose you saw what Erdvynn Wilsondid this afternon , did n't you ? " " I do n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's how it looked then , " Aunt Ada said . " It looked as if you did n't care . When Dorcy and her mother were going to leave the cemetery , Erdvynn Wilson left the rest of you and went to Dorcy and talked comfort/ingly to her and helped to put her in her car  --  while you just stood there . I suppose you were thinking about how soon you could get back to that woman next door . Well , you know better now ; but I can tell you  --  look out ! All these things you 've done are going to count against you with Dorcy Aldrich ; and you need n't expect they wo n't . " " I do n't expect anything , Aunt Ada . " Hatcher 's tone was as lifeless as were his attitude and facial expression ; Ada , still on her spree , was n't getting much satisfaction out of him . He might as well have been a piano upon which she had an uncontrollable urge to play a particular tune ; but the keys would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , so you do n't expect anything ' , hatcher Ide ? " She tried to mimic the flatness with which he 'd spoken . " You do n't expect anything ' , do n't you ? You wo n't put that over on me , young man , so do n't waste your ! treat h . You do , too , expect ' ! Your head 's probably so full of happy-ending movies you think you can treat a girl like Dorcy as you 've treated her and then be taken back . I think you 're mistaken ! Dorcy would n't any more let a man drop her for a creature like Sarah Florian and then come creeping back to be welcomed home and get his bruises all petted up  --  she would n't do it any more than I did , myself ! A good many things have changed in these modern days ; but I think you 'll find that girls have n't entirelylost their pride . No , and there 's another thing you may have to take into consideration  --  " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just about ! " she said triumphantly . " Dorcy 's got to take care not only of herself now but of her mother , too ,  | 74 has n't she ? You 've been setting her quite an example , have n't you  --  showing your preference for driving about town in French limousines ? " Hatcher turned abruptly toward the door ; but as he left the room his overwrought aunt called after him . " You 'd better look out ! When you go to pay your call of condolence at the Aldriches ' you may find Erdvynn Wilson there before you ! " ... When Hatcher paid his " call of condolence " , the last afternoon of that week , Ada 's prophecy was fulfilled . He and Erdvynn Wilson said hello to each other gravely , just outside the front door ; then Erdvynn went on toward the car he 'd left in the driveway , and Hatcher did n't need to ring the bell , for the door had not quite closed . Dorcy opened it wider . Her face looked thin ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always hated mourning clothes , " she said , as she took Hatcher through the doorway at the right  --  not into the room where stood Harry 's closed piano . " He would n't have wanted us to wear black  --  he 'd have abhorred it for us  --  but I ca n't persuade Mother . I 'm afraid I 'll never get her out of it . You wo n't mind if I do n't go and ask her to come down ? She 's going to be pretty shot for a long time , I 'm afraid . Wo n't you sit down , I ! archer ? " " Thank you , " he said , sat , and felt queer . She took a chair facing him ; and , with her eyes downcast , folded her hands in her lap and sat looking at them . He 'd never seen her do anything like this , and felt queerer . " You 've been very kind , Hatcher , and Mother told me that when you came I must be sure to thank you for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grateful to youP275for staying so long at the telephone . I 'm afraid it was very tiring for you . " " No , no ; not at all , Dorcy . I was only too glad to  --  That is , I mean I  --  " " Everyone has been so kind , " she said . " The whole town loved Harry , and the letters have been pouring in  --  so many from people he 'd helped and Mother and 1 'd never heard of . It makes us even prouder of him than we always were . " Hatcher 's heart was wrung . " Yes , of course you 'd be . Yes , of course everybody loved him , Dorcy . He  --  " " There 's something I want to straighten out with you . " Dorcy did n't seem to hear Hatcher 's murmurings . " I 'm afraid you may have thought I 'd got a wrong idea about something , partly because of how foolish I was , being frightened that night I sent for you to help me find him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened - you may have thought that Mother and I were afraid he 'd  --  that Harry had  --  I ca n't say it . in the shock , at first , we  --  we were tormented by ideas that maybe something was terribly wrong downtown and that your father was keeping something back from us ; but since then he 's showed us that the firm is n't even bankrupt , so we know now that we never needed to have the dreadful thought about Harry hanging over us . " " No  --  of course you need n't  --  " " No , " she said . " I want you to know what a blessing it 's been to be certain it was an accident . I want you to forget it if you ever thought we might have imagined that it  --  that it was n't . " " Yes , I will . I did n't really think  --  "
