By FREDERICK TISDALE 1-1 T year it was revealed that Vincent Astor , present head of the Astor dynasty , was quietly unloading some of his New York properties . He sold an apartment house on Park Avenue , a downtown office building , loft properties in Manhattan 's midsection , and storage structures on the West Side . It was even indicated that the Vincent Astor home , an awesome pile on East 80th Street , might change hands , since the owner had simplified his life and his servant problems by moving to an apartment . Since it was plain that more relinquishments were coming , the move provoked much civic excitement . The sales were widely noted , because Vincent Astor i.e no gilded dreamer , but a shrewd operator , alert to changing trends and values . Some hoped that Astor was only shedding a few unnecessary headaches because he had become a commander in the United States Navy . The real explanation was diplomatically phrased , but had a hard core . Astor let it . be known that , while he intended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had decided to diversify . Hereafter , instead of depending on rentals from rich New Yorkers , he was going to pick up outlying properties suitable for chain stores and other businesses catering to mass buying , and pay more attention to tenants in the middle-class-income brackets . Since his friend Franklin D. Roosevelt and his New Deal followers were decentralizing established industries and populations , cities favored thereby would be considered in future Astor purchases . The Vincent Astor sales followed a summer during which New York 's strident mayor , Fiorello La Guardia , bewailed the tribulations of his town and besought help from Washington . While Los Angeles 213Called Pittsburgh roared and Detroit hummed with war production , New York struggled with serious unemployment . While nearly every other big American city wondered where it was going to house its war workers , New York counted more than 70,000 empty apartments . Hearing these things . visitors joked about New York becoming a ghost town . The mayor 's lament showed that New York 's shortcomings from a war standpoint were numerous . Primary defense contracts for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heavy industries , such as the makers of automobiles , locomotives , electric equipment and other bulky machinery . New York is the biggest manufacturing city of all , in terms of numbers employed . But its normal total of 26,000 factories and 592,000 workers turn out consumer goods and luxuries that are among the first to be hit when the shooting starts . Many of the workshops on which New Yorkers depend for jobs have been progressively restricted on materials as the war demand absorbed more and more available supplies . Hence the big town , which manufactures 7.6 per cent of the country 's peacetime total , got only about 4 per cent of total war contracts . New York is a city of small businessmen . Detroit has only seven out of every I00 workpeople in plants employing fifty or less ; New York has forty-seven out of every 100 in these small plants . Since New York 's metal products are apt to lean more to art than utility , its shops have trouble meeting the precision demanded by the Army and Navy . New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the vast new munitions and airplane plants were built within the Rocky Mountain and Appalachian barriers to reduce the threat from enemy bombings . Mayor La Guardia 's entreaties have brought some additional war contracts to New York . They reduced the city 's jobless from 400,000 last summer to around 250,000 at the beginning of the year . But this quarter million is still one sixth of the country 's total unemployment and represents by far the worst situation of all the big towns . New York 's new governor , Republican Thomas E. Dewey , appointed a special committee to wrestle with the city 's troubles before his inauguration , remarking , " There are ten million square feet ( about 230 acres ) of idle factory space in New York City and thousands of idle machine tools in critical war-production categories . " Mr. Dewey added that a large number of small businesses with facilities suitable to the war effort " are slowly dying for lack of either materials or opportunity to produce goods needed by the nation . " The obvious question was : Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are needed ? That has been tried . Henry J. Kaiser recruited 2000 men for his West Coast shipyards , who departed . PHOTOGRAPHY BY SAM FALK chanting . " We 're off to see the wizard ! " Larger migrations have been stymied . One barrier is housing . By next summer , Buffalo will need 40,000 to 50,000 people for new war jobs . But there , as in many other localities , the question is : Where would the newcomers sleep and eat ? Another barrier is the fact that New Yorkers hate to leave home . The needle trades , dominated by the International Ladies ' Garment WorkersUnion with 300,000 members , is the town 's biggest industry . Largely because of New York 's higher wage rates , a huge percentage of contracts for war clothing has gone to near-by states and to the South . But men and women in the metropolitan needle trades prefer to stay put and hope for aid from Washington . They like the excitements and : advantages of New York life and they want to remain under the protecting wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A partial solution of the jobs-versus-housing question is found by war workers who live in New York and commute to the bursting production centers of New Jersey and Connecticut . It is estimated that each weekday 85.000 laboring men going to work in New Jersey pass 75,000 white-collared Jerseyites streaming in to desk jobs in New York . Other thousands of white-collar commuters converging on the Grand Central Station encounter an additional 8000 New York war workers outbound ' for Connecticut , some going daily as far as Bridgeport . Still other New Yorkers travel to war jobs on Long Island . The simplest solution is to bring war orders and war activities to New York , regardless . President Roosevelt has ordered that this be done . The city now enjoys a somewhat more generous helping of the war gravy through subcontracting . Transfer of Federal13 offices has been especially welcome , since idleness among professional and office workers has been acute . Federal tenants now soaking up business-building space in the city include the Home Owners ' Loan Corporation , the Wages and Hours Division , the Employees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branches of the War Production Board , the Office of Price Administration , mail censorship and many Army and Navy offices . It is estimated that the Federal Government now rents 10,000,000 square feet of space in New York buildings of various categories . Such emergency benefits and the feverish spending of war crowds give New York a temporary , if slightly hectic , flush of prosperity . " Sorry , full up " is a common remark of hotel-room clerks . Desperate visitors have used taxis for sleeping places . The Gay White Way of the George M. Cohan era is n't white any more because of the dimout , but it is plenty gay . Soldiers and sailors of the Allied nations swell the shadowy promenade . Bars are packed to suffocation in the evening . War workers increase the patronage of night clubs and such-like sucker traps , where many a seventy-five-cent drink is lifted by hands dark with honest machine oil . Over two dozen legitimate theaters compete with the movies , and business is so insistent that the misanthropes in the box offices have resumed their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and forgetfulness , not merchandise . A look at the retail section of Fifth Avenue will disclose what the Greater New York Taxpayers Association meant when it reported , " Many stores have been vacant for upward of seven years and were formerly occupied by prominent shopkeepers and merchants who conducted thriving businesses and paid large rentals . " There are numerous small-shop vacancies on Fifth Avenue between 42nd Street and 59th  --  once considered the richest retail market in the world . Tiffany 's famous old building on Fifth Avenue at 37th Street found no takers when the jewelers moved up to 57th , and is now being used by the Red Cross . Retail business in New York is perhaps worse off than in any other big city . While department-store sales in this district were up 7 per cent for the first eleven months of 1942 compared to the same period of 1941 , the increase for the whole country was 12 per cent . The slump is especially severe in luxury goods . The same goes fur luxury services .

" Von Klinschmidt  --  that 's your man 's name  --  would have fooled almost anybody . His flawless English , his chance meeting with Chief McGinn and his going with him to the night club aided in his deception , and was evidence of extreme daring and cleverness . Even the hospital people would n't have been suspicious if he had n't spoken German during his semiconsciousness . " Andy gulped again . So did Boh . The commander 's brows wrinkled . " Where he obtained the uniform he wore , we do n't know . We 're still checking on it . And how you boys saw through him , I also do n't know . Tell me , will you ? " He was too young , " Andy blurted out . " He was too young , sir , to be wearing a Mons Star ribbon . " " Mons Star ribbon ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hack in the last war and hat guy was n't even born then . And it was right in the middle of the second row , so he did n't just stick it on to show off . " Somebody handed the commander a khaki tunic . He let his eyes flow over the rows of colorful ribbons and passed it on to the officer at his right . " So you rightly figured that if his decorations were wrong , then there was something wrong with him . Well , nice going . Darn nice going ! And , boys " ? he suppressed a grin ? " keep up with your jujitsu . It seems a handy thing to know . " Bob 's face likened itself to a very ripe tomato . The commander said , " We are sending Von Klinschmidt to London for further questioning , and we are including you in the escort party . A few days in London wo n't he hard to take , eh , boys ? " He paused . Andy was feeling quite like a hero . It could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have , if Bill McGinn had let him keep his date with Norma . And anyway , he had known that something was cockeyed about the guy . He glanced about MANHATTAN HEADACHE ( Continued from Pogo ) 3 ) An inquiring reporter approaching the New York sky line these days notes several significant facts . First is the disappearance of peacetime shipping . Except the room , his eyes coming to rest on Chief McGinn . The chief grinned sheepishly . Andy grinned back , and he was suddenly inspired . Ho faced forward . " Could I ask a favor of the commander ? " he requested . " What is it , Smernis ? " " Chief McGinn knows more about handling prisoners than we do , sir . So , if it 's okay with you , Bob and me would rather the chief went to London instead of us . " Commander Wilberglanced up quickly . He looked surprised . " Is that your wish , too , Warman ? " Bob swallowed twice and nodded . His mind had come to a standstill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the commander , still wonderingly . " Very generous . " Ten minutes later Andy and Bob were strolling along the quay toward the 183 . Andy said , " Look , remind me to collect that two bucks from Red , will you ? " " Sure . But , Andy , " Bob said in a bewildered voice , " why 'd you want to let the chief take our place ? We could 've had fun in London . " Andy flicked him with his eyes . " Even yet you have n't learned to be sharp . Even yet you have n't . If we went to London we 'd be gone two or three days , would n't we ? " " Sure , we would . And ? " " And even if Norma is crazy about me , " Andy broke in , " I do n't want to keep her waiting any two or three days before she sees me again . " " I 'll het you could , though , " said Bob . The bewilderment was gone ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupil nt the feet of a master . " I 'll bet if you wanted to , you could keep her waiting four days . " " Yeah , " Andy agreed . " Specially " ? he halted and lighted a cigarette ? " apccially if I 'm here and the chief ai n't . So I 'll tell you what let 's do . Tonight , right after chow , I 'll get Norma , and another girl for you , and " Boh took a step backward . His eyes were suddenly wary . " But do n't get Gertrude , " he said apprehensively . " Do n't get Gertrude , Andy ! " for a few small steamers in their dirty gray war uniforms , slips where the big liners once docked are deserted . Here is one cause of unemployment , and the apprehensive citizen wonders to what extent this traffic will ever return , since the luxury ships may be sunk by the time the war ends . ( Continued on Pope 75 ) A ( Continued from Pogo 72 ) In Manhattan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has backfired , as far as the men who worked on these towers are concerned . Many of them are jobless . New York has 40 , - 000 idle in the construction industries , and there wo n't be anything for them until war restrictions are removed . The forest of New York skyscrapers stands rankest in the Wall Street district at the lower tip of Manhattan , and uptown from the Thirties to the Fifties . These two architectural thickets are largely interdependent . The broker or speculator who made his money downtown spent it uptown . He and his family patronized the smart shops , the theaters , the Stork Club  --  and other hot spots . An Astor apartment house in the midsection might be his home . But the downtown boys are not buying many $3000 mink coats or $5000 bracelets . Wall Street has come upon lean days . Brokers ' offices are almost deserted , and so are the gold-plated lobbies of buildings in the financial district . To cut expenses , some of the strong brokerage firms remaining take in the washing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookkeeping department does the paper work for the smaller ally . and the two aid each other in smelling nut business . Employees forced from jobs by such necessities or those whose pay has been reduced are a focal point of unhappy labor relations . The fade-out of brokerage firms has sorely diminished demand for space in the elaborate office buildings . numbers of which were finished after the blight of 1929-1930 . The U.S. Army and Navy are paying $1.50 a square foot for office rent in these embellished follies . Since rates for this type of structure should be $2.25 to $2.50 , it becomes all the harder for the Actors and other competing landlords to negotiate profitable leases . Wall Street money always has been important to Broadway , since the successful speculator celebrated in theaters and night clubs . or gambled some of his winnings on financing shows . Right now Broadway is going great guns in spite of hard times in the Street . It 's the war . When that stimulant is removed , show business , night clubs and allied entertainment industries probably will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downhill ever since the movie came into its own . The threat to Broadway was intensified by the advent of sound movies in 1929 . This development opened to the movies the field of musical shows . Thereby New York lost another of its interesting monopolies  --  the writing and publishing of music , the unique activities of Tin Pan Alley . Cohan and other sentimental Broadwayites mourned the degeneration of the theatrical district . Saddest example of all is 42nd Street . In the old days it was reserved for fine theaters and lobster palaces . Now this same stretch of 42nd Street consists of flea circuses , hot-dog stands , pineapple bars , automats , poolroom entrances and third-run movie theaters . The full impact of such shifts fella finally upon real estate . Property owners blame Mayor La Guardia for not solving their difficulties . The argument over whether La Guardia 's lack of sympathy for business and his preoccupation with national affairs have driven pay rolls out of New York rages unabated . Hizzoner 's violent and erratic retorts keep the ruction going . Being the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though many of his difficulties were handed down by former administrations , and others are the result of economic change . The refugee rich are an illustration . In the last few years many families living on investments fled to other states . where taxes and living costs were less burdensome . In the good old days the Mau who made his millions in distant diggings looked forward to the time when he would move to New York and live in suitable splendor . First , New York mansions were undermined by the servant problem or the advantages which the automobile gave to country living . Then , as city taxes and the Federal income tax began to bite nearer to the hone , there was a stampede of Manhattan moguls into near-hy Connecticut and Pennsylvania , because here , unlike New York , there was no state in ? come tax . New York 's boom of the Twenties not only built ton many apartments , office buildings and lofts but these structures were too large and Ion de luxe . The apartment of the late Arthur Brisbane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven to ten rooms each , which have been rented . But the alterations were made before the Government put a limit of $1000 to the amount that could he spent on a single building , which means that the other euper.dooper de-luxers must remain so for the duration . Underlying the long-standing row between Mayor La Guardia and property owners is the tax burden , The hive , ' .. owner in New York pays a base tax rate of $2.79 for every $100 of assessed valuation . Special levies increase this in each of the five boroughs , actual payments in Queens Borough reaching $3.15 . Taxes can be tempered or intensified by adjusting the assessment on which they must be paid , and it is on this point that New Yorkers are yelling bloody murder . The state constitution requires that city borrowing must be kept within a certain percentage of assessed valuations . La Guardia 's critics charge that he protects the municipal borrowing power by the simple trick of hiking assessments on property . Some months back , a landowner got so mad about overassessments that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ governor . Commented the mayor , sadly , " If , by removing me , assessments could be brought down , I 'd say ' Amen . ' " La Guardia complains at lowered assessments which are yearly gnawing away at the city 's income from its major source . From a total valuation of $19 , - 616,000,000 in 1932 , there has been a decrease of $4,900,000,000 , or about 25 per cent . Owners complain , in turn , that it is necessary to resort to costly court suits to force justified reductions . Records of the Real Estate Board of New York show that sale prices during the first eleven months of 1942 amounted to only 65.3 per cent of the assessed valuations .
