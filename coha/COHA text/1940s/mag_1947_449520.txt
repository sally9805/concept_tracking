IF on many years the ties of business have com- pelled me to take my fishing holidays when rivers are at their lowest ebb . Invariably I am met with the comment , " The river is at its lowest in the memory of man . " Faced with the alternative of not fishing at all , or trying to find a way of enticing the fish to come to the lure , I set about experimenting with various means and modes . In assembling these notes , which are the result of decades of low-water fishing , I have endeavored to avoid the pitfalls of dogmatism . One of the charms of salmon angling is the wide scope it affords for discussion ; and if we can not always agree with each other 's theories and practice , we can at least concede that a salmon caught in dead low water gives greater satisfaction than a dozen taken in a flood . By " low water " I mean a river that has been deprived of rain for so long that it is reduced to a minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ margins stand out in startling relief like the bones of a starved cow . Places where one would normally look for fish either are dry or have become sluggish deep pools . Rivers which are fed at their heads by large lakes arc better able to stand up to drought than are those solely dependent upon springs and contributory streams . In normal water anyone can catch salmon ; indeed , the salmon catch themselves . In low water the angler has to do the work himself . In good water , anyone who can get a fly out a few yards may look for sport . The current will soon straighten out the most wobbly lino . Then the fishing of the fly is automatic . In high water , sometimes called " duffer 's water , " the veriest tyro is quite likely to catch a bigger fish than the experienced angler . Further , the much larger hooks used in high water permit harsher treatment of a hooked fish , with more certainty of landing him , than is permissible with the tiny hooks used in low-water fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , it is essential the angler be able to put out an accurate long line . It is astonishing how many anglers expend substantial money and time in visiting salmon rivers without first learning to cast properly . They miss nine tenths of the real joy of fishing . How often do wo see anglers proudly exhibiting their catch , when the fish were really hooked by guides . It is true the anglers played the fish ; but , at the best , that is a purely mechanical process in high water . They missed the thrill of the pull as the fish fastened . If anglers who are deficient in casting skill would only put themselves in the hands of a professional teacher for three or four hours , they would find their enjoyment and satisfaction in fishing increased beyond belief . Salmon are unpredictable . On some days they will come to the fly like tigers , and on other days will refuse your most insidious lures . At the best of times they are sporadic takers . That they are very susceptible to weather , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach of a thunderstorm usually puts them down . On the other hand , I recall exciting sport in a raging thunderstorm ? exciting in more ways than one , for it is no fun playing a fish with a wet lightning conductor in your hand . Salmon often take well the clay before rain , and the first inch or two of a rise of water seems the best of all . One may hear anglers lamenting a falling ba ? rometer , absence of cloud , too low cloud , bright sun , too hot , too cold , and so on , ad infinitum . Fish are caught under all conditions of barometer , temperature , water , and weather . The most theo-retically unfavorable day will sometimes turn out most prolific of sport , while what looks perfect may result in a blank . Had I the power to control the weather , I should specify for low-water fishing a beautiful fine day , the sun shining brightly in a blue sky , the trees and mountains ( if any ) reflected in the water . Under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river even if the sport should be unexpectedly poor . Fishing in the rain is at best a miserable pastime . The rain waterlogs the line , making it almost impossible to keep it afloat , while the slack , or " shoot , " refuses to run out through the rings . I have rarely had sport in continuous , heavy rain . Perhaps age makes one reluctant to take one 's pleasures sadly ! From 10.00 to 12.30 is usually the best time of day , but so many fish are caught at any hour of the day that it is futile to try to form any reliable forecast of when the fish will take . To get sport the angler must be at the right pool at the right time , and the golden rule for successful fishing is to " keep your fly in the water . " Late evening fishing can bo tantalizing . Fish may be showing themselves all over the pool , and yet refuse to take . Even in ultra-low water , late in summer , fish will " run " directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen in the dusk is probably clue to running fish , which are non-takers . In dead low water , salmon and grilse move about much more than is generally supposed . In extremely clear water , like that of the Gas rivers , in which every fish can be clearly seen , it is astonishing to find how the fish content of a pool will alter in a few hours . In some pools , fish tend to drop back into the almost streamless deep holes , to emerge later for aeration in the running water . This movement of fish may explain why an angler , confining his activities to one pool , and lashing the same water for hours without a rise , will suddenly hook a fish . This is very noticeable in rivers where , by reason of gross overcrowding , an angler in a canoe may only have a few yards of pool in which to fish . There have been theories advanced as to the influence on fish of the relative temperatures of air and water . Some claim that fish will not take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of the air . One can only retort that fish are taken when the water feels like a hot bath . It may be admitted that , generally speaking , overheated water is certainly not conducive to free rising , particularly in regard to salmon . On the other hand , in some rivers , grilse rise freely under these conditions . If fish are in the mood , they will riso to a fly no matter what rules and regulations the angler may make for his own amusement . If fish are not in the mood , they will ignore the fly even when conditions exactly comply with the angler 's ideals . On the whole , it would appear wiser to ignore man-made rules and regulations for the behavior of fish , and to hope for the best . More often than not , the angler will be surprised at the results of the clay 's endeavor , be they good , bad , or indifferent . 2 MEM are many misconceptions among anglers regarding fishes ' senses . Scientists tell us that fish can not hear in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they have organs which are very sensitive to vibrations . Loud talk or shouting is likely to be inaudible to a fish , but the noise of a carelessly dropped anchor or the crunch of the metal-shod end of a canoe polo is doubtless heard by fish in a pool . It may be better , when approaching the lie of the fish , to use the wooden end of the polo when maneuvering for position . It must be further realized that sound travels farther in water than in the air . While we do not seem to know much about powers of communication between fresh-water fish , it is known that many sea fish are provided by nature with special sound-making devices which they use for communication with one another , particularly at breeding time to call the shoals together . Some fish , like the grunt , make a noise by expelling air from their air bladders ; others make a noise by rubbing one surface against another . Horse mackerel and some of the triggerfish produce harsh noises by grinding their teeth , while others make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sound made by the drumfish may be heard by a person standing on the deck of a ship , fifty feet above them . From these facts it seems reasonable to suppose that salmon can communicate with one another and possibly utter a warning of impending danger . The sight of fish is much keener than most people realize . Any deep-sea fisher who has seen a school of dolphins starting to " hurdle-race " some four hundred yards away from a trolled lure , which one of them strikes with unerring accuracy , will appreciate the distance fish can see through clear water . In the upper waters of the Wye , in the autumn , when the water was clear and low , I have often seen a pike start off across the wide stream to meet the lure he had seen many yards away . Sahnon see a submerged fly , in clear water , a very considerable distance away . Fortunately for the angler , a fish 's vision of what goes on above the water is limited to a very confined " window , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating fly has to be drifted almost directly over him if he is to see it at all , For the same reason , a salmon is very unlikely to be able to see the angler , or his rod , or anything that is his , other than the line , leader , and lure as they pass directly above the fish . Should any angler doubt these contentions , let him sit quietly by the side of a stream where a shoal of salmon fry are swimming around looking for food . Let him shout as loud as possible , and the fry will take no notice . Lot him wriggle a stick or the point of his rod in the water : the fry may come to see what it is all about . But if the angler stamps heavily on the bank margin , he will see the fry dart away in evident alarm . They received the vibrations through the water . It is interesting to surmise how it is that salmon , or any other fish , are able to make tremendously fast and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to a few inches , without colliding with a rock . Fish are provided with sensitive nerves , supposed to be located near the central line , and are given radar-like warning of obstructions in their path . It is supposed that blind fish , inhabiting caves or underground rivers , owe their existence to this sense . Fish not only use their bodies and tails for propulsion , but are greatly helped by jet propulsion . This is effected by jets of water squirted from the gill covers during respiration , and plays an important part in driving the body forward . This method is probably always brought into play for high-speed traveling , and assists the muscular action of the body . The jets reach their maximum strength between the flexures of the body , and are so timed that the motions of the fins do not got in the way of the jots . A particularly powerful jot is usually expelled when a fish begins any swimming movement ? in flying jargon , a " rocket-aided takeofT . " By holding down tightly the gill opening on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposito one , the fish may make the most abrupt turns . Why does a salmon take a lure ? The only rational answer is : " Because he thinks it is something to cat . " On many Canadian rivers , salmon and grilse may be seen regularly feeding on stone fly and other insects , and I have seen them take dragonflies struggling on the water . If , as some still maintain , a salmon never eats in fresh water , whatis he doing with a worm in his mouth ? Those who have killed a large number of salmon on the worm will ask why , if the fish thought of some other reason to take it , the worm hook has to be cut out of his throat . Once , in Scotland , I argued on this thorny subject with the acknowledged greatest authority on salmon , who was an intransigent advocate of the non-feeding theory . At two o'clock in the morning he got up , saying , " I 'm going to bed . Salmon do not feed in fresh water , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for you , or you would never catch one ! " So , with this delicious scientific epigram , one may leave this perennial subject of postprandial discussion . 3 limu has changed our ideas in regard to salmon tackle . Fifty years ago my proudest possession was a Q0-foot split bamboo rod . What a wonderful weapon it wash And what a terrible polo to carry over your shoulder , in a strong wind , from pool to pool ! But it did the job for which it was do-signed , that of driving out a 4/0 fly into the tooth of the early spring gales encountered on the British rivers . ' rho fly was tied to the end of a tapered triplex leader , of immense strength and thicknesS , fastened to a lino of corresponding proportions . Up to twenty years ago , we habitually used a 1U-foot rod in high water and never loss than a 12-foot , fl=inch weapon in low water . This latter rod would still be my choice in big water when using large flies . Lighter rods are put to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fly into the teeth of a strong wind . There is a tendency today to go to the other extreme , using rods so light as to handicap the angler seriously except under the most favorable conditions of wind . Further , such light rods will carry only very light reels , which do not , in my estimation , afford the flexibility , length of line , and speed of rewind which are necessary at times when dealing with wild fish . In low-water fishing we are primarily concerned with casting very small flies , fitted with very small hooks which would be too readily pulled out of fish by heavy rods . When I am fishing rivers which require only short casts , my favorite rod is a single-handed 9-foot , 6-inch one which possesses greet casting power and carries a reel with a capacity of 30 yards of line and 100 yards of fine silk backing ? enough for most emergencies . For large rivers , whore in low water there is eon- siderablo distance to be covered , I use a 10-foot , 0-inch double-handed rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or water when fishing wet fly or dry , and is not too severe on a hooked fish if properly handled . A double-handed rod always seems less tiring to handle when casting or playing a fish . The essential factor of the line must be that it will float properly under all conditions of casting . A fine which drowns on the slightest provocation is bettor scrapped immediately . Nylon lines , when new , float well but , from my limited experience of them , soon begin to fail in this respect , and have to bo discarded . Tho explanation would appear to be that nylon is extremely elastic , whereas the dressing applied to it has a lesser coefficient of expansion and , consequently , cracks rapidly . For durability I prefer the tapered silk lines , which float very well and , if properly looked after , have a life of several years . To protect a silk line , it should be stripped from the reel at the end of the fishing season and hung up in a dry , dark cupboard . Light seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on their dressing . Sometimes one comes across a line which is twisted , and the slack " shoot " forms into loops which invariably foul the reel when casting . If this is not an inherent fault in the manufacture of the line , about which nothing satisfactory can bo done , a twisted line may be straightened by pulling it over a grass meadow or up the rapids of a river . In either case , one must , of course , remove the fly and loader before dragging the line . The " torpedo-head " line is delightful to cast and is likely to improve the distance of most anglers . The weight is all forward , and the line goes out like a rocket . Its only disadvantage would appear to be that the lino can not be reversed , as in the case of double-tapered lines ; therefore , its life is only half that of the latter . But lines are so inexpensive an item in the general cost of angling that this expense may be ignored . Because flotation is such a vital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential to use a satisfactory flotant . Cerolene and solid paraffin wax are both excellent . There may be other preparations with which I am not familiar . When fishing is over for the day , always run the lino off the reel , together with any wet backing , onto a line drier . To got satisfactory flotation , next morning , it is essential that the lino be thoroughly dry before greasing . If the night or early morning air is foggy or damp , do not leave the line outside on the porch , where the damp air can get at it . The day 's sport may be ruined by lack of thissimple precaution , if it results in the line 's not floating properly . Putting grease on wet lines is disastrous ; they sink worse than over . 4 LBADERS may be of nylon or silkworm gut . Having heard so many lamentations from other anglers over fish they have lost because nylon knots broke or came adrift , I have decided to stick to my old reliable gut . Whether these casualties were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . It required the lapse of time occupied by World War II to debunk the plea of tackle dealers to " buy fresh leaders " each year . Receiving the bulk of my tackle , which had been laid up in England since 1938 , I found a large number of leaders dated 1936 , 1937 , and 1938 . I discovered them to be ( in 1946 ) far better than any I could acquire now , They had been stored in the original transparent envelopes in which the makers had packed them . One of these antiques accounted for fifty-two salmon and grilse before being discarded because of wear and tear . Some thirty years ago , when I first began to experiment with low-water salmon fishing , I tried 4X trout leaders , and two 9-foot leaders knotted together to give 18 feet of gut in the water . Now I never , under any circumstance , use a leader longer than 9 feet . I can say positively that it is unnecessary so to do . The use of these ridiculously long leaders adds to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason the landing of a fish . A steady deterioration of the leader results from chafing of the point by fish being played . This has , for safety 's sake , to be cut out and the leader gradually shortened . Towards the end of the normal life of a leader I frequently find myself fishing with only 71 feet of gut . I have never been able to see any difference in the behavior of fish when I was using so short a leader . With two flies , the effective length of the leader , above the dropper , is only 44 feet , and certainly salmon do not take exception to that . There is no need to handicap yourself by using unnecessarily fine leaders , which are a menace . In dry-fly fishing , where an instantaneous strike has to be made , one is too apt to leave the fly in the fish . In any type of fishing , no matter how skillful you may be , you can not prevent a salmon from rushing downstream , then turning upstream , and thoroughly drowning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loader will not stand this treatment . I consider IX , if an angler wishes to fish very light , the finest gut permissible . But it is unnecessarily light , and is sure to spell disaster sooner or later . For low-water fishing in general , there is nothing to beat the tapered 7/5 leader . It has great strength and a point fine enough to pass through the eye of the smallest hook , and stands up well to the shock of dry-fly strikes . ' rho fact is that , within wide limits , salmon ( unlike trout ) do not care in the least what length or thickness of leader you put over them . They simply ignore it . Gut leaders must , of course , be kept thoroughly wet . This should be the rule during the whole fishing life of the leader . A solution of at least 25 per cent glycerin and water should be in your damper . Do not dry out loaders at night : keep them wet . If you knock off fishing for lunch , leave the leader in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is drying at the same time . Keep old ends of leaders : they can be knotted together to serve another life . Keep new leaders away from light . Always carry a spare wet leader . A fish may cut the leader , or even the running line , on a rock edge , and it is annoying to have to wait while a new leader soaks . In traveling in a canoe between pools it is advisable , if the distance to be covered is at all far , to trail the leader in the water so that you can start fishing the next pool with a properly soaked leader . ( No doubt the nylon enthusiast will comment that with nylon no damping is necessary . ) The reel is an important unit of the outfit and should be of the simplest , most reliable construction . Self-winding reels , and those fitted with gadgets , are better left alone . On the 9-foot , flinch rod I use a reel with a diameter of 31 inches , carrying 30 yards of line and 100 yards of backing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reel 4 inches in diameter , carrying 40 yards of line and 110 yards of backing . Avoid overcrowding a reel , but at the same time mount sufficient line and backing to fill the drum fairly . As a fish takes line , and consequently reduces the effective diameter of the line pack , great additional stress is thrown on the backing because of the accelerated speed of rotation . Any deep-sea fisher knows what this means . When a marlin has stripped a quarter mile , the angler reduces the drag , or disaster may follow . The same applies , to a lesser extent , in salmon fishing . It may be pointed out that a salmon running at 30 miles per hour will cause the reel drum to rotate at some 8500 revolutions per minute when the effective diameter is 8 inches , but when the effective diam ? ter is reduced ( by line stripping ) to 2 inches , the reel will be making more than 5000 revolutions per minute . In low-water angling , set the drag very light . It should be only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other piece of fine machinery , the reel must be kept clean and well oiled . After fishing in rain , always dismount your reel , dry it , and thoroughly lubricate it . When you are putting a reel away after the season is over , always reduce the drag to a minimum to ease the tension on the spring . Drags left on , at high tension , through the off season , may be permanently weakened . 5 Foot low-water fishing with wet flies , it is almost impossible to use too small a fly under all ordinary conditions . In over half a century of salmon fishing I have , like most anglers , acquired an enormous collection of salmon , sea trout , and other flies . True , many of them are only suitable for high-water fishing and are lovely to gaze upon . For present-day use I rely on two flies only : the Logic and Blue Charm . If the fish will not take these I might as well give up , although I usually try other patterns in desperation . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I suspect that different-colored flies may present different shadows , silhouettes ? call them what you will . What is of the utmost importance is the size . Just why a salmon will take a 4/0 in high water and a No. 12 in low is one of those mysteries . In this connection , I had a remarkable experience , one July , when fishing a Highland river , in which I usually used a No. 10 fly in low water . The pools were full of fresh-run fish which utterly ignored my small flies . In desperation I mounted a I/O silver gray , to be rewarded with six fish in quick succession . For two weeks this fly accounted for a substantial number of fish which continued to ignore the small flies presented to them . I can not think of any credible explanation . I have tried this experiment many times since without getting any result . What hooks are best ? When we are using very small flies , the hooks are necessarily tiny , but we have the choice of three types : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double . Any one of them will lose a substantial proportion of fish hooked . Salmon will sometimes readily take the smallest trout flies , but the No. 16 hook with which they are fitted simply moans the loss of 80 per cent of fish hooked , when the fish jump . It is perhaps hotter to have hooked and lOst than never to have hooked at all ! That substantial losses will occur must be expected . On some days , one seems to lose more fish on singles , and on other days on doubles . Probably , in the end , the double No. 10 hook is the better holder . Long , low-water hooks are provided with a short dressing , and fish do not seem to mind the projection of the hook . Indeed , at times it seems that a long hook is actually an attraction rather than a deterrent . 6 A. TYPICAL low-water pool consists of three sections . At the head is the fast water , or run . Tho run gradually tapers away to smoother water with a fair current , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an almost motionless deep hole , or to shallows . Starting right at the head of the fast water , the high-water angler may feel at home . There are three axioms for low-water fishing with a wet fly : 1 . The line must float throughout its whole length . The knot , where it joins the loader , must cut the water visibly . 2 . The fly must be fished square across the stream , so that it passes as nearly as possible at right angles to the direction in which the fish is lying . 3 . The fly must move rapidly all the time , from the moment it alights in the water . It is impossible , on paper , to lay down rules for the speed of drag . The amount of acceleration may vary with every cast . As a rough guide , try to imagine the river in perfect order and try to got the fly across the pool at the speed you estimate it would travel under such conditions . The run , at the head of a pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fly is coining round at the proper speed . Careful watching of the knot will indicate to the angler if it is . There are sometimes whirls and eddies in a stream which so manipulate the line as to bring the fly almost to a rest . This must be corrected by drawing the lino with the hand unoccupied in holding the rod . Except in unusually fast water , it pays to draw the line across a stream . On the other hand , in very fast water , in which the fly is obviously tearing around too fast , the fishing speed must be reduced . This can be accomplished by casting the fly more downstream , or by " mending " the cast by throwing a loop upstream directly the fly reaches the water . This latter method is also useful when fishing across a rapid stream into a stream of much loss velocity . This " mending " the cast permits the fly to fish the slower water properly , and often proves effective at the moment the swifter intermediate current suddenly takes hold and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start fishing in the shallow water at the very head of the stream . Salmon and grilse are frequently taken in extremely shallow , fast water ; salmon will lie , and take , in eighteen inches of water . As the angler proceeds down the stream in which the current is becoming less , he must increase the rate of drag by drawing in the lino quicker . Ile should be careful to fish out each cast into the " straight " and let the fly hang a moment before picking it up . Salmon , particularly grilse , often lie at the edge of fast water , and have a habit of following a fly around , across the stream , to rise to it at the very moment the angler lifts it ; therefore , fish out every cast . When fishing from a canoe , in midstream , do not neglect the short cast . Try the water all around the canoe with a very short line and pull the fly back and forth across the surface of the water . Fish will come from under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there is a breeze downstream , " dap " the fly by alternately raising and lowering the rod , so that the fly jumps on and off the water surface . Having exhausted this method , start fishing with a very short line , which may be gradually extended until the whole width of pool is properly covered . Never neglect short-line fishing . A fish rising to a fly without taking it is known as a " short rise . " Some anglers will say " the fish missed the fly . " Now it is very doubtful if a fish ever " misses " a fly by accident . He is much more likely to miss it on purpose . Something , at the last moment , excites his suspicion . How are wo to deal with this fish ? The fact that the fish rose at all shows he is a potential " taker . " Sometimes it is almost impossible to rise a fish a second time . Such fish are known as " oncers . " Anglers differ on how to deal with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others recommend that the same fly be presented again immediately . In high water , the rule used to be to present a fly two sizes smaller . This is excellent advice in low water when you are using , say , a No. 8 and change to a No. 10 . But when you are already using a No. 12 , you are unlikely to be able to present , usefully , anything smaller . Under these circumstances , it is well to try a low-water long hook , with very skimpy dressing , in place of the double hook you were using when the fish rose ? or vice versa . If he still refuses the alternate wet fly , try a dry fly over him . Owing to the amount of labor that is involved in getting salmon to rise at all , it is worth while to spend some time over a fish that has shown an inclination to rise . Except when you are dealing with a risen fish and have plenty of water in front of you , I consider it waste of precious fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . Generally speaking , a fish will come to the wet fly at the first cast and very rarely to subsequent casts on the same water . On the other hand , if you are restricted as to water , you have no alternative but to duplicate casts . If there is plenty of water open to me , I fish a pool down quickly but very thoroughly , covering every inch of water , and then move to another pool . Fish are often taking in one pool and not in another ? exploration often pays well . In low water , the glide at the foot of a pool , when the current is still good , but on the surface of which is no ripple , often holds a number of fish , which can sometimes be taken more freely than in the run . In this class of water , the ' draw must be greatly increased so that the fly is working swiftly across the current . It is of paramount importance to have the whole length of line floating on the water and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If any portion of the line sinks or is waterlogged , it will prove fatal to success . If the line is not sodden , a few false casts through the air may correct it ; but if this proves ineffectual , the line must be thoroughly dried and greased . Sometimes fish will come to a fly which is cut ting the surface of the water , but as a rule the fly should be just submerged . If the leader is greasy , through being handled by greasy fingers , it is likely to prevent the fly from sinking . This can generally be overcome by giving tho line a sharp pull as soon as the fly alights . Sometimes glides exist at the head of a pool just before the water breaks into a rough stream . This is usually good taking water , particularly at the very point where the glide ends and the stream begins . Fish love to lie with their tails just on the sill , and are often free takers there . Fish , particularly grilse , may sometimes be seen lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way from a recognized pool . These are worth a square cast , rapidly drawn across their noses , and afford an angler occasional satisfaction in extracting a fish from what looks like an impossible situation . 7 As I pointed out previously , fish move about a pool ? some days , or part of a day , fish will be found on tho right side of a pool , and at other times on the left . At times they will be in the run , at others out of it . Every part of a pool should be thoroughly explored in order to find the taking fish . If fish are known to be in a pool , and decline to rise , try approaching them from different angles and with different rates of draw . In dead low water , one is most unlikely to be drawing too fast ; it is far more probable that the fly travel is insufficient . Try increasing the rate of draw . Some anglers always wave their rods up and down in the supposition that this imparts a jerky movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight line , but on lines of any considerable length , no movement whatever is imparted to the fly unless'tho rod-lashing attains a fantastic degree . Actually it is detrimental , as a rule , to good fishing . A fish may take the fly as the rod point is being lowered , and consequently fail to fasten . Never , under any circumstances , strike at a fish you see rise to your wet fly . Wait until you feel the pull and then just tighten on him . There is no excuse for leaving a wet fly in a fish when he rises . The tiny hooks will fasten , as well as they are likely to do , through the weight and friction of the line . Striking at a rise will probably result in a fish 's being pricked and put down , possibly for clays , or the fly will be taken away from him before he has it in his mouth . There is one strange type of rise , particularly from grilse , which I have never been able to understand . You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , when suddenly you see the lino being drawn away towards the fly . No sign , or break , of a rising fish can be seen . When this is observed , tighten instantly . The fish has apparently sucked in the fly , an inch or two below the surface , without showing any disturbance . It is a weird performance . Rising fish do not always mean to take the fly . Apparently they intend to drown it and , in consequence , get foul hooked ? sometimes in the " face , " sometimes in the tail , and often in a ventral fin . And what a time-wasting performance it is playing such fish ! Large salmon , at times , amuse themselves by hurdling the floating lino , a tantalizing experience . Anyhow , it shows how little danger a fishing line convoys to a salmon ! " Coming short " may be due to the fish or to the fly . On some days , these short rises are a nuisance , and nothing you can do seems to overcome theta One must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and are simply making passes at it . On the other hand , coming short may be due to the fiy . Most shop-dressed flies are too full and take much bettor after having killed a number of fish . A No. 12 Logic I used last season accounted for over fifty salmon and grilse , and was killing fish freely at the end , with only a few turns of silk left on it . It was noticeable that with this skimpy fly there were few short rises . It is well worth frying the special long low-water hooks , with very short , skimpy dressing , on short-risers ; they sometimes work miracles . Fish coming short to a wet fly may frequently be taken on a dry one . The grilse has always been a great favorite of mine . He is , weight for weight , the bravest and finest fighter that swims . In Canadian rivers the grilse runs rather small , averaging a little over throe pounds , with a four-pounder considered large . In a Scottish river I fished many seasons , the grilse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pounds . Grilse often lie apart from salmon , and are frequently taken so . When working out the and of a cast , I always make a point of fishing for them . In rivers like the Miramichi the grilse abound in thousands ? many a day in August , when the salmon have been reluctant to rise , has given delightful sport by the capture of six or more grilse . A grilse is , of course , no different from a salmon , except that ho has passed less time in the sea . The aquabaties and acrobatics put up by a sporting grilse remind me , in miniature , of those displayed by a marlin , and when I lose a grilse which has fought so gamely for his life , I can not help feeling he deserved his freedom . Grilse take just the same small wet flies as do the salmon , and the presentment of the fly is exactly the same . Grilse will lie , at the head of fast water , in scarcely depth enough to cover their dorsal fins . Tho @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their elder brethren . Like salmon , they may refuse to rise all day , except for an hour or so , and then take greedily . To encourage others to try the methods I have endeavored to describe , I give the following extracts from my fishing log for part of August and September , 194 ( 3 , on the Miramichi in t he lowest water " in memory " : ? Only days on which four or more fish were hooked are recorded above . In forty-two fishing days dead low water ) I hooked 133 fish , with only roue blank days in the whole period . There had been no rain since May , and the volume of water flow-ing through the narrows was that of a brook . Tho Miramichi is a very broad river , but most of the pools arc exceedingly shallow in low water . Rarely is there more than three or four feet when the fish take .
