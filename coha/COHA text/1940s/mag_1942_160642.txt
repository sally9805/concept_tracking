" America wants Victory-not the closed shop . " With this headline in full-page newspaper advertisements last week the National Association of Manufacturers attacked the attitude of both the War Labor Board and organized labor . A.F. of L. President Green and C.I.O. President Murray cracked back that the N.A.M . ' s position really was : " We want the open shop-even at the expense of victory . " The old row was on again . <P> Labor 's stand : N.A.M . President William Porter Witherow had " broken faith with the President of the United States , " was " trying to crawl out " from under the industry-labor pact , which would arbitrate all disputes-including the closed shop . <P> Mr. Witherow 's answer : Industry had never agreed to arbitrate the closed shop . <P> The War Labor Board 's comment : Mr. Witherow and other industry representatives had pledged themselves to " accept the President 's direction for peaceful settlement of disputes . . . . " <P> At that long , stormy industry-labor conference last December , industry had wanted a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end-made part of the pact . President Roosevelt rang down the curtain just as the show got hot , accepted a three-point peace formula agreeable to all , ignored the closed-shop ruckus . <P> But even though President Roosevelt reassuringly proclaimed that " the Government of the United States will not order , nor will Congress pass legislation ordering , a so-called closed shop , " industrialists were far from satisfied . The N.A.M . glared stonily at the War Labor Board , watched for a suspicious twitch in any direction . <P> Last week N.A.M . thought it saw that twitch . WLB had settled two disputes ( Walker-Turner , International Harvester ) by ordering " maintenance of membership , " which the N.A.M . believed was a " sweet-sounding " name for the closed shop . <P> To WLB 's way of thinking , maintenance of membership is a compromise : it merely compels workers already in a union to keep on paying dues or lose their jobs ; no one has to join the union , as in a closed shop . The Government-and-labor majority thinks that unions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are entitled to some protection , and that union security stabilizes industrial relations . This formula comes closest to freezing union-industry relations of any yet hit upon . <P> At week 's end WLB brought in another decision , this time in the ten-month-old wrangle at Federal Shipbuilding Co . Their recommendation : maintenance of membership . Federal turned the formula down once before and the Navy seized the yard . Indications were that Federal might turn it down again . If it did , President Roosevelt would have two choices : seize the yard all over again , or kiss WLB good-by as an effective arbiter of industrial disputes . This might be the showdown .
