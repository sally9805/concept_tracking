By the light of the waning moon Rommel made his last-minute preparations . As dawn cracked over the desert , he attacked . It looked at last like the offensive for which the British had waited . <P> The Long Wait . For more than two months General Sir Harold Alexander 's British had crouched along the 35-mile front stretching from the Qattara Depression to the sea . Daily they had made sorties and feints , lashing at Rommel 's advance posts , scuttling back to their own lines to bind their wounds and bat the flies . The flies were the worst . They swarmed over the unburied dead . They swarmed over the living , drove soldiers close to madness , until morale ran out and men prayed only for some kind of action . Now they had it . <P> It was scarcely possible that the Eighth Army had received anything like the reinforcement that Rommel had got over shorter supply lines which the British had been unable to sever . To Rommel from Crete had flown a complete German infantry division - the 146th @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported in the desert were German and Italian parachute troops , and on hand were two veteran Panzer divisions and Rommel 's tough , veteran 19th light motorized infantry division . One estimate of his strength : 125,000 to 140,000 men , rested and equipped . <P> How many the British had was their own secret . Over the tortuous Allied supply lines-by plane across Africa , by ship around Africa 's tip-some men and equipment had reached them , but their losses at Tobruk had been great . Last week members of a U.S. ground crew established camp , raised the U.S. flag over a tiny sector of the desert . Medium bombers flown by U.S. pilots have been flying alongside British bombers for some weeks ; harassing Axis supply lines . The British had superiority in the air before the fall of Tobruk . They probably still had it . <P> The attack began with a tentative push against El Hemeimat , 25 miles south of El Alamein . Early this week it was not clear what Rommel intended or where the main force of his drive would center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to maul Rommel as they advanced , to lash at him in unexpected places-and they probably had a surprise up their sleeve . At best , superior Allied air power would be able to disrupt superior Axis ground power and give Allied infantry , artillery and tanks a fighting chance to turn the tide . At worst , the British would be routed , hurled out of Alexandria and Suez , and the Allies driven from the whole Mediterranean theater.
