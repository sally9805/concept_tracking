txt When Parliament reconvened after its Christmas recess today , Foreign Secretary Sevin announced Britain 's willingness to release the Jewish immigrants of fighting age now held on Cyprus . He also fully and strongly supported the negotiations now going on between the Israelis and Egyptians at Rhodes . This was a deliberate and genuine effort on his and his Government 's part to hold out the olive branch to Israel and to his critics here and in the United States . British officials believe and hope that there will be rejoicing in Tel Aviv and Washington tonight and that even the most extremist Arabs will now realize that they are being left to come to the best terms they can get from Israel . Mr. Sevin likewise indicated that de facto recognition of the Government of Israel was being seriously considered . It was under discussion , he said , and he hinted that there might be a statement on " further steps " regarding Palestine next week . There will be a full dress debate on Palestine in the House of Commons in the early part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . It looked tonight as if Mr. Bevin , by his soft answers , had turned away the worst wrath of his critics in the Labor party and even in the Opposition . A close analysis of his concessions shows that he was not really offering much that turas concrete , or new , but all sides agree that he made a sincere effort to be conciliatory and it is that angle that is being fastened upon in comments tonight . The House of Commons has rarely shown more or keener interest in any subject as the question period drew toward its close . The chamber not only had every seat taken on both sides but many members had to stand . All top members of the Government and the Opposition were in their places when Winston Churchill , who had previously given Mr. Bevin notice , got up and asked if the Foreign Secretary had any statement to make . recent events in Palestine . Mr. Bevin started right off by announcing that - we have been using all our influence , in conjunction with the United States , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Arabs . " It was known that British officials had been quietly but firmly telling the Arabs to get on with those negotiations and to make what terms they could , but this was the first time that it had been publicly stated on behalf of the British Government . However , because of these negotiations , Mr. Sevin declared that there ought not to be a. debate on Palestine until next week . The justice of this view was conceded by Mr. Churchill . The leader of the Liberals , Clement Davies , pressed futilely for a debate this week on the ground of " grave anxiety " over Palestine , felt here and throughout the world . In general it was felt that Mr. Bevin was not only right in waiting but clever as time seemed to be working on his side . Mr. Bevin went on to make his announcement about Cyprus . " It is well known , " he said , " that certain Jewish immigrants of military age are detained in Cyprus . We have been discussing the position of these immigrants with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now arisen has permitted us to send a message to the Acting Mediator Dr. Ralph J. Bunche announcing that we are prepared to allow these men to leave as soon as the Jews provide transport for them . " The official total of these immigrants was later given by the Foreign Office as 11,000 . They were being held under Britain 's interpretation of the United Nations Security Council 's truce resolution of last May 30 against allowing " fighting personnel " into Palestine . However , the carping ones of Mr. Bevin 's critics are explaining tonight that even now the immigrants can be released only if Dr. Bunche or the Security Council , or both , agree to their release . Recognition Hint Indicated " As the negotiations to which I have referred make progress , " the Foreign Secretary said at the end of his prepared statement , " the British Government will carefully watch them and we shall take further steps as may be necessary in hopes of facilitating peace and understanding , and I hope to be in a position to make a further and fuller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken to mean de facto recognition of Israel , and Mr. Churchill , in later questioning , pressed Mr. Berth on the point because he and the Conservative party urge recognition . Mr. Bevin replied that recognition was " under discussion . " " It is not an easy matter , " he continued , " and we can not take one state in an isolated way . There is the question of another part of the world where the question of this de facto recognition has created serious trouble  --  Indonesia * * * And we have been trying to arrive at arrangements on the basis of the United Nations decision . " The question of British reinforcement of the Trans-Jordan port of Aqaba was touched upon by a number of speakers , including Mr. Churchill . The Conservative leader 's anxiety today was expressed in what h4 opponents considered imperialist terms . He aroused appreciative laughter by suggesting that in sending Jewish immigrants from Cyprus to Israel after helping Trans-Jordan , Mr. Bevin had been " reinforcing both sides at once . " Later , he asked the Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we do n't scuttle from it under any threats of mere violence . " Mr. Bevin 's reply to that wary : " I think Mr. Churchill knows that I am almost too fat to scuttle anywhere . " ' Another important assurance that Mr. Churchill asked and received from Mr. Bevin was this : " May we feel sure that the Foreign Secretary will feel under no restraint or impediment from taking any necessary measures to secure the safety and effective action of the troops which he and the Government have sent to Aqaba and that that does not depend upon any other issue than what is considered necessary by the Government ? " Mr. Davies had asked why British armed forces had been sant to Aqaba when the United Nations Security Council asked that this be avoided . Mr. Bevin answered : " His Majesty 's Government took the view that under the treaty of alliance with Trans-Jordan this was a request that we could not refuse in the light of all the circumstances at the moment . No Itroops.have been sent to Palestine and there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council for the action we have taken . " One of the things Mr. Bevin stressed today with exceptional ' emphasis was his belief that only an agreed Israeli-Arab settlement could be effective . " My policy , since I have been in office , " he said , " has always been that this case would never be setItied unless it was by agreement be . tween the two parties . Force on either side wo n't settle it . " At one point this correspondent , who was sitting in the gallery , understood Mr. Sevin to refer to the " Government of Israel " and there was , in fact , some talk about this afterward . However , the British Press Association account of the proceedings does not give this phrase . In any event , a Foreign Office spokesman said it would have been a slip of the tongue . If so , it was one that indicates the line Mr. Bevin 's thoughts are taking . These are conciliatory thoughts and it is confidently believed that they will disarm enough of his critics in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's meeting . The belief has been growing here that the Israeli Government desires friendly relations with Britain . Reports from Tel Aviv are to that effect and today Prof. Selig Brodetsky , president of the Jewish Board of Deputies in Britain , who has just returned from a trip to Israel , expressed his assurance of the Israeli Government 's friendly intentions .
