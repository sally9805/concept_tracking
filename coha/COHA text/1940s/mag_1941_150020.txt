Her hull , rigging and spars sheathed in ice , the schooner Mary E. O'Hara , of Boston , turned tail to the fishing banks last week and headed for home . On a dark night , in near-zero weather , she thrashed into Boston Channel . A numbed lookout in the bow suddenly shouted . Frantically the helmsman tried to put her over , but she was sluggish with ice , heavy with 50,000 lb. of fish in her hold . Next moment the Mary E. O'Hara crashed into a barge anchored off Finn 's Ledge . <P> Out of her shattered fo'c'sle. men scrambled up on deck . Some , trapped below , drowned amid frozen fish , cluttered gear , shattered planking . After the crash , the schooner sheered off ; the barge was swallowed up in the darkness . With the desperate hope of beaching his ship before she sank , Captain Fred Wilson swung her inshore . But the schooner was settling rapidly , nose down ; the water was knee deep on the deck . The nested dories , welded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under them , Captain Wilson and the survivors swarmed up the icy rigging . <P> When the Mary E. O'Hara came to rest on the bottom , twelve feet of her mainmast , five feet of her foremast stuck out above the waves . There on slippery , ice-covered halyards clung more than a dozen of her crew . Some of them were dressed only in the underwear in which they had slept . It was about 3:30 of a January morning . <P> From time to time the lights of other ships passed , but nobody heard the hoarse hails of the men in the schooner 's rigging . After a while one man lost his numb hold , dropped into the black water . Another followed-another , and another . When a man dropped , the others heard a brief thrashing in the water , then silence . One who let go was 60-year-old Mandea LeBlanc , who had hoped this would be his last voyage to the banks . Shortly afterward , Captain Wilson followed him . <P> Just before dawn the trawler North Star , inbound for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mary E. O'Hara 's masts . Five of the crew were still hanging on . One man slipped off even as the North Star hove to alongside , but he was fished out alive . Another , frozen to his perch , had to be pried loose . <P> One other death was added to the toll of 19 when it was learned later that the watchman on the barge had been knocked into the sea by the collision . For Boston 's fishing fleet it was the worst disaster since the foundering of the schooner Eleanor Nicker son , in 1932 , when 22 men drowned in the stormy north Atlantic .
