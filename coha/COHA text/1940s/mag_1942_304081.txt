Suddenly at midweek , Singapore burst into cheers . The British Malayan Command at last threw the Australians into battle . Flippant as ever , the Aussies moved up to the line , through columns of haggard retiring Britons and Indians , in busses marked ' " Tokyo or Bust " and " Nippon Express . " <P> The Aussies were to test in blood a British gamble . Sometime ago the British Command had recognized that it could not hold north Malaya . Its troops were outnumbered four-to-one ( or more ) , out-planed , outgunned , later out-tanked . There were some 1,000 miles of coast to defend , a half-score coastal inlets that invited Japanese saving the Australians for a compact shield of men just north of Singapore . This would stretch Japanese communications through hundreds of miles of Commando-infested jungle , shorten British communications and coastline to the defensible limits of the troops in hand . <P> The Hope . The execution of the decision began with disgrace . At Penang , the British left behind them almost undamaged port facilities and public utilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wharfside . <P> As the retreat went on the British learned to destroy bridges , roads , stockpiles . Commandos were sown thicker behind enemy lines . But the main body still retreated . At some points troops withdrew as much as 50 miles a day in good order . <P> British patience was strained . The London Daily Express called the civilian and military defenders of Malaya " a pack of whiskey-swilling planters and military birds of passage . " The only answer : The Aussies had not yet begun to fight . <P> As last week opened , the fall of Kuala Lumpur was announced coincident with the establishment of a new line 170 miles north of Singapore . Then that line crumbled . Monday , Tuesday , Wednesday , Japanese bombers in 50-to 125-plane batches pounded the city of Singapore . A drenching tropical rain poured down . There was only one island of hope in the dampness : the Aussies were moving up to fight . <P> The Men . The Australian troops in Malaya were like Australian troops anywhere . They had little understanding of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were they familiar with the meaning of fear . When they arrived at Singapore , they pitched pennies to the dignitaries waiting on the dock . Ashore they shouted , drank , swore , rousted Singapore 's residents out of their sleep . When they went into the jungle to train , they groused-but they trained hard and hungered to fight . <P> They numbered about a division . Some of the men arrived just before Malaya was attacked and these green men , many of whom were used to Australia 's dry brushland , had to be accustomed to Malaya 's dripping tangle ; this may have been a factor in the decision to hold them back .
