Radio City 's executive eyebrows , the hypersensitive seismographs of the broadcasting industry , were twitching excitedly . Cinemactor Ronald Colman 's new transcribed show , Favorite Story , was having its premiere over Chicago 's WMAQ . To many a radioman it sounded like an early , diffident mumble of an earthquake that might upset the whole map of U.S. commercial radio . <P> Transcribed shows had Big Radio-NBC and CBS-worried . Big Radio 's power has always rested chiefly on its near-monopoly of famous entertainers . Last fall , Bing Crosby fled the fold . He recorded his weekly show , sold it to 208 ABC stations-and over the head of at least one big network to some of its member stations . Total Crosby stations : 400 . The advantages : Bing can record the show any time he likes , can edit it before it reaches the air . If other big names followed Bing 's lead , the big networks might lose control of their affiliates , might soon be torn apart . <P> Transcribed-show builders last week were smug-sure that Colman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day become a stampede . Although NBC makes transcriptions , at least one energetic independent was ready with staff and know-how to handle runaways . He was hard-eyed , 41-year-old Frederic William Ziv , the producer of the Colman show and the big beglerbeg of the " open-end " * game . <P> The Ziv outfit is currently releasing 23 high-rating open-enders , has 30 crack salesmen retailing them to advertisers all over the U.S. Ziv 's chief sales targets : advertisers who ca n't afford ( or do n't want ) to buy time on a full network . Some of his open-ends are filled in by as many as 80 advertisers on 200 stations . Ziv 's 1946 income : about $7.5 million ; the pickings would be much , much fatter after an earthquake . <P> Ten top radio comedians got on the record , too . The ten : Benny , Cantor , McGee &; Molly , Gardner , Burns &; Allen , Bergen , Amos ' n ' Andy . They formed their own company , Audience Records , Inc. , and this week will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : $4.50 . The records will be banned from the air and from jukeboxes . They are designed , the company pressagent explains , for posterity and such of the living as would like to be the life of the party . So the folks at home will know when to laugh , the records were made with a studio audience . <P> * A transcribed program with blank periods for commercials-so that it can be sold to any number of sponsors . A few Ziv-produced open-enders : the Wayne King , Barry Wood , Kenny Baker , Easy Aces and Philo Vance shows .
