txt While representatives of twenty-six nations stood before their national flags forming a huge " V for Vic . tory " in the White House , President Roosevelt appealed today to the people of Germany , Japan and the conquered nations of Europe and Asia to revolt against their Axis masters for " freedom of speech and religion , freedom from want and from fear . " Mexico and the Philippine Commonwealth formally joined the ranks of the United Nations at the ceremonies in the East Room of the White House as the free nations of all the world joined in a celebration commemorating Flag Day . Mexico and the Philippines thus became the twenty-seventh and twenty-eighth countries arrayed against the Axis . From the President and the representatives of all the nations battling Hitlerism came pledges of a struggle to the finish and a promise of victory over the " oppressors " and the " tyrants " who would destroy freedom . Mexico and Philippines Sign The White House ceremony , the first which brought together representatives of all the United Nations at once , included the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Manuel Quezon , Philippine President , of the United Nations pact of Jan. 1 , which accepts the prin ciples of the Atlantic Charter , pledges each country to use all its military or economic forces against the Axis members with which it is at war , and forbids a separate armistice or peace . The President utilized the occasion not only to strengthen the solidarity of the United Nations , whose goal of the " four freedoms of common humanity are as much elements of man 's needs as air and sunlight , bread and salt , " but to attempt to weaken the internal strength of Germany and Japan , and the nations they have overrun . " We ask the German people , still dominated by their Nazi whipmasters , whether they would rather have the mechanized hell of Hitler 's new ' order or  --  in place of that , freedom of speech and religion , freedom from want and fear , " said the President . " We ask the Japanese people , trampled by their savage lords of slaughter , whether they would rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  freedom of speech and religion , freedom from want and from fear . " We ask the brave , unconquered people of the nations the Axis inwaders have dishonored and despoiled whether they would rather yield to the conquerors , or  --  have freedom of speech and religion , freedom from want and from fear . " We know the answer . They know the answer . We know that man , born to freedom in the image of God , will not forever suffer the oppressors ' sword . The people of the United Nations are taking that sword from the oppressors ' hands . With it they will destroy those tyrants . The brazen tyrannies pass . Man marches forward toward the light . " A high point of the ceremony came when the President read solemnly a prayer written by Stephen Vincent Benet. who appealed to the " God of the Free " to grant us " a common faith that man shall know bread and peace  --  that he shall know justice and righteousness , freedom and security , an equal opportunity and an equal chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lands , but throughout the world . " The message of determination to win the war for a truly worldwide brotherhood of man in peace as well as war went out to all the world in many languages , and was especially broadcast to the men in the United States Army and Navy now serving around the world . The Ambassadors and Ministers of sixteen United Nations , some of them over-run by the Axis , spoke to the people of their own lands in their native tongues , and all gave a message of hope and confidence .
