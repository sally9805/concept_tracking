As he lay awake in his sleeper berth , a New England businessman pondered the problem of reconciling his business and his God . When he got back to Bristol , R.I. , William H. Smith went to his boss ( who is also his brother ) and said : " Business is rather a selfish institution . What can we do that is unselfish ? " He had an answer ready for his own question : hire a clergyman , at company expense , to further Christianity in New England . <P> Maurice C. Smith Jr. , community-minded president of the Bristol Manufacturing Co. ( sneakers and rubber stamps ) , liked the sound of brother Bill 's idea . Last week he announced the appointment of the Rev. Dale B. Button , pastor of Providence 's Central Baptist Church , as " Vice President in charge of Christian Relations . " <P> The new v.p. ( with a salary backed by an expense account which may run to $100,000 a year ) will not be just another " industrial chaplain . " Bristol employees may consult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outside the plant , " to do good as he is led to do it . " <P> Parson Button , 46 , is a forthright , husky man who looks more like a vice president than a clergyman . As he sees it , his first duty- " or , rather , privilege " - will probably be helping out small , impoverished New England churches of all denominations . The good Baptist Smith brothers explain the anomalous Button job thus : " We spend lots of time trying to figure out ways of helping the community and the state . We are employing an efficiency expert in religion just the same as we 'd employ any other efficiency expert . We do n't expect to sell , any more shoes because of our venture . . . . There will be no superior over him to tell him what to do-that is , no earthly superior . "
