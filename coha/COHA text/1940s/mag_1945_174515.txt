To help publicize a new kind of super mink fur ( marketed by the Quebec Fur Breeders Cooperative Association ) , Eleanor Roosevelt went to Manhattan last week and accepted an $8,000 mink coat . Two days later , at her regular White House press conference , the newshens were waiting for her . <P> Asked the Christian Science Monitor 's Mary Hornaday : " I have been asked to inquire whether you consider it a justifiable gift ? " Replied Mrs. Roosevelt : " It was given to me to popularize that particular brand of mink . The gentlemen who presented it asked me to keep it , and I thought it would be ungracious to turn around and give it away . " <P> Eleanor Roosevelt quickly explained that there is no law which prevents a President 's wife from accepting gifts ; the Constitution bars the President . Then she listed some other recent presents . <P> From Ibn Saud she and daughter Anna Boettiger had each received a silk-embroidered harem gown . " We had quite a show the other night , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up to see how they looked . Emperor Haile Selassie had sent a gold bracelet . Then she remembered a jeweled crown received two years ago . She did not remember who sent it , she added , but it was on display at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Library at Hyde Park . ( At the library , the crown , 6 inches high and encrusted with jeweled birds and butterflies , is listed as a gift from the Sultan of Morocco . ) As to the crown , said Eleanor with a smile , she never wears it . <P> Then she was asked about a trip she made to Baltimore to see a new play by Rachel Crothers . Was her trip in conformance with ODT regulations ? Said Eleanor : " I do n't think traveling to Baltimore in a coach displaced anybody . " Besides , the play was about returning servicemen , a subject close to her heart .
