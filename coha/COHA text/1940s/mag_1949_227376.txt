Manhattan 's Mohawk Business Machines Corp . last week unveiled a new wire recorder , the " Tele-Magnet , " which will answer the telephone when no one is home . As Mohawk 's President George F. Ryan explained it , when he leaves the house ( or office ) , the gadget 's owner puts his cradle-type telephone on the machine . When the phone rings , a mechanism lifts the receiver and turns on a phonograph record . The owner 's own recorded voice announces that he is out , asks the caller to leave his message at the sound of a chime . When the owner returns , a meter tells him how many calls have come in , and a wire recorder repeats the messages ( up to 60 minutes of them ) . The wire can be erased and used over again . Retail price : $198.50.
