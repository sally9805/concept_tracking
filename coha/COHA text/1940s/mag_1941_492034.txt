Berlin ersatz food fair .

W ISHFUL thinking dies hard ; there are still enough persons who cling to the hope that the " unsound economics " of Nazism will speedily defeat Hitler . Those many economists who have been predicting the " imminent collapse of Nazism " ever since 1933 still expect that financial collapse , a shortage of gasoline , or other raw-material trouble will paralyze the German war machine within a short time . But a growing number , especially in this country , have swung over to the other extreme since the Nazi successes last summer . They seem to be convinced that there are no economic problems Hitler can not solve , and that Germany could fight a twenty-year war without cracking up economically . Even those who seem to think that Hitler has discovered the secret of perpetual economic motion usually fail to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hitler 's Germany has been arming for almost six years at a rate greatly exceeding that which bankrupted the Kaiser 's Germany in less than two years during the World War . Although mechanized warfare , with its tremendous demands for armaments and machines , had not really started until the spring of 1917 after Germany , by resuming unrestricted submarine sinkings , had ushered in the era of total war -- November , 1918 , found Germany completely broken economically . Her industries were disorganized , her production falling , her currency rapidly depreciating . Modern war is a far greater economic strain than was 1918 at its peak . The development of tanks , airplanes and motorized forces has doubled or trebled the economic requirements of warfare . This explains why Germany , at the very start of the Nazi armaments effort in 1935 , had to spend as much on war material as did the Kaiser in 1917 . And since 1937 , when German armaments production reached a full war basis , the expenditure has never been less than 50 per cent above that of 1918 . How was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present rate , maybe even bettered ? Or will Germany collapse economically , after all ? And what is Hitler 's economic secret ? Actually , there is no secret . The basic principle of Nazi economics has been discussed in a hundred books , pamphlets and articles in Germany . It was given international currency in Marshal Goering 's epigram : " Guns instead of butter " But not manyabroad understood what this principle implied . Goering did not simply mean that guns must have priority when there is not enough productive capacity to produce both guns and butter . He wanted to say that guns are preferable and more desirable than butter , even if there were enough capacity to produce both . Food for Guns First , for Humans Last H ITLER 'S war economy is based upon the prin- ciple that all productive capacity of a country ? its labor power , its raw materials and its factories ? must primarily be used to manufacture war material . A higher standard of living and a high level of consumption are no longer regarded as goals ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them as definite dangers , since good living makes people soft . The main purpose of the Nazi economic machine is to produce all the war material it can produce . Consumption should not be higher than is necessary to maintain the civilian alive and in good working condition . Any production of goods for civilian consumption above that standard is wasteful and unproductive ; it requires labor and plant capacity which otherwise would be free for the production of arms . One of the Naziradicals once wrote that a worker employed in the production if perfume is a greater economic liability than an unemployed man . At least the unemployed worker wastes only his own skill and does not waste raw materials and machines . The Nazis do not , therefore , ask : How much armament shall we need and how much civilian consumption will we have to sacrifice in order to get it ? They try to find out how much consumption they must allow as minimum and how much armament production they must sacrifice in order to satisfy this irreducible civilian demand . " In the democracies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ration armaments and discuss how much of a navy or air force they need as a minimum . We ration the civilian , but set no limit to our armies . " Since 1933 , civilian consumption has probably been halved . Political considerations  --  the fear of arousing opposition  --  were all that stopped the Nazis from bringing down at once all civilian consumption to the irreducible minimum below which the people would lose their ability to work . And to the amazement of the Nazi economists , the civilian population has shown less resistance to sharp cuts in the necessities of life  --  food , clothing , housing  --  than to the attempted elimination of the small luxuries which make ( continued on Page 65 ( Continued from Page 63 ) enough would be substituted the drab helmets that humped behind their shoulders .

He had cleared his eyes in later seasons when big Junkers and Dorniers began to wheel and smoke in the sky above the Firth of Forth bridge . True , Sam had a very had leg  --  had had , for a quarter of a century ? but that did n't prevent him from lying upon a petrol depot rooftop with a pair of binoculars in his hand ?

He shook the paper as Sam himself might have shaken a cocktail shaker , in other years when American tourists sat at the inn . Sam had to take the paper away and hold it himself , before he could read the B. E. F. awards . It did n't seem real . It was too wonderful to be real ; it was like wearing a kilt for the first time , or setting foot first on Scottish soil . It was like hearing again the mettlesome drums of Harry Lauder 's troupe . . . .

The people accepted substitute textiles without much grumbling , in spite of their poor quality , but the German women protested when an attempt was made to limit buttons to four standard colors , white , gray , brow-n and black , in order to economize on dyes . Even though one may still buy a red or a green button in Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite radical . Typical . is the case of a small manufacturer of better-class office accessories , such as paperweights , inkstands and blotters . Though he had a good business , he employed only some forty workers . He had hardly any machines and he used practically no imported or vital raw materials . Yet one day in 1939 he was informed by the government that he would have to shut down . His production had been investigated and found to be unnecessary . Though his shop and tools could not be converted to war production , the skill of his workers could be used to better advantage turning out machine guns . The Nazi theoreticians never cease to point out that modern wars are won and lost on the home front . In the Napoleonic wars , they argue , one worker at home could produce all the materials needed by two soldiers at the front . During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870 , one worker was needed for each soldier in the fighting forces . By ' 1917 each soldier had to have five men in the hinterland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twenty men in machine shops , in railroading , on the farms and in supply services to keep a soldier going . The soldier is thus comparable to the man at the wheel who drives an automobile off the assembly line . If he drives the car into the ditch , the labor of the entire assembly line will have been wasted . But if only one man on the assembly line falls down on his job , even the best driver will have no car to drive away . And just as in an assembly line each step is carefully planned , each motion studied so as to fit . in with the motions of the other men , so , in modern war production , each step must he carefully planned , co-ordinated and regulated . There can be no trial and error in the Nazi system ; nothing may be left to chance , to individual decisions or to the free play of economic forces . To cut consumption , it is necessary for the German government to control the living standard of every citizen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to control and plan every step in armament production . Even the weather is " planned . " At least there is an office for long-term weather predicting which tries to forecast several weeks ahead ; these forecasts are used not only in planning military action but also in deciding upon the dates for sowing and harvesting  --  though with doubtful success , since , as an old farmer once said to me , " They do n't know yet how to put a hailstorm in a concentration camp . " But since men can be sent there , the human factors in economic production have learned to obey . The worker is just as completely under the supervision of the government as the employer , the shopkeeper as much as the customer , the farmer as much as the government official . There are countless organizations controlling every conceivable phase of economic life , all in turn controlled by the Central Economic Council headed by Goering as economic dictator . There is a good deal of truth in the German joke that you can not buy a postage stamp without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works was best shown in the construction of the Hermann Goering steelworks in conquered Austria . When the German troops rolled into Vienna in 1938 , a unit of German army engineers stopped halfways in the sleepy Austrian provincial city of Linz ; they made camp on the shores of the Danube and began at once to dig . The puzzled inhabitants could not make out what it was all about . Nor did they learn much more when suddenly , six weeks after the occupation , 25,000 young men arrived from Vienna , moved into barracks built by the army engineers and joined in the digging . For the young men themselves had not been told why they were sent to Linz . They had been taken off the relief rolls in Vienna , told to say good-by to their families and to he at the railroad station in the evening . Only gradually did it become known that the Germans , long before they actually invaded Austria , had decided to build a unit of the Hermann Goering works at Linz- The Hermann Goering works employ a new process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which abound in Germany and Austria , but which formerly could not be converted into steel . The process itself had been perfected only in 1937 , and the main German plant had not begun to operate when the Nazis began building the new unit at Linz . Yet , although the territory had not been theirs until they marched in and took it , they had surveyed every inch of the ground , had worked out blueprints down to the last bolt , had planned a new harbor and a new railroad statior , to go with the new mill , and knew precisely where each machine and each girder would come from ; they had even decided beforehand which of the young workers on relief in Vienna would be most suitably employed in Linz  --  either because of skill or because of their known political opposition to Nazism , which made it desirable to remove them from Vienna . A few weeks after work had begun in Linz , another 20,000 Viennese workers were sent to other camps to open up the new low-grade iron mines , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany to learn steelmaking . Eighteen months after work had started  --  only a few days after the outbreak of the war  --  the first unit of the new mill was opened with a capacity of 750,000 tons ; one year later . last October , the second unit with an equal capacity was put into operation . But while the steel-producing capacity of former Austria was thus tremendously increased in less than two years , the steel allotted to civilian use in Austria was cut in half . The Nazis stopped the use of steel in private buildings simply by stopping private building . They even forbade steel for toys . German steel-producing capacity was increased by about 60 per cent in seven years  --  from 16,000,000 to 26 , - 000,000 tons  --  excluding the steel-producing capacity of Czechoslovakia . At the same time , civilian consumption of steel was kept at or near the depression low of about 6,000,000 tons . The Nazis thus have a steel-producing capacity of 20,000,000 tons annually purely fur armament and war purposes , which is almost twice as much as Imperial Germany @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany 's autumobile-building capacity has been doubled without any increase in the private ownership of cars . In 1933 Germany could produce about ten to twenty airplanes a month ; at present , her rate of production is estimates as between 1500 and 3000 monthly . Figures un machine tools are unobtainable , but a German official publication once boasted that the Nazis have three times the machine-tool capacity of the Germany of 1914 . The greatest economic effort of the Nazi machine was directed toward the development of synthetic substitutes for industrial raw materials ? formerly imported from abroad . And it is in this field that Germany has achieved most in the past seven years . Of the basic industrial raw materials , Germany produces only two in sufficient quantities  --  coal and zinc . Some others , such as bauxite  --  the ore of aluminum ? lead , quicksilver and sulphur are found in sufficient quantities in countries from which Germany did not fear to he cut off . Now that she has conquered the rich mines in Luxemburg and France and has regained access to the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still remain many vital materials of which no part of Europe has enough . Chief among them is oil , followed by rubber , tin , cotton , copper and wool . And from the first day of Nazi rule determined attempts were made to find domestically produced substitutes for these materials in order to withstand a British blockade . In 1933 , German research chemists had just developed the laboratory stages of new processes to make synthetic gasoline and synthetic rubber out of coal . Today , Germany produces probably 3,1 ) 00,000 tons of synthetic gasoline a year ? German sources claim 5,000 , tai0 . Even that is , of course , not enough . But , it covers a much larger part of war requirements than most experts expected . Before the present war started , foreign observers put Germany 's full war needs at 20,000,000 tons . But owing to the complete elimination of private consumption of gasoline , Germany 's actual needs are probably not much more than 8,000 , - 01 ) 0 to 10,00,000 tons annually for the type of war she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least 30. probably almost 50 per cent of her basic oil needs at home enough to enable her to hold out with the help of Rumanian , French and Czech natural oil production , which altogether might yield another 7,0110,000 tons annually . Bona , the synthetic rubber , fills at present more than one third of the requirements of the Nazi army ; by 1942 it is scheduled to provide almost all of them . In the meantime the Germans make shift by using old rubber over again and by drawing upon the large reserves which they accumulated and those which they found in I I olland and France . Copper has partly been replaced by aluminum and aluminum alloys , with quite good results . Artificial fibers give poor but workable substitutes for cotton and wool . The tin lining in cans is replaced by chemical substanCes similar to those used in Neer cans in this country . And above all , there are countless plastics made from coal , wood , acids , milk ; the German chemical industry is said to have worked out more than 1500 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1918 All these substitutes are more expensive than the natural product , and their quality is usually inferior . Also , Germany does not produce enough of any of them to be able to dispense with imports from abroad . Still , so much progress has been made in substitutes , so much consumption has been eliminated by cutting down civilian use , and so great are the war reserves accumulated before the war started , that Germany today is probably not threatened by " industrial starvation . " There are very serious problems and very serious shortages , but unless British air attacks destroy a large part of the substitute plants , Germany should not ? at least not for a long time - be in the same position as in 1918 , when she had not enough gasoline left to run her tanks , not enough rubber to mount her guns and not enough wool to clothe her soldiers . Nor is there much hope for a financial collapse of Nazi Germany ? at least not for quite a few years . Of course , the Nazis will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finance the armament , but they never intended to . It is openly admitted by Nazi leaders that these loans are just taxes ; they are called loans only because it sounds better . In addition , tax rates have to he published , whereas no one needs to know how much in loans has been extracted from a wealthy industrialist . As long as Germany has enough man power , raw material and plant capacity to produce what she needs to fight the war , she can always obtain the necessary money by expropriation . The Limits of a Machine The German war machine is therefore incomparably stronger economically than it . was in the last war  --  and not . weaker , as so many thought before last summer 's blitzkrieg . Nevertheless , the Nazi economy is by no means shatterproof . It is highly unlikely that there will be economic collapse soon , and equally improbable that economic factors alone could defeat Germany  --  even in a long war . But there are many serious weaknesses and serious strains in the system ; even Hitler has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though the unified , government-controlled armament machine has achieved much , it has not outstripped the achievements of a free , efficient , uncontrolled economy based on a high standard of living rather than upon artificially restricted consumption . It has probably reached the limit beyond which production can not he increased . It has , in addition , completely failed in one of the most important fields  --  agriculture . With all the increase in her steel-producing capacity , Germany , having more than half the population of the United States , produces only one third as much steel as is currently produced in this country . The whole of German-dominated Europe from the Channel to the Russian border has only a little more than 50 per cent of the steel-producing capacity of the United States . After sinking billions into the production of synthetic gasoline , Germany and all the territory conquered and controlled by her produce not more than one tenth of America 's oil output . The present automobile producing capacity of the Nazis twice that of 1933 - is only one twentieth of Detroit 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelming lead in the Old World , theirs is still a nation of limited industrial resources . Industrial production can not be raised much beyond the present peak  --  at least not until the Germans succeed in organizing the industrial capacity of the conquered countries . In Germany proper , consumption can not be reduced much further ; in most of the essentials of life the irreducible minimum either has been reached or is very near . Still , the Germans should be able to maintain the present high level of arms production for a long , perhaps an almost indefinite period , provided they can maintain the present level of consumption . But if available supplies for civilian consumption should sink below the minimum standard at which the people can live and work , the Germans would be forced to cut armament production . That there is today a strong probability that within a few years the supplies of some vital foodstuffs will fall below the subsistence level is therefore the moat real threat to Germany 's strength . To increase Germany 's industrial capacity and to develop substitutes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . Just as important was the drive which aimed at making Germany independent of foreign food and fodder supplies . The industrial program has been largely successful and has accordingly been widely publicized . The farm program has been a complete failure , and , consequently , it is rarely mentioned in the Nazi press . Official farm statistics showing miraculous increases in production are published regularly . But few , even in Germany , take these figures seriously ; one look inside any grocery store must convince even the most fanatical Nazi that the officially reported steady rise in egg and cheese output exists only in Doctor Goebbels ' imagination . Actually , in their food statistics the Germans have taken a leaf out of the Russian book ; they base their figures not on what has been produced , but on what should have been produced according to the official plans . The Achilles ' heel of the German economy is the shortage of meat and fat products . Germany always approached self-sufficiency in breadgrains , sugar and potatoes , but lacked butter , eggs , cheese , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens for her own basic needs , yet she could not even feed what livestock she had , being dependent upon imports of corn from the United States , soybeans from Manchuria and oil cake from the Philippines . It was the Nazi hope that livestock could be increased sufficiently to produce enough high-quality food for all Germany , while at the same time German agriculture could he made independent of foreign fodder supplies . Actually , the Nazis were forced to cut down the imports of fodder even before the British blockade stopped overseas shipments . According to conservative estimates , German livestock today gets one third less fodder than before the Nazis came to power . Other estimates place the decline at close to half . Since cattle , unlike human beings , can not live on promises and on Mein Kampf , both the number and the productivity of livestock have been going down steadily . In the past , the German deficiencies of high-quality foodstuffs have largely been met by imports from Holland and Denmark  --  both among the world 's leading producers of milk , fats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countries might therefore appear to have relieved the pressure upon the German food supply . Actually , the contrary is the case ; the German invasion makes it impossible for these countries to continue to produce the foodstuffs on which Germany depended . For Holland and Denmark were far more dependent on overseas fodder supplies than even Germany was . The Goose and the Golden Eggs With those supplies cut off , nothing is left for the two small countries but to slaughter their livestock . Germany may escape the consequences of this radical reduction of available Danish and Dutch supplies for two or three years . The Nazis confiscated the large fodder reserves which had been accumulated in the conquered countries and shipped them to Germany . They also confiscated all the cattle that had to be killed for lack of fodder . Even the most optimistic German expects no supplies from the conquered territories in the west after 1943 , since by then there will be nothing left of the Danish and Dutch livestock industry . Since there are no other fats and meat supplies available in Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a danger as this slow starvation  --  though a completely different one  --  is that arising out of the very thoroughness of the German economic machine ? bureaucraticrigidi ty . Everything in Germany has to be planned and every single detail has to be coordinated with a thousand others . As in a modern airplane engine , the parts of the machine must fit into one another without any tolerance at all . Yet the parts of the Nazi machine are not made out of steel ; they are human beings . And the jobs which they have to perform can not be decided in advance , once and for all . The Germans see clearly the danger that their complicated machine will fail and break down as soon as it is confronted by tasks not worked out in advance . They try determinedly to reintroduce some elements of personal initiative , to decentralize , to limber up . They have been successful , however , only at the very top ; in Goering 's Central Economic Council there are some men whose work is not scheduled and who are given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal initiative into subordinate organizations has been wholly unsuccessful . Living by the Book The individual cogs in the machine are far too afraid of the personal consequences of mistakes to dare to act without orders . To neutralize this dangerous tendency toward complete automatism and apathy , the Nazi planners have tried to work out blueprints for all possible situations and emergencies ; German engineers have elaborate instructions about what to . du if British bombs destroy part of a plant ? which orders to rush through at the expense of others and which workers to use for reconstruction . But though the instructions are probably excellent , no plan devised by man has ever succeeded in providing for all contingencies . What will happen if the plan should go wrong and if the individual plant manager or railroad engineer has to take a decision for which there are no rules in the hook ? Will he still he able to adjust himself ? Or will he do nothing until he gets his orders from Berlin ? And can such rigidity survive a major miscalculation without serious , even fatal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all economic activity has another dangerous consequence . It has led to hitter fights between the various governmental agencies . Each of these agencies is jealous of the power it wields ; each has its own policy , its own aims , its own political connections . And each of them  --  the Labor Front , the Farm Estate , the Raw Materials Board , and so on  --  is prone to concentrate on that line of action which will be most likely to advance its own cause . In addition , each of the major control organizations in the economic field is headed by a highly ambitious party politician who looks upon his job as a steppingstone to even greater personal power , and upon his organization as his own personal machine . Behind a facade of national unity there is , therefore , incessant warfare . The individual manufacturer or engineer is often caught between two contending parties , each forbidding what the other one orders him to do .

Repeated appeals to the highest party authorities brought no solution , and the man finally saw no other way out than to resign . With 2,000,000 persons engaged full time in controlling the economic activities of other persons , everything is buried knee-deep in paper . Bureaucracy is so rampant that corruption has almost heroine indispensable to efficiency . For bribery is often the only means to obtain a decision from a gov ernment office . " I am willing to pay even to get an unfavorable decision , " a German industrialist once said ; " at least I know then where I stand , and can go back to work .

I may not be logical , but in the clinches I know what 's right for me . " Thank you , Tom , " Arthur said , and for that moment there was real gratitude in his eyes  --  for that moment , and that moment only . He moved quickly toward his car . Naturally , I followed . But he got in and slammed the door practically in my face . " I 've got an important errand , " he said . " Sorry , Tom , but I 'll have to leave you here . " " After I 've stood here and told you about Roy ? " ' You 've had two chances to cooperate with me today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting up the motor . " Hey ! " I yelled . " What do you expect me to do ? " " You might go to the Cunning-hams ' petunia bed , " he yelled back , " and bury that pound of butter ! " He stepped on the gas and was gone . XIII I T WAS a long walk home , and I had plenty of time to think and plenty of things to occupy my mind . I had no doubt now that Brent , on his previous trip to the kitchen , had seen and read the butter message . Then , when the rest of us went there , he 'd come in to watch and wait until the person for whom the message was meant should look for it in the refrigerator . That gave me pause . For whom had the message been intended ? What was the meaning of the five short words ? " Jenny got the wrong letter . " What letter ? What was wrong about . it ? How had Roy , assuming it was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , known about Jenny and a letter ? My mind went back to the old days . Roy had liked Jenny more than the rest of us had . He had n't laughed at Jenny 's pretensions  --  not ever . Was it because he had sensed and admired her real ability , or was it because he had recognized a person with an ambition like his own ? an ambition to achieve financial success at any cost ? This much was true : since the early 1920 's the pair had both been climbing , with single-minded determination , toward certain goals . Now Roy was a fugitive ? possibly a murderer . Jenny Iverson was dead ; she had found her own answer in a fisherman 's shanty when someone put a knife in her back . These thoughts passed through my mind as I walked home . An occasional curious glance was cast my way by the people I passed . But I had something more important to worry about than what Mumford was thinking . I realized for the first time that if we were ever to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we loved  --  Jenny 's death had to be solved . Much as we might wish it , we could n't go on as we were . Jenny Iverson , by the simple act of being murdered , had seen to that . Friendship means the ability of two or more people to find pleasure and relaxation in each other 's company , and that presupposes trust and respect . Where a group must unavoidably suspect that one of their number may he a murderer , friendship can not exist . It was n't a matter of avenging Jenny ; it was just that to live with one another  --  Sally and I and our friends  --  we had to know what had happened to Jenny Iverson and why . I no longer had any desire to duck and dodge . I was now on the side of the law . What I wanted , and all that I wanted , was to hasten the day of revelation . Maybe I could figure out how Jenny had hoped to raise fifteen thousand dollars in Mumford over Labor Day week end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running off to New York to pry into Jenny 's affairs , go through her business correspondence , question her debtors . That was up to the police . I could n't , at the moment , make the dullest guess as to the meaning of " the wrong letter . " I had n't enough evidence to build up a halfway plausible theory . It seemed to me that a logical starting point , in any investigation I might make , was my own home . One thing was certain . Jenny had gone straight from the station to my home . She had stepped into the kitchen and deposited the orchids in the icebox ; she had opened the closet door and neatly cleared a space to receive her bag . It was perfectly possible she had done more than that . A thorough search of the house might even , I thought with sudden excitement , turn up the " wrong " letter . I hurried up the steps at home and through the door , ready to start an intensive search at once . The moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Richard was on his hands and knees on the floor in the hallway , looking under the settee . The lock of white hair fell in his eyes ; his handsome nose was very close to a curl of dust . " What 's going on here ? " I began . Then I saw Velma . She was standing on a chair in the living room , and was peering intently at the top of the ugly old chandelier which our landlord had undoubtedly got as a wedding present . Alice was on her knees in front of the sofa . She had pulled off all the cushions , which lay around her . Sally came out of the coat closet . " Velma thought , " she said , with an uneasy glance at me , " that maybe if we searched the house , Tom ? and very thoroughly  --  we might find something that would help clear up the murder . " I sighed . I should have known that no idea of mine would fail to strike Miss Fix-It first . Velma was an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sobbing from the drawing room next door a few short hours before . She did n't touch my heart at all , as she turned around to look at me from her perch on the chair . " It . seems to me , " she said reprovingly , " you might show some interest , Torn . Ca n't you see we 'll have no real peace of mind until we find out who is guilty ? " " We may have less , " Alice said , " when we do . " That struck a little chill into the searching party . Richard got to his feet and brushed off his trousers . Sally closed the closet door and Alice began to put the cushions back on the sofa . Velma got down slowly from her chair . As for myself , when I started toward the living room I was n't walking fast either . But my step quickened when I saw from the corner of my eye that Richard was coming after me . I did n't want to have even a short talk with Richard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face , that he was anxious to revive the topic of the vanished pound of butter . " What 's your hurry ? " Richard said . " You look worried , Tom . Anything go wrong on your trip ? "
