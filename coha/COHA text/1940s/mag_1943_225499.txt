If an imaginative ten-year-old set out to make a toy gun for himself by hooking two pieces of gas pipe together , he might wind up with something looking remarkably like the U.S. Army 's newest war tool , the M-3 submachine gun , unveiled last week . <P> A stark , crude , unlovely shooting iron , the M-3 is nevertheless rugged , light and easy to massproduce . It coughs out a clipful of .45-caliber pistol slugs , can be fired with fair accuracy at short range ( as with any submachine gun , the closer the better ) . Of all-metal construction , the M-3 weighs less than nine pounds , compared to twelve for the famous Thompson " tommy-gun , " a standard Army weapon whose relationship to the humble M3 " is approximately that of a chronometer to a dollar watch . ( Even in quantity production the Thompson gun costs about $40 to make ; the M-3 is fabricated mainly from stamped parts and can be turned out for something less than $20 . ) <P> Man chiefly responsible for the M-3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his predictions for the new gun , pointing out only that its lightness and ease of assembly would make it a valuable weapon for parachutists . But other officers wondered privately whether the M-3 might not be destined to serve as a " revolt gun , " to be dropped by parachute to the rebellious people of conquered Europe when the time is ripe . Colonel Studler 's gadget will never stir a gunsmith 's soul , but to a despairing Pole . Czech or Dutchman it might look like a rare and lovely objet d'art.
