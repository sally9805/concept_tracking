txt In an almost unprecedented gesture of bipartisan cooperation , the Truman administration has scrapped its original arms export program and presented a new bill to Congress . The new bill contains many vitally different proviisons and drops the " blank check " authorization of presidential powers . The effect was immediate . It reduced tension in Congress over one of the biggest foreign policy steps before the nation . It greatly limited the area of disagreement in the Legislature . It brought quick expressions of appreciation from top Republican foreign policy leaders like Senators Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan and John Foster Dulles of New York . While skirmishes over the program will continue , a new feeling of good will and cooperation has been engendered by the action of Secretary of State Dean Acheson that will affect the temper of the debate . Major Changes Here are major changes in the rewritten bill : 1 . Arms aid is limited to specified countries without the original " black check " clause giving Mr. Truman power to act at discretion . 2 . Aid is limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chiefs of Staff , decides that such transfer would not injure United States national interests . This , in effect , is a veto power . 3 . The new bill carries a policy statement supporting United Nations policies and declaring the United States will not use armed force " except in the common interest . " 4 . A major role is given to Louis Johnson , Secretary of Defense , in determining the " value " of surplus and reserve material . 5 . Permission for the President to shift up to 5 per cent of funds between specified countries replaces the original bill 's $45,000. - 000 of emergency funds for presidential expenditure at his discretion . Senate Hearing Waited All this is in preparation for the start of the big Senate hearings next week at which the Connally committee meets jointly with the Senate Armed Services Committee to consider and prob ably decide the fate of the arms program . Republican Senators Arthur H. Vandenberg of Michigan and John Foster Dulles of New York express gratification at the conciliatory White House attitude , though declaring still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut far below the original request . The official attitude is made known by Senator Connally . " Nobody insists that the bill ca n't be modified by Congress , " he says . " This bill came up as a working paper and was not in a mandatory form . We 're going to get a bill pretty promptly . " Two Victories Gained Meanwhile , the ding-dong battle over the bill for foreign economic aid continued its laborious course through the Senate with the administration winning two big victories and seeking a third . The administration has knocked out two " crippling " amendments from the huge bill which includes Marshall Plan funds . One of these would have earmarked $1,350 , - 000,000 for export of surplus American farm goods , another would have allocated $50,000,000 for Generalissimo Francisco Franco 's Spanish dictatorship . A return engagement on these two amend-mends is promised , but under the present parliamentary situation , they require two-thirds majorities to be inserted in the appropriation bill , which they are unlikely to get . A third amendment has caused the administration leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France unless French Morocco stops alleged discrimination against American businessmen there .
