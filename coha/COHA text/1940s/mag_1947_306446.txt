MY DANISH FATHER ( 255 pp. ) - Karl Eskelund-Doubleday ( $2.50 ) . <P> Eighty-five years ago , Schoolmistress Anna Leonowens ( Anna and the King of Siam ) went to Bangkok to spread the blessings of " the English language , science and literature " among members of the royal family . It was more than half a century later when young Dr. Niels Eskelund arrived in Siam from Denmark . <P> Anna 's influence had all but disappeared . From Dentist Eskelund , who became " royal tooth puller " to the court , the Queen demanded a set of false teeth-black , because she chewed betel . But when he commanded her to " open the royal mouth " she refused , finally consented with the understanding that he would not raise his head above her own . Crouching , the young Dane maneuvered his tools into the " foul interior " of her mouth , stood clear while she spat betel juice into a golden spittoon . When it was over , she asked him about his love affairs . He replied by recounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her new teeth . <P> Life with Olla . Papa Eskelund 's real affairs are told in this book , prised out of him by his son Karl , with the help of some good stiff drinks of a Guatemalan liquor called olla . As the story of a wayward parent , My Danish Father is a lineal descendant of the family-chronicle light biography ( Papa Was a Preacher ; Mother Wore Tights ) . Son Karl , a lanky , amiable onetime United Press correspondent in China , made the best-seller lists 18 months ago with a variation on the theme called My Chinese Wife . In My Danish Father , he has mixed a frothy mortar of sex and exodontia . Readers are likely to find Dr. Eskelund 's love affairs ( he was thrice-married , had many mistresses ) less picaresque , however , than his adventures in oral hygiene , although there were times when it became hard for the dentist himself to distinguish between them . <P> As royal tooth puller , Eskelund was one of the few foreigners allowed inside the " forbidden city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , languished thousands of doe-eyed beauties of royal blood . Papa told Karl : " When I entered their quarters with my foot drill and instrument box . . . a whole flock of them immediately came running to greet me with a come-hither smile full of promise . " Later , when the young dentist scaled the betel off the teeth of a native girl in Bangkok , he unwittingly started a fad for gleaming teeth . He was soon swamped with " shy little Siamese ladies " in search of the smile of beauty and the smile of health , who took up so much of his time that he trebled his price . <P> Elephant Rumbles . Between extractions and fillings , Eskelund carried on a romance with a half-caste native girl named Oolong , went on elephant hunts ( " You must stand still . . . until you hear the rumble in the elephant 's belly " ) , drank Haig &; Haig with the King . Later he moved to Shanghai , where he built a prosperous practice among the Chinese by knocking 10% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge ) . When his son went out from Denmark to join him in 1935 , Dr. Eskelund 's prestige was already high . Said the sign of one Chinese practitioner : " Dr. Chu , Dental Surgeon , former chief assistant to Dr. Eskelund , former dentist to the King of Siam. "
