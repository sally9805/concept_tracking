True Picture <P> Sirs : Despite TIME , despite the able work of U. S. newspaper correspondents here , the good people of the United States still do not seem to have a true picture of Britain today . <P> There has just arrived at my house a parcel from California containing : 2 Ib. tea , Ib. gelatine , 8 Ib. sugar , 2 Ib. cocoa , i Ib. powdered milk , 3 Ib. dried fruit . <P> The cost of these , according to the customs declaration , was $4.88 . U. S. postage was $3.32 . Customs dues at this end were 45 3d . <P> So that the senders obviously believe that people over here are hungry . And the senders are well-read people , deeply interested in European affairs . <P> Here is our position : the 2 oz. per person tea ration is small for some people , and there is talk of its being increased , but we have tea left over ; we have sugar to spare , in addition to the extra allowed for jam making ; gelatine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like ; and milk-people with children wo n't buy as much as the Food Ministry want them to have , even at the under-cost price for children . <P> . . . But I do believe you will be interested in the conditions of an ordinary family . <P> WILLIAM J. BRITTAIN Marlow , Bucks , England <P> Best Wishes <P> Sirs : <P> Who are these so-called " neutral " military observers who frequently pontificate in your footnotes ? Are they the same false prophets and professional propagandists who told the American people that the French Army was the best ( sic ) in the world and that the Maginot Line was impregnable ? Wow they tell us that the riff-R.A.F. pilots are superior to the Germans and Italians TIME , Aug. 19 . Whence comes this sudden superiority ? <P> With best wishes for a speedy British defeat ! Gott strafe die schmutzigen Englander ! <P> EMIL ADLERMANN New York City <P> &gt; " Neutral military observers " are soldiers of neutral countries , who sometimes make mistakes but have the benefit of professional knowledge . Is Herr Adlermann @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> As a white officer commanding colored combat troops in the first World War , I have read with interest your article in the Aug. 12 issue of TIME relative to the 369th Infantry ( colored ) New York National Guard . . . . <P> The 369th was a fine outfit , and I do not wish to detract from its record , which was outstanding . I was a Company Commander in the 371st Infantry made up of drafted Negroes from the South . I respectfully challenge your statement that : " With one exception their battlefield record negro combat units was not so good . Exception was Harlem 's 369th . " <P> The 371st Infantry ( colored ) , the 372nd Infantry ( colored ) and the 333rd French Infantry ( white ) with French Artillery combat trains , etc. , made up the 15 7th French Division , commanded by General Goybet . I quote from a message sent by him on Oct. 1 , 1918 to the Colonels of the American Regiments in his Division : <P> " Your troops have been admirable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the courage of your officers and men , and I consider it an honor to have commanded them . The bravery and the dash of your regiments are the admiration of the Moroccan division and they are good judges . <P> " Thanks to you during these hard days the 15 7th division has always shown the lead to the other divisions in the corps. . . .
