A spry old man . as regal-looking as a Shakespearean actor , arrived in Manhattan last week to show off his latest creation . Before 68 New York reporters Architect Frank Lloyd Wright unwrapped his model for " The Modern Gallery of Non-Objective Painting , " which will be built ( with Guggenheim money ) next spring on Manhattan 's upper Fifth Avenue ( TIME , July 23 ) . To some of the newsmen , impressed by Architect Wright but irreverent by nature , the model looked something like a big , white ice cream freezer . <P> Architect Wright has never built anything in Manhattan before . He improved the occasion by lecturing the newsmen on art &; life . He called the big grey Metropolitan Museum , a few blocks away on Fifth Avenue , an " undemocratic , " outdated stone quarry . Rooms should only be about 12 ft. high , he explained , so people will not be made to feel insignificant . Pointing to his model , he sermonized : " Democracy demands this type of building . The thing you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get here ; the health , vitality and beauty of the human imagination . " <P> He added : " There is no reason why New York should keep on building with doors and windows and separate floor slabs one above the other . ' ' His building has only two doors ( both on the outside ; none between rooms ) , one long spiral window , which winds like the floor in gradually expanding , gradually ascending circles . The museum 's wide-open interior is lighted from a dome of pyrex tubing . <P> Wright said he got his basic idea from Assyrian ziggurats ( pyramidal temples with outside ramps ascending spirally ) . Eventually he decided that " the ziggurat is pessimistic , " because it is pyramidal , so he turned it upside down to get his own building . Pointing to his model , he said triumphantly : " This is pure optimism . "
