TO ANYONE unacquainted with the character of the British public it would have seemed beyond question that what it was craving more than anything else in the world , in the ten years preceding the First World War , was opera . All this time there had been carried on in and out of the press an unceasing campaign for the establishment of an English opera , or perhaps more accurately an opera in English ; and according to dozens of writers on the subject , both professional and amateur , we would never be a really civilized nation until we had one . The only existing institution of importance , the Grand Opera Syndicate , which gave us regular seasons , usually in the summer , at Covent Garden in French , Italian , and German , was constantly assailed as being inimical to the interests of native music , and condemned on two further counts , insufficiency of repertoire and adherence to the star system . For my part I never saw reason or justice in either of these indictments . The program given was fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the famous theaters on the Continent , and the so-called star system was nothing worse than the practice of engaging for each role that particular singer whom the Directorate thought best fitted for it ? hardly a serious offense against music . Six opera houses running the whole yearround could not have played all the works which newspaper writers were convinced the public wanted to hear , and if this demand was genuine then clearly what was wanted was less the reformation or abolition of an institution that was doing excellent work in its own way than the creation of others to meet the demand . But as it is always more fun and less trouble to criticize than to construct , nothing tangible ever came of this busy activity of tongue and pen . In determining the character of my own effort , then , I had to take into consideration these two public aspirations : a more varied choice of fare and the performance of English works , together with the engagement of a large number of English singers . The first was much easier to gratify than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pieces unknown then as now . That was purely a matter of selection and should be simple enough , as the public seemed to want everything . But the production of operas by native composers on any scale was quite another matter , for there were very few that could be given with any reasonable chance of success ; and as for the singers , most of them had been trained for oratorio and other concert work , and had little or no knowledge of the stage and all that varied accomplishment which is essential to a successful career on it . Furthermore , English voices are unlike those of most other nations ; really robust tenurs and true dramatic sopranos hardly exist among us and high baritones are as rare as a perfect summer . The best among them are of comparatively moderate volume , pure and excellent in tone but lacking in power and brilliance in comparison with those of Italy , Germany , and France . Some care and discretion would be necessary in the planning of a scheme of work that would display them to advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultimate goal would prove to be a theater of smaller dimensions than Covent Garden or La Scala , something after the model of that admirable French organization , the Opdra Comique . But as my advisers were strongly of the opinion that this , my first important season , should be given at Covent Gardena theater that had been associated in the public mind with opera for over two hundred years ? there I went . The program was made up of " Elektra , " " A Village Romeo and Juliet , " " Ivanhoe , " " Tristan and Isoldc , " " The Wreckers , " " Carmen , " " Hansel and Gretel , " and " L'Enfant Prodigue . " This lastnamed piece was originally a short cantata which I transferred to the stage , and proved to be a capital curtain raiser . I myself conducted the Strauss and Delius operas , while Bruno Walter , whose first appearance this was at Covent Garden , and Percy Pitt divided the others between them . With the exception of " Elektra " none of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general attendance was fairly good . " A Village Romeo and Juliet " was pronounced by the press to be undramatic , although I myself have never been able to discover this deficiency in it . All the same , Delius has certainly a method of writing opera sharcd by no one else . So long as the singers are off the stage the orchestra plays delicately and enchantingly , but the moment they reappear it strikes up fiercely and complainingly as if it resented not being allowed to relate the whole story by itself . During the last act the curtain is down for about eight minutes , and the orchestra plays a strain of haunting beauty ? an intermezzo now known to every concert-goer as " The Walk to the Paradise Garden . " But in the theater it went for next to nothing , being almost completely drowned by the conflicting sounds of British workmen battering on the stage and the loud conversation of the audience . When I revived this work some years later I introduced here a new stage picture , so that this lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in an English theater to secure comparative silence . What the public does not see it takes no interest in , and I would advise all young composers if they wish their music to be heard never to lower the curtain for one second during the course of an act . Better let it remain up with the operations of scene-shifting and workmen in shirtsleeves in full view ; for possibly a fair proportion of the spectators would leave the building under the impression that these were actually a part of the entertainment . Just as this work and " The Wreckers " represented the living English school , so the revival of " Ivanhoe " was an act of respect to a dead English master , Sullivan . It was essentially an affair of action and spectacle , and the designers and machinists saw their opportunity and went out boldly to grasp it . I was promised effects of grandeur and excitement that would outrival the most startling Drury Lane melodrama , and tons of timber were ordered for the scenes of the tournament and the burning of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet escaped from the cycle of ultrarealism in stage representation and everything had to be as lifelike as possible . If there was a house on the stage it must be a real house ; trees and waterfalls must be the things themselves ; and artists as well as the public took a childish delight in going farther than merely holding the mirror up to nature . This phase came to an end shortly afterward when a celebrated actor-manager , nervously uncertain of the effect likely to be made on his cultivated audience by the unassisted recital of Shakespeare 's verse , distinguished himself by letting loose on the stage a brood of tame rabbits during Oberon 's magnificent speech in " A Midsummer Night 's Dream . " Naturally against this rival attraction on the boards the unfortunate Bard had very little chance . I soon observed that the soaring ambidons of the scenic department were reacting none too favorably upon the musical side of the work . There were so many buildings , fences , trees , rivers , and animals encumbering the stage that there was hardly any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the chorus and supers , numbering nearly three hundred , it was evident that if something were not done to accommodate them better they would have to sing in the adjoining market . But it is as difficult to alter traditional methods in a theater as to impose economy on a government department , and I waited and vacillated until the final rehearsal when all the grand effects were to be seen in their full glory . The burning of the castle was certainly an astonishing triumph as viewed from the auditorium , but it was appreciated less by the occupants of the crowded stage . For , regardless of the value of human life , huge chunks of masonry flew in every direction , spreading terror among the attackers and defenders alike . There was almost a riot and undoubtedly there would have been no performance if I had not given my word to control the enthusiasm of the realists . All that day there was a depressed exodus from the theater of about as much wood and other solid material as would have built a fair-sized sailing yacht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elektra " in London , the reputation of its composer reached its zenith . Excepting the death of King Edward , which occurred in the following spring , it was the most discussed event of the year . Some time had gone by since a new work of Strauss had been heard , the last having been the " Symphonia Domcstica " in 1905 , which had been little more than a faint success . About ten years had passed since " Ein Heldenleben " and the earlier Symphonic Poems had been overplayed . None of the composer 's operas had yet been given in London , the town was in just the right mood for a new musical sensation , it expected it and most decidedly it got it . Weeks before the first performance one newspaper vied with another in presenting its readers with the most lurid accounts of the new work , musicians took sides , and a small warfare raged with refreshing animation before a note of the score had been heard . Scholars fell afoul of the libretto on the ground that Hofmannsthal had bedeviled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never saw much to choose between the Greek and the German in the way of horrors . The story , even as told by the silver tongue of Sophocles , is one of the gruesomest in literature . Some of this journalistic fever , which my advertising manager assured me was of untold value , occasioned some embarrassment now and then to the theater staff . As all know who are acquainted with the work , there is a modest procession of sacrificial victims , a few sheep generally , to prelude the first entrance of Clytemnestra . But from the accounts of some papers one would have thought half the inhabitants of the Zoo were being rehearsed to take their part in the show . One day I received a letter from a farmer living about a hundred miles from London whose imagination had been fired by reading of these wonders , and under the impression that I was seeking voluntary contributions to my production in the way of livestock , he had arranged for the transportation to London of a fine large bull , which he claimed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animal had already started on his journey there was nothing to be done but wait for his arrival , have him photographed for the satisfaction of his former owner , and , as we could not employ him in the service of art , put him to the next best purpose . Strauss 's share of the work , taken as a whole , is his most characteristic achievement . Here he has the fullest opportunity of working that vein of grotesque and weird fantasy of which he remains the greatest master in music . On the side of pathos and tenderness he rises to a fairly satisfactory height and , in spite of inequalities of style , realizes a unity which is lacking in his other stage works . The almost entire absence of charm and romance makes it unique , and if it is reported truly that Gluck in his austerity thought more of the Muses than the Graces , then Strauss might be fairly said to have shown a preference for the Furies . The public was undoubtedly impressed and startled , and to satisfy the demand for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the last night , invited Strauss to conduct , and he agreed to come provided I gave him two rehearsals with the orchestra . But in the middle of the first of them ? that is , after about three-quarters of an hour ? he quit the desk , expressing the highest satisfaction with the work of the players . So far as I could ascertain , musicians did not like the piece at all . One eminent British composer on leaving the theater was asked what he thought of it . " Words fail me , " he replied , " and I 'm going home at once to play the chord of C major twenty times over to satisfy myself that it still exists . " The curious thing about this little piece of criticism is that " Elektra " actually finishes with the chord in question , thundered out several times in repetition on the full ensemble . There is in every large town of every country at least one individual who is the living terror of managers , conductors , pianists , and every other kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this type of fanatic no other music except that of the object of his idolatry exists at all . If he thinks that it is being insufficiently played he writes Iong and frequent letters to the press . He attends all concerts where any composition of the master is given , and if there is something in the performance that he does not like he fires off a volley of oral or epistolary abuse at the misguided and incompetent interpreter . He is aways " plus royaliste que le roi " and there is no escape from him ; in other words , he is the world 's greatest bore and its nuisance number one . As I had already suffered from the attentions of the leading Strauss devotee and watchdog in London , I was hardly surprised when he got in touch with me over " Elektra " in the following typical fashion : Sir : Do you intend to imitate the cheeseparing habits of the Grand Opera Syndicate ? What is coming over you ? Last night from my coign ofvantage in the gallery I counted your orchestra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well know , Strauss has stipulated for no less than one hundred and eleven . What have you done with the rest ? Please reply at once . Yours anxiously SYLvEsrEa SPARROW For the moment I felt like the unhappy Varus when the Emperor Augustus confronted him with the terrifying demand , " Where are my Legions ? " I thought that I might quite easily have lost a few of my men without noticing it , and a favorite criticism of the malicious was that I could have dispensed with a great many without the ordinary ear being able to discern the difference . Surely it was impossible for a company of them to have trooped out while I was conducting without my observing it . To satisfy myself , I ascended to the exalted spot which Mr. Sparrow termed his " coign of vantage " and discovered the explanation of the mystery . From there it was impossible to see the full orchestra , some having been concealed in and under certain boxes , and , greatly relieved , I was able to send a reply that all was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III 1 , , Tarinikra matures or grows old more rapidly than music . The brilliant audacity of one generation declines into the placid commonplace of another and an audience of to-day would not find it easy to realize how strange and bewildering the score of " Elektra " sounded to the public of 1910 . About the middle of the work there is a short scene in which two men ? messengers ? rush excitedly on the stage and , after singing a few phrases , rush off again . At one of our later performances this episode occurred in the usual way and the opera went on . About five minutes later the same performers appeared again , and without regard to what was happening at the moment in a scene of totally different character , sang their passage exactly as before and disappeared . I pinched myself to make sure I was not dreaming and , bending down to Albert Sammons , who was leading , asked , " Have those two fellows been on before ? " " Yes , " he replied . " Are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I put the same question to the leader of the second violins , and he was equally convinced that we had been treated to an unsolicited and highly original form of encore . At the close of the performance I went on the stage to discover the cause of this novel addition to the normal attractions of an operatic evening and found the culprits in the company of the chorus master , all three of them looking very embarrassed . " Am I right in assuming that you took upon yourselves to repeat your scene this evening ? " I asked frigidly . " I am afraid you are , " replied one of them . " What is the explanation of this twice nightly experiment ? " This question was answered by the chorus master , who explained that a part of his duty was to take the cue for the sending on of the two singers from a passage in the orchestra . On this occasion his attention had been distracted by the necessary task of forcibly expelling a rude and refractory chorister through the stage door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the stage aglow with victory , and presently there came along something that to his flushed ear resembled the familiar phrase which was his lighthouse in the polyphonic sea of whirling sound . " Now you go on , " he called out to the singers . " But we have been on , " they answered . " Then it was at the wrong place ; you must go on again , " and as they seemed rather hesitant he literally pushed them onto the scene . I was relieved to find that a more agreeable manifestation of human weakness than artistic vanity was at the bottom of the mystery , and I discharged the offenders with a caution and the reminder that there was quite enough rough and tumble going on in the band without the actors joining in . As I never heard a comment or received a protest from any member of the audience I concluded that this curious variation from the orderly course of performance had either passed unnoticedor had proved to their liking . But I do not think that even an audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works like " Faust " or " Carmen " a repetition of the songs of Siebel or the Toreador during scenes with which they obviously had not the slightest connection . I awaited anxiously the arrival of the next day 's post , which I felt sure would bring me an explosive communication from my friend Sylvester Sparrow . To my relief nothing appeared , from which I gathered that the " coign of vantage " had not harbored its usual tenant that night . IV A TER the startling success of " Elektra " it was inevitable that my quest for an equal sensation for another Covent Garden season should lead me at once to " Salome . " I engaged a cast which had the full approval of Strauss and which was headed by Aino Akte , a slim and beautiful creature with an adequate voice and a remarkable understanding of her part . But one day I was unpleasantly surprised to learn that , as the censor considered the work to be unfit for the British stage , we had been refused a license for performance . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was advised that I should be wasting my time if I did not appeal to someone of higher authority ; and as there was only one such person in the State known personally to me , the Prime Minister , I decided to seek his intervention . He had just Ieft for Gloucestershire to spend a few weeks in the house of a relative , and so Mrs. Asquith , who always interested herself in matters of this sort , invited me to join the party . It has often been said that if anyone wants to see the English at their best he should turn his back on the town and hasten to the country . The average Briton is not genuinely urban in soul , although the evolution of industrial life has driven him from the countryside into cities ; and the best evidence of this is the really shocking muddle he makes of the job when called upon to plan and lay out a new town . With the wealthier class it was never the house in London that xaa upon as the real home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote from the capital , set off by gardens that would have satisfied the requirements of Bacon himself , and half hidden in the trees of its girdling park , For my part I had already observed that the man one has been seeing for months at a time in town takes on a different aspect and undergoes an almost biological transformation when met a few weeks later in the country among horses , dogs , and dairymaids . On first meeting Mr. Asquith at Downing Street I had been a little abashed at his magisterial demeanor , which was rather too obviously that of the man accustomed to issue commands and wield authority . He treated us either to long flowing periods reminiscent of a college lecture room or to a rapid series of staccato utterances not unlike those of the old Sergeant Major of the Engineer Corps in Lancashire , in which for a brief time I had held a commission . And although his wife had an easier and lighter hand in dealing with visitors or strangers , most of us remained rather more conscious than was quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land , with immense power in her grasp for good or But in the freer air and more spacious accommodation of that charming house in the lovely Stroud Valley both of these essentially simple and warm-hearted people became different beings . The giant 's robe fell away from the shoulders of the Prime Minister , who made one forget in five minutes that he was what he was , save for his massively striking appearance and the intellectual quality of his conversation . He was learned , but deeply rather than widely . His acquaintance with Creek , Roman , and English literature was as comprehensive as any I have known , and he retained a clear memory of everything that he had read . But with that of foreign modern nations it was fragmentary , and for the other arts , architecture excepted , he did not seem to have much predilection . Of music he knew next to nothing ; but unlike most people who , unaffected by the classics , take pleasure in popular jingles , he had no taste for anything that was vulgar ormeretricious . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general culture , he would display a statesmanlike caution in taking part in any discussion that touched on aesthetic subjects . But one evening when I found myself alone with him for a short while in a room where there was a piano he asked me , with something of the expression in his eye with which a schoolboy makes a request that he is not quite sure should be granted , if I would play him the March from " TannhAuser . " I did so twice , and when he gathered from me that musicians did not think too disdainfully of this famous fragment , he repeated the demand for it the night before my departure , but this time boldly in the presence of the rest of his family . I explained to him my little difficulty over " Salome " : how Strauss was the most famous and in common opinion the greatest of living composers , how this was his most popular work , how it was to be played for the first time to a few thousand enthusiasts who wanted to hear it , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see , those that did not want to hear it , how being given in German , it would be conaprehended by few , and , lastly , how I could not envisage the moral foundation of the Empire being endangered by a handful of operatic performances . Would it not be more judicious to give the piece a chance , especially as we might run the risk of making ourselves slightly ridiculous in the eyes of the rest of the world by taking an exceptional attitude toward a celebrated work of art , as we had done so often in the past before the advent to power of the present enlightened government ? The Prime Minister was , I think , mare impressed by the last argument than the others and promised to speak to the Lord Chamberlain about it , and encouraged by this comforting assurance I returned to town to complete my plans for the autumn . THE foreigner the principal charm of England is its odd mixture of sprightly modern resource and stately medieval lumber . In most countries when a custom outwears its use it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be quite obsolete or has long been crying out for reform . But no one can do anything about it ; for a mysterious force , almost an occult influence , creeps insidiously through the body politic and social to head us away from the folly and danger of change . We become ashamed of our seriousness and falter in our determination to make wrong things right ; nor dots it matter in the least that our conservatism is not only an inconvenience to ourselves but the object of ridicule to others . We have a sneaking affection for the one and an open contempt for the other , and abuses or absurdities that would make some nations blush for shame and others rush to the barricades we endure cheerfully for the sole reason that they are our own , just as some parents delight to protect and indulge the weakly among their offspring . One of our most characteristic institutions is the Censorship , which functions as the watchdog of decency over all that touches the drama , literature , painting , or any other art ? easily the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am no advocate either for or against it , and I shrink from expressing any opinion on the theory of some of our thinkers past and present that to the average Englishman there clings a vestige of the old Adamic taint that stands in need of constant repression . But that his rulers have a concern for his spiritual health , as well as a rigid belief in the perpetual adolescence of his mentality , is sufficiently evidenced by their assumption of a paternal authority which none elsewhere care or dare to exercise over their own citizens . The history of the stage is full of episodes which illustrate the manifold workings of the censorial mind , but few , I think , have been more closely linked with the true spirit of comedy than that of " Salome . " Some weeks after my conversation with the Prime Minister in which he promised to look into the matter of the ban upon it I received an invitation to present myself at St. James 's Palace , where I was received by the Lord Chamberlain and his second in command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their refusal to grant a license was due in noway to personal prejudice but to the huge volume of letters they had received from every corner of the country protesting against the appearance on the stage of a sacred character , Saint John the Baptist . I at once pointed out that " Samson and Delilah " had been given now for many years in London although it labored under a similar disadvantage ; but the Lord Chamberlain , who had undoubtedly been waiting for this obvious rejoinder , caught me up quickly with : " There is a difference , a very great difference ; in one case it is the Old Testament and in the other , the New . " Here followed a lengthy dissertation on this important distinction , punctuated by a wealth of doctrinal example of which I , although severely brought up in the bosom of the Church of England , had hitherto been ignorant ; and the conversation , which had gradually taken on the tone of an elaborate theological debate , had to be diverted once more into the terrestrial channel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But we think we have found a way out , " he interpolated . " There is no doubt that there arc many people who want to see this work , and it is the view of the Prime Minister that , subject to the proper safeguards , we should do everything we can to enable you to give it . Now if you will consent to certain modifications of the text likely to disarm the scruples of the devout it would help us to reconsider our decision . " I could offer no objection to what seemed at first hearing a quite reasonable suggestion and inquired how he proposed to get to work on the task , to which he replied that both he and the Lord Chamberlain were prepared to give their personal attention to it if I would do the same . I agreed without hesitation , and we arranged for an early conference at which " Salome " would be trimmed so as to make it palatable to the taste of that large army of objectors who would never see it . The first thing we did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be called simply The Prophet ; and having invested him with this desirable anonymity , we went on to deprive every passage between him and Salome of the slightest force or meaning . The mundane and commonplace passion of the precocious princess was refined into a desire on her part for spiritual guidance , and the celebrated line at the end of the drama , " If you had looked upon me you would have loved me , " was transformed into " If you had looked upon me you would have blessed me . " It is only fair to say that my collaborators in this joyous piece of nonsense were , in spite of their outward gravity , as exhilarated as myself ; for we all of us alike felt that we were making a solemn sacrifice on the altar of an unknown but truly national god . The day arriving when our aim was accomplished and we had successfully metamorphosed a lurid tale of love and revenge into a comforting sermon that could have been safely preached from any country pulpit , I handed over the strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make an equivalently innocuous German version and send it along to the singers for study . I was neither surprised nor disappointed when there poured in one by one the liveliest communications from the unhappy creatures who were asked to sing to some of the most vivid and dramatic music ever written words which not only had no discoverable association with it , but were utterly devoid of any dramatic significance , the chief complainant being the leading lady , who did not see how it could be done at ail . But I assumed an adamantine front and , resolutely declining to discuss the matter with them fur one moment , declared that everything must go through exactly as prescribed . England was not Germany , they should understand , but a country that took a pride in doing things in its own particular way , especially where the arts were involved ; and here was an edifying example of it . Before this unbending attitude the flood of remonstrance subsided , and with groans of resignation the artists submitted to the foreign yoke . But it was hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the transaction , and for weeks those journals which were read mainly for their contribution to the lighter side of life enjoyed a large increase of circulation over the whole Continent . In course of time the singers arrived , but rehearsals had hardly begun when a mild bombshell was exploded among us by St. James 's Palace , which had just remembered that the decapitated head of John had to be handed to Salome on the stage , and that she was to sing to it in full view of the audience for about twenty minutes . This would never do . If it had been his arm or even leg it might have been different ; but his head certainly not , and some substitute must be found for the offending member . We all went into conclave again , and it was settled that Salome be given a bloodstained sword ; but this time it was the prima donna who put her foot down , objecting that the gruesome weapon would ruin her beautiful gown and flatly refusing to handle it at all . Despairingly , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official mind travailed and brought forth . The best and final concession we could obtain was that Salome should have a large platter completely covered with a cloth , but that under no circumstances could any object , even the minutest , be placed beneath it that might suggest by its bulging protuberance the presence of the precious head . VI p-Tlim troubled voyage of rehearsals cora1 ing at last to an end , we reached the night of the first performance , in which a much more than ordinary interest was taken . Not only had the story of our little difficulties got abroad , but as always happens anywhere when there is the slightest hint of naughtiness in a piece , the whole town yearned to see it . This in fact is the royal road to success , and if a young dramatist can only induce the bishops and clergy to denounce him with enough objurgation as a monster of impropriety his fortune is made . At the last moment people appeared offering any price for a seat , and the performance began in a spirit of high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half an hour all went perfectly according to plan , everyone singing his or her innocent phrases accurately , if somewhat frigidly . But gradually I sensed by that telepathy which exists between the conductor of the orchestra and the artists on the stage a growing restlessness and excitement of which the first manifestation was a slip on the part of Salome , who forgot two or three sentences of the bowdlerized version and lapsed into the viciousness of the lawful text . The infection spread among the other performers , and by the time the second half of the work was well under way they were all living in the work and shamelessly restoring it to its integrity , as if no such things existed as British respectability and its legal custodians . I was powerless to intervene . Overcome with terror and agitation , I had visions of dire disaster . I saw Covent Garden , a theater under the direct control of the Lord Chamberlain 's office , losing its cherished Royal Charter ; it was I who would be held responsible for this flagrant breach of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friends in the face , and I perspired in torrents . I recalled an experience of Strauss himself at a rehearsal of the same opera , when out of humor with vocal struggles on the stage he had exhorted the orchestra to more strenuous efforts by calling out that he could still hear his singers ; and I strove valiantly by the same methods to render my own even more inaudible . But I knew that in the end I should have to admit defeat , for looming like a specter before me was that dreadful final scene where the orchestral accompaniment sinks to a dynamic level that the brutalest manipulation can not lift above a gentle piano , and I knew that every word of Salomewould be heard in the last row in the gallery as she crooned away ecstatically to her empty platter . After what seemed an age of purgatory to me , the performance came to an end , the public was enthusiastic , and the artists bubbled over with delight at their success . I had not the heart to reproach them ; I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remained on the stage with them after the curtain had gone down I was horrified to see advancing toward me the party from the Lord Chamberlain 's box . My first impulse was to fly , but as this would be a personal acknowledgment of the crime , I decided to stay and fight it out . To my astonishment the magnate addressed me with beaming countenance : " It has been wonderful , we are all delighted , and I felt I could not leave the theater without thanking you and your colleagues for the complete way in which you have met and fulfilled all our wishes . " I think I must have effectively concealed my bewilderment at these unexpected felicitations , for the official group passed on radiating a benevolent satisfaction which I interpreted joyfully to my foreign contingent , who left the building in a greater state of stupefaction than ever at the unaccountable workings of the British mind . To this day I do not know whether we owed this happy finishing touch to the imperfect diction of the singers , an ignorance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or their diplomatic decision to put the best possible face on a denouement that was beyond either their or my power to foresee and control .
