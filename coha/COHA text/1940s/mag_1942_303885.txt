For 15 noonday minutes this Wednesday , a million or more retail stores refused to sell any merchandise , no matter how importunate their customers . Reason : they were selling nothing but war bonds and stamps . This " White-Out-For-Victory " was the bright idea of the Treasury 's Retail Advisory Committee Chairman , Benjamin S. Namm ( Namm Store , Brooklyn , N.Y. ) , who also sparks the N.R.D.G.A. 's " Retailers-for-Victory " drive . War-minded , promotion-wise Major Namm hoped his White Out would sell as much as $100,000,000 worth of war bonds and stamps .
