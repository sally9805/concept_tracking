When there is more than one charge , the charges should be numbered with Roman Numerals , e. g. , Charge I ; Charge II . c . When there is more than one specification under a charge the specifications under that charge should be numbered with Arabic numerals , e. g. , Specification 1 ; Specification 2. d . An offense made expressly punishable by a certain article should as a rule be formally charged thereunder : to charge it , instead , as a violation of an article relating to a different specific offense , or as a violation of the General ( 96th ) Article is an error . 4 . Name , grade , and organization ( to show the jurisdiction of the court over the accused ) . a . The present grade of the accused should precede his name . b . Where the accused 's grade has changed since the date @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a statement of his former grade , e. g. , Private A B , Company , then Corporal , Company c .

It is unnecessary to give the station of the accused 's organization . f . The serial number of the accused should not be included in the specification . 5 . Time and place ( to show the jurisdiction of the court over the offense ) . a . The place of the alleged offense must be stated . b .

The specification must be appropriate to the charge and must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ element of the offense , as denounced at common law , in the Article of War , or in other statute . The failure to set forth any essential element of the offense renders the specification defective . ( 1 ) Intent and knowledge . Where specific intent or guilty knowledge is an element of the offense , the same must be alleged unless the words descriptive of I Ire offense inherently connote such intent , as " desert " in the offense of desertion and " steal " in the offense of larceny . ( See M.C.M. , Appendix 4 , Forms 13 and 94. ) ( 2 ) Technical terms . Certain words have a well established meaning and must be used when appropriate , e.g. , " malice aforethought " in the offense of murder , " desert " and " steal " as in ( 1 ) above , and " unlawfully , " " wrongfully , " " maliciously , " " feloniously " in many if not most offenses . The omission of Iliese words may result in the non-averment of any ( Tense cognizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e offense of mayhem to aver " that did , at on or about 19 cut off the finger e1 ' .. .. " does no more than state that which surgeons lawfully do every day , while the averment ( Form 89 , M.C.M. , Appendix 4 ) that did , at on or about 19 unlawfully , wilfully , and feloniously cut off the finger of tales an offense. b . Certainty . The offense must be clearly described : // ( 1 ) To enable the court to say that , if the facts are true , an offense has been committed by the ac-cused ; ( 2 ) So that the court will know what punishment to award in case of conviction ; ( 3 ) So that the court can confine the evidence to the offense charged , in order that the defendant may not be charged with one offense and convicted of another ; ( 4 ) To give the accused reasonable notice of the charge that he will be called upon to answer ; ( 5 ) To make the particular offense the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of review in case of conviction ; ( 6 ) To identify the offense so that an acquittal or conviction may be pleaded in bar of trial if the accused is again charged with the same offense. c . Positiveness . All material allegations must be positive and direct . Conclusions , arguments , and beliefs are highly improper and should not be stated . ( 1 ) Matter immaterial and superfluous should not be included . ( 2 ) " It is not technically good pleading in alleging an offense to state the circumstances or evidence proving or tending to prove it , such as the acts , occurrences , and matters of description , which should properly form part of the testimony of witnesses ; but there is no objection to stating very briefly in the specification the immediate result or effect of the act charged as a circumstance or description illustrating the character and extent of the offense committed . For instance , in charging a striking or doing a violence to a superior officer under A.W . 64 , it is allowable , in a case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specification , thereby causing his death , ' as indicating the measure of violence employed . UnnecesTo // sarily pleading the evidence ' does not render the specification fatally defective . But the circumstances thus alleged in detail , even though unnecessarily , must be proved at the trial as alleged , or exceptions must be made in the finding . There is also danger of variance as to details between the specification and the proof . " ( Manual for Courts-Martial , 1921 , par . 74d. ) d . Singleness of offense . A specification should not allege more than one offense either conjunctively or in the alternative . For example , an offense under A.W . 84. can not be charged by the words " did lose and destroy " or by the words " did sell or through neglect lose . " If , as the result of an investigation , there is doubt whether the property has been sold or lost , each offense may be charged in a separate specification . Care must be taken , in every case of charges made under an Article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each specification alleges but a single offense. e . Describing property . Property must be sufficiently described so that it can be easily identified . Usually the ownership must be alleged . f . Value . The value of property when material , must be alleged ( as in larceny ) , and should be stated in words and figures , e.g. , five dollars and twenty cents ( $5.20 ) . g . Written instruments . Written instruments should he set out verbatim . If this is impracticable , the substance must be shown . h . Oral statements . Oral statements , the making of which are facts in issue , should be set out as nearly as possible in exact words , but should always be qualified by the words , " or words to that effect . " i . General prisoners . In charging a general prisoner with an offense , the form of the charge will not he changed but the specification will read as follows : // In that General Prisoner A B did ( here allege the offense in the language prescribed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is not necessary to allege in the specification that the general prisoner was formerly a soldier , was tried by a general court-martial , and was sentenced to dishonorable discharge and a term of confinement , and that he committed the offense while serving such confinement . The words " general prisoner " necessarily carry the import of such facts . NOTE . General prisoners are persons sentenced to dismissal or dishonorable discharge and to terms of confinement at military posts or elsewhere . j . Scandalous and disgraceful offenses under A.W . 95 and A.W . 96 . In framing charges it is permissible , under the custom of the service , after alleging the facts in the specification , to add , " This to the scandal and disgrace of the military service . " This form of charge is appropriate in cases of particularly disgraceful conduct committed in the presence of a number of persons , especially civilians , or while the offender was in uniform , or under other circumstances resulting in publicity . k . Erasures and interlineations . Erasures and interlineations are objectionable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Additional charges . New and separate charges which are preferred after others have already been preferred are known in military law as " additional charges . " Such charges may relate to past transactions which were not known by , or brought to the attention of , the person framing the original charges at the time that they were preferred ; or they may , as is more frequent , arise from acts of the accused subTo // sequent to the time the original charges were preferred . Thus , if after charges have been preferred the accused commits a " breach of arrest , " an additional charge will properly be preferred in the case , and should be designated as an " additional charge . " Charges of this character do not require a separate trial , but may and preferably should be tried by the same court that tries the original charges ; at the same time , these are subject to the limitations regarding investigation and service of charges contained in A.W . 70 . If it is practicable to consolidate the two sets of charges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be denominated " additional charges " ( written at the top of the charge sheet and referred to as such in the 1st Indorsement ) . However , after the court has been duly sworn to try and determine " the matter now before it , " additional charges which the accused has had no notice to defend , and for which the right to challenge has not been accorded him , can not be introduced nor can the accused be required to plead thereto . But if all the usual proceedings prior to arraignment are first had with respect to such additional charges , including proceedings as to excusing and challenging members and administering oaths , such charges may be introduced , the accused may be arraigned on them , and the trial may proceed on both sets as the trial of one case . In such a case an application for a reasonable continuance should be granted . m . Abbreviations . Abbreviations should generally not be used in any legal document except the following : 1 . Figures , e.g. , 1st , $2.50 , 1941 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // n . Variance . ' Disagreement or difference between two parts of the same legal proceeding which , to be effectual , should agree ? as between the allegation and the proof is called variance . Variance is fatal to any specification where the proof not only fails to support such specification as an offense under the declared Article of War but also fails to support it as a lesser included offense , either under such declared article or the General ( 96th ) Article . Such failure of proof and the consequent collapse of an entire court-martial proceeding is , in most cases , within the power of the framer of charges to prevent ? as the following example will show . A soldier was charged with and found guilty of knowingly and wilfully misappropriating one woolen shirt , property of the United States , furnished and intended for the military service thereof , in violation of the 94th Article of War ( 9th Clause ) . The evidence clearly established larceny of the shirt . The Judge Advocate General , in his review of the case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as used in the 94th Article of War , were intended to include acts not covered by the previous words " steals " and " embezzles . " He held that , since misappropriating means to devote to an unauthorized purpose , one can not misappropriate that over which one has no control or supervision , nor can one devote property to a purpose when one exercises no lawful authority respecting such property . He held that evidence of larceny fails to sustain the finding of guilty of knowingly and wilfully misappropriating the property . The proved and wrongful taking ( larceny ) of the property is an offense , but it was not included in the specification , and it is an entirely different offense . The framer of this charge should have known , as an // item of professional knowledge , the legal boundary between larceny and misappropriation under A.W . 94 ; and in the light of such knowledge he should have selected , after a thorough investigation and appraisal of the available evidence , that Article of VTar and the appropriate specification thereunder which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the evidence , as known to the framer of the charges , has changed , in quality or quantity , by the time it is presented to the court trying the case . The variance thus caused can not , of course , be avoided ; but in the usual case variance can be prevented if the framer of charges makes a careful investigation of the facts and if he properly applies to the facts the legal boundaries of offenses. o . Forms for charges and specifications . See M.C.M. Appendix 4 . Note that the several forms are not mandatory and may be added to or deviated from . Always consult , in a given case , the discussion and " proof " of the offense in the M.C.M. Consult also the " Specimen Charges , " M.C.M. , page 23.8 , for punctuation guide . ( See also additional specimen charges in Chapter 13 , herein . ) Initiating and Preferring Charges . Anyone may initiate charges , that is , bring to the attention of the proper military authorities information concerning a supposed offense committed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military law may prefer charges , that is , sign them as an accuser and make the necessary affidavit as to their truth . Instead of preferring charges it is ordinarily better , especially in a minor case , to initiate changes , that is , to inform the accused 's immediate commanding officer of the matter . If charges are preferred by anyone other than the latter , the charges , properly signed and sworn to , will be forwarded through this latter officer . ( This // is the officer who , under A.W . 104 , exercises immediate jurisdiction over the accused . See M.C.M. 33 . ) Forwarding Charges . Where it appears probable that the case will be disposed of by reference to a summary court ( or by action under A.W . 104 ) , the person preferring charges need not forward them by letter of transmittal . Otherwise the charges will be forwarded to the officer exercising immediate court-martial jurisdiction over the accused , and the letter of transmittal will include or carry as enclosures a summary of the , expected evidence ( derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter may also include a recommendation as to the disposition of the case . All reasonably available documentary or other real evidence will be forwarded , or a notation made on the charge sheet as to where such evidence can be obtained . ( For a suggested form of letter transmitting charges see Appendix 4 . ) The charge sheet should be filled out in triplicate and all entries on pages 1 , 2 , and 3 , ( except " 1st Ind . " ) should be filled out , as far as is practicable . If charges are preferred by some one who is unable to easily secure the required data , the commander of the accused 's organization is required to fill in missing data and correct erroneous data about the service of the accused , the list of witnesses , the restraint of the accused , etc. , and the evidence of previous convictions . Care should be taken to forward only admissible evidence of previous convictions ( M.C.M. 79c ) . Each previous conviction should be checked to determine that the offense was committed ( 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to serve ( or status as a general prisoner ) , ( 2 ) within one year ( in the case of an enlisted man ) , or within three years ( in the case of an officer ) , directly preceding the date of commission of the offense charged ( excluding // periods of unauthorized absence for which the accused was convicted ) . Note that the one or three year period runs from offense to offense , regardless of the date of conviction or the date of arraignment . If the accused is tried and ( presently ) convicted of offenses committed on different dates , use the earliest date as the basis for computation . ( See Chapter 13 , page 281 , for problems on previous convictions . ) After the charges are completed and the accompanying papers in order , they should be forwarded through channels to the officer who has immediate authority to appoint summary courts-martial for the command to which the accused belongs . ( Usually this officer is the regimental or post commander . ) Action Upon Charges . You may say that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no further direct interest in what is done by higher authority on the charges . However if you understand fully what your regimental or post commander must do , you can more intelligently perform your task of properly preparing the charges . Briefly , the officer exercising court-martial jurisdiction will take action as follows : 1 . He will examine carefully the charges to determine that they are properly signed and sworn to , that they are in proper form , that they sufficiently allege , an offense or offenses cognizable by a courtmartial , and that the specifications are laid under the appropriate Article or Articles of War . 2 . He will correct and initial obvious errors ; he will return the charges to the accuser for correction of substantial defects . 3 . He will act under A.W . 104 with respect to such offenses as may properly be disposed of under that article . ( He should then draw lines through such specifications and charges , initial them and change the nu140 SOLDIER AND THE LAW merical designations in the affidavit to correspond to any renumbering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) 4 . He will make or cause to be made any necessary ( additional ) investigation of charges not disposed of under A.W . 104 . The formal investigation required by A.W . 70 need be made only when it is likely that the case will be referred to a general court-martial for trial ( See Chapter 6 ) . 5 . He will refer the case to a medical board for a report on the mental condition of the accused , if evidence is discovered that the accused is insane or was insane at the time of t ; Ie commission of the act . 6 . He will take prompt , proper action to refer the case to the lowest court that has power to adjudge an appropriate and adequate punishment , that is : a . He will refer the case to a summary court or to the trial judge advocate of the special court , together with all related papers ( including , if the case was investigated under A.W . 70 , a statement of the substance of the testimony taken on both sides ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to a general court-martial , he will refer the case to an officer for investigation under A.W . 70 ; and he will then forward it to the officer having general court-martial jurisdiction , together with a recommendation that the case be referred to a general court-martial ; c . If he himself has general court-martial jurisdiction , then , of course , he need not forward the charges ( unless he is the accuser or prosecutor ) , but he must refer them to his staff judge advocate for the latter 's ( written ) recommendation of the action to be taken ; when this report has been received and trial by general court is still believed to be warranted , he will then refer the charges and all related papers ( includTo // ing the report of the staff judge advocate ) to the trial judge advocate of the general court . Typical Cases . To illustrate this phase of your duties , let us take some hypothetical cases and follow them through . Company punishment . Assume that you are the company commander of Company A , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sitting in the office at about two o'clock on the afternoon of August 4 , 1943 , endeavoring earnestly to make the mess sheet balance , a knock sounds on the office door . Knowing that all the men are at work , you look up to find Corporal Brown , the NCO in Charge of Quarters , escorting Private Dunn into the office . Corporal Brown reports that Private Dunn has just reported back to the organization after overstaying his leave by some eight hours . You dismiss Corporal Brown and begin to question Private Dunn . At first Dunn , who is a recruit , appears nervous and shy about answering your questions . Gradually , when lie understands that you desire only to ascertain the truth in order properly to dispose of his case , lie informs you that he fully intended to return on time but that he was having such a good time at home that before he realized the hour , he had missed the last train at night and was forced to wait for the early morning train . Now this story has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his deportment , and his straightforward manner in making the statement convinces you that it is true and that Dunn fully realizes his mistake and is willing to make amends for it . Being absent without leave is an offense which should not be overlooked ; in this case , since the absence is of short duration and since it is his first offense of the kind , you decide to award Dunn punishment under the 104th Article of War . You advise him of the fact that you intend to impose corn142 SOLDIER AND THE LAW pany punishnment unless he desires trial by court-martial . It is very likely that he ( or any other normal soldier ) will usually have confidence in his company commander 's sense of justice and select company punishment in preference to trial . Dunn makes his selection . You then inform him of his punishment which , in view of the type of offense , the circumstances attending its commission , and the youth , attitude , etc. , of the offender , you fix at three days ' restriction to barracks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understands the full meaning of the restriction , you ask if he wishes to appeal this case to the battalion commander . He undoubtedly will say " no , " but if the reply is in the affirmative , he should be granted the right to write out a brief statement of his reasons for thinking the punishment unjust and the right to see the battalion commander . In either event , you dismiss Private Dunn with an admonishment to " see that it does not happen again . " Dunn , after saluting , makes an about face and leaves you once again to the search for missing mess bills . Initiating trial . Some time later , while deeply engrossed , in a page so full of figures that you can scarcely decipher your last ones , a human figure appears and you look up to see your " A number one " soldier , First Sergeant Riley , before you . By the expression on Riley 's face , you know that someone has committed an act which Riley believes is not in the interest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing in the doorway , because he is motionless . You lay aside the pencil and paper and inquire , " Yes , Sergeant Riley , What is the trouble l " Immediately he tells you that Private Blank has been observed taking a book of post exchange coupons and a fountain pen from Corporal Sam 's trunk locker . You recall that on many previous occasions reports have reached you // to the effect that men of the organization have been missing various small articles of a similar nature . You direct Sergeant Riley to have the men who know anything about this case report to your office at once . Soon you have before you Corporal Chester O. Sam and Private Blank . You interrogate Corporal Sam and learn that he did not give permission to Private Blank to use his Parker fountain pen or the coupons which were in his trunk locker . You also learn that the pen cost $7.50 , that the coupon book had $3.50 worth of coupons left in it , that Blank sleeps beside Sam , and that he knew where the pen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this interview but he has nothing to say . You dismiss Corporal Sam . The next person to appear is Corporal Dunn who was the NCO in Charge of Quarters . You learn from him that as he was walking through the barracks at about three o'clock in the afternoon , he saw Private Blank crouching down beside a trunk locker . Since Dunn knew that Blank should not be in barracks at that hour , Dunn called to him . Blank was startled and dropped something on the floor . Dunn walked to where he was and saw a Parker fountain pen lying on the floor ; at the same time , he noticed that Blank was trying to put something into his back pocket . All of this took place near Corporal Sam 's trunk locker . When Dunn asked Blank what he intended to do with the pen , and what he was putting in his pocket , Blank replied that he was going to write a letter , but that before he could do so , he had to buy some writing paper at the post exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . Dunn immediately took Blank to First Sergeant Riley , who learned from Corporal Sam that Blank had taken these things without permission , express or implied . Private Blank is present and hears Corporal Dunn // make these statements to you . Since he does not question these statements in any way , you dismiss Corporal Dunn . You are now alone with Private Blank , and you inform him that he has the right to tell you anything he pleases , although he does not have to make any statement . However , ( you inform him ) that any statement he may make may ( and probably will ) be used against him in the event of his trial by court-martial . He appears depressed , studies the situation , and informs you that Ile has nothing to add to his explanation already made to Corporal Dunn . You thereupon inform him that you are preferring charges against him for the offense of larceny . You further advise him that the is being placed in confinement , and you direct the NCO in Charge of Quarters to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then to take Blank to the guard house . A confinement slip is immediately prepared in the orderly ' room , signed by you and sent with the NCO in Charge of Quarters to the guard house . You then secure the fountain pen and the coupon book , place identifying paper stickers on each , and initial them . After giving Corporal Sam a receipt for the articles , you lock them up in the company safe . You are of the opinion , as a result of your informal investigation , that Private Blank is guilty of the crime of larceny , and you are now confronted with the preparation of the charges . You call to the First Sergeant for the Manual for Courts-Martial ( 1928 ) . and you begin thumbing through the pages . In your haste you fail to recall that the Manual is very well indexed , but after you search through the pages in vain for a discussion of larceny , you finally turn to the index . As you look through the alphabetical index , you find " Larceny " on page @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the heading of " Larceny , " the page numTo // bers listed for its definition , discussion , and form for specifications . This latter form is listed as Appendix 4 , number 94 , page 250 . You quickly turn to page 250 and there before you is specification 94 , Larceny . You study it for a moment , and see that with the insertion of appropriate words in the blank spaces , you can accomplish an appropriate specification . You are now ready to draft this specification but you do not recall all the details concerning the proper numbering of charges and specifications , the use of abbreviations , etc . Again you turn to the index of the Manual and looking under " Charges and specifications , " you find , " Drafting , general rules applicable to , " listed on page 18 , paragraphs 28 and 29 . Reading through these paragraphs , you frequently find reference made to Appendix 4 . Turning to this appendix , which begins on page 236 , you find not only additional rules and hints , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you now proceed to write the following charge and specification : Charge : Violation of the 93d Article of War . Specification : In that Private James R. Blank , Company A , 22'nd Infantry , did , at Fort Dash , Idaho , on or about 4 August 1943 , feloniously take , steal , and carry away one fountain pen , value about seven dollars and fifty cents ( $7.50 ) , and one post exchange coupon book containing coupons to the approximate value of three dollars and fifty cents ( $3.50 ) , a total approximate value of eleven dollars ( $11.00 ) , the property of Corporal Chester O. Sam . With this penciled draft of the specification , you secure a charge sheet and study it so as to complete it . ( See M.C.M. , Appendix 3 for sample form . ) At a glance , it can be seen that the information called for // on page 1 of the charge sheet may be obtained from the service record and pay card of the accused , except the items " Data as to witnesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which must be supplied by you as the one familiar with the case . You direct the clerk to fill in these data including under " Data as to Witnesses " a note specifying the location of the pen and coupons . Page 2 of the charge sheet is completed by merely having your clerk type in your penciled draft of the charge and specification . On page 3 you notice that , as the accuser , you are required to sign the charges and fill in the affidavit to show that you have investigated the matters set forth in the specifications and the charge , and that the same are true to the best of your knowledge and belief . You direct your clerk to line out the inappropriate words , to type in your name as the accuser , and the name of the Adjutant as the person to administer the oath . You note that page 4 is of no concern to you at this time . After the charge sheet has been fully prepared in triplicate , you prepare all of the required accompanying papers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading " Charges and specifications " you find the sub-heading " Forwarding with letter of transmittal when required , " and " Forwarding with summary of evidence when required . " The page number listed for these is 21 . Turning to page 21 of the Manual , you observe in paragraph 32 , that in all cases which will probably not be disposed of under the 104th Article of War or by summary court-martial , the charges will be forwarded by a letter of transmittal . This letter will include or carry as inclosures a summary of the evidence on which the charges are based as derived or expected from each witness or other source . Accordingly you complete your summary of the substance of the testimony to be expected from // Corporal Sam , Corporal Dunn and First Sergeant Riley , have it typed in triplicate for their signatures , and have them sign the original copies . You notice also on page 22 , paragraph 33 , that you must attach to the charges any available evidence of previous convictions . You find that Private Blank was tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 1 , 1942 to December 15 , 1942 . However , as a brief computation shows , this previous conviction is inadmissible , since it was committed more than a year ( even excluding the two weeks A.W.O.L. ) previous to the date of the alleged larceny . Therefore you direct the clerk to make out for your signature a negative report of previous convictions . After attaching all the necessary papers to the prepared charge sheets , you are now ready to take the oath required on page 3 of the charge sheets . You take all of the papers personally to the office of the Adjutant where he administers the oath to you and signs his name . You then leave the papers with him for the action of your regimental or post commander . When this has been accomplished , you have completed your task of preparing and forwarding the charges . If your job has been properly done , you will have set in motion , for the administration of justice , an extremely speedy and effective system , the workings of which will be discussed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to prepare for your signature a letter of transmittal forwarding the eharges . A form of such letter of transmittal is contained in Appendix 4 . Introduction Before treating the various types of courts-martial it might be well to consider their jurisdiction and the nature of the offenses over which they possess this jurisdiction . ( See Chart on Courts-martial , p. 56 . ) Since these courts-martial apply purely to the military service , it is obvious that their jurisdiction is limited to military offenses , and to those persons who have been made amenable to trial by the military authorities . Courts-martial are strictly criminal courts , which have been set up by Acts of Congress and have been given certain power to try offenders who are alleged to have committed acts which have been denounced as military offenses by the Articles of War ( or other statute ) . These Articles of War are likewise a part of an Act of Congress ; but they should not in any way be likened to the federal statutes which embrace the crimes of which the federal courts take cognizance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the federal judiciary system , but a separate system of law . If this were not the situation , every military case tried by a military courtmartial might be subject to review by a federal ( civil ) court . Such procedure , in a way , would detract from the prestige of the military service and would tend to render extremely difficult the enforcement of proper discipline in the Army . There are certain channels through which a military court-martial case must proceed . No right of appeal as such is allowed the accused , because every case has an automatic appeal , or review , whether or not the accused desires it . For example , a case which is tried by a summary court-martial is not only reviewed by the officers appointing this court-martial , but it is also subject to the supervisory powers of the officer who exercises immediate general court-martial 151 // jurisdiction over the command . A general court-martial case is reviewed not only by the appointing , authority , but , in addition , by the office of the Judge Advocate General of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases involving dismissal of an officer , the dismissal or suspension of a cadet , any sentence of death , and any sentence imposed on a general officer ) , a general court-martial case generally must be confirmed by the President . Thus it may been seen that the right of the accused to a review of his case is amply provided for without his having to obtain a " writ of error " or " bill of exceptions . " Lest it be misunderstood , and the accused be in doubt as to the rights of which lie may avail himself under the military system of laws , it should be continually emphasized that all of the essential rights of the accused are safeguarded in a court-martial trial by virtue of their incorporation into the Articles of War or the Manual for Courts-Martial . For instance , Article of War 24 provides against compulsory selfincrimination ; Article of War 39 prescribes a statute of limitations for certain offenses ; and Article of War 40 defines and forbids such trial of a person as may place him in double jeopardy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are generally recognized in the trial of criminal cases in the courts of the United States shall ( with certain exceptions ) , be applied by courts-martial . ( For further discussion , see p. 55 . ) Thus it may be seen that the military system of courts-martial is a system which gives to the accused all of his constitutional rights , while at the same time it places his fate in the hands of his superiors , who are guided and directed in their actions by " the rules and articles for the government of the Armies of the United States " ( as laid down in the Manual for // Courts-Martial ) , by their consciences , by the best of their understanding , and by " the custom of war in like cases . " Courts-martial are often referred to as " Courts of Honor " ? probably due somewhat to their origin as the " Kings Court of Chivalry " and because they are called upon to maintian a high code among the military . The doctrine of teamwork should always prevail in the military court-martial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of a great team anti should think well before setting the machinery of a court-martial in action . ff , after due reflection and deliberation on a case , he elects to initiate charges against an accused , he should be able to present sufficient facts to establish a prima facie case . If he can , the next member of this great team , the officer exercising court-martial jurisdiction , should carefully make the decision as to whether the charges are of such a character ( i.e. , apparently triable by a general court ) that a formal investigation under the 70th Article of War is necessary . If this investigation is necessary , the investigating officer enters the team and must play his part faithfully . Whether formally investigated or not , the charges are referred to a court-martial only if these charges are considered to be legally sound . ( If the appointing authority also exercises general court-martial authority , the charges are referred to a court-martial only after their legal soundness has been considered by the authority 's staff judge advocate . ) Once the charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team are brought into play , and it is their duty to work in close harmony , not only with each other , but also with the appointing authority . The trial should proceed with as little friction as possible , and in a dignified and impressive manner which can be obtained only when each member does his // part willingly and conscientiously . The court , judg ing a case on the facts presented , applies the law to these facts , arrives at a finding , and if it finds the accused guilty , it imposes sentence . This duty of imposing sentence calls for the greatest thought and care . The members should always be mindful of the fact that no sentence given by them can ever be increased , even though the reviewing authority may desire to do so . However , any sentence may be decreased , not only in the same form of punishment , but also by eliminating certain types of punishments entirely . Hence , a sentence should be commensurate with the offense , but not necessarily the maximum listed in the Manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court should not exercise clemency . That is the function of the reviewing authority . This right of review given to superior authorities is actually the key to the doctrine of teamwork in a court-martial trial . To illustrate : suppose two soldiers A and B , from two different organizations , were tried by the same court-martial for similar offenses , but were tried on different dates . In the one case A receives a relatively severe sentence , while B , because of his youth receives a comparatively light sentence . As soon as this information reaches other members of the two organizations , they begin to ask why and perhaps suspect some ulterior motive on the part of the members of the court . Naturally , discontent and dissatisfaction are apt to arise ; for when the workings of justice are not clear , soldiers are likely to conclude that an injustice has been done . In the case of the two decisions rendered on soldiers A and B it is impossible for the members of these soldiers ' organizations to understand intelligently these two decisions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , and they can not discover why the court // made these two decisions because the reason for the difference is not published in orders . However , if this court had given consistent sentences , and then had left it to the reviewing authority to exercise his right as guardian of the entire command by reducing the punishment of the deserving soldier in proportion to the extenuating circumstances , an entirely different picture would have been presented to the command . They would have known that the court considered both A and B equally guilty and worthy of the same punishment , but that the reviewing authority had a good , obvious reason for reducing the punishment of one and not of the other . This fact is more forcibly brought to the attention of the command if the reviewing authority takes advantage of the opportunity presented in the order promulgating the sentence to state his reasons . For instance , some reviewing authorities use expressions of this nature in their orders announcing a sentence , " In the foregoing case of Private John Doe , Company Z , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of the extreme youth of the accused , his very limited military service , and the special circumstances in his case , the period of confinement in excess of three ( 3 ) months is remitted . " Note that if a case involves five prior convictions within a year ( and within the current enlistment ) or if it involves two offenses ( which together authorize a punishment of more than 6 months ' confinement ) , then a general court-martial may be directed to try it even though the case would ordinarily go before a special or summary court-martial . In this event , the doctrine of consistent sentences for similar offenses must necessarily be departed from because a special court can never give a dishonorable discharge . // INVESTIGATION OF COURT-MARTIAL CHARGES General Duties Receipt of Charges . Suppose that you found , when you reported to headquarters at officers ' call , a set of charges for formal investigation . Just what procedure would you follow ? First of all , you would ordinarily expect to find attached to the charges : 1 . A letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which may include a recommendation as to which type of court-martial is recommended by that officer ) ; 2 . A directive for you to investigate the enclosed charges and to report thereon in accordance with A.W . 70 ; 3 . A summary of the expected testimony ; 4 . Any documentary or other real evidence available ( or a notation on the charge sheet of the location of such evidence ) ; 5 . A statement of admissible previous convictions of the accused . From the charge sheet you can determine the nature of the charges against the accused , his age , service , etc. , the names and addresses of available witnesses , and what disposition has been made of the accused ( whether or not he is in the guard house ) . Preparation . Bear in mind , at the outset , that the job which you are about to undertake is not a trial . I t is similar in many respects to a grand jury investigation , in which , in a civil case , the grand jury determines whether a man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the grand jury determines , by handing down an indictment or presentment , for what offense or offenses the 157 // man will be tried . Similarly , your function is to determine : 1 . Whether the charges are supported by proper evidence ; 2 . Whether the charges are in proper form ; 3 . What disposition should be made of the case in the interest of justice and discipline , i.e. , trial by a general , special , or summary court-martial , disposal by action under the 104th Article of War or other provisions of law ( e.g. , Army Regulations ) , or dropped without further action . At the first opportunity you will probably turn to the index of the Manual and look for " Investigation . " You will discover under it the sub-heading " Of charges See Charges and Specifications . " Therefore you must look under " Charges . " You thumb through the index to " Charges and Specifications " ; then you read down the list of sub-headings until you find " Investigation " with its various sub-headings . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Article of War 70 and to paragraphs 30c , 33 , and 35 in the Manual . Read all of these carel'ulty . When you feel that you understand the duties required , you should proceed with the investigation . Remember that Article of War 70 states , among other things , that any officer who is responsible for unnecessary delay in investigating a case may be punished by a court-martial . So take no chances and arrange for the investigation as soon as possible . You should notify the accused 's first sergeant ( if the accused is not in confinement ) , or the commander of the guard ( if the accused is in confinement ) , and arrange to have the accused present at the prescribed place and hour . You should then arrange for the attendance of all witnesses and for your inspecting all real evidence ( as listed on the charge sheet ) and not // appended to the charges . Note that an investigating officer does not have the authority to compel a civilian witness to attend an investigation ; nor has he the right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regulations clearly state that , unless specifically authorized , government funds are not provided for the payment of witnesses attending an investigation . Procedure . 1 . Duties toward the accused . With the accused and all witnesses present for the investigation , you should interview the accused alone . ( Ask the witnesses to remain outside the room . ) Since accused is not entitled to any counsel at an investigation , he should be made thoroughly familiar with his rights and privileges before the investigation proper takes place . You should explain the purpose of the investigation , read the charges and specifications , read the name of the accuser and the names of the witnesses listed on the charge sheet ; after this you should ask the accused if he fully understands what he is charged with . Further , you should ask the accused if he has any witnesses to call in his own behalf ; if he has , these witnesses , if apparently material , should be summoned and examined . ( See discussion , p. 160 . ) You should also inform the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposing witnesses , and to feel free to cross-examine these witnesses on their testimony . In the ordinary investigation , the accused is timid , and unfamiliar with the routine and legal phraseology ; therefore it is incumbent upon you , as investigating officer , to assist him in the cross-examination , and in other matters in which he displays ignorance of his rights . As required , you explain to the accused his rights as a witness , that is , you inform him that after all other testimony has been presented he may make a // statement either unsworn or under oath ( but that this statement is subject to use against him in the event of trial ) , or he may remain silent ( in which event no inference can be drawn as to his guilt or innocence ) . 2 . Evidence . With the above preliminaries out of the way , you should next proceed to take the testimony of each witness in turn and always in the presence of the accused . Because you must record the testimony of each witness , you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his expected testimony , if it accompanies the charge sheet , and to make any necessary alterations or additions which may be warranted as a result of the direct examination or cross-examination . You should place these witnesses under oath before receiving or reading their testimony . This may be required by the officer who appointed you ; but even if it is not , it is a desirable practice as an efficient aid in assuring that the testimony the witnesses give before you will be substantially the same as the testimony they will give before a court-martial . In the event that no summary of testimony accompanies the charges , you will be forced to frame your questions so as to bring out all of the relevant evidence . The usual practice is to ask the witness to tell what he knows concerning the case . You record , in substance , his direct testimony and the statements he makes under cross-examination . Since you may be called to testify as a witness concerning any inconsistent statement made by a witness , you should exercise care to record the testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , both for and against the accused , the latter , if he wishes , is permitted to make his statement in any one of the ways we have mentioned . If he elects to make a statement , you should show ( in your report ) whether or not it // has been made under oath and you should take care that the accused understands his rights concerning his statement . You should pay very close attention to his statements because you are subject to call to testify as a witness to any admission or confession which he may make , even though it is not your job to obtain a confession or to induce admissions . At sometime during the investigation , you should read to the accused documentary evidence such as extract copies of morning reports , reports of surrender or apprehension in cases of desertion , and other material papers , and fully explain them so that he understands them . Since the purpose of an investigation is to ascertain whether any military offense has been committed , and , if it has been , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you as the investigating officer have a highly important function to perform . You must see that justice is at all times preserved and , since you represent both the defense and the prosecution , you should be impartial . Your main duty is to gather and record facts which , legally speaking , are of such a nature as would be admissible as evidence in a court-martial trial . Therefore , you should not consider hearsay evidence , inadmissible opinions , inferences of witnesses , etc . Further you should not compel a witness to answer questions which may tend to incriminate him . You should warn the witness , if you consider it possible that by his answering he may tend to incriminate himself . Suppose that as the investigating officer you must obtain the testimony of a material witness who is in the hospital , or of a civilian witness who is not available to come freely to the investigation . In such cases , if their testimony is of great importance and if it is considered just to the accused , you may take // the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these witnesses wherever they may be . ( An investigation is not of fixed place , but may be moved if circumstances dictate . ) However , if the substance of any witness ' testimony may be had in written form , by interview or otherwise , and if the accused states that he does not wish to cross-examine such a witness , you need not call this witness . When the accused requests that a witness be called , you may properly request the accused to outline the testimony expected from such a witness . If the testimony would not materially affect your investigation , you should inform the accused that you will regard such testimony as having been taken . If he then withdraws his request , you should consider the matter in your deliberations and you should note briefly the facts in your report . As a general rule you should not be content with the testimony given by those witnesses listed on the charge sheet , if a thorough investigation on your part discloses the possibility of other material testimony . Remember that the preliminary investigation made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is likely to be rather sketchy . Your duty , however , is of paramount importance . It is mainly upon your recommendation that your commanding officer will rely in determining whether the accused is to be tried at all , and if he is to be tried , for what offense or offenses and by which type of court . Therefore , you should exercise the greatest diligence in making your recommendation , because no appointing authority wants to refer for trial a case which is based on purely frivolous and unsubstantiated evidence . 3 . Decision . After all the evidence is in , you should , of course , dismiss the accused and the witnesses . You should then consider by the weight of evidence whether // the charges should be upheld . That is , whether in your opinion a prima , facie case , based on the evidence , has been made against the accused . If you believe it has been you should make your recommendations accordingly and at the same time you should recommend the type of court-martial which you believe should take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ principle that the lowest type of court-martial which has the power to award an adequate and commensurate punishment ( if trial should result in a conviction ) should be the one to try the case . If the evidence does not make a prima facie case , as charged on the charge sheet , against the accused , but if the facts support a true case for a lesser included offense or for a different offense from that charged , you should make your recommendations accordingly . Consult freely the Manual for CourtsMartial for pertinent discussion of offenses , for the lesser included offenses involved , and for the statement of proof required for each offense . Make free use , also of Appendices 3 and 4 , M.C.M. , for the form of the charges . ( See also sample specifications listed in Chap . 13 . ) The following examples of lesser included offenses may suggest a lesser included offense of the one charged : Table // Lesser Principal Offenses Included Offenses Table // Table Again , if the evidence should clearly disprove the commission of any offense by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of your investigation that he is innocent , you should state that fact in your report . Do not hesitate to recommend " no trial . " Such a recommendation is not necessarily a reflection upon the person initiating the charges . It is , however , an indication that you are conscious of your duty toward the government , as well as toward the accused , and that you are performing your duty to the best of your ability . A thorough job on your part will prevent a great deal of unnecessary work on the part of the rest of the personnel concerned in the administration of military justice . Of course , if , as a result of your investigation , you are convinced of the truth of the charges , but if there is some question as to the sufficiency of the evidence , you should recommend trial by // the appropriate court ( the court which is appropriate to the accused 's rank , to the type of offense committed , and to the awarding of what you consider , in the light of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . It is , after all , the purpose of the court to determine contradicted questions of fact and to apply the law to them . 4 . Report . With the testimony of all witnesses actually written in triplicate , and with your recommendations arrived at , you should now forward this report of investigation by letter of transmittal to the appointing authority . The charge sheet , with its accompanying papers as you received them , should be attached to the report of investigation , when it is thus forwarded . ( For a suggested form of letter of transmittal and report to be used by an investigating officer , see Appendix 4 , of this book ) . Case of Private Blank As a typical example of the entire situation which we have just outlined , consider the case of Private Blank referred to in Chapter 5 . In this case , the company commander , after a preliminary investigation , has seen fit to prefer charges against Blank for the alleged offense of larceny . These charges after passing through the mill at headquarters have finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , you should ascertain the nature of the charge and specifications . When you learn that it is larceny , under the 93d Article of War , you should turn to " Larceny " in the index of the Manual , since your memory of the elements of larceny , and of the proof necessary to establish the offense is vague . As a subheading under " Larceny , " you will find " Definition , discussion , proof , " which are to be found on page 171. // You turn to this page , and after you have read along through page 173 , you will discover not only the elements of the offense , with their respective discussions , but also the various factors which must be proved in order to sustain the charge . You will invariably find listed in the Manual the essentials of proof of an offense in the last paragraph , under the discussion of that offense . As proof of larceny , you will note that there must be a taking and carrying away of personal property belonging to or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trespass ( that is , without the consent of the owner or the one in possession ) and must be done with the intent of depriving the owner or possessor permanently of his property . Further , the property must have a value , and this value as alleged in the charge sheet must be approximately substantiated by witnesses . Having in mind these various elements , you should now feel that you are fully prepared to conduct this formal investigation in the manner previously outlined . Throughout the investigation you should always be mindful of the facts to be proved , and you should endeavor , if possible , to bring them out by the testimony of the various witnesses . It is a rare occasion , indeed , when one witness knows everything about a case ; more often , many witnesses will be needed , because each will know a different angle of the case . Examine the case of Private Blank . One witness , Corporal Dunn , will undoubtedly be able to show the taking and carrying away of the fountain pen and coupon book . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fact that they are personal property . Witness Dunn will not be able to give any valuable assistance in establishing the value of the pen or in determining whether the taking was by // trespass . He has no direct information along these lines , and the best he can do is venture an opinion which , under these circumstances , is not permissible . Thus , the owner of the property , Corporal Sam , is called to support the two elements , trespass and value . For the proof of Blank 's intent to permanently deprive Corporal Sam of his property , you should examine the circumstances . You will see that the statement made to Corporal Dunn by Blank , when he was caught in the act , was that he ( Blank ) planned to write a letter and that he was going to buy writing paper at the Post Exchange . This was a plausible story , but it did not account for the taking of either the coupon book or the pen without permission . The logical deduction is that Blank intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was discovered . On the value of personal property involved in larceny cases , the Judge Advocate General holds that : " Other than as to distinctive articles of Government issue , and similar articles whose market value is not readily determinable , the value of personal property to be considered in determining the punishment authorized for larceny is the market value at time of theft . " ( Dig . Op . J.A.G. , 1912-1940 , 451421 . ) Assume , for purposes of discussion , that the circumstances did not indicate any intent on Blank 's part to deprive Sam permanently of his property . As a matter of fact , the evidence might have clearly negated this intent by showing that Blank intended only to borrow the pen and coupon book . If such had been the case , you can clearly see that one of the elements of larceny could not be sustained . Under such circumstances , you should not recommend trial for larceny as alleged , but rather you should recommend trial upon // the lesser offense of unlawfully taking and carrying away the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 96th Article of War . As the evidence at this investigation of Blank 's case tends to prove all elements of larceny , you should recommend trial by court-martial . Although this case is one of petty larceny , in peace time there should not be much hesitation on your part as to which courtmartial takes jurisdiction . To be sure , the limit of punishment for such an offense , as shown under Table of Maximum Punishments , Manual , page 99 , is only 6 months confinement ( with or without a dishonorable discharge ) , and it is true that a special court-martial can award this confinement ( without a dishonorable discharge ) ; yet the Army is no place for a petty ( riminal and particularly no place for a thief . Such a man is a menace to the morale of the organization and , if he is proved guilty , he should be dishonorably discharged from the service . Therefore , your recommendation should be trial by a general court-martial and not by a special court-martial . Even if your judgment should dictate leniency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an article of such minor value , you should still recommend the above action , leaving to the appointing authority the responsibility for the final decision . Since the appointing authority has placed faith in your ability to investigate and recommend , he will ordinarily support your recommendations if they are factually and legally sound . Thus , make it a rule to recommend the type of court which has jurisdiction to try the person for the offense involved and which is able to dispense justice based upon ( 1 ) the punishment which may be given , ( 2 ) any established War Department or local policies , ( 3 ) the custom of the service as to whether or not Blank should be dishonorably discharged . // However during this war the policy of the War Department is that the offense of larceny does not necessarily require that the offender be separated from the service . Leniency toward first offenders is especially encouraged . Furthermore , the broad War Department policy , as expressed in Mobilization Regulations 1-10 , March 5 , 1943 is as follows : " Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usual methods of punishment must be expected . A suggested solution that has proved satisfactory is to create disciplinary detachments in combat units so that recalcitrants will perform the more arduous duties while sharing the dangers encountered by their comrades . Only the worst criminals will be confined in military prisons during an active campaign . Offenses involving moral turpitude will not carry dishonorable discharge except in the most serious cases . All sentences carrying dishonorable discharge will provide for such discharge at a time well beyond the probable duration of the war . " Consequently in wartime a different recommendation would be justified in the case of Private Blank , and a recommendation for a special court-martial would be in order . If he was a young first offender it is possible that the exercise of good leadership in the nature of an appropriate admonition might be adequate , rather than a court-martial . From the above example , you may see that an investigating officer is definitely a guardian of military justice and that he is certainly one officer who is in a position to preserve the dignity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for trial , and by referring to general court-martial , only those cases consistent with its rank and prestige . the investigating officer utilizes to the best advantage the component parts of the system of military justice . // GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL Jurisdiction . As the name " general " suggests , this court-martial may take jurisdiction over any person subject to military law and for every crime or offense made punishable by the Articles of War . This courtmartial is not limited to the trial of military personnel , only , but it may try and punish certain civilians as well . For example , if a general court-martial is the type of court established by a military commander under a state of military government or of strictly martial rule , this court has the power to try and punish civilians for offenses committed against the military authorities within the said occupied area . Appointing Authority . Again , the word general may have been used co-extensively with the conferring of the power to appoint this type of court-martial . You can analyze this meaning by examining Article of War 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to appoint a general courtmartial . This Article of War reveals that these officers are not designated by rank . Rather , they are referred to as The President of the United States ( Commander in Chief of the Army ) , the commanding officer of a department , the Superintendent of the Military Academy , the commanding officer of an army , an army corps , a division , a separate brigade and of any other body of troops ( when the President empowers the commanding officers of such troops with this power ) . With the exception of the last-named i.e. , ( any other body of troops ) and of the President of the United States. , commanding officers of these various units are usually general officers . Hence this may appear to signify that it was intended that only general officers ( the exceptions were noted above ) have the 171 // power to appoint general courts-martial . This interpretation , however , is not entirely correct since from paragraph 5 , Manual for Courts-Martial , we learn that the power to appoint is based on command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command of a division would have the power to appoint a general court-martial . It is therefore more nearly correct to state that since a general court-martial is the highest military court of justice , its appointment is limited to those officers commanding the highest units of our Army . Qualification of Members . Because this general court-martial is so important , you would expect it to be composed of comparatively senior officers . While nothing in the Manual prescribes this , in practice this principle is generally followed . M.C.M. 4d , specifies that officers detailed on courts-martial shall be those " best qualified . . . by reason of age , training , experience and judicial temperament ; further , that " officers having less than two years ' service shall not , if it can be avoided without manifest injury to the service , be appointed as members of courts-martial in excess of the minority membership thereof . " Number of Members . Since a general court-martial is entrusted with the trial of major offenses , its minimum required number of members is greater than the minimum for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A. W. 5 as five members . If the number of members becomes less than five at any time before or during trial , the court can not function ( except to pass upon a challenge of a fifth member , or to adjourn from day to day ) . Therefore , as a general rule , the number of members detailed originally will be approximately eight to ten . Meaning of Member . In relation to the above two paragraphs , note that the word member refers exculGENERAL // sively to those officers who sit on the court-martial as members , and it does not include the trial judge advocate ( and assistants ) or the defense counsel ( and assistants ) . It is true that their names always appear on the court order ; yet they are not considered as members , but merely as part of the court detail . Hence neither is considered in the minimum number required for a court-martial nor for any other purpose when members are referred to . Detail of Law Member . Another distinguishing feature of the composition of a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law member This requirement is consistent with the relative importance of this court and with the type of cases referred to it . Many rulings on points of military court-martial procedure are necessary in a major case , and for this purpose , provision has been made in A. W. 8 for detailing an experienced officer who can perform such duties . His duties and rights are discussed in a later topic . Authorization of Reporter . The authorization of a shorthand reporter is also a distinctive characteristic of a general court . This authorization is contained in the order detailing the court and applies to all cases tried by this court . In exceptional cases , as noted in M.C.M. 46 , a reporter may be authorized for a special court , but since this authorization is rarely given , a special court usually proceeds without any reporter . Seating of Court . The proper seating of a courtmartial is in the shape of a U with the members of the court occupying seats along the base of the U. The president ( who is the senior member ) sits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated according to rank alternately to his right and left . In a general court-martial , the law member is sandwiched between the president and the member // of the court who would ordinarily sit on the president 's immediate left . By this arrangement , Be law member , regardless of his rank , is always on the president 's immediate left , and all other members of the court are seated according to rank alternately on the president 's right and the law member 's left . The wings of the U are given to the personnel of the prosecution and defense , the trial judge advocate ( and assistants ) occupy the wing most convenient for summoning the witnesses and handling the trial . The open end of the U is devoted to the witness chair and the reporter 's desk , if a reporter is present . ( See plate 6 ) In considering the duties of certain officers detailed on a court-martial , it is proper that attention be first directed to the one who perhaps has the most work to do prior to , during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trial judge advocate , commonly likened to a prosecuting attorney in civil criminal law . Trial Judge Advocate ( For check list of duties see Appendix 8 ) Selection . If you are selected as a trial judge advocate , it is probably because of your qualifications or your experience in military law . It is presumed that you know the various angles of any case and that you are able to prosecute it to a successful conclusion . Your duty as a trial judge advocate is usually in addition to your other duties , and thus it often necessitates extra hours of work . You may be , and you usually are , aided by an assistant trial judge advocate in a general court-martial . This helps materially but the responsibility for the final result still rests upon your shoulders unless you have been excused by proper authority from prosecuting a particular case . Therefore , regardless of the help given by // assistants , you will endeavor personally to supervise the preparation of each case . You will first be apprised of your selection as trial judge advocate when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , together with other officers , on a general or special courtmartial . The duties of a trial judge advocate are listed throughout the Manual , particularly under Appendix 5 . For a complete list , see Appendix 8 , herein . We offer here some supplementary discussion on a few of these duties . Duties Before Trial . Receipt of charges . Your serenity as trial judge advocate will be broken the moment you discover a bulky document lying on your desk , a document which even from a distance you will recognize as a set of charges . You thumb through the papers until you discover the charge sheet and you turn quickly to the charge(s) and specification(s) , where you learn the nature of the offense . You may have some misgivings because this is your first major case , but you need not be daunted . You should take advantage of the first opportunity that presents itself to check the charge(s) and specification(s) carefully to see that they are in proper form . If they are not , you correct and initial slight errors or obvious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made , you consult the appointing authority . Verify the first indorsement on page 3 of the charge sheet to see that the case has been properly referred to you for trial , and has been referred to the proper court . It is well to check the order appointing the court against the first indorsement to see that jurisdiction is conferred upon the proper court to try the case . Next you check to ascertain whether all the necesGENERAL // sary papers which should accompany the charge sheet are actually present . You look , particularly , for the report of investigation , and the testimony of witnesses pertaining to it ; you look for any documentary evi-dence and for the record of previous convictions . When you are satisfied that the charge sheet contains all the necessary papers , you should begin to segregate the duplicate copies of all papers from the original copies . You do this for the purpose of furnishing the accused ( or his defense counsel ) with a duplicate of the charge sheet , and with duplicate copies of all papers which you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you should have on hand two complete sets , each with a charge sheet and accompanying papers . Service on the accused . An accused is allowed a reasonable time in which to prepare his defense , after the charges have been served on him . Therefore you , as the trial judge advocate , should promptly serve on the accused a copy of the charges after they have been referred to you for trial . This immediate service is not as important when the case is referred to spe-cial court-martial for trial , as it is when the case is referred to a general court-martial . In the latter in-stance , the accused , unless he consents to waive his right , can not be brought to trial in peace time within the five day period subsequent to the service of the charges upon him . This is provided for in Article of War 70 , Manual for Court-Martial . The service of charges consists in delivering person-ally to the accused a copy of the charges and specifica-tions upon which he is to be brought to trial . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you for trial and the identity of the defense counsel . You // will inform the defense counsel of the court that the charges have been so served . After you have served the charges on the accused , you complete and sign page 4 of the charge sheet . Preparation of case . With these preliminary steps accomplished , you now begin the real preparation of the case . You study the Manual carefully for the ele ments of the offense(s) and learn what you must prove in order to establish your case . In a difficult case , see if there is any precedent established , either in the Digest of Opinion of the Judge Advocate General * or in any other legally recognized sources , in order to refer to them during the trial to show the prevailing principles of law . At your earliest convenience , you should carefully analyze and digest the testimony of the witnesses which accompanies the report of investigation and the expected testimony of witnesses which was procured by the accuser . You should notice particularly whether this testimony was or was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps sufficient for a carefully prepared case . It is almost always necessary to interview all witnesses personally prior to the trial . Much valuable information can be garnered from the personal interview of a witness . It enables you , in a great number of cases , to elicit some new and valuable information , as well as to make a close study of the witness . Thus you may learn in advance just how valuable his testimony may be , both from his seem ing accuracy and reliability , and from the straight-forwardness and positiveness of his demeanor . You may find that you can easily eliminate some witnesses apparent lack of knowledge , their inability to express who would not be useful for the trial because of their // themselves clearly or because other and better evidence is available . The problem of whether or not to call a witness is your responsibility and , in many instances , you may be forced to call a witness even though you might prefer not to . This is true when a questionable witness is the only one who can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , if the case can be established without the use of a poor witness , it is usually far better not to call him even though his testimony might tend to corroborate another witness ' testimony . The rule that a few reliable witnesses are always better than a great number of questionable witnesses , is a good one to follow . A case is seldom proven by the number of witnesses called , but rather by the reliability and accuracy of the witnesses regardless of number . Remember that " witnesses are weighed , not counted . " If a new angle should creep into the case as the result of an interview with a witness , you should exhaust every possibility for tracking it down because it may lead to something valuable . Rarely does the investigating officer learn everything about a case ; for this reason many a helpful piece of evidence is uncovered by a thorough " personal reconnaissance " made by you before trial . Whether the search brings to light some evidence which is helpful to you or helpful to the defense , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , it enables you to build up a counter-defense in the event that the defense counsel uses it . If you wish to , it is perfectly proper to bring such evidence to the attention of the ' defense counsel for whatever use he sees fit . Your job is to see that justice is done with fairness to all concerned ? the accused as well as the government . // The preparation of a case for trial , whether by you as a trial judge advocate or by the defense counsel , is simply a matter of ascertaining and marshaling all the facts that may be helpful or detrimental to your side . Since the M.C.M. provides for the use of depositions and stipulations , frequent use should be made of them under those conditions listed in the Manual on pages 89 , 90 , 91 , 122 , 123 ( depositions ) , and pages 31 , : 35 , 66 , 86 and 1.36 ( stipulations ) . You should interview the defense counsel frequently in order to accomplish these depositions or stipulations , and you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You should make the trial cost the government as little as possible consistent with just ice to all concerned Arranging for trial . Because the Manual requires an early trial in each case , you should notify the president of the court of the number of cases you have on hand , how long you have had them , and you should arrange with him for the date of the trial . This date may be fixed even though you and the defense counsel have not fully prepared your cases , if in your opinion you will have completed your preparation by the proposed date . If it should develop that neither of you is ready to proceed with the trial on the date specified , and that the statute of limitations may run in favor of the accused , the court should meet , arraign the accused and then grant a continuance either upon the motion made by you , or upon the motion of the defense counsel . However , as a general rule , before the date of trial is set , a reasonable time is allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time becomes necessary , the side which requires it may forward a letter to the appointing authority , through the president , requesting a longer time and giving the reasons for the request . This procedure apprises the president of the court and // the appointing authority of the cause of the delay , and it permits them to approve or disapprove the request . Close co-operation between the president of the court , the trial judge advocate , and the defense counsel should always prevail in order to expedite the trial . At the same time such co-operation grants proper consideration to the accused in his defense and to the trial judge advocate in the preparation of the government 's case . If a reporter is authorized for the trial , you will get in touch with him and request him to be present . If this reporter is habitually employed elsewhere , it may be necessary to arrange the date of the trial to correspond with his available time . In this case , you should communicate with the reporter before the date of trial is fixed . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you notify all of the witnesses needed by the prosecution and the defense , unless the defense counsel prefers to call his own witnesses . This notification consists of informing them of the place , date , and time of the trial . If the witness is military , the notification is usually transmitted to his organization commander . If the witness is a civilian , the notification is communicated by mail , phone , or subpoena ( for the latter , consult M.C.M. 97 ) . Coincident with the summoning of the witnesses , you should see that all of the court officers detailed are notified , either by phone , mail , or by a notice inserted in the daily bulletin ( if all members pertain to a single command ) . The accused will also be advised of the time of the trial ; if he is in confinement , the prison officer will be instructed concerning the trial and requested to have the accused present and dressed in a presentable service uniform , unless the accused is a general prisoner ( in which case he will appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trial , you may make enough // copies of the charges and specifications to provide one copy for each member of the court and for the person nel of the defense . This is not mandatory , but in a case which consists of many charges and specifica tions it is quite helpful . In addition , sufficient station ery , pencils , and other materials needed for a trial should be assembled and taken to the courtroom on the day of the trial . Since you are responsible for the preparation of the courtroom you should have it prepared in advance of the time set for trial , and you should inspect it personally to see that it is in proper order . Check for arrangement , cleanliness , sufficient tables , chairs , desks , etc . Since the trial judge advocate is the officer detailed to represent the government , you are in all respects the prosecutor for the United States . As such , your duty is similar to any other prosecuting attorney and the same faith , trust , and fidelity is reposed in you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bounds of a " prosecutor " and enter into the field of a " persecutor . " It is your duty to see that justice and honor are always preserved , even though it may entail the loss of the case you are prosecuting . Duties During Trial . ' In general . As a prosecutor , your duty is to summon the witnesses and administer the necessary oath to them . If the witness is a prose cution witness , you conduct the direct and redirect ex amination , and if a defense witness , you conduct the cross and recross-examination . You ask all prosecu tion witnesses and usually all defense witnesses the preliminary questions which establish their identities . Direct examination . It might be appropriate at this time to make a study of the aims and procedure // of the direct examination conducted by you , or by the defense counsel . In most cases , the side which calls a witness knows approximately what his testimony will be . Therefore , the aim is so to phrase the questions that the witness is quickly brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For this purpose , leading questions may be asked . However , once the testimony proper of the witness begins , leading questions are no longer permitted . Exception may be made by the court in the case of a witness who apears hostile to the side which has called him . Since you are somewhat restricted in the latitude of your questioning , it is incumbent upon you to make a careful study of the type of questions to use , not only in order to avoid leading questions but also to bring out all the evidence necessary to prove the case . The careful judge advocate ( or defense counsel ) will prepare a list of the questions he plans to ask each witness . He does this in advance of the trial , and after he studies the testimony given at the investigation or after interviews with the witnesses . For example , in preparing to prove desertion , the trial judge advocate may draw up a list of questions covering all essential elements and another list outlining the means of proving the elements as follows : Essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accused ? ( b ) Date of unauthorized absence of accused ? ( c ) Place where accused absented himself on such date ? ( d ) Date and place of surrender or apprehension ? ( e ) How was accused dressed when apprehended or when he surrendered ? ( f ) Did accused have any authority to be absent between dates in ( b ) and ( d ) ? // ( g ) Did accused make any statement regarding dissatisfaction before leaving ? ( h ) Was there a condition of shortage in the accused 's clothing and equipment when he left ? ( i ) Did the accused correspond with his organization during his absence ? ( k ) Did the organization get in touch with any agencies for the purpose of locating the accused during his absence ? Means of Proof ( 1 ) As to ( a ) ( b ) ( c ) above : extract copy of morning report . ( 2 ) As to ( d ) ( e ) above consult : verbal testimony or stipulated testimony . ( 3 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) ( k ) above : consult verbal testimony , usually by first sergeant , company clerk , or members of accused 's squad . ( 4 ) As to ( b ) above : consult verbal testimony , usually by supply sergeant . Cross-examination . Much has been said but very little written concerning the cross-examination of witnesses by the trial judge advocate ( or the defense counsel ) . Since the procedure is practically the same for both , the following suggestions are meant to apply equally to either . The matter of cross-examination is really a study in itself . No hard and fast rules can be propounded because of the variety of witnesses , the manner of their testifying , the subject matter of their testimony , and the psychological effect upon the court , all of which play an important role . It is possible , however , to lay down certain helpful points of guidance to bear in mind when the proper opportunity occurs . We believe that on these occasions the points that we shall mention may prove to be of great value . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the correctness of a witness 's testimony . For this purpose leading questions may be freely used . However , you must exercise a sound discretion in deciding when to cross-examine a witness . If a witness gives positive , outstanding testimony in direct examination and if he gives the impression of being sure and confident of himself , it is much better to dispense with cross-examining him . This is the best course to follow because , on repeated questioning , the witness becomes more emphatic and positive about what he knows ; thus , by his emphasis on these points he tends to impress the court even more favorably ? a detriment naturally , to the side which is doing the cross-examining . Do not " dislodge a spike in attempting to hammer home a few tacks . " On the other hand , if a witness displays lack of confidence , hesitancy , or in other words , if he is not a positive witness , many a telling blow may be struck at his testimony by the proper cross-examination . By the use of leading questions it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or at least to show so many discrepancies in his testimony that its structure as a whole will fall . It is with this hesitant type of witness , then , that cross-examination may be useful . However , if he becomes confounded and frequently makes inconsistent statements because of his lack of intelligence , you should exercise the utmost care to avoid a prolonged cross-examination which may hurt your case . The old adage that " still water flows deep " is applicable to a person on the witness stand . If he is calm , relaxed , and talks no more than is absolutely necessary , the chances are that you will get little to help you from cross-examination . The contrary is true if the witness is loquacious . That type of witness pre186 SOLDIER AND THE LAW sents a golden target for any cross-examiner because he is often so eager to expound that he gives little thought to what he says and whether it coincides with what he has already said . Inconsistency is his downfall . The over-zealous trial judge advocate or defense counsel who believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignores a valuable point . It is , indeed , a wise judge advocate or defense counsel who can remain quiet when there is need for silence . Silence is the best course to fol low with a witness who is turned over for cross-ex amination after he has given little help to the side which has called him . It is unwise to try to elicit information from such a witness , since your side has not suffered by his direct examination . To be sure , a valuable clue may be uncovered , but the chances are against it . In most instances of this kind , as a matter of fact , the contrary is true ? the other side profits at your expense . Thus , the old saying , " never go fishing on cross-examination , " is an excellent rule to follow particularly when the witness is the type we have jus described . All cross-examination is based on psychology . If the court is in a receptive mood , is not bored by the length of the trial , and displays keen interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may prove of the utmost value . If the court indi cates by its demeanor that it is restless and therefore your common sense warns against an undue prolonga tion of the trial , you should keep the cross-examination to a minimum . More harm is done by over-zealousness in cross-examination than can ever be compensated for , even by direct evidence . Study the temper of the court and watch its reactions to the cross-examination A wise judge advocate or defense counsel will know instantly when not to cross-examine or when to stop a cross-examination which is in progress . // Supervising the reporting . During a trial you should cast many a glance in the direction of the reporter , if one is provided . Prearranged signals between the reporter and you will help immensely . Such signals as the reporter 's holding up a pencil to indicate that the witness is talking too fast , or the reporter 's nod-ding his head to indicate that all is going well are commonly used . Bear in mind that a reporter must report all material proceedings in open court and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bound to see that the record is complete . Most general courts-martial have competent reporters , and it is rare that any lack of skill on their part in reporting interrupts a trial . Occasionally , however , a less skilled reporter must be employed ; in such a case , you should take plenty of time to see that the record is at all times kept up to date . In the event of a trial that continues for more than one day , it will be necessary for the court to recess or adjourn from day to day . Note : in that event you should sign the record of each day 's proceedings ( after it is typed up ) . Because you are selected for your experience or for your knowledge of court-martial procedure , you are occasionally consulted by the court for legal assist-ance . You should furnish such assistance and every other posible aid to the court . This is particularly true in a special court-martial , since in a general court-martial there is usually a law member , and therefore . your advice as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both the trial judge advocate and the de-fense counsel have equal rights to challenge during a trial either for cause or peremptorily . You should advise the court of the nature of the charges , of all persons who participated therein ( See page 6 , Su SOLDIER AND THE LAW plement , Section A ) and ask if any member is aware of any facts which may be a ground for challenge by either side ; if no member responds , you proceed to challenge for cause . A challenge for cause may be presented either by the trial judge advocate or by the defense counsel at any stage of the proceedings , if sufficient cause is shown and if due diligence has been exercised . Even though adversely determined , such challenges may be presented again if good cause is shown . ( See M. C. M. 58c ) . If there are no such challenges , or if there are challenges and they have been acted upon , you may then challenge any one member peremptorily ( except the law member who can be challenged only for cause @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the number of accused , the defense is entitled to only one peremptory challenge . A court which consists of six , nine , or twelve members is desirable from the point of view of the prosecution ; for in those cases which require a two-thirds vote , the prosecution has a . leeway of two or three members whom he need not convince , two or three members who may vote " not guilty , " and still assure the prosecution of a verdict of " guilty . " Whereas , in a court which consists of five , seven , or eight members , the margin of safety for a conviction varies from only one member to two because of the rule that a fraction of a vote counts as a unit ( one vote ) in favor of the accused ( M. C. M. 78d ) . For this reason , a court which consists of five , seven , or eight members should prove advantageous to the defense . However , you should not control your challenges merely by the fact that a court is favorable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ importance . It may be that you will prefer to sacrifice this advantage of numbers by chal  - -  lenging a member whose elimination from the court you would prefer because you know by intuition or // experience that this member is not favorable to your side . Thus you will be perfectly satisfied to lose a slight advantage in numbers , because you feel that you will have gained a distinct advantage otherwise . There are proper occasions and seemingly improper occasions for using the suggestions we have just offered . To illustrate , if two cases are on hand to be tried one directly after the other , it is unwise to challenge a member merely in order to reduce the court in numbers , and thus force the challenged member , if you are successful , to sit around outside waiting for the next case to come up . This is particularly true if the first trial does not give indications of being a close one . Beware , too , of challenging the same member every time unless experience has proven it to be necessary . Nothing offends and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in many instances , he has been put to some inconvenience in order to meet with the court . ( For other steps , see Supplement , Sec . A. ) Duties After Trial . General . When a trial has been completed , you should collect all the papers related to the trial and give them to the reporter if one has officiated . If no reporter has been employed ( as is the general rule in a special court-martial ) , you should keep these papers and have the necessary ones bound with the record of the trial . If a reporter takes custody of all papers he will not only type the record , but will also complete it by inserting all papers of an evidential character which were used in the trial . In any case , be careful to keep all notes ( and other written matter ) that you have made so that if a part of the record is lost , you will be able to reconstruct the necessary data . Record . When the record is completed , check it carefully for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If there are many minor errors , the page or pages of the record on which they appear may be retyped ; but if the errors are comparatively few , you may correct them in ink , and initial them . Do not undertake correction of major errors on procedure , testimony of witnesses , etc. , until you reach an understanding with the president of the court , the defense counsel , and the reporter . Even in such a case , remember always that a reporter is under oath faithfully to perform his duties and that he will normally report the proceedings as he hears them . His notes are usually correct , and it is unwise to assume that the notes are in error unless error appears to be clearly evident from the lack of coherence in the proceedings as reported , or from your memory of the proceedings , from that of the president or of the defense counsel . If this is the case , the record may be corrected accordingly . When you are satisfied that the record is correct , you will permit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done so , you will correct any minor errors which he has found . When the defense counsel and you agree that the record is complete you will sign the original and forward it to the president of the court for his verification and authentication . Since the president of the court is equally responsible with you for the accuracy of the record , he may have certain minor errors corrected . If he discovers a major error , he follows the same procedure for correction as the one we outlined for the trial judge advocate . When the president is satisfied that the record is in perfect order , he will authenticate the original by his signature , just as you did . The record is then returned to you . Once you have the record again , you will furnish a copy of it to those persons authorized to receive it , // who have requested it . ( Normally you will furnish a copy only to the accused . ) For all copies furnished , you will procure a signature on a receipt which you will attach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special court-martial , since a copy of the record of trial is not specifically authorized , no copy is made for the accused . ) In a general court-martial record , it is always incumbent upon you to verify the reporter 's voucher and authenticate it for payment . Therefore , you must ascertain the number of words in the record in order to be able to check the total listed by the reporter . It is seldom necessary to count each word ; it should suffice to count the total number of words on each of several average pages , get the combined total , find the average per page and multiply it by the total number of pages in the record . ( For the pay of a reporter , see paragraph 2 , Army Regulations , 35-4120 . ) Another of your responsibilities is to check the answers to certain questions on the data sheet , which is a part of the completed record of a general court case . When you have done this the record should be complete , and you forward it to the appointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after a trial in which civilian witnesses appear , you must arrange for the payment of their fees . This may be done during a recess or adjournment of the court , if the witness is no longer needed . On the other hand , it may be more expedient to wait until the case is completed , and then prepare these vouchers , have them signed , have the witness take them to the finance officer for payment , or send them to his office yourself . ( For information concerning fees allowed a civilian witness who attends a court-martial , see paragraph 3 Army Regulations 35-4120. ) // GENERAL COURT-MARTIAL ( Continued ) Defense Counsel Selection . Because of the importance of the duties of the defense counsel , who is the attorney duly bound to aid and assist the accused , this counsel should be selected with great care . To be sure , the accused may prefer to select a counsel of his own . He may do so under the conditions provided in M. C. M. 45 which states that the right is given the accused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military counsel if such be reasonably available , or civilian counsel if the accused so provides and pays all the expenses incident thereto . In a number of cases , whether in a special court or a general court , the accused is certain to avail himself of the services of the regularly appointed defense counsel ; hence his fate should be entrusted in as capable hands as the military service can provide . There is no fixed number of assistant defense counsels , or of assistant trial judge advocates . By studying M. C. M. 6 , you will discover that an appointing authority must detail a trial judge advocate and a defense counsel for each general or special court-martial , and when necessary , appoint one or more assistant trial judge advocates and assistant defense counsels for each general court-martial . Further , the same paragraph provides that as many assistant defense counsels as assistant trial judge advocates be appointed . Duty to Defend . If you are detailed as defense counsel on a court-martial you should feel that you have a duty to perform , a duty which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient a manner as possible . You should undertake the case and carry it through 193 // to a conclusion regardless of whether you believe or know that the accused is guilty . Your duty is to see that the accused 's rights are properly safeguarded and that his side is properly presented to the court . If you allow a belief that the accused is guilty to influence your actions and , consequently , do not defend him to the best of your ability , you are failing to perform your duty as a defense counsel just as much as you would be failing to perform any other duty if you allowed your performance to be influenced by the fact that you did not understand its purpose . Remember that there usually is much that you can do . even for a guilty person . It may merely consist in presenting an extenuating or mitigating piece of evidence , but whatever it is , it is your duty as defense counsel to present it in the trial . If you disregard this duty , you automatically breach the trust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live up to the government 's expectations of you . It is in the interest of the government to see that the accused gets a fair and impartial hearing , free from prejudicial error . If such error results , whether from the overzealousness of the T. J. A. or from the laxity of the defense counsel , it may necessitate the expenditure of time and money for a retrial . It is the duty of a defense counsel to undertake the defense of a person accused of a crime , regardless of the counsel 's personal opinion as to the guilt of the accused ; thus are protected innocent persons , victims only of suspicious circumstances , who might otherwise be denied proper defense . Having undertaken such defense , you are bound by all fair and honorable means to present every defense that the law of the land permits , to the end that no person may be deprived of life or liberty , except by due process of law . Similarly , the primary duty of an officer detailed as // a trial judge advocate is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The suppression of facts or the concealing of witnesses capable of establishing the innocence of the accused is highly reprehensible . The following is the Lawyer 's Oath on Admission to the bar , which is equally binding upon prosecutor and de-fender : " I will employ for the purpose of maintaining the causes confided to me such means only as are consistent with truth and honor , and will never seek to mislead the Judge or Jury by any artifice or false statement of fact or law . So Help Me God . " There may be times when you as a defense counsel are biased , prejudiced , or hostile in a particular case , or otherwise feel disqualified or unable properly and promptly to perform your duties . If this be so , you should immediately report the fact to the appointing authority so as to be relieved . You should do this in all fairness and justice to the accused and to your own sense of responsibility as a defense counsel . However , you should not resort to such a measure merely as a pretext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undertake the defense . Duties Before Trial . Interviewing the accused . When the charges have been served upon the accused by the trial judge advocate and a copy given either to the accused or to you as the defense counsel , you should arrange to study the charges , the report of investigation , and the attached testimony of witnesses at your earliest opportunity . After digesting all of this , you should call for the accused and interview him carefully and thoroughly . Let him know at the outset that you are the regularly appointed defense counsel , and ask him whether he wishes to request any indi196 SOLDIER AND THE LAW vidual military counsel , whether he wishes to procure a civilian counsel , or whether he is satisfied to be represented by you ( and assistants , if any ) . If he expresses a desire for individual military counsel or for civilian counsel , assist him in his request as far as you possibly can . If the accused elects to " take his chances " with you , apprise him carefully of your duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand at once that everything he tells you is in confidence and will not be disclosed , and insist upon knowing the absolute truth . Explain that your knowledge of the true facts works to his advantage in that it enables you to plan his defense carefully . Show him that the painting of an absurd , ridiculous , and false story will get him nowhere and will merely make you lose what faith you may have in him . Ordinarily , if you present such facts to an accused in the proper manner , he will not attempt to prevaricate , but will tell all that he knows . If he does mislead you and you discover it from interviewing a few witnesses tell him immediately of the folly of his attitude ; that he is wasting time which you might be spending profitably in his cause . Sometimes , getting facts is like pulling teeth but you ? like any lawyer ? can only hope to accomplish something with facts . Pleas . After listening to the accused 's story , you should ask him whether he wishes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to any particular ones . If he feels that he has no chance , he may prefer to plead guilty . If he does , you should inform him what this plea means , and if there is any defense , explain how it might be used to his advantage if he were to plead not guilty . If he still desires to plead guilty there is very little you can do except present whatever extenuating or mitigating evidence // there may be , and , in a proper case , prepare a recommendation for clemency . ( See page 209 . ) On the other hand , if the accused wishes to plead not guilty , and even if you are convinced from his story that there is no defense , you should not induce him to change his plea unless from prior experience you have learned that the court shows some leniency on a plea of guilty and , hence , you believe that it is to the interest of the accused to so plead . Avoid even any appearance of attempting to " high pressure " him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voluntarily and is given the maximum punishment , he can not " pass the buck " to you or have any feeling of having been forced or tricked . You should offer advice , but under no circumstances should you prevail upon him to do what he prefers not to do . Frequently , an accused will not know how he should plead and will inform you that he will do what you suggest . Even in this case , you should not make the decision , but rather you should point out to the accused the advantages and disadvantages of a plea of guilty or not guilty and permit him to make his choice . You should explain carefully to the accused that a plea of not guilty has no other legal significance than to force the prosecution to prove the case beyond a reasonable doubt . Many an accused has the feeling that if he pleads " not guilty " when he knows that he is guilty , he may be subject to being tried for this intentionally false plea or for perjury , and for this reason he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You should dispel this misapprehension so that the accused understands his position thoroughly . Challenges . Whether the accused elects to plead " guilty " or " not guilty , " you should read the court order to him and explain his rights of challenge . Per198 SOLDIER AND THE LAW haps the accused may wish to challenge a certain member peremptorily , or perhaps he can furnish a good reason for challenging a member for cause . In either event you should comply with his desires . If he should have no choice , but allows you to use your judgment , you should be guided by the hints previously outlined for the trial judge advocate . ( See p. 175 . ) Explaining the rights Of the accused . The accused has certain rights with respect to becoming a witness in his own behalf , and it is your duty , as the defense counsel , to explain these rights to him . The accused should be told that he may remain silent , in which case no inference may be drawn as to his guilt or innocence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is the most important to be explained to him . Too many accused have the feeling that they must say something or their fate is sealed . This is a fallacy and should be clearly pointed out to the accused . In some cases " Silence is. golden . " However , if the accused possesses valuable testimony , to remain silent would be a grave error . Another right that the accused has in his own behalf is to make an unsworn statement . You should explain this right to him , and tell him that such a statement carries very little weight as evidence because it is not subject to cross-examination . Of course this may appeal to him with the thought that he can make any untruthful statement without being guilty of false swearing or perjury . However , you should inform the accused that for this reason small value is attributed to such a statement and , in the majority of cases , it is better to remain silent than to make an unsworn statement . The remaining right which the accused has in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is // the right to be sworn like any other witness and to give his testimony under oath . This method of testifying is greatly favored if the accused has a defense of any importance . However , the fact that the court may allow a greater latitude in the cross-examination of an accused is or should be a deterring factor in the decision of any accused to testify , if he is simply offering a fabricated story . It often happens , in such a case , that the accused not only convicts himself , but secures as a result the maximum punishment allowable . If it is possible to do anything about it , you should not allow the accused to testify under oath unless you actually believe his story and are willing to have the court accept it . An accused often wants to talk , if for no other reason than to appear to be of some importance ; but he should be advised to the contrary and deterred , unless there is some good reason for his testifying . Preparation of case . You can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused has revealed his story . When he has done this , you should interview all the necessary defense witnesses and make a study of their testimony in much the same way as has been outlined for the trial judge advocate . ( See p. 175 . ) By doing this , you entrench yourself on firm ground instead of handling the whole matter in a " hit and miss " fashion . Many little details will be straightened out so that , . in the end , the defense will be brought forward in a logical and understanding manner . Avoid calling too many witnesses , particularly if they are all to testify on the same subject ( such as character , for example ) . Limit the number to a few and , of course , to the select few . Often , it is expedient to interrogate the witnesses who are listed to appear for the prosecution . You may thus ascertain in advance what type of witness each really is and // whether or not cross-examination would be profitable . Moreover , you often gain much from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and talks more freely . The same opportunity and privilege is extended to you with respect to depositions and stipulations as is extended to the trial judge advocate . The only difference is that the trial judge advocate is responsible for the preparation of the depositions , based upon the questions propounded by you , and that he mails the depositions and causes them to be taken and returned . You merely cooperate in the preparation of the depositions . You will find it advisable to correspond with a witness before having a deposition prepared . It may be possible for you to learn , by this means , what questions to ask , and , conversely , what questions to avoid asking because they are damaging . Make it a rule to learn everything possible about the expected testimony of a witness before that witness is called to give testimony , whether verbally or in deposition form . Remember that depositions , once obtained , may be introduced by either side and that you have no right to destroy or otherwise make unavailable such evidence . As for stipulations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and each obtains the consent of the opposition to introduce the stipulated testimony into evidence . ( For forms , see Supplement , Section A. ) When the necessary interviews with witnesses have been accomplished , and the pertinent depositions and stipulations agreed to and completed , you should have all the facts that you are able to acquire concerning the defense . Now you should plan the defense carefully , keeping in mind the fact that only procedure // consonant with good conscience and ethics is acceptable . If there appear to be two avenues of defense for the accused , select the one which is the better supported by the evidence and which requires the minimum of inferences or indirect evidence . If you choose that defense of the accused which is well supported by the evidence , you will certainly be more likely to engender a strong reasonable doubt of guilt and thus create a greater likelihood of acquittal . If a court is asked to indulge in conjectures or draw inferences in order to fill gaps in a defense , the defense is greatly weakened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense , you should remember that all non-confidential papers and documents which accompanied the charge sheet and which may be in the hands of the trial judge advocate are at your disposal . Close harmony and cooperation should exist between the trial judge advocate and you , because you are both vitally interested in seeing that justice is done , that the accused is prosecuted fairly and that he is given the best defense that is humanly possible . This does not mean that the trial judge advocate and you should share each other 's secrets , or that the case is tried before it goes to court , but it does mean that each of you should assist the other in bringing about a trial that is speedy , fair and without friction . Duties During Trial . Cross-examination . The old idea that a defense counsel is merely a figurehead , detailed on a court-martial simply to have an officer sit beside the accused , is clearly a fallacy . This misconception undoubtedly springs from the fact that formerly the activities of counsel for the defense were greatly limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often the duty is performed in a per202 SOLDIER AND THE LAW functory manner . ( Winthrop p. 166-7 . ) Such lack of activity is never more apparent than during the presentation of the prosecution 's side of the case . Of all times during a trial , this is clearly the worst for any defense counsel to allow-his mind to wander and to display little interest in the proceedings . Yet too many defense counsels feel that they can do little at this stage of the case and they prefer to save their talent and energy for the moment when the defense begins to dominate the trial . This is the wrong conception of a defense counsel 's duty . The defense counsel who is not attentive to the prosecution testimony loses a golden opportunity , the opportunity to strike many a telling blow at the prosecution 's evidence , and to puncture a would-be perfect case with quick thrusts , so that in the end a motion for a finding of not guilty may be made and sustained . Listen attentively to each prosecution witness 's testimony , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chance to cross-examine this witness on a dubious point . By putting properly worded questions ( leading questions , if necessary ) to the witness , he will frequently disclose one or two helpful points , or appear so uncertain that as a result his entire testimony is somewhat shaken . If no weak spot is evident in a witness ' testimony , yet you believe his testimony is unreliable , you should attempt to discredit it to the limit of your ability . Naturally , since not every witness presents an easy mark , you should make a careful study of every witness before pursuing a cross-examination . This study sometimes can be made before trial , but , in any case , the most effective time to study the witness is while he is giving direct testimony . The demeanor , the self-assurance , the reserved or ready replies of a witness to any questions form the basis for this study , and if all thcie are // carefully considered , there will be no doubt as to which witnesses a defense counsel should cross-examine , and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ previously been said concerning a trial judge advocate applies to cross-examination by a defense counsel . To reiterate in part , it is much better to permit a positive , excellent witness to go without any cross-examination than to give him an opportunity in cross-examination to emphasize points already made for the prosecution in the direct examination . Again , do not go fishing unless the bait is right , and unless you have some idea of what you expect to catch . ( See page 184 . ) Cross-examination may be used to lay the groundwork for impeaching prosecution witnesses . Impeaching a witness is the process of attempting to diminish his credibility . The attack may take several forms : previous conviction of a crime , general lack of veracity ( limited to general reputation for lack of veracity in the community where the witness lives ) , prior inconsistent statements , prejudice , bias , etc . All or any of these , if properly proven , have a tendency to cast strong doubt upon the value of a particular witness ' testimony . You must be alert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize good grounds for objections . Unintentionally , the trial judge advocate may transgress his privileges or a witness may indulge in the common practice of giving improper hearsay evidence and you should enter an objection . When objecting , or when addressing the court at any other time , you ( or trial judge advocate ) should stand and address the court respectfully . Although it is the duty of a defense counsel to object to all illegal evidence , yet in many cases silence is the better course of wisdom . Thus , if the evidence is clearly of no value , even though it is objectionable , it is better to offer no // objection , because such a constant practice becomes obnoxious . If the court is accustomed to having a defense counsel object to everything , it may pass over a real objection as simply routine and give little consideration to its value . A good rule to follow is to object when the evidence is damaging and to avoid trivial objections . Motions . When the prosecution rests its case , you can elect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if you believe the prosecution has failed to prove the case . This motion may be made on one , several , or all the specifications at one time . However , in making such motion , you must be prepared to show wherein the evidence presented by the prosecution is legally insufficient . Although such a motion in itself does not prejudice the case of the defense , it is not one in which the defense counsel often indulges . A court to which the prosecution has offered substantial evidence , from which reasonable inferences may be drawn , will not grant the motion , and hence it may look upon the motion as being merely clever or annoying . If however , there are good reasons for such a motion , it should by all means be made . If it is upheld you need not defend the one or more specifications on which the motion was made . If the motion is lost , you are no worse off for having made it because you still have the opportunity to present the defense . Presenting the defense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussed , has been taken , or , if the action has been taken and has been acted upon adversely , you may then make an opening statement . If the case is a minor one , the charges brief and not complicated , a statement is rarely made . However , if the case is complicated , it is a good idea for the defense counsel to make an opening statement placing his pan of deGENERAL // fense before the court and indicating what he hopes to prove . It is also helpful , just prior to each witness ' testimony to inform the court of the particular specification toward which this testimony will be directed . If the testimony is to be general , state this fact in order that the court may have some clear idea of what to expect . When and how an opening statement should be made and of what length is mainly a matter of judgment . Avoid making any opening statement unless the case requires it ; if it does , be as brief as is consistent with clarity and with the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense is to be based upon cross-examination of the prosecution witnesses , the opening statement of the defense counsel may be given prior to the prosecution 's presentation of its case ( usually just after the opening statement made by the trial judge advocate ) . With the preliminaries of the defense out of the way , you are now ready to embark upon the real work of unfolding the elements of the defense . To accomplish this , the witnesses should be called in such order as to present the evidence in logical sequence . " The military witnesses should be instructed to initially report to the president of the court and render the hand salute , but if accused is to be a witness he will not salute . " The defense witnesses are usually summoned before the court , as a matter of custom , by the trial judge advocate , but they may be summoned by the defense counsel . The oath , however , is always administered by the trial judge advocate ( or his assistant ) . When the witness is properly identified ( by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the defense pursues the direct examination . tTsually , since you have interviewed the witness before the trial the examination at the trial is simply a mailer of presenting the testimony to the court in the most direct man206 SOLDIER AND THE LAW ner . You should make the witness feel at ease and should instruct each witness as to the correct manner of testifying ? the proper tone of voice to use , the necessity for addressing the court when giving testimony , and for talking slowly and assuredly . You will find , as did the trial judge advocate , that it is helpful to list the questions which you intend to ask each witness . Thus you will avoid asking searching questions when you are uncertain of the answers . You will also be much more likely to present the evidence in a clear cut , positive manner . If new elements come into the case as a result of the prosecution 's presentation , you should make notes on these new points and attempt to rebut them with the testimony of your own witnesses . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions , or at least to depart somewhat from the system of fixed questions . Ordinarily , however , it would be in order to ask for one or two recesses and , during them , to question the witnesses on the new points before calling the witnesses in court . Thus , the questions to be asked can be framed in advance . The defense counsel asks the same type of questions , and employs the same manner and method in direct examination as does the trial judge advocate . Therefore , our previous discussion of the direct examination , as conducted by a trial judge advocate ( see Chapter 7 ) , is equally applicable here . You should assist the defense witnesses in the preservation of their rights , and invite the court 's attention to any unusual or unnecessarily severe cross-examination conducted by the trial judge advocate . The court is the protector of the defense witnesses , as it is of the prosecution witnesses . Throughout the entire case , that is , prior to the trial , during the trial , and to a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the accused 's rights . You should enter the necessary challenges , special pleas , and motions for the accused , after explaining them to him and obtaining his consent . Rarely does an accused understand these procedures , and he would be in a more or less helpless state if you did not act for him . The same is true of the general pleas , " guilty " or " not guilty , " or of the general plea , " guilty with certain exceptions and substitutions . " ( Such , for example , is the plea , " not guilty of desertion but guilty of absence without leave " . ) If the accused testifies under oath as a witness in his own behalf , you should be exceptionally careful of the questions you ask the accused and should see that he does not wander in giving his testimony . Many a defense counsel is criticized for failing to persuade an accused not to testify . When the accused does testify , the defense counsel is often frowned upon for not limiting to a certain few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always be understood that the defense counsel is looked upon as the adviser as well as protector of the accused . As such he is usually held responsible for any wrong step pursued by the accused . Even if there are no defense witnesses to offer , it is rare , indeed , for the accused to have no suggestions of extenuation or mitigation . There may be no defense , as such , in certain cases , but often there are witnesses who are willing to testify and capable of testifying to an accused 's good character . Although the testimony of such witnesses will never suffice as a defense , it may cause the court to show some leniency . The defense counsel should therefore , avail himself of such testimony . It may be introduced before or after the accused testifies or , if the accused does not testify or make any statement , it may be introduced at any time before the defense rests its case . // Remember that the court is just as anxious as you , to render a just verdict based upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Therefore , you should do anything you can to help accomplish this objective . Recesses , etc . A defense counsel should always feel that he has the same rights and privileges as the trial judge advocate to request recesses and adjournments . If a witness has been on the stand for a considerable length of time and if , from fatigue , he is becoming unintentionally lax in his answers , it is a good idea to request a recess of a few minutes . A recess is also in order and you should request it , if it becomes necessary to interview a witness before calling him . However , a request for recess , like any other request , is a matter of using good judgment . It does not speak well for the defense to seek many recesses or to employ dilatory tactics . It tends to give a court the impression that a case is not fully prepared . When it is obvious that the court is becoming tired of a day 's proceedings and that there is no chance of completing the defense within a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of witnesses still to be called and of the estimated time necessary for the completion of the defense . Then you should request the court to grant an adjournment to the following day or to any other day . Of course , if it is necessary to have a certain witness appear and if he is not available and will not be for a couple of days you have the privilege of asking for an adjournment , whether or not the end of a day 's proceedings is near . There are many reasons for requesting a recess or adjournment ; but it is the court which makes the final decision on these requests , and if it does not see fit to grant either , you are bound thereby . Argument . Whether or not a closing argument is in order is a matter of judgment of the defense counGENERAL // sel . If the trial judge advocate elects to make no opening argument and if you prefer to keep the trial judge advocate from making any closing argument , you should submit your case without any argument . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the final closing argument , but he is limited in this to a rebuttal of the defense 's argument . Hence if the defense makes no argument , there is nothing to rebut and the trial judge advocate may be precluded from emphasizing his case . If a case is complicated or rather long , and involves many witnesses , it is a good idea to sum up those points proved by the defense which tend to overthrow the prosecution 's side . It is also effective to show , in this summing-up , just how and in what particulars the prosecution has failed to prove the case . For this summing-up , you may use , to refresh the court 's memory , a chart showing the digested testimony of each witness as given in court , or you may use any other similar graphic aids ( drawn upon paper or upon a blackboard , etc . ) . One picture is worth a thousand words . Unless a case requires a closing argument , you should never feel that you have to make one . The idea that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing your duty is absolutely erroneous . You gain more by saying nothing than you would by talking when you have only a ridiculous argument to present . Therefore consider the matter carefully before making your decision . Duties After Trial . Clemency . If an accused is found guilty and sentenced , you still have the opportunity to submit a plea of clemency in behalf of the accused , if the case is worthy and deserving . Your first step is to ask the members if any or all would like to sign such a plea of clemency . If they would , prepare the
