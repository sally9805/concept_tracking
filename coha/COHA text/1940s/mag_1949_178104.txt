The Senate finally began doing something about the Government 's long-under paid hired hands . Convinced at last that the U.S. could not get first-class service for second-class salaries , it voted some $476 million a year in pay boosts for the 1,600,000 members of the armed forces and 1,400,000 Government employees . With only perfunctory appeals to economy , the Senate approved : <P> A $61 million-a-year raise for about 500,000 U.S. postal workers-an average of $100 each ( but only half the amount the House had voted ) . <P> A $110 million boost for 885,000 civil-service employees-an average of $125 each ( but trimming the pay limit of $15,000 set by the House to $12,500 ) . <P> A $304 million House bill , increasing pay rates for men &; officers of the Army , Navy , Air Force , Coast Guard , National Guard , Air National Guard , Coast &; Geodetic Survey and Public Health Service . <P> Urgent Appeal . Although the nation 's fighting men were already the highest paid in the world , military pay , particularly for officers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the first general brass-to-rookie pay boost in 40 years . Some samples : a corporal , who got $42 a month before World War II and now draws $105 , will get $132 ; a master sergeant drawing $157 before the war and $283 now , will get $363 ; majors will move up from $484 to $560 ; brigadier generals from $712 to $961 . <P> After the big bills , with only the smallest of the Administration 's pay bills left to pick on , the Senate began worrying about economy all over again . For two days it haggled over the Administration 's proposal for boosting the salaries of some 250 key U.S. officials . Harry Truman sent an urgent letter to Vice President Alben Barkley to prod the Senate . The reason the proposed increases seemed so large , he argued , was that they had been so long in coming . Wrote the President : <P> " The 15 top executives of a single private corporation in this country i.e. , the E. I. du Pont de Nemours &; Co. , which pays its top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aggregate salary now paid to all the 250 or so federal officers to whom this bill applies . " <P> New Equality . After a little more grumbling , the Senate gave in-but not before it had lopped almost a half off the President 's proposal , which the House had already approved . Cabinet officers were jumped from $15,000 to $22,500 a year ( instead of the $25,000 Harry Truman requested ) ; Presidential Aides Clark Clifford and John Steelman got raises to $20,000 ; White House Secretaries Charles G. Ross , William D. Hassett and Matt Connelly to $18,000 . The under secretaries , assistant secretaries , bureau heads and commissioners who run Washington 's alphabetical beehive were raised to $15,000 - approximately the amount Congressmen and Senators voted themselves in 1946 . <P> But the new equality might not last long . After thinking it over for a day or so , Congressmen were beginning to talk this week about raising their own pay again-this time to $25,000 a year .                  @ @ @
