THE LOVED ONE ( 164 pp. ) - Evelyn Waugh-Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> " Of course , parts of Brideshead are wicked , really wicked . But does one have the feeling that Evelyn Waugh himself is wicked enough ? " <P> In a dingy Manhattan bar , some members of the Waugh cult were measuring out their lives with swizzle sticks . They had been badly shaken by Brideshead Revisited ( TIME , Jan. 7 , 1946 ) . Unlike Waugh 's earlier novels , its irony had not been outrageously funny , and the typical Waugh mood , bright , pardlike and impermeable , had been clouded by a sweat of nostalgic and religious dither . Worse still , Brideshead was the first of Waugh 's novels to become a U.S. bestseller . His fans had reluctantly winked at the fact that he is a conservative and a Roman Catholic convert . But popular ? No literary cult can tolerate popularity in its prey . The boys were preparing to dump Evelyn . <P> " I know what you mean , Eustace-is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can make the spiritual leap from malice to malignance ? " <P> " After all , if he is ever to mature as a satirist , he must stop tickling the public 's toes , and start cutting its throats . " <P> " Instead of simply festering , as in Brideshead , like an old , old staphylococcus , my dear , in a duodenal ulcer . " <P> " I am afraid poor Evelyn has begun to take the problem of evil seriously . " <P> " How very tiresome . " <P> Last week Novelist Waugh was tickling toes and cutting throats again . The Loved One , his first novel published in the U.S. since Brideshead , was in the eager hands of U.S. readers , most of whom did not know whether to gasp , hoot or holler at the uncomfortable feeling that they had been smudged with soot from a crematory . The title was Waugh 's creamy trade name for a corpse . A tale of love and suicide among the morticians of a cemetery that physically resembles Hollywood 's fabulous Forest Lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loved One was either Novelist Waugh 's most funereal horse laugh or a retch of glacial rage at two of America 's most cherished deceits-its effort to prettify death and to vulgarize love , and hence escape the impact of both . Intellectuals were bitterly divided over Waugh 's intention . But the book , which was richly laced with the fun of embalming fluid , might well become a bestseller . <P> The Book . Last year Metro-Goldwyn Mayer offered Waugh $150,000 for the film rights to Brideshead . It was a situation worthy of a Waugh novel . It is explained , according to Waugh , by the fact that none of the top studio brass had ever read the book . When Waugh demanded " full Molotov veto rights " over the script , the deal fell through . <P> Waugh 's Hollywood trip was not wasted . He was fascinated by the ritual for disguising death which is big business in Southern California . Waugh spent every day that he could get away prying into the fatuous , sumptuous necropolis of Forest Lawn . The result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horizon . Editor Cyril Connolly devoted the entire February issue of the highbrow British literary monthly to Waugh 's short novel . This smart devotion paid off . Horizon for February was sold out in a week .
