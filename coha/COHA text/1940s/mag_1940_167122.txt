I wo n't sign for no $10,000 ! " barked pompous Dizzy Dean last spring , scoffing at a 50% cut in the salary he had been getting from the Chicago Cubs the past two years . A few weeks later , after his baying had successfully reminded every baseball fan that " Ol ' Dizz " ; was still in the game , Loudspeaker Dean characteristically signed his contract . Last week , proving as useful to the Cubs as a wet firecracker , the celebrated fireball who had been purchased two years ago for $185 , - ooo cash ( and three able-bodied players ) was bunted back to the minors , his arm crippled at 29 . <P> If people remember baseball a hundred years from now , Dizzy Dean will probably be remembered as one of the great pitchers of the 20th Century . In his first five years with the St. Louis Cardinals he averaged 24 victories a year . His 17 strikeouts in one game ( in 1933 ) still stands as a four-star feat in modern baseball . But to this generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand words , " may be better remembered for his performances off the field than on . <P> <P> In 1932 , when he joined the Cardinals , U. S. sportswriters yipped with glee . A bumptious bumpkin , he was vague about his name ( sometimes it was Jerome Her man Dean , sometimes Jay Hanna Dean ) and his birthplace ( either Texas or Oklahoma ) . But he was crystal clear about the fact that " Me'n ' Paul " ( his younger brother who joined the Cardinals two years later ) were the two best pitchers south of the North Pole . In 1934 he boasted that " Me'n ' Paul " together would win 45 games for the Cardinals ( they won 49 ) . <P> To anyone within earshot , the tall-talking southwesterner blustered about his stunt ( which never actually happened ) of getting married under floodlights at the home plate of a Houston ball park , about his registering at three St. Louis hotels at one time so that he could flop when he liked . On sizzling hot days he would build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in a blanket , do an Indian war dance . One night , out of ennui in a Philadelphia hotel , he and two teammates , dressed in painters ' overalls , dragged ladders and paint cans into a crowded ban quet hall , began to redecorate the walls . <P> Because of these antics , reverberating through the press , Dizzy Dean became the Rube Waddell of his time . <P> Last week , when " OF Dizz " ; got his walking papers , he was in a Chicago hos pital recovering from a scalp wound , received in typical Dean fashion : the door of an automobile in which he was riding had jerked open , toppled him out on his head . - We 'll be back - do n't forget that , - chirped Mrs. Dean , explaining that the fabulous cripple who can no longer pitch overhand had asked to be sent to Tulsa , where , under the hot sun ( most Tulsa games are played at night ) , he would develop a sidearm delivery , make a come back next year . <P> Owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some return on his **27;14268;TOOLONG investment - sent Dean back to the Texas League un der option ( subject to 24-hour recall ) and sent a personal tutor along to give him pointers on sidearm pitching . But few fans expect ever again to see Wrigley 's white elephant in a Cub uniform .
