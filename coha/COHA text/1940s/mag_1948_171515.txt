Should French Canadian writers follow French traditions or strike out in their own way , even if it is a North American way ? For two years the question has sparked a lively debate among French Canadian intellectuals . <P> Ren Garneau , Montreal critic and devoted apostle of French letters , sounded the first sharp note . With apprehension he had watched the rise of such French Canadian writers as Gabrielle Roy , whose Bonheur d'occasion ( Accidental Happiness ) became a U.S. best-seller as The Tin Flute ( TIME , March 17 ) . Her story of a Montreal slum showed unmistakable U.S. influences . Wrote Garneau , in the 1946 literary supplement of Montreal 's Le Canada : " We can not escape the zone of influence of a mighty literary power . If it is not France it will be America . " French Canadian authors , said he , should turn to France . Besides , " Americans do not like literature . " <P> Retorted Robert Charbonneau , Montreal writer and publisher : " Let the facts talk . If Americans do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writers like Hemingway , Steinbeck , Faulkner , Dos Passos , Thomas Wolfe , Eugene O'Neill ? " <P> After that , it was anybody 's fight . Roger Lemelin , author of Au Pied de la Pente Douce , a story about Quebec City , took the middle way . Obviously , he argued , French Canadians have the intellectual characteristics of their race , but it is natural that they should write about their North American surroundings . <P> Last week Charbonneau sounded off again . He told La Socit des Editeurs Canadiens du Livre Franais : " It is by being Canadians and proud of it that our writers will assert themselves . . . . While modern French literature is in full decadence , while its techniques are obsolete . . . why should our younger writers continue to tie themselves exclusively to it ? " <P> In the literary todo , more than artistic attitudes was at stake . During the war , such Quebec publishing concerns as Charbonneau 's Les Editions de I'Arbre had a free hand in launching French Canadian novels that might otherwise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . French publishers , on the other hand , squirm as Quebec-printed books run into big editions . Said a Paris critic : " French Canadians should be ostracized . They are going to ruin our market .
