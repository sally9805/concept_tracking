 | Super-Salesman of Music Condensed from The Etude + Doron K. Antrim Pat Gilmore , band leader extraordinary , combined 1000-piece orchestras , choruses of 10,000 , and batteries of cannon in the most colossal musical jamborees ever staged THE PLACE is New Orleans , the time 1864 . Louisiana has been returned to the Union , a Union sympathizer has been elected governor , and the Union Army desires a rousing celebration . Massed in Lavette Square are 5000 singers , bands n imbering 500 pieces , and a huge drum-and-bugle corps . And high on .1 podium , directing the whole stui , eudous ensemble , is Patrick Sarfield Gilmore , army bandmaster and e showman . Bands and chorus swing into Gilmore 's own composition dramatizing the occasion ? When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again . The crowd goes wild . Other songs follow . But the . knockout number is Hail , Columbia ! " ' or this Gilmore has assembled a row of cannon , one of which booms in each beat of a thunderous drum . The effect is staggering . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ musical shows put on by Patrick Gilmore , who knew how to make a band concert as exciting as a circus . With a fine sense of the spectacular , he brought totiler in the course of his ebullient career orchestras of 1000 and 2000 members , choruses of 10,000 and 1000 . Touring the country with his mid after the War Between the States , he introduced the hinterlands to the bassoon , bass horn and Beethoven . In his wake amateur bands sprang up ; people drove to the towns of a Sunday to hear them . Following his footsteps , John Philip Sousa and scores of other band leaders covered the country with crack concert bands . That so many school kids play in bands today is due largely to Patrick Gilmore . Yet the man is almost as uncelebrated now as was the raring-to-go Irish lad of 19 who burst on Boston , the cultural hub of the nation , in 1848 . As a boy he had mastered the cornet and had come to America with a regimental band . In Boston he was soon playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in putting a fine polish on a band was quickly recognized ; he formed his own Gilmore 's Band and remained its head until his death , save for his Civil War service first as bandmaster of a Massachusetts regiment and later as chief of army bands . The New Orleans show only whetted Gilmore 's appetite for another , even grander , musical festival . The idea of a National Peace Jubilee came to him in a " vision " one June day in 1 867 . Choirs from every state in the  | Union singing great music together would foster a friendlier feeling among people sundered by war . " A vast structure rose before me , " he wrote , " filled with the loyal of the land , through whose lofty arches a chorus of io , 000 voices and the harmony of 1000 instruments rolled their sea of sound , accompanied by the chiming of bells and the booming of cannon . " Aglow with this idea , he hurried home to tell his wife . Mrs. Gilmore commented : " When the hosts of Angel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be there directing it . " For his Jubilee , Gilmore envisioned an auditorium to seat 50,000 persons . ( Madison Square Garden in New York seats only i8,5oo . ) One of Boston 's best architects agreed the gargantuan structure could be built and drew up plans . But Boston 's city fathers thought the Peace Jubilee fantastic . New York was likewise cold . So was the federal government , when Gilmore asked backing for a festival coinciding with Grant 's inauguration . Gilmore , his Irish dander up , determined to see the project through himself . Returning to Boston , he canvassed for subscriptions , pleading with merchants , hotel proprietors and railroad heads who might profit by the venture . No one wanted to be first to subscribe . The leader was feeling pretty low the day before Christmas when by chance he bumped into one Josiah Bardwell , to whom he had sent an outline of the festival . " You 're just the man I 'm looking for , " boomed Bardwell . " I think your Peace Jubilee is a great idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $5000 . That started the ball rolling . Excitement mounted as the nation ' . press reported the progress of t1 Temple of Peace . It was to cover t city blocks and was to be illuminate by thousands of star-shaped gas jet Four balconies were to run around the sides . Its retiring rooms were t be " completely equipped for ever necessity of nature . " Pat Gilmore staged ingenious publicity stunts to fan the nation 's inter . est . A specially built bass drum , ' feet in circumference , was exhibited to goggle-eyed crowds as it was taken from New York to Boston . The organ installed in the Temple had pipes the size of factory chimneys . Daily excursions disgorged hordes from adjacent cities to witness the colossus taking shape . But the feverish musical activity of people all over the land who were to participate was the best stumulant . Picked bands were rehearsing daily . Eight hundred choirs fro Maine to California were lifting voice in Mozart 's Twelfth Mass , Gounod 's Ave Maria and other programme numbers . Gilmore provided them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute directions f singing it . Days before the opening , a huge and varied crowd , the like of whit ! f the city had never seen , began pouring into Boston ? lumbermen fro ' the north , southern gentlemen wit their ladies , New England 's first fam lies . Half fares prevailed on all rail roads . Choice seats for the five-do festival went for $ i oo apiece . Came June 15 , 1869 , the great day . At three o'clock the doors were closed to crowds still clamoring to get in . A hush settled over the throng as  | Edward Everett Hale rose in the dim vastness of the stage and offered a prayer . Then Gilmore appeared , and the applause shook the building . Fifty thousand pairs of eyes now foesed on this man atop a high stand he raised his baton . When it came down , organ , orchestra and chorus ' nrst with mighty tone into Luther 's floral , A Mighty Fortress Is Our God . Just as the number drew to a close , thee sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ore had planned it that way . The feet was overwhelming . Press wires buzzed with the miracle . During the intermission a visitor telegraphed 1 his wife , who had felt she could not afford the trip : " Come immediately . Will sacrifice anything to have you here . Nothing like it in a lifetime . " The hit number was Verdi 's Anvil Ch orus . As a prelude , red-shirted Boston firemen marched out and stood like statues before 50 anvils . Soon the sparks were flying as hammers swung i perfect time with the choristers . 1s the piece proceeded , bells pealed d finally a battery of cannon on the outside ? fired electrically from a ow of telegraph keys on Gilmore 's and ? boomed an awesome climax . The crowd was almost hysterical . After the first concert a listener described his impressions . " There was a mystic quality to the music impossible to analyze . It bore you up as on a great tidal wave . You felt the beauty of brotherhood , the majesty of America . Tears rolled down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The festival continued throughout the week . At the second concert President Grant and his cabinet walked down the broad center aisle to the strains of See , the Conquering Hero Comes ! One afternoon a visitor from Chicago , overcome with emotion at the singing of Let the Bright Seraphim , quietly expired . It was the only fatality . Gilmore showed resourcefulness at all times in keeping his far-flung cohorts under control . Once the chorus got completely out of hand while singing , significantly , All We Like Sheep Have Gone Astray . Gilmore tried strenuously to round them up , shouting orders through speaking tubes to lieutenants throughout the chorus . When he saw it was hopeless he turned on his cannon and drowned out the singers . The piece came to a roaring halt . Then he began again . After the festival a grateful Boston citizenry presented a purse of $40,000  | to the beaming band leader who had " awakened the country to such musical enthusiasm as it had never known before . " Gilmore went to Europe to recuperate from his labors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he was already dreaming of another , bigger and better . Opportunity to build it came with the ending of the FrancoPrussian War . To celebrate this event Gilmore organized the World Peace Jubilee , to be held in Boston in 1872 . He promised that it would be twice as large as the National Peace Jubilee , and he made good . He got together Europe 's top bands , including La Garde Republicaine from France , the Grenadier Guards from England , the Kaiser Franz Grenadiers from Berlin . Johann Strauss came at a reputed $20,000 fee to lead his band in The Waltz of the Blue Danube . The festival lasted three weeks and made the leader 's name an international byword . The last of Gilmore 's big shows was given in Chicago the following year , to celebrate the city 's recovery from the great fire . Then , having achieved the ultimate in quantity music , Gilmore turned to quality . His objective was to build the world 's leading concert band . In those days bands were for parades . Gilmore envisioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believed it could play great music with more spirit than a symphony orchestra , which he considered effeminate , high hat and a foreign importation . The band he felt to be virile and heroic , more in keeping with our inherent energy and itching feet . With this ideal in mind , he combed the world for the finest players , and paid them handsomely . One of his cornet stars , Jules Levy , received $750 a week , good money even today . The remarkable precision of his band , however , was due to his own electric enthusiasm . Adept at advertising , Gilmore announced his concerts on circus-size posters . People drove miles to hear them . At the old Madison Square . Garden , in New York , he hung up a record that still stands : 150 consecutive concerts , packing in 10,000 persons at each concert . Some of his numbers invariably had the audience on its feet cheering . Gilmore had a trim military figure , and he made a striking picture in a uniform which glittered with medals , some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To the end of his life he never showed age . The fall of 1892 found Gilmore playing at the St. Louis Exposition . He was 63 , and planning a round . the-world tour , his third . But one evening an assistant conducted in his place . Gilmore had not been feeling well . Between numbers a note was handed the assistant . In halting tones he read : " Patrick Gilmore died at 7:45 p.m. of a heart attack . " There was a stunned silence , then unrestrained sobbing by the men in the band . When President Harrison received news of the leader 's death , he said , " I do n't believe it . Pat Gilmore could n't die . " And he was right . Gilmore 's irrepressible spirit lives on today in every American kid who toots a horn .
