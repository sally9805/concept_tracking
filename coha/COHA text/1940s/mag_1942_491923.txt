T E:TY GROVE 'S race really ended July 25 , 1941 , when he achieved his three hundredth big-league victory , but it was n't until December ninth , nearly five months later , that modern baseball 's greatest pitcher admitted he had crossed the finish line . It was an admission made under duress  --  duress which consisted of the imminence of an unconditional release from the Boston Red Sox , the granting of waivers by fifteen other big-league clubs , and the persuasion of his best friends , among them Tom Yawkey , Eddie Collins , Connie Mack and Joe Cronin . You see , Lefty rather expected to go right on pitching forever . Despite the burden of years , the evidence of a swollen waistband and the complete loss of his famed fireball , Old Mose withdrew reluctantly . " It 's tough to take your shoes off just like that , " he complained to Yawkey , the night they snipped Grove 's career at the Red Sox owner 's hunting preserve on South Island , South Carolina . It sure is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vinegar-coated veteran as any man , who had paid him good money over eight seasons , and who had borne with him through a succession of crises until he reached his three-century goal . But what 's the use of going on ? " asked Yawkey . " Who cares if you win seven or eight more games ? Why force yourself to get in condition just to win a couple of games in the spring and fall ? " " That 's why I 'm quitting , Tom , " said the pitcher . " I 've been thinking it over . It 's hard work getting in shape , and pitching in the summer is just about too much for me . I guess I 'm through . " The next morning , as Grove and Jim Gibson , superintendent of the island , strode away in the twilight before dawn , guns under their arms , the pitcher probably scared all the game within a mile 's radius when he exclaimed , " Well , I 'm through ! There 's nothing left for me now except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized in September that Boston no longer wanted him . After he had won his three hundredth game , the papers told him to put his arm in a sling before he disgraced himself . Reporters and photographers stumbled over him heedlessly in the daily rush to get at Ted Williams , the young squirt who was hitting .400 . The echoes of whispers reached him : he was cluttering up Joe Cronin 's pitching plans . So one day near the end of the season the dam of his temper broke , and Old Mose made a fiery clubhouse speech , concluding with , " And if the Red Sox do n't want me , Connie will give me a job . I 'll get a job somewhere . " Tom Yawkey wanted to discuss Grove 's status then , but the pitcher said , " Not now . I 'll see you down at the island in the winter . I want to do some thinking . " And early one morning , less than two months after he rang immortality 's gong with his three hundredth victory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his personal belongings and left for his home in Lonaconing , Maryland . There were no farewells . He wanted none , for he was bitter  --  bitter as always when beaten , and now he had lost to time . At that poignant moment when Old Mose walked away from Fenway Park , he probably would have yielded all his cherished records for one more triumphant season . But if he never throws another ball , Grove has carved himself a niche . His three hundredth victory was no trivial conquest ; it was attained by only two men in the previous quarter century  --  by Grover Cleveland Alexander in 1924 and Walter Johnson in 1920 . Of the dozen men to win 300 games , only Grove won all his with the modern rabbit ball . The Mound 's Top Step G ROVE lived to win . Victory was a caress , de- feat salt in a spike wound . He kissed Jimmie Foxx when the chubby slugger tripled home the winning runs of his three hundredth triumph , bought beer for the boys , took a swig of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred wo n't be so tough . Quit ? Hell , this is the biggest thrill of my life ! I 'm just starting now . " He threw a killer-diller of a victory party for his teammates  --  one that Joe Cronin and Teddy Williams smartly skipped , The tension that had mounted on everyone , when Grove 's ebbing powers threatened to strand him at 299 victories , slacked like a broken garter after he staggered to a 10-6 victory over the Cleveland Indians . Frenzied at the possibility of frustration , Grove suffered and made his teammates suffer until he reached his goal . He was hard to live with . The crest gained , however , the reaction set in . It was thrilling to see the old codger strive for No. 300 ; it was boring to see him labor for No. 301 . Five times he failed to win ; and the fifth time something gave way under his ribs . It was then that he made his little speech and went home . Grove pitched once more  --  the last day of the season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runs in the first inning , and he retreated to the showers . It was sad , bitingly sad , because while the greatest pitcher of his generation stumbled toward oblivion , cheers were ringing for the new idol , for a Ted Williams who was making six hits in eight times at bat that sunny Sunday afternoon , to be the first American Leaguer in eighteen years to hit over .400 . The contrast was painfully perfect . The fans gave Grove a chest of silver that afternoon before he responded with his token performance  --  the same fans who had gaped at him when lie was in his prime with the Athletics , from 1925 to 1933 , the fastest southpaw of them all . He was the man who had won thirty-one games and lost only four in 1931 , who had won sixteen games in succession , and who had helped pitch the A 's to three straight pennants . Now , on probably his last day as a big-league pitcher , they saluted him . Someone on the Philadelphia bench , stirred into remembrance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better guy now . All Lefty used to have was a fast ball and a mean disposition . " Overhearing the remark , a sparse old man with pale blue eyes and nervous fingers chuckled softly . Connie Mack said , " I took more from Grove than I would from any other man living . He said things and did things ? But he 's changed . I 've seen it come , year by year . He 's got to be a great fellow . " Stories had come back to him about the man he had sold to the Red Sox after the 1933 season , the man who was responsible for so many of his fine gray hairs . He knew // well enough that Grove always had been a generous father to his son and daughter , a kind and considerate husband . He knew he had helped former teammates on a touch now and then , helped friends and slipped occasional bills to bat boys . He knew , too , that Lefty came to see him every winter  --  paid the Old Man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jimmie Foxx told him how Old Mose had roomed with him coming North one spring and they 'd got along swell . " Just him being with a fellow like Tom Yawkey has changed Mosey , " Foxx had explained . Did n't Boston give him a huge banquet and a silver service that cost $1200 in 1939 ? And he put on a Tuxedo , sat in the seat of honor and made a speech ! That was hard to believe , but it was true . One spring , they said , he tutored Johnny Vander Meer , he who had regarded any other southpaw as a personal challenge . Change ? Why , with his own eyes he had seen him running in the outfield , shagging balls in batting practice , feeding halls up to a kid pitcher . And he 'd been told how he joked all the time  --  wrestling with Tom Yawkey , pounding Eddie Collins and giving the girls in the office fits . Lefty Grove had got to be a great fellow , Connie Mack repeated firmly , that last day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , always thought him a great fellow . They never made him mayor , but then he never ran . He just wanted to be a sort of mountain character . He lived in his simple frame home in town with his wife , kids and dogs . When he came home , it was fall ; when he left , still winter . They have n't seen much of Lefty Grove , summers , in Lonaconing , not since 1920 , when he hiked off to Martinsburg , West Virginia , to play ball for money . Why He Pitched in Martinsburg He had quit school when he finished the eighth grade , because he felt like it , and worked in the silk mill , oiling machines . for fifty cents a day . Sometimes now he lights a cigar that costs fifty cents . From the silk mill he went to the glass factory for $2.50 . When it burned down , he tried the mines for a couple of weeks . But he was smart enough to get out instead of staying there digging coal for fifty-four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was seventeen , he worked one summer on the railroad , laying rails and driving spikes . That was almost as hard as the mines , so he went into the new glass factory as a needle etcher and got good money ? $5.25 a day . That 's when baseball became important . He 'd played with other kids some , on a diamond skinned from a pasture , but he never got really interested until they asked him to play in near-by Midland . He played first base , and then he pitched . One day he heat the Baltimore and Ohio team from Cumberland , and the railroad-team manager said , " I 'll get him a job and we 'll have him on our side next year . " Grove went to the B. &; 0 . shops in Cumberland , twenty miles from home , as an apprentice mechanic . He 'd probably still be building locomotives if a stranger from Martinsburg had n't come up to him one day in midwinter , and said , " Why do n't you come down and pitch for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bob did n't trust him much . " What for ? Why should I pitch in Martins-burg ? " " For a hundred and twenty-five dollars a month , " said the stranger . The next thing Bob said was , " When do I start ? " " In the spring , " said the stranger , " but first you got to sign a contract . " So Bob , only twenty years old , signed a contract and made it legal . And in the spring Bob used his B. &; 0 . pass to go to Martinsburg , which was a dirty trick , because he has n't yet pitched a game for the railroad . When Lonaconing saw Grove again , Martinsburg had sold him to Baltimore for $2000 to pay for a new fence , he had pitched in the Little World Series for the Orioles and had $1861 in his pocket . He and his home-town sweetheart , Ethel Gardner , thought that was plenty for a young couple wanting to be married . Since then he has seen much of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Lonaconing is still home to Grove . Up in the house , to which few ballplayers have ever been invited , he has souvenirs of his triumphs , raffia baskets full of balls , pictures in frames , razor-edged daggers from Japan . Down at Lefty 's Place , the town 's bowling-and-billiard emporium which he bought for $5700 in 1929 for his brother , Dewey , and his brother-in-law , Bob Mathews , he has a big refrigerator where he freezes the game he shoots . When he is n't hunting , or telling tales of the outer world at Lefty 's Place , he 's probably home in his shop making miniature furniture and toys on his lathes for the neighborhood children . In Lonaconing they 'll tell you that Robert Moses , son of John and Emma Grave , born March 6 , 1900 , always was a good guy , if you knew how to handle him . Connie Mack knew how to handle him . If he had done nothing else , some baseball men will tell you , Mack would have been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never was a team player . When Grove was a rookie taking beatings regularly in 1925 , he locked his door against a kindly manager who sought to solace and advise him . He had periods in which he would speak to no one , others in which he would speak only to abuse . On the bench he censured teammates . Sometimes he refused to walk batters intentionally , and lie practically ignored the fine arts of holding runners close to base , of backing up bases , and of fielding bunts . He particularly eschewed the bull pen . Grove recalls that his bitterest argument with Mack took place over a relief assignment in Cleveland in 1933 . Grove had no sooner entered the game in the pinch than Bob Johnson misjudged a line drive in left field , letting two runs score . Scaling his glove into the dugout as he came off the field , the pitcher shouted , " That 's the last relief pitching I 'll ever do for this club ! You guys save your own lousy games after this ! " " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't tell me how to talk ! " said Grove , throwing his jacket on the floor and kicking it . " I 'll tell you how to talk , " replied Mack , hopping off the bench with animation , walking over and giving the jacket a kick . Turning to Rube Walberg , he said , " Go down and warm up , Walberg , and we 'll get a real pitcher in this game . " As Walberg hastened away , Grove said with a leer , " Yah , and send down your whole staff , and you can put ' em all in , too , because you 'll need ' em all to get anybody out . " But when the Athletics took the field , Grove sullenly picked up his glove and returned to the mound . The Athletics won , 4-2 . That evening , when Grove in his gruff way tried to apologize to Mack , the manager said brightly , " Oh , that 's all right , Robert . We all get worked up sometimes , but you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 1-0 beating in St. Louis , when he was trying to win his seventeenth successive game in 1931 for a new American League record . The Athletics had not been shut out previously , but on this occasion , August twenty-fourth , they were held to three hits by Dick Coffman , a relatively obscure pitcher . Al Simmons was out of the line-up with an injured foot , and it was the unhappy lot of his substitute , Handsome Jim Moore , to misjudge a fly , which let in the only run scored . As Grove charged into the clubhouse like a mad bull after the defeat , door panels splintered , water pails crumpled into scrap metal , buttons popped from his uniform and lockers landed in the middle of the floor . Mickey Cochrane got as far as " Hard luck , Lefty , " when he was blasted into a confused retreat . Moore , who bore the brunt of Grove 's anger , could have broken the pitcher in two , but making allowances for Grove 's disposition , he shut his ears to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That night Mack soothed his suffering star , not by pitying him but by praising Coffman . He said , " Robert , did n't Coffman pitch a wonderful game today ? We made only three hits , and we would n't have scored a run if we 'd been still playing . " Mack hammered on the thought until Grove at last agreed that Coffman had deserved to win . In his late years , Grove could recount such an episode with a feeling of pride . " I could really get mad in those days , " he 'd say with a chuckle . A professional tantrum thrower , he tutored teammates in the tricks of uniform destruction . Once when the irate Bill Werber had broken a toe by kicking a bucket full of water , Grove rebuked him , saying , " First , you always ought to kick an empty bucket , and , second , you should always kick it with the bottom of your foot , not your toe . " Werber used the advice to advantage . Although admired in the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the press . As king of pitchers , he was a tyrant with reporters . He spurned the great with the small . John Kieran and Joe Williams , New York columnists , avoided Grove for years , because early in his career he had rebuffed them . Later , when time was running out on him , he went out of his way to make friends with the writers , and among the fastest of these was Kieran . Five-Mile Fury Grove sometimes indulged his temper at the expense of teammates . In 1936 , when he had nine victories against one defeat , he put on an epochal performance in Chicago after losing , 4-2 . He charged the Red Sox with not making enough runs for him , and asked , " Do you think Grove is going to throw his arm off for you hitless wonders ? " His best friend in the ranks , Jimmie Foxx , stood up to him . Looking him in the eye , Double X said , " Mose , we 're doing the best we can , for you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He shut up , but for days cut the club . Refusing to ride with the players , he walked from Comiskey Park to the hotel by way of Michigan Boulevard  --  more than five miles . Tom Yawkey flew with him to St. Louis , but when he pitched there , Grove had nothing on the ball . His fever of anger burned away slowly ; he lost ten of the last eighteen games he pitched . Often , after losing , he would pitch batting practice , and so work off his anger . Grove pitched some great ball in batting practice . But one day he threatened to get hack at his teammates in a novel way , when he told the Athletics , " If you guys do n't score some runs for me the next time I pitch , I 'm going to run around the park ten times . " He allowed rookies no liberties . In a practice game in 1930 , an Athletics rookie , Doc Cramer , hit a solid double off Grove . The next time he came up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it was an accident , " says Cramer , " until a few days later , when I bounced a ball off Grove 's shins in a pepper game . Sure enough , the next time I hit against him , he bruised my ribs again . " II Duel of Giants Joe Kuhel had a similar experience when he played for Washington . He doubled off Grove in a pinch , and then , feeling chesty , started to jockey the pitcher from the dugout . Grove could n't discover who was riding him , so he beckoned Mickey Cochrane to him , and said , " Find out who that loud mouth is who 's on me . I 'll take care of him when he comes up . " Cochrane found out . He told the pitcher , with the inevitable box-score result : Hit by pitched ball , Kuhel , by Grove . Grove professed to be afraid of no batter , not even Babe Ruth . His first meeting with the Bambino produced sparks . It came in an exhibition game at Baltimore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time he faced Grove . As Ruth shuffled to first base , he growled , " These dumb minor leaguers . They do n't know where they 're throwing the ball . " Blazing , Grove retorted , " I know where I 'm throwing the next ball to you Ruth . I 'm not afraid of you . " Grove fanned Ruth nine times in eleven tries in exhibition games , but when he went up to the A 's , he had only fair luck with the slugger . Ruth hit nine homers off him through the years , one with the bases full . The two stars , temperamental opposites , had little use for each other . Ruth provoked Grove by leaving him off his all-star team in 1921 , the year Grove won thirty-one games and was voted the most valuable player in the American League . Grove told the world that Jimmie Foxx hit the ball farther than Ruth , and would have set a home-run record if the parks were built for right-handed hitters . Despite his truculence , Grove never walked off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of a game by an umpire and never had a fight . He was n't the fist-swinging kind , and men he disputed with always seemed ready to make allowances for his greatness as a pitcher . The fiery Cochrane challenged him on occasion , but Grove never responded . Rube Walherg , the capable Athletics southpaw whose ability was obscured by Grove 's fame , although he sometimes drew the harder assignments , had a formula for handling his teammate . Said Walberg , " I let him set the pace . If he says ' Good morning , ' then I say ' Good morning . ' If he says nothing at all , I say nothing . " If Connie Mack and the A 's overlooked his eccentricities , Jack Dunn , of Baltimore , invited them . When Grove reported from Martinsburg in 1920 , Dunn called him over and said , " Kid , when I cuss you and bawl you out , do n't pay no attention to me . I get steamed up sometimes , but do n't mean anything by it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go peddle his fish the first time the manager reprimanded him , and thereafter he was let alone . Dunn did not coach him , advise him or discipline him , except that after the twentyyear-old southpaw had beaten Jersey City , 9-1 , in his first start , Dunn asked him , " Who taught you how to pitch ? " " Nobody ! Learned myself , " answered Grove truthfully . Dunn measured him an instant , then growled , " Well , learn the rest yourself . Only remember this : never let up . Keep firing that ball , no matter where it 's going . " That 's how Grove pitched for the great Orioles through the better part of the five seasons he was with them . " It was nothing for Lefty to fill the bases on passes , then strike out the side , " says Bill McGowan , who umpired Grove 's first games in both the International and the American leagues . Grove always has said that he could have been winning in the majors after 1922 , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with fellows like Jack Bentley , Joe Boley , Tommy Thomas , George Earnshaw and Rube Parnham on his side . Then , Dunnie paid big-league salaries . Grove went from $175 a month his first season to $7500 for his final season . And there was little discipline . Dunn only asked that his teams win , and how they won  --  seven pennants in a row ! The Athletics got Grove because of a close Dunn-Mack friendship , and because they were willing to pay big money . Mack had seen Grove beat his team , 5-0 , fanning thirteen men , in an exhibition game , and he knew that a big-league team had never beaten Grove in an exhibition . The purchase price was $100,600 . Grove used to say , " The hundred thousand was for my pitching , the six hundred for my hitting . " Actually , it was Dunn 's idea . When the papers were being drawn up , he said , " Connie , let 's make it a little more than a hundred thousand ; then it 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red Sox for Babe Ruth . Let 's make it baseball 's biggest deal . " Big-League Freshman Mack agreed , and $600 was added to the original price . The story goes that Dunn , an inveterate gambler , won a nice sizable bet for himself , because he always had boasted that Grove would bring the biggest price ever paid for a ballplayer . Did Dunn and Mack ever think that Grove would wind up playing for a manager , Joe Cronin , who was bought for $250,000 ? At the start , Grove was n't so good as he thought . He had won 108 , lost 36 games for Baltimore in four and a half seasons , and with his terrific speed had fanned 330 men in 303 innings in 1923 , but the American League was tougher . The first batter to face him singled . Grove was knocked out of the box in his first start . He did n't win a game until the season was three weeks old . His first-year record showed ten victories against twelve defeats . He gave a flash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first season , when he lost 1-0 in fifteen innings to Herb Pennock at the Yankee Stadium . That game taught Grove a lesson . As he said , " Pennock showed me what control meant to a pitcher . I pitched a good game , but with half as much speed and effort , Pennock pitched a better one . " Grove worked for rhythm and control . He developed a sweeping style which is pointed out as flawless . " I do n't throw with my arm or shoulder , but with the base of my spine , " he once said . To improve his control , Grove pitched by the hour on the side line to Earl Mack . He enjoyed warming up before the early customers , and hearing their exclamations as his fast one cracked into the coach 's sticky mitt . Grove overcame his longing to get rid of the ball quickly by counting to himself between pitches , and in those years crowds used to ridicule him by counting aloud , " One , two , three , four , five IP The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little schooling ; his spelling was sometimes mysterious , his penmanship a puzzle and his speech rough . Nor was he a natural athlete , but Grove had amazing baseball savvy . When the big leaguers started wearing him out in the late innings , he forgot about strike-out records and learned to pace himself . Grove was intelligent enough , always , to change losing tactics . " Some people , " Connie Mack said , " believe that Grove was only a thrower , but I always said he was a smart pitcher . He always knew what he was doing . " Horsehide Hero Grove had his best years under Mack . His five-year record of 128 victories and 33 defeats for a percentage of .795 from 1928 through 1932 , is unmatched in baseball history . He is the only modern left-hander to win thirty games a season . In 1930 he won four games in six days . In 1933 he shut out the Yankees for their first scoreless game in 309 contests . In the 1929 World Series , after the A 's had scored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Grove came out of the bull pen to fan four of the six men to face him in the last two innings . Grove likes to recall such strong-armed stunts as these : With the tying Yankee run on third base in the ninth inning , he struck out Lou Gehrig , Babe Ruth and Bob Meusel on nine pitched balls . Another day he relieved Jack Quinn with the bases full and struck out Ruth , Gehrig and Tony Lazzeri on ten pitched balls , with only Lazzeri hitting a foul . And yet , in the mind of Eddie Collins , Grove 's finest achievement was still before him . " Lefty had a sore arm his first year with the Red Sox , " Collins explains , " and without Connie Mack to lean on , he became panicky . The wonderful thing was that he refused to quit , but changed himself over as a pitcher , and went on to enjoy some of his best years in Boston long after he was supposed to be through . " In spring training of 1934 , after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffered his first sore arm , and although he had infected teeth and tonsils removed , it did not disappear until the last two weeks of the season . Mack was accused of selling the Red Sox a lemon , and when Grove 's record consisted of eight victories and eight defeats , he was counted out . For the first time in eight years , the southpaw failed to win twenty games . About as pleasant as a wounded she-bear , Grove packed his bags several times , but he never did quite catch the train for home . Surviving the agony of that season , he was ready with new weapons  --  a curve , fork ball and hairline control  - -  when the 1935 campaign opened . He had learned a lot about pitching while he had his sore arm  --  enough to be a twenty-game winner again . More serious than his sore arm of 1934 was his dead arm of 1938 . ' When his record was fourteen victories and three defeats , Grove fielded a bunt and made an off-balance throw to first base . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed lifeless . When Yawkey came down from his box to see what had happened , the puzzled pitcher said to him , " It 's dead , Tom , like a piece of fish . I ca n't feel anything . " Grove 's left hand was cold . There was no pulse . They took him to a hospital and kept him in bed by hiding his pants . Specialists were vague , but finally called it " intermittent claudication , " and prescribed a glass boot to restore circulation . Three weeks later Grove tested his arm against the Tigers , with no success . He did not win another game during that season , and when it was over they had him washed up and hung out on the line . He rested his arm all winter and trained carefully in the spring . When doctors said there was too much nicotine in his system , he gave up his seven cigars and half can of tobacco a day . He made one concession to time ; he pitched only once a week . The program fitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four in 1939 . At the age of thirty-nine , he led American League pitchers for the ninth time in earned-run percentage . Grove needed fourteen victories to reach the 300 mark when the 1940 campaign opened , but the man with the scythe was catching up with him , and he took the greater part of two seasons to complete the course . His weight soared when he stopped smoking . The stripling of Baltimore now weighed 215 pounds . Furthermore , the man who had never made the mistake of trying to save his fast ball made the error of trying to save his energy . Grove was weakening fast when Coach Tom Daly warned him that he was taking it too easily , so the great pitcher took a deep breath and went back to hard work , even stooping to the chore of feeding balls to the batting-practice pitcher , because it made him bend . And to cut down his weight , he went back to smoking . Baseball 's Lone Wolf Grove was always willing to make a personal sacrifice in order to win . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In late years he made a rule of taking naps before he pitched , and on those days the Red Sox locker room resembled a huge boudoir , with Grove snoozing on the training table and hairy-chested teammates tiptoeing around , saying " Sh-h-h . " He rarely had his arm manipulated , but he would protect it with an extra sleeve cut from a heavy undershirt . He feared air-conditioning , and blamed the modern sore-arm epidemic on polo shirts and chilly Pullmans . Thoroughly independent , Grove lived his own life , made his own rules and picked his own company . Secretary Phil Troy , of the Red Sox , learned that Grove had to have berth lower five always ; that Grove was to be roomed on the sixth floor , if possible , but never above seven ; that Grove 's meal checks , which consistently ran about $3.25 for dinner , were not to be challenged . Grove ordered without looking at menus . One of his whimseys was to buy neckties , shirts or hats for his favorites on the ball club . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand over a package , and say , " Here  --  here 's a decent-looking necktie . I 'm sick of looking at that thing you 've got on . " Grove had a set routine . If pitching , he got up late and ate a hearty breakfast , but no lunch . If not pitching , he opened the dining room for breakfast , and ate a light lunch . Usually he retired at 9:30 and went to sleep over a pulp shoot-'em-up , after taking the receiver off the telephone . He rarely went to the movies more than once a week . He gambled , but not much , for he never could stand being taken . His response to outsiders , the buzzing flylike fans , fitted his mood . Against his flinty personality , wave after wave of insurance salesmen , autograph hunters and glamour hounds was shattered . There was the embarrassing moment in Detroit when he left Jan Garber , the orchestra leader , standing with outstretched hand . Sometimes he relented , but he never lost the ability to growl an unmistakable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when giving an autograph . He liked the small towns encountered on exhibition trips , where he 'd overhear people on the corners whisper as he walked by , " There 's Lefty Grove . " During the 1931 World Series , he anticipated the demand by having a rubber-stamp signature made . It came in handy one day in Cleveland . Grove sat for an hour in the hotel lobby during a high-school-band convention , with a million or so kids crowding around him , and stamped autographs on a pad of paper , tearing them off and handing them out as he contentedly smoked his pipe . Grove would n't autograph a picture or book that carried his name , arguing , " It 's already got my name on it , has n't it ? " as though his signature served only a utilitarian purpose . And he was careful not to autograph blank checks , for he once heard of someone doing that . Grove saved his money . Government bonds and bank interest were good enough for him , even hi those boom postwar days when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speaker and other affluent A 's saying , " Well , I made ten thousand dollars on the market today . " Or , " Lost five thousand dollars on Consolidated this morning , but got it all back on Amalgamated . " The stock crash left Old Mose unhurt . Once in his life , in 1931 , he was a holdout , and he resembled a little boy with a peeve  --  having fun while pouting . The Red Sox never had trouble signing him , and so much admiration did Grove have for Yawkey , the young owner who was his antithesis , that he okayed whatever amount Yawkey mentioned first , and once actually signed a blank contract . Trail 's End He had been on his annual hunting spree at Yaw-key 's island estate in South Carolina , and was anxious to start for home . His car was loaded with deer , turkey , preserves , pine trees , chickens and eggs , and he had his foot on the starter when Yawkey suddenly shouted , " Hey , Mose , what about the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " answered Grove . " Where is it , anyhow ? " Yawkey hurriedly got a blank contract , and Grove , grabbing it from him , scrawled his signature , then stepped on the gas , as Yaw-key roared , " But what about the money ? How much ? " " Put in anything , " came back Grove 's words faintly as he sped away in a cloud of dust . Grove was n't a dollar-and-cents ballplayer . He was a record ballplayer . He took an intense pride in his achievements , but Grove bowed to his profession . Each victory was something to be symbolized , and he saved the last-out balls from all his victories  --  except those of his first season  --  and inscribed them . One of his first acts after winning his three-hundredth game was to rush the last-out ball to the National Museum of Baseball at Cooperstown , New York . He had not been asked for it , but Grove felt it belonged there . Curator William Beattie gladly accepted it , and it now rests under glass in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cy Young 's five-hundredth-victory ball . Ultimately , Grove will be represented at Cooperstown by more than a ball in a cage . Next there will be a bronze portrait of his vinegary visage in the Hall of Fame , but even such a promise will hardly appease the greatest pitcher of his generation as he faces the end of his competitive career .
