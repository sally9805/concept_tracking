txt DRAFT TO REMAIN , CHURCHILL SAYS Britain Told of Necessity for Some Years ' ? Gasoline Ration Is Restored By Wireless to Tae New YORK Tuns , LONDON , May ** Minister Winston Churchill warned in the House of Commons today that conscription for the war against Japan must go on , but Britons were on the high road back to the enjoyment of pre-war liberties and privileges , including enough gasoline to drive 120 miles a month . Mr. Churchill 's scheduled broadcast tonight on the end of the war in Europe and , according to rumors , containing an announcement of a general election , was postponed until Sunday at 9 P. M. He was unable , due to the press of other engagements , to prepare the speech . He also said there would be a debate on foreign affairs after Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden returns from San Francisco . The Evening Standard called the relaxation of security regulations yesterday and of economic restrictions today " the liberation of Britain . " Mr. Churchill said it might be // necessary to continue conscription " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the heat and burden of the day . " Announcing the restoration of that basic gasoline ration " as in the United States , " Mr. Churchill said bus and delivery services would be extended and special allowances increased . In reply to questions , he added , " both motor boats and lawn mowers come within the ambit of this modest indulgence . " Other Restrictions Lifted The basic ration , which now will entitle any one with a car to four to seven gallons a month , was abolished in June , 1942 . Since last autumn , gasoline reserves have been sufficient to restore the ration , but it was feared that some emergency such as revived U-boat warfare might cut into the reserve . Other announcements gratifying to Britons today were these : More horse racing and dog races will be permitted . Dimout restrictions in a fivemile coastal belt were lifted , thus entitling Britons to make as much light as they can find electric light bulbs for anywhere in Britain . Ernest Bevin , Minister of Labor , told the Commons he is seeking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " consistent with maintaining munitions production for the Japanese war . " He said he would seek a maximum of demobilization of building and other skilled workers . Other Ministry of Labor officials meanwhile revealed that women who had been conscripted for national service soon will be released if they have household responsibilities or wish to join a husband who has been demobilized . The Board of Trade said there will be more children 's clothes available , since 20,000 workers have been added to the civilian textile industry . Homes to Be Returned The Ministry of Works announced it will turn back requisitioned homes and land to their owners as fast as possible and that it will begin next week to employ prisoners of war for repairing bomb damage on a large scale . Most British rights under the Magna Charta have been restored by the abolition of eighty-four defense regulations and the limitation of twenty-five others . Among other things , Britons now may wave handkerchiefs to passing airplanes and ships . They may leave oars in their rowing boats without violating the regulation on the immobilization of vessels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in processions and hold meetings as they please . They may go camping anywhere except a few places in North Scotland . Police no longer may halt and search their cars . And they no longer may be hanged either for looting or for forcing their way past a sentry . Speech Is Postponed Because of his " many engagements at this time , " Mr. Churchill 's broadcast tonight to mark the war 's end in Europe was postponed and rescheduled for Sunday night at 9 o'clock , London time . Busier than ever in the moment of victory , Mr. Churchill had not time to prepare his speech . The result of half a dozen impromptu speeches he made to the London multitudes who acclaimed him with tumultuous enthusiasm during the victory celebrations was noticeable in the slight hoarseness in his voice when he spoke in the House today . But otherwise , Britain 's 70-year-old Prime Minister , who came to power exactly five years ago today at the country 's worst hour , was in his most vigorous and best-humored form . Answering a question , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothes , because they had to travel through neutral Switzerland . When asked that no loopholes be given for the propaganda that followed the last war , that the German Army was not beaten but had been stabbed in the back by the civilian population , he replied : " I do n't think it is possible to shape every action of our lives in every emergency that may arise by the fear that villainous propaganda of any kind be launched against us . " Destruction a Lesson Asked if he did not consider the transfer of Germans from uniFormed activity to civilian work Ind clothing one of the major objects of the war , he answered it might have been one of the indirect results but " it certainly was not presented to the public here as a major objective . " In a more serious vein he said the destruction the Germans could witness in their own land , now entirely overrun by Allied troops , should make them aware of their defeat . He promised the House an op portunity for debate on foreign affairs after he confers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco and also an opportunity to debate the working of the Inter-Allied Commission for Germany after the commission begins its operations . But he emphasized that the military authorities must be left in full control foz " a little while " until the threat of chaos in the movement of millions of civilians and soldiers in Germany is eliminated .
