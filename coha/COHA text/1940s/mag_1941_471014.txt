the formal , remnants of feudalism are fast receding into the historic past . As to empire matters : In these decades , which allegedly saw no change in tenacious British " imperialism , " nothing less happened than that the old British Empire disappeared altogether in all the colonies formed by settlers from the British Isles . Nothing happened except that a completely novel , immensely hopeful , and exemplary society of six independent countries was created in the British Commonwealth of Nations . And wherever you look in the vast ambit of British Empire affairs you will see that nothing remained immutable in these hectic decades , and that in every aspect of these changes British efforts were deeply engaged not to frustrate , but to assist and to guide . Yet their own " old trite indictment " is more to the liking of the fable-makers of our time . They urge England ? of all nations ? to become civilized at last . They do not even have to work out for themselves their complacent criticism of British shortcomings , for they find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the British system . For generations the British have been forging ahead by their peculiar methods of trial and error and compromise , both among their citizens as individuals and in their responsible governments . These methods would never have worked out as they did without that important ingredient in the British character which at every turn in the road produces the severest selfcriticism . This was the means by which conservatism was wedded to progress without resort to that poor ( but vicariously glorified ) expedient of politically unimaginative nations ? chaotic revolution . In England the dissatisfaction and criticism of to-day again and again engenders the formative ideas of to-morrow . II Demobilization of the fighting forces after 1918 threw millions of Englishmen MAGAZINE on to a disorganized home market . The war industries idled and had to be turned to peace production . Rundown plants and outmoded industrial organizations had to be modernized and adapted to completely unprecedented postwar conditions that emerged only slowly . A fundamental question of policy had to be decided ; whether to continue the centralized organizations of war economy in the railroads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential individualism , and on what terms . The question was answered in favor of private ownership , but on a new level of public supervision . And before long , while unemployment figures rose , while minds were depressed and uncertain of the future , while on the home and international scenes business deteriorated in a typical postwar depression , while talk about the impending end of capitalism ran high ? in those days British private enterprise was getting busy in many fields . Coal mining , shipbuilding , and consequently iron and steel production fell precipitately from their war heights , Lancashire cotton spinners and weavers suffered under terrifying postwar market conditions , especially the rising competition of India and Japan . But already new industries of first magnitude were in the making . Under an interesting semipublic organizational plan Britain built up her electrification . In a typically British way the widely decentralized power plants were not replaced by new huge centralized stations ( which , as it turned out under the bombing attacks in the present war , was most fortunate for the country ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Under this plan British power production rose from 15,000,000,000 KWH to 31,000,000,000 KWH between 1929 and 1938 . Another basic modern industry , the chemical , got its great chance in the First World War , when Germany was thrown out of the monopolistic position she had held since the turn of the century . Within a few years England built up immediate goal seemed a universal remedy : outright socialization of the mining industry . In 1919 a Royal Commission under Justice Sankey produced a comprehensive report on urgent reforms in coal mining . It bluntly advocated socialization , calling upon the state to guarantee uniform wages , prices , and general working conditions in this basic industry . The Conservative Governments of the first postwar years did not sec their way to implement such an untraditional approach by legislation , nor did the 1924 Labour Government . Six years after the Sankey report another Royal Commission ( under Herbert Samuel ) recalled the state from its deep involvement in actual partnership in industry to its true democratic role as arbiter outside and above the interested groups . Subsidies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers and employers were again to negotiate by districts collective bargains for the best obtainable working-conditions . This return to private capitalism the miners and their associates in the Trade-Union Executive Committee decided , in May , 1926 , to put to the crucial test of the general strike . At first it seemed as if the entire economic machinery of a nation of more than 40,000,000 people had indeed been paralyzed , was faced with no alternative except Socialist revolution . Besides the miners , the railwaymen , the transport and dock workers , many branches of the metal , engineering , and building trades and the printing and paper trades responded to the strike call to a man . Everything depended not so much on what the Government , but on what the people of England , would do under the circumstances . Characteristically , it was the muzzling of the free press by the strikers ' executive that opened the eyes of the British masses most thoroughly . Was it fair that the Bulletin of the Trade Union Executive should be the one newspaper allowed ? Where was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entitled to a sympathetic hearing . Soon everyone was simply doing his part in keeping essential services going . " It was all immensely good-humored and peaceful . " After nine days the general strike collapsed without violence or coercion . Unfortunately the miners ' leaders did not relinquish their notion of a rigid , nation-wide , state-guaranteed working order for their industry until the strike had gone on for seven months . The Trade-Union Act of 1927 outlawed political and sympathy strikes , and made the collection of political levies from trade-unionists dependent on their individual written consent . Unionists did not like the act , but unionism continued to expand undisturbed . And so little did the restitution of private ownership in the coal industry mark a reactionary trend that in 1938 , by an ambitious legislative act of Neville Chamberlain 's Conservative Government , that old remnant of a peculiar British property system , the so-called coal royalties , was finally " socialized . " All private property rights to the coal seams were vested in a Coal Commission appointed by the Board of Trade , which within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds all property rights at the January 1 , 1939 , values . IV The next period of trial and danger came at the end of the 1920 's with the impact of the Great Depression . Immediately after the New York Stock Market crash in the late fall of 1929 the then British Chancellor of the Exchequer , the Labour leader Philip Snowden , charged the Royal Commission on Finance and Industry ( the so-called Macmillan Commission ) to report on possible remedies to forestall an impending catastrophe . By August , 1931 , when the Macmillan report was published , the economic crisis had become international and had made fearful strides . The report could not catch up with events ; for while its authors still clung to the hope came to the aid of England . By dishoarding , the princes served their own interests as well as India 's economy , to which these dead treasures accumulated over centuries had been entirely useless . There is nothing more incongruous than later complaints of Indian nationalists about the ( unsolicited and unexpected ) " drain " on India @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead gold into active sterling accounts no one profited more than India herself . All over the world , the countries with the closest ties to British trade and credit ? besides those of the British Empire , these were primarily the Scandinavian countries ? followed Britain 's lead and formed the " sterling bloc . " Only one empire nation ? Canada , because of her closer ties with the United States ? remained aloof . When it was too late , Germany and France regretted that they had not joined at once . The monetary upheaval was quickly followed by another revolutionary step : the turn toward protection and Empire preference . Up to the 1929 crash all the war and postwar experience had not succeeded in shattering Britain 's large free-trade majority . At various times during the 1920 's the protectionist section of the Conservative party had tried to prevail , but in vain , and it was the same with the constantly mounting pressure from the protectionist Dominions for a sheltered British home market on which to sell their products . It took one shock after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commons : the reaction of world markets after 1929 , the exorbitantly high IlawleySmoot tariff of the United States in 1930 , cumulative effects of tariffs , quotas , exchange controls , and export subsidies of the French , Italian , German , and most other governments ; and , against these barriers to British world trade , all the hopes and promises held out by the imperial-preference idea . Protectionism won the day when the British tradeunions became converts . British protectionism and the Ottawa system of imperial preference were granted by history a test period of seven years , which ended with the outbreak of the new war . Trade figures do not seem to reveal any clear-cut , let alone decisive , influence of British protection on international trade or , for that matter , on British recovery . In the years of British recovery empire trade also recovered vigorously , in places doubling the appalling lows of 1932 . Despite imperial preference , Britain never quite returned to her prewar position on the Dominion and colonial markets . The Dominions and India , fast expanding their economic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeking customers in import and export trade . They refused to " buy British " unless it was to their advantage . Preference helped trade within the Empire to participate fully in the general upward trend in Empire economic conditions . Yet British trade outside the Empire also recovered , and remained at least as vital a factor in British prosperity as inter-Empire trade . The good sense of the British kept them from raising insurmountable trade barriers against anyone . The execution of the protectionist measures was entrusted to an Import Duties Advisory Committee , the majority of whose members were former Liberals . They saw to it that protectionism never got out of hand or created too powerful vested interests . The average protection for manufactures was 20 per cent , remaining 10 per cent for numerous goods . On the whole the British tariff wall was far lower than the American , and later many duties were substantially lowered by trade agreements . Almost all imports of raw materials came in free of duty , most imports from empire countries were free , most foodstuffs were free . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This agreement , indeed , was the turning-point toward a new freetrade era in both countries . Once more ? as after the Hawley-Smoot tariff ? Britain followed America 's lead . " Potts looking old , do n't you think ? " " Potts old ! Why , clamant , he 's not been here twenty years ! It seems only yesterday he was fourth footman . We used to call him James " " Still he works very ? " Mrs. Winter bit her tongue , flushed crimson in the face . ( " What in the name of goodness made me say that ! " ) " He what ? he what what , what-say , hunk ? " " Oh , I was just thinking he works just as much as he did when he was a young man , Arthur . " " As much as he did !

Would n't mind betting he 'd been inside having a drink ! Slovenly and loose behavior/ wo n't stand it ! " But there was no response , and the silence in the library was even more profound than the English evening outside . Adrian was still staring at the Guardsmen , the twelve of them standing mute and motionless in a line , their faces almost invisible beneath their enormous black busbies . " Wish I could snap off one of their big heads without anyone hearing ! If only they would bleed ! Oh , I do hate you , you silly useless things ! " He held one of the twelve soldiers in his hands . He pressed its head far in to one of his palms , then closed his fingers over it . With his other hand he gripped the feet of the soldier , and with a grimace of hate bent them far away from the head . Snap ! The little black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's palm . " What was that ? " Mrs. Winter gazed about her like a wren on the alert . Out of one eye Adrian peered up at her . In each hand he was clenching a broken piece of theruined Guardsman . Then he lowered his flushed face . " Was that you , Adrian ? that noise ? " " Me , Mummy ? What noise ? " " A little noise I heard . Seemed to come from ? " " What ? what , what-say , what 's all this ? " The Captain plunged round in his chair , faced his son . " Did you hear a noise , Arthur ? " " Hunk ? " " A noise , Arthur . " Mrs. Winter was staring down at her son 's clenched fists . " Noise ? What noise ? " " Adrian ! " cried Mrs. Winter , " open your hands ? at once ! " Adrian , perspiring , hesitated . Then quickly throwing behind him the pieces of Guardsman , he thrust out his small empty palms . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wainscoting behind him . " Adrian ! What was that you threw away ? " Mrs. Winter was already on her feet striding toward him , past him . Now she was bending down . Adrian shut his eyes tight . His hands were wet . " Arthur , I 'd like you to look at this . " Mrs. Winter held out the head of the Guardsman under her husband 's face . " What 's this , Doll ? What is it ? Beetle ? That infernal Potts , I told him only ? " " No , " replied Mrs. Winter , as though she were about to leave a pulpit . " No , Arthur , this is not a beetle , this is even more serious ; this is the mutilated head of one of Adrian 's beautiful soldiers which you gave him for Christmas . " Adrian held his breath . ( " Can I get out of the door in time , can I ? " ) " What-say , what ? " The Captain was on his feet , his little eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustache bristling like those on the back of a furious dog . " Did you ? do this , did you ? break this , did you ? ? " But the Captain 's tongue would not work fast enough ; the words fell over one another and the sentence ended in a kind of breathless snarl . He was standing over the boy , sentences , and ? " he pointed at the bookcase , " those things ? books1 " Something seemed to be leaving the Colonel . It was as though the air in a tight toy balloon had suddenly found a small outlet and the balloon were growing smaller and smaller . Adrian looked at his father and thought , for the first time in his life , what a little man he was . " But do n't you think that 's rather a good idea ? " he asked . " I 'm one of very simple tastes and , you see , the Army ? " " Well , what about the Army ? Certainly the finest and healthiest profess ? " " H @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health point of view , I 'm not sure that I do n't agree with you . But , you see , the awful thing is that I 'd simply hate it .

It 's bad enough to have to kill people to make the world better , but when you know you 're going to make it worse ? no , I do n't think I could ever be party to anything quite so wicked as that . I always remember your once telling me that if you told lies in the Army they marched you up and down the square till you damn well told the truth . Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as someone ? ? " Suddenly the library door opened . Cyril Potts , twenty-seven years butler at Hambledon House , stole in . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? " Silence . " Any more letters for the post , sir ? " " Potts wants the post , " said Adrian to his deflated father . " Hunk ? " III Twenty flies buzzing round Adrian 's head were roaring into his ears Mon-ey , mon-ey ? make some ? mon-ey ! Ad-rian Winter , work . work ! " Going to work to-night , Adrian ? " Silence . The two trees in front of Hambledon House had grown too large for their tubs , so they had been taken out and planted one each side of the library window , which was very dirty . From within the room their tops were invisible , not because of the dirt , but because the trees had grown too high . Between them a pale shaft of sun managed to ooze its way through the grime on the glass panes and shed its light on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opposite wall . All four walls of the one-time library , now one of only four rooms in use at Hambledon House , were encrusted with dustcovered prints , paintings , drawings , etchings ? all displaying different phases in the art of the French Impressionists . On the mantel lay a mass of faded papers , pamphlets , manuscripts , and backless books . On the floor , partly covered by moth-eaten rugs , in corners , peeping out from under uneasy-looking chairs and the sagging sofa , was strewn a medley of literary reviews , monthlies , weeklies , articles ? souvenirs of almost-forgotten work ; pipes lay there in their own old ash , as well as cigarette-ends viciously trodden to death between one written sentence and another . There was but one photograph in the room ? in the center of the mantel , under a large portrait of Lenin ? a colored photograph of a man it was , resplendent in scarlet-and-blue uniform , holding in one hand a helmet whose long white plume rose like a fountain-jet to within an inch of the gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter , who for some years , in company with his wife , had been lying in the village cemetery . Peter Winter was lying on his back on the floor , trying to discover the crown of his father 's head , which was all he could see of Adrian over the back of the only armchair . But Peter could n't find the crown , for his father 's hair was so life was to kill things . Ooh , what a little murderer he was ! Four days in the winter weeks he used to put on a red coat ? symbolic , I thought ? get on a horse , and with a whole pack of strangelooking dogs , gallop across the country after one small fox . The peculiar thing was I often heard him speak quite lovingly of foxes . If the dogs killed the fox after careering across country for about an hour he 'd say what an excellent fox that had been , what a pity he was dead , but what damn fine fun it had been driving him to that death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ common sense to dive down a drain before he 'd gone a field , your Grandpop , as you call him , grew furious and called that fox art extremely dirty brute . " Peter was sitting up very straight , his lips apart , eyes wide with excitement . " But bad foxes or good foxes , " Adrian continued , " I remember that he always came home , ate two huge meals within a few hours of each other , and then settled down to tell your Grandmother what a wonderful fellah he was . Actually he was one of a band of Englishmen who were ? still are ? the very wickedest of men . . . . " " Really , Adrian , " interrupted his wife , " is n't that a rather distorted picture ? " " Not at all , darling , " said Adrian in his superior manner that Vera hated . " Peter asked what his grandfather was like . If men arc to be judged by their deeds , these were his . Now , let 's see , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he killed rabbits : he had a man who stuck ferrets down a hole , and if the ferret did n't eat the rabbits underground they usually bolted out of another hole , whereupon Grandpop would raise his gun and blow bunny to bits . I heard him once vulgarly call that practice ' corking sport . ' " " What about Sundays ? " asked Peter , quickly . " Ah , Sunday , " groaned Adrian . " Poor Grandpop , that was a dreary day for him ? for he had always made the greatsacrifice never to commit murder on the Sabbath . Instead , he used to moon about and look for bills to pay till the Church bells began to ring , and then he and your Grandmother set out very slowly , very smartly dressed , very silently , with Prayer Books , to the village church . He never missed a Sunday ? a very religious man , as he always said of himself . I often think he was not unlike Rasputin , whose belief it was that you must sin in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not heard a word his father said , for he had been listening intently to some strange sound like a trumpet being blown in the distance . At last his curiosity overcame him and he rushed from the room . " Where 's he gone ? " said Vera . " Oh , I do n't know , " said Adrian , with indifference . " Probably up to his room to use those new paints you gave him . He 's intelligent , that boy ; got the right ideas all right ? he might do anything . Interesting to watch him develop . " " / must say , " said Vera , " he seemed awfully interested in what you were telling him about your father . " " Of course , dear , " said Adrian , a little patronizingly . " You see , if you 're not dogmatic with children , do n't force things down their throats , just treat them as equals and intelligent human beings , then you get them to listen , and you also earn their respect . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if slightly sarcastic implication , you not only force them to think , but you steer them away from the wrong manner of thinking , mold their thoughts along the lines of your own . No , Peter will have a chance , start early . None of this mucking about with Latin and Greek till he 's nearly twenty years old . " Adrian paused and , locking up , found his wife smiling . He was suddenly hot with anger . " Why , what the blazes &you; find funny ? " he shouted , and for a moment his face assumed an extraordinary resemblance to that of the late Colonel Winter . " Oh , darling , " laughed Vera affecWASHINGTON the Capital is a symbol of democracy and America . Washington the city is a symbol of almost everything that sincere and thoughtful men know is wrong with democracy and America . Washington the Capital is the hope of world freedom ; Washington the city is overcrowded , badly housed , expensive , crime-ridden , intolerant , with inadequate transportation , schools , and health facilities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and its problems are rapidly getting worse . It is the most undemocratic city in America . The metropolitan district has grown in population from 621,000 in 1930 to more than a million to-day . No American city of comparable size has shown anything like this expansion . It is much greater than that which Washington experienced during the years of the First World War . More than 5,000 new federal workers are pouring into Washington every month ; and with them an estimated 4,000 to 6,000 others ? members of their families and employees of the private concerns which serve the Capital . At times the Union Station is so jammed that no red-caps can be had , and strangers carrying their bags thread their way through the crowds to the taxi stand , where it is not uncommon to stand in line twenty minutes waiting for a cab . ( The taxi business is so rushed that many government clerks supplement their earnings by driving cabs in their off hours . ) Lines in front of ticket windows are sometimes so long that trains leave while would-be passengers are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D. C. statistics is a grab basket of all-time highs . Two hundred and twenty thousand federal employees now work there . The government pay roll was up to $33,000,000 in August . Building permits for the metropolitan area are being issued at 1,500 a month . 1940 brought 82,500 outsiders to 208 conventions , another record . Retail trade is over $400,000,000 a year . Bank deposits are $440,000,000 ? the largest in history . The District government 's budget will reach $54,000,000 in 1942 . And so on . There are more automobiles , more new homes , more hotel rooms , more telephones , and more bars than ever before . There is also more crime , more disease , more congestion , and more poverty . Washington society is having the same continuous field day it had in 1917 . The parties are bigger and brighter . Hostesses compete excitedly for the new crop of dollar-a-year men and their families ( the " defense people " they are called ) with an intensity never in evidence over the New Dealers , few of whom had either social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the indifference of many merchants who are selling so much they do not seem to care about either making sales or giving satisfaction , and at the shoulder-shrugging carelessvarious other expansions of health facilities . Since then about 300 additional beds have been provided , a few public-health nurses have been hired , one health center has been built . Meanwhile Washington 's population has risen 25 per cent and the recommendations themselves are now out of date and insufficient . Within limits , public health is a purchasable commodity ; the city that spends the most gets the best results . The American Public Health Association recommends an annual expenditure of $2.50 per capita in Washington as a minimum ; the hard-working health officers now have only $1.27 available , and as the population grows the amount per capita drops accordingly . One hundred and fifty public-health nurses are trying to do the work of 300 . The tuberculosis rate has been beaten down effectively in the past few years , but it is still 89 per 100,000 ? almost twice the national rate . The Washington Criminal Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resulted in only 1,167 convictions ? a poor record . Defense seems to have brought with it a real crime wave , and there is general agreement that 1941 's figures will look even worse : 19 cases of rape , for instance , two of them rape-murders , have been reported since the beginning of the year . Schools have been overcrowded for years and some of them have double shifts . Lack of teachers prevents any more being so operated . Even though a large proportion of new Washington workers are childless or do not bring their children with them , the new influx has strained facilities dangerously . Before the Tolan Committee on Interstate Migration this spring Superintendent Ballou stated that at least ten new buildings were necessary , with a large increase in the teaching staff . The building of transportation facilities in any city necessarily lags behind its growth . Washington has some fine new streamlined streetcars that move almost silently , inch by inch , sandwiched between ancient creaky vehicles suggestive of remodeled horse cars from perhaps the Cleveland Administration . Buses are modern enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many government workers come to work by private auto as manage to sardine themselves into the public facilities . Taxis are cheap , but only cheap enough to be used by about 1 per cent of U. S. workers on their way to the office . In this city where the inadequacy of the public transportation system makes it necessary for 35 per cent of government workers to get to their offices by automobile there is garage space for less than 10 per cent of the registered cars . The rest stand on the street all night , except on some streets during the winter months when " No Parking ? Snow Removal " signs are put up , though there is hardly any snow and practically no snow-removal equipment . The streets are narrowed by lines of parked cars all night and glutted with snail-pace traffic all day . The traffic regulations are the most complicated that experienced motorists can call to mind . Some streets are oneway southbound from 7:30-9:15 A.M. , northbound from 4-6 P.m. on week days and from 12-1:30 on Saturdays ; twoway at other times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 25 cents an hour , a prohibitive amount for low-income workers to spend daily . There are actually government clerks who come to work at 6 A.M. to find a parking space , and eat a box breakfast and read newspapers until eight ! The traffic death toll is not high and has been kept about static in recent years by the simple method of slowing traffic down practically to a walk , a device which anybody could think up and which does little credit to the traffic management officers of the District . A new underpass under Thomas Circle helps automobilists but drives pedestrians nearly crazy by its complicated system of neon " Walk " and " Do n't Walk " lights . Yet the present crisis , brought about by America 's need to rearm , is only a sudden turn for the worse in a chronic start the Washington subway , which will cost no more than a battleship and can be partly in use by 1944 ? Or does the Congress expect the war to be over by that time , and Washington to be a ghost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Washington . Far more difficult will be the putting at ease of Washington 's soul . Here in the Capital of a nation which fought a war round the slogan of " No taxation without representation ! " taxes are under the control of Congress , and Washington is not represented in Congress . And if the tax rate is low it is because essential services arc pinched and inadequate . Here in the Capital of a nation dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal , one-third of the residents are forbidden the theaters and the restaurants of the principal business area , are effectively blocked in their search for employment , are commonly charged two to three times as much rent as the other two-thirds are charged for equivalent accommodations , and are hated and feared because they do not like it . In the South the Negro is kept rigidly in what the whites say it his place ; but his place is made somewhat more tenable by a tradition of paternalism and a sort of code of responsibility and justice , however arbitrary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more free to go where he will and find what employment he can . There is no paternalism , but there is a certain amount of granted independence and even a shadow of equality in the right to vote and in employment opportunities . But Washington combines the worst features of North and South ; here is neither the paternalism of Atlanta and Tuscaloosa nor the relative freedom of Chicago and New York . Negroes who have lived in many parts of the country say that nowhere else in America is there such bitter mutual race hatred . The Washing ton Afro-American calls the city a " cesspool of racial intolerance . " Negroes are being forced out even from their traditional jobs as waiters and hotel workers , and the chances for private employment are even slimmer than those in the Federal government , which officially does not discriminate ; but except for some few " co-ordinators of race relations " and the like , you will find colored people only as messengers , elevator operators , and building-service workers . The Washington Urban League reports cases of Negroes who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by telegram to the Capital from as far away as New Orleans to take emergency defense jobs ; when they arrived , and their color was discovered , they got the " we 'll let you know " treatment and were stranded penniless in Washington . Even in the local penal institutions , occupied by two to three times as many blacks as whites , there seem to he almost no jobs for Negroes . Yet Washington wonders why two-thirds of its relief cases arc black and two-thirds of its crimes are committed by Negroes . When Leadbelly , the Negro folk-singer , accompanies himself on the twelve-string guitar and sings : Home of the brave , land of the free I do n't want to be mistreated by no bourgeoisie , Lord , it 's a bourgeois town ! Tell all the colored folks to listen to me , Do n't try to buy no home in Washington , D. C. ' Cause it 's a bourgeois town ! Eeee ? it 's a bourgeois town I got the bourgeois blues , Gon na spread the news all round ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population . Here in the Capital of democracy no citizen has a vote , for those who maintain residence in a State and vote by mail can not be called citizens of Washington . Washington once had the vote . In the beginning it was the general assumption that citizens of the Capital were as good as anybody else . The charter of
