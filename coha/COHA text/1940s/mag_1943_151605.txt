The Navy and the Merchant Marine must have rope made out of manila hemp ; no other kind withstands salt and fresh water so hardily . Manila hemp comes from abaca , a plant much like the one bananas grow on . The U.S. got 98% of its pre-Pearl Harbor hemp from the Philippines . After Pearl Harbor , the U.S. grew enough hemp seed to enable it to plant 300-350,000 acres of ordinary hemp in 1943 . These crops will satisfy all but marine hemp needs . <P> Last week came good news : United Fruit Co. announced that its first harvest of abaca on its Panama plantation showed a 50% greater yield per acre than has been obtained in the Far East . By the end of 1944 United will have 40,000 acres in Panama , Costa Rica , Guatemala and Honduras , from which it hopes to supply half U.S. normal requirements of around 40,000 tons a year . All of it will go to the Navy , which will share with the Merchant Marine .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
