The test pilot 's job is still tough and exacting but he now can take along an automatic observer to handle the vitally important paper work . This mechanical secretary is the new electronic flight recorder developed ( after nine years ' work at a cost of $250,000 ) by Philadelphia 's Brown Instrument Co. , a division of Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Co . <P> Before the flight recorder was introduced , test temperatures and stresses were jotted down by the pilot from a few relatively inaccurate dashboard instruments . Plane builders thought they were lucky if a pilot managed to get eight or nine readings in five minutes-correct to the nearest 10 or 15 degrees . The automatic observer takes and prints 144 temperature readings of cylinders , propeller bearings , oil in the fuel lines , carburetors , etc. every three or four minutes for as long as eight hours at a stretch . It can also measure normally impossible to get pressure on wing struts , bulkheads , tail surfaces , etc . <P> About the size of a suitcase , weighing 128 lb. , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of planes from single-seater fighters to B-19s . A recorder costs $2,000 ( Glenn Martin paid for one in a week with money saved in life-insurance premiums for the three observers usually carried on heavy bomber test flights ) . But the supply of recorders is still limited .
