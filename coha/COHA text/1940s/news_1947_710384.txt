And on this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not nationalistic in " any narrow , inhuman sense , " he averred , but its policy has been directed always toward international cooperation .

Hundreds of thousands of Mexicans , he pointed out , are engaged in helping to work farms in the United States and in railroad maintenance .
