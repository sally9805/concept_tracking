THE GREAT FOG-H . F. Heard-Vanguard ( $2.50 ) . <P> An antarctic explorer one day found himself in a lush , green valley near the South Pole ( volcanic heat kept it warm ) . The valley was inhabited by civilized , seven-foot-tall penguins who lived in a " Penguinry " of neat stone houses . The grave " chairbird " of the penguin parliament waved his flipper at the explorer . A choir of tuneful penguins rippled off " fluting sounds " of welcome that reminded the explorer of the clarinet works of Johannes Brahms . One smart penguin soon learned to speak a sort of penguin-English . " Being a bird , " he clacked , " of course I think we are the form in which Life is best expressed . " The explorer soon came to realize that this was no mere " bird-fancy . " For the penguins devoted their lives to developing ( with the help of cosmic rays ) mystically minded super-penguins and super-seals who were in tune with the infinite . <P> Most of the eight short stories in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bearded , erudite Author Henry Fitzgerald Heard is a masterly exponent of the Doylian detective story and the Wellsian , pseudoscientific fantasy . Writing under the name of Gerald Heard , he is also a distinguished British mystic ( Pain , Sex and Time ; The Ascent of Humanity . <P> Like his penguins , anti-Darwinist Gerald Heard believes that the meek do indeed inherit the earth , and that the strong end up as fossils . He also believes that men might live as harmoniously as his penguins if they would learn to contemplate like Quakers and to aspire to extrasensory experience like Brahmin Yogis . Since 1937 , Expatriate Heard has been expounding these doctrines from a home in Laguna Beach . Calif . <P> The Great Fog displays Author Heard in both guises . As H.F. he makes the flesh creep ; as Gerald in disguise he makes the conscience crawl . A few of the stories are straight mysteries and scientific thrillers , in which the principal elements are a woman 's ear , a Siamese cat , a crayfish , a fog which covers the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gerald . They involve an eerie Gothic cathedral , with a mystic message for those who know how to find it ; an English spinster who is saved from suicide by tooth ache and theosophy ; a couple of professors who wonder if they can exchange bodies simply by willing it . ( They can . ) But the nicest concurrence of the two Heards comes in the subtle , uncanny Rousing of Mr. Bradegar , the story of a simple dream . The dreamer may be 1 ) a man lying in bed and recalling his boyhood , 2 ) a boy lying in his crib and envisioning his manhood , 3 ) a corpse in its shroud looking back on its earthly days as man and boy , or 4 ) some " timeless " mixture of all three at once . Mystical Gerald Heard would probably plump for No. 4 . <P> Mystery-Man H. F. Heard leaves it to the reader .
