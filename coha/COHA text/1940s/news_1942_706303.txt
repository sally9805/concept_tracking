txt The feud between Mayor La Guardia and Paul J. Kern became more bitter yesterday when . Mr. Kern was subpoenaed to appear at 10 o'clock Friday morning before William E. Ilerlands , Commissioner of Investigation , to substantiate his charges that there was " widespread fraud " in the La Guardia administration in addition to the Flynn case , which Mr. Kern investigated last November . Originally Mr. ' Kern was subpoenaed to appear at 10 A. M. today , but as soon as he heard aboutthe subpoena at 6 o'clock last evening , he went to the office of Mr. Herlands at 2 Lafayette Street , spent half an hour with him and then announced the postponement . ? Kern " Yearns " to Talk " He does n't have to subpoena me to tell what I know , " the former civil service head said last night . " I yearn to tell the world lall I know about Eddie Flynn and his gang , so I - went right over to Herlands 's office . But to my surprise Herlands did n't want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other cases of fraud and graft . " So I gave him eleven cases , of which I made four public at the end . Of the remaining seven cases , three would provide an opportunity to set up alibis if they were released now , and the other four involve corresponaence which I can not obtain until Friday morning . For that reason Herlands postponed my subpoena until 10 o'clock on Friday morning , when I expect to appear with the details . " I say that the Mayor has sup- , pressed a report given to him by Herlands on Emil K. Ellis , counsel to the City Council committee which investigated the Civil Servlice Commission , although ' the Mayor has had the report in his possession for several months . " I gave information on Ellis from 1931 up to date , which is relevant in his case because he has asked the city to Pay him a fee of $195,000 , and the amount of his fee depends upon his standing at the bar . " I gave Herlands , and I think the Mayor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about which nothing was done . " At the time I was suspended I was investigating , an alleged credential mill in this city which was giving false and forged experience records for civil service employes . I do n't know whether they 've suppressed that or not . " The fourth case involves the assignment of ten city employes classified as laborers in the Bronx Borough President 's office to drive automobiles , most of them private passenger cars . " Herlands Tells of Meeting Mr. Herlands 's version of his meeting with Mr. Kern was : " Kern stated under oath when questioned by me that his statement today charging widespread ' , fraud and graft to numerous city officials did not apply to any officer or employe responsible to the Mayor . Kern 's position is that his statement about numerous city of-1 ficials ' should be restricted to one Borough President 's office , namely , the Bronx . I asked Mr. Kern to submit any details , clues , leads , information and evidence relating directly or indirectly to graft , corcuption and fraud by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conduct an immediate investigation wherever his information was susceptible of investigation . " It finally developed that most of the items which he had in mind at the time when he made his newspaper statement about widespread fraud were based upon anonymous telephone calls which he had received at his home subsequent to his suspension . In other words , Kern does not know , first , the informants , who they are , and , secondly , most of the information he has is vague and indefinite . No dates , names or particulars were mentioned . When Kern was asked whether he had made a record or a notation , of these telephons calls he was somewhat uncertain and vague , finally stating that he may have taken notes of some of the calls . , " I adjourned the subpoena from 10 tomorrow until Friday morning at 10 o'clock to give Mr. Kern two days to check his bureau drawers , pigeonholes and tops of shelves . Furthermore , Mr. Kern pointed out that he had an appointment with his lawyer tomorrow to , prepare papers in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mr. Kern could make this bureau drawer investigation overnight ; I felt if I insisted that he come here tomorrow morning he would raise a hue and cry about harassment , persecution and similar tactics . " Mr. Herlands said that up to the time of Mr. Kern 's suspension his office had worked with the Civil Service Commission on the civil service credential mill , the , case of Emil K. Ellis and the Flynn case , which is now in the hands of District Attorney Foley of the Bronx . He added that he would not interfere with Mr. Foley 's investigation . Kern 's Earlier Charges Last Monday Mr. Kern accused the Mayor and Mr. Herlands of trying to muzzle his investigation of charges that twenty-seven employes in the office of Bronx Borough President James . J. Lyons had used 9,000 city-owned paving blocks to beautify the country estate of Edward J. Flynn , chairman of the Democratic National Committee , at Lake Mahopac in- Putnam County . The Mayor 's reaction ' was to complain to District Attorney Frank S. Hogan of New York County against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal from office and indictment if it were proved true . If the statement was not true , the Mayor said persons responsible for publishing it should be held accountable . At the same time Mr. Herlands disclosed that he had sent a detailed. - report on the Flynn case to District Attorney Samuel J. Foley of the Bronx . Since reports from the Department of Investigation ? are never turned over to prosecutors unless a criminal element exists , the action of Mr. Herlands raised a strong presumption that criminal action might be expected . The course taken by the Mayor and Mr. Herlands is intended to show that they made proper investigations of the charges made by Mr. Kern last November and that the former civil service head differed with them on the manner in which the investigations should be conducted . While Mr. Kern has assailed the two officials for having failed to call a single witness for two months , they have contended that the case should be perfected without tipping off those involved through summoning witnesses . Returning to the attack yesterday morning , Mr. Kern said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread graft and fraud " by numerous city officials which he would have been able to uncover had he not been removed from office last month by the Mayor . ? The Mayor based his removal on a row between Mr. Kern and Corporation Counsel William C. Chanler , but Mr. Kern insists that his exposure of the Fly ! in matter was the principal reason for his ouster . After reading Mr. Kern 's latest ( charge yesterday in an afternoon newspaper , Mr. Herlands said : " I do not propose-to sit by idly while grave charges are publicly made to the effect that there is ' widespread fraud ' on the part of numerous city officials and that there are ' many other fraud cases ' in the Bronx . Accordingly , I have just issued a subpoena for Paul J. Kern to appear at the Department of Investigation tomorrow morning at 10 o'clock , when he will be given full and complete opportunity , as is accorded to any other complainant , to submit any information , clues , leads or evidence in his possession in support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' on the part of numerous city officials and of ' any other fraud cases ' in the Bronx . " Mr. Herlands said the hearing would be held privately and that Mr. Kern 's sworn testimony would be taken stenographically , in accordance with the Investigation Department 's practice . His issuing of the subpoena followed a conference with Mayor ha Guardia at City Hall earlier in the afternoon . When Mr. Kern was , asked Whether he would object to giving information at a private hearing , he said : " I have not the slightest objection , and I will be very glad to appear at the time called for in the subpoena , and to give Mr. Herlands all the information he desires . " The Mayor 's action in subpoenaing me on the same day my charges were made public shows that it is more of a crime to publish ' such , charges than it is to steal from the city . The Mayor subpoenaed no witnesses in the Flynn case for two months after I broke it . but he subpoenas me on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear that he was far from backing down on his charges and said he would substantiate them in detail .
