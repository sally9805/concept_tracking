By midmorning , despite a drizzling rain , one of the biggest crowds in Tallahassee 's history was standing in front of Florida 's steepled old state capitol . Democrat Fuller Warren , onetime farm boy from Calhoun County 's peanut and sweet-potato country , was about to be inaugurated governor-belly laugh , handshake , campaign promises and all . The folks expected a good show . They got it . <P> The rain forced dignified Governor Millard F. Caldwell to cut short a resume of his administration . But it stopped as soon as the new man , handsome , greying , jovial Fuller Warren , stepped up . Warren was wearing a frock coat which hit him below the knees , but nobody minded . Cried he : " This is the first monkey suit I ever had on . . . " During the proceedings , an airplane flew over . Its wings bore the legend : " Hi Gov . " <P> Warren made a speech which demonstrated his infinite capacity for the revolving , roller-bearing , dipsy-doodle phrase . He " took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service " and promised to " eliminate roaming livestock from the roads . " He promised that one &; all could come to his office and see him , though , he added with a wink , " ... it will help a whole lot if you voted right . . . " <P> The new governor dived into the crowd which was gathered for the free barbecue-40,000 pounds of meat , and plenty of beans , cake , orange juice and Florida celery . He shook hands , posed for photographers , handed out chunks of cake , and hugged giggling women with democratic vigor . Then he went off to watch the parade , which had 127 floats , and bands , and herds of bathing beauties , many of them tossing oranges at the crowds . <P> That night he fought his way in &; out of four grand balls-all of them so jammed that dancing was next to impossible . Everyone agreed that it had been a wonderful inauguration-everyone , that is , but a horde of newly appointed Florida colonels , who found that their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such goings-on . <P> Chester Bowles was inaugurated as governor of Connecticut , and coined a phrase which seemed to stem equally from his background as 1 ) a New York advertising executive , and 2 ) head of OPA . Democrat Bowles promised the state a program of " competent liberalism . " <P> Republicans in the legislature held up the inauguration for four hours , threatened to demand a recount of last fall 's close election ( Bowles won by only 2,285 votes ) . But the high point of the proceedings was Bowles 's rakish appearance in the inaugural parade-he wore a dented grey hat with his cutaway . Said his wife : " Chet has a silk hat somewhere . But he just wo n't wear one . "
