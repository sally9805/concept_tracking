MUST AMERICA SAVE THE WORLD ? By JOSEPH and STEWART ALSOP Revealing that we are already in the business of breaking and making foreign governments , and have already made critical commitments , the authors brilliantly present the case for their conclusion : We must resolutely oppose Russia , or let Russia take over the world . T HE biggest story on earth  --  a straight news story , deserving all the eight-column heads and outsize type in all the newspaper offices of this continent  --  is the story of the new world role of the United States . It is a story which has been hinted at rather than told . And it is a story on which a lot depends : if Americans do not understand their country 's role , they will rot play their parts ; and if they do not play tteir parts , the future hardly bears think-Mg about . Fate has suddenly imposed upon the United States the staggering responsibility of leadership of the West , in a vast contest between the Soviet and Western worlds . And this responsibility has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and startling manner , in the political affairs and fortunes of a long list , of other countries , big and little . The Soviet-Western struggle has now tragically reached the phase of open political and economic warfare . The battles of this war are as decisive as any great blood-letting of the past . Yet because there is no dramatizing roar of cannon and no crash of bombs , the story is not getting told . ' I his , then , is a quite inadequate attempt to tell the biggest story on earth . A good place to begin is in the rather shabby precincts of the second-best hotel in Athens . Constitution Square , with itsinnumera lie caf ? loungers and coffee drinkers , its brilliant sunlight , its intimations of a gimcrack present and a glorious past , is all Greek . Only pass the portals of the Hotel King George , however , and you enter a strangely different atmosphere  --  part . State Capitol , part Federal office building . part Elks Club , and all American . It is the atmosphere of the civilians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , set up under the Greek-Turkish aid bill , inevitably known as AMAG . Like the atmosphere they have brought with them , these men are everyday Americans  --  state and Federal officials , junior business executives and Army officers chosen , not because of foreign experience , but because they know how to get a job done . Their present job is to sustain Greece against the Kremlin-directed , Kremlin-supported pressure of the communist guerrillas . And here , in the job the men of AMAG are doing at the moment , is where the story lies . If you told the average American in the street that his country was in the business of breaking and making foreign governments , he would not believe you . Yet precisely this was the first astonishing sequel of the Greek-Turkish aid bill . The State Department rightly judged that the intenselyreactionary , grossly inefficient government of Premier Tsaldaris could not hold Greece against the Soviets . A hint was dropped in Washington that was heard in Athens . The Tsaldaris government fell . In the ensuing crisis . Ambassador Lincoln MacVeagh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads AMAG , and State Department Expert . Loy Henderson all intervened forcefully and continually . The new , more broadly based government of Premier Themistocles Sophoulis satisfactorily emerged from t he temporary turmoil . Then certain things had to be done in Greece which , in the postwar disorganization , no Greek leader could quite encompass . So the Greek budget was prepared by Gen. Lucius D. Clay 's brilliant nephew , Eugene , and the former assistant budget secretary of Pennsylvania , William Sponsler . A Nebraska highway commissioner went to work to rebuild the roads of Greece . Other Americans set themselves to improving agriculture , stabilizing the tottering drachma , controlling exports and imports , reconstructing harbors and purging the padded bureaucracy . Then Premier Sophoulis himself spontaneously asked ' or an even more crucial and delicate sort of aid . Last fall , after agonized indecision in Washington , AMAG was strengthened by a large group of American officers , who assumed something pretty close to control over Greek Army operations . These extraordinary interventions in Greek affairs might almost be classed as un-American activities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign policy . They have their historic parallel , rather , in the great Greek effort of twenty-five centuries ago , which hurled back the Persian myriads and prevented Oriental despotism from strangling Western civilization in its moment of birth , In their unheroic manner , these everyday Americans who wish the King George Hotel had a juke box and dislike Greek cigars , are also struggling to turn back an onslaught of Eastern despotism upon the West ; - In plain language , if the Soviets gain Greece , Turkey will be open . If they gain Turkey , the Middle East will be open . If they gain the Middle East , they will hold the crossroads between Europe and Asia , and control the oil which is Europe 's lifeblood and America 's last great reserve . And this is their real objective . With the Soviets in the Middle East the fate of Europe and Asia will be sealed , unless we fight to get them out . And we should have to fight to get them out , since our own fate would be sealed if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pacific . These are the highly practical considerations which have led to our intervention in Greece . What is alarming in Greece , in short , is not what we have done , but that no one in America knows what we have done . For these interventions add up to a commitment to safeguard the Greek future , which we must honor . Furthermore , although Greece is a very special case , the same basic problem of dependence upon our actions and decisions exists in nation after nation . All over the Western world the course of history is now being determined , sometimes almost at haphazard , in far-off Washington . Waterloo wassupposed to have been won because Napoleon had a stomach upset . These are times when world events can be almost equally influenced by the fit of - peevishness of a former vice president of the First National Bank of St. Louis , whom chance has elevated to be Secretary of the Treasury . All this arises . from our leadership in the world struggle with the Soviets . We may not realize the importance of what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be unaware that we are doing anything at all . But the Kremlin is very clear about what we are doing and what it means , and has officially told us so , in unmistakable language . Last summer the leaders of the chief European communist parties gathered secretly at a little Polish town , to organize the Cominform . Andrei Zhdanov , Stalin 's right-hand man , brought down the tables of the law from the Kremlin . In his subsequently published speech , the climactic statement was the following brief sentence : " The Soviet Union will employ all its resources to prevent the success of the Marshall Plan . " We Can Avert This Disaster C ONSIDER this a moment . The object of the Marshall Plan  --  of the European Recovery Program now being debated by Congress  --  is the reconstruction of war-shattered Western Europe . Why should the Soviets employ " all their resources " to prevent Western Europe 's recovery , unless they intend that nations weakened by hunger and despair shall ultimately fall into their grip ? And what sane man can doubt that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equivalent , for the United States , of a gigantic , irretrievable military disaster ? There is only one possible answer to these questions . American self-interest and the interest of human freedom both demand victory in the political and economic war . The American leadership of the West , the American world responsibility , arise from an obvious fact . America alone possesses the wealth , the strength , the reserves of energy which are needed to defeat the Soviets in the political and economic war . So much all Americans can grasp . What is hard for any American to grasp is the political result of this situation . In our good fortune , we can not conceive of the votes of our Congress , the membership of our Cabinet , even the outcome of our presidential elections , being affected by the views of officials of another government , several thousands of miles away . But until the war damage can be repaired , the other nations of the West are almost wholly dependent , directly or indirectly , upon American help . If help does not come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can look  --  and that is to Moscow . And this monopoly of surplus strength gives us in America a power of life or death over free men everywhere , which is as absolute as it should be sobering . What this means can be conveyed only by actual case histories . The first may well be introduced by a little picture that was unimportant yet somehow unforgettable . The office of the Italian minister wee splendid with the marble and fresco and gilding of the great age of Roman Renaissance architecture . The minister himself was small , shabby , earnest , intelligent and excitable ; and since it was distinctly hot in Rome last September , be was damp with perspiration . In his mind he had the naked , repeated threats of the Italian communists to take the offensive against the government at the first opportunity . On his desk lay the tabulations of Italy 's hard assets  --  showing that the country 's dollars and gold had all been expended  --  and of Italy 's graw supplies  --  showing only half enough to last through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands in ( Cortiinwed on Page 72.1 toed f Pope 76 ) that needs sun on Hie north side .

And illy husband said it MIS a shame , with the good soil you 've goL 91 The salesman said , " I 'm trying to salt houses , not landscapes . " " Well , but folks want the outsides to look nice as the insides . " But Mr. McGinty and the salesman had both stopped listening to her . They moved away to a window and started talking , low-voiced , to each other . Julie looked over at where Robert was standing , and then she looked away quick . Robert could n't see as far as the shaded window where the two men were . All Robert knew was that he just had to stand and wait . Then all of a sudden Mr. McGinty came toward them . He said , " I 'll be frank with you both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they just do n't buy . You people seem to like the setup , with a few changes here and there . It 's the changes that interest me .

And if American aid is n't promised soon , the bread ration must be cut in half  --  in half , I tell you  --  and our people live on bread . " Conceive the outraged indignation if Secretary Anderson , or Secretary Harriman , or Secretary Krug should tell a wandering foreign official or journalist , that the American Government and the American people were not the masters of their fate . Yet this was a distinctly routine , minor episode in our first case history , which is that of Italy . It is symbolic of the source of the world 's troubles that this case history should begin in the Kremlin sometime during the war . The precise moment is not known to us , but it was probably rather early in the Soviets ' career as our glorious allies that the rulers of the Soviet state adopted a peculiar postwar strategy for Europe . In Eastern Europe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new industrial potential , And they would consolidate the Soviet . Union and its satellites in one great , monolithic power center . In Western Europe they would direct the communist leaders , like Italy 's wily Palmiro And then the was Robert 's voice saying , calm and polite , " It sounds line , sir . " And then they were looking at her , and Julie swallowed . The trouble was she had forgotten what the question had been . " My wife , " said Robert , " is kind of tired . If she could have a glass of water  - -  -  " He lifted the baby off , Julie 's lap , and then , with his free hand , helped Julie to her feet . " Kitchen 's through the dining room , " said Mr. McGinty . " Take your time . " The kitchen was nice looking with its big white refrigerator and its blackand-white stove . But it was n't beautiful like Julie 's kitchen in Modern Eden . " You feel okay , Julie ? " Robert said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. McGinty 's kitchen had a real neat arrangement over the stove for hanging up the egg beater and the measuring cup . But over the sink in Julie 's kitchen was an even more convenient place . They could nail up a board , and on the board could be hooks for an egg beater and a measuring cup and a dish mop . Maybe Robert could think up a way to hang the kitchen knives up on the board too . That would keep them out of Susan 's way when she began to crawl around . Julie held both hands tight around the glass of water that Robert bad brought her . Then she took a real deep breath . " White hooks , " said Julie , " on a red painted board should be colorful and practical both . " And her voice came out almost as calm as she 'd tried to make it . THE END Togliatti , to assume the mask of cooperation . They would then instruct them to do an inside job of sabotage , obstruction , disruption and infiltration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the West weak and in chaos . And then , when their Eastern power center was consolidated , the distracted Western nations would he drawn to the strong Soviet East , as iron filings fly to a magnet . It was a clever long-range plan for the capture of Europe by the Soviet Union , but we checkmated it . The beginning of the checkmate may be roughly dated from Italian Premier Alcide de Gasperi 's visit to Washington last winter . Already , with American help , the Western European nations had recovered a vitality unforeseen by the Kremlin . Yet , both in France and in Italy , the communists were still in the governments , the inside job was still going on . Long before , Secretary Byrnes and his staff had discerned the Kremlin strategy , and had concluded that the inside job must stop . Now , in Washington , Premier de Gasperi held a series of conversations at the State Department . The details of these talks are still secret , but two significant facts may now be disclosed . On the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to aid Italy , but would find it hard to do so , as long as the Italian Government included Togliatti and his communists . On the other hand , Premier de Gasperi professed confidence in his power to defy the communists , provided he could be sure of getting food and fuel for his people . There was no bargain , certainly . But there was at least a shadow of a hint of an outline of a tacit understanding . Soon after de Gasperi went home there was another governmental ( vitae in Rome . The communists thundered their tumid blackmailing threats . This time t hey were ignored . De Gasperi formed Italy 's first communist-free postwar cabinet of any duration , Thus the inside job came to an end . As a result of do Gasperi 's American talks , the Kremlin strategy had gone wrong in Italy . The first reaction from the Kremlin came last spring , with the republication in Moscow , amid much official fanfare , of Lenin 's April Theses . These particular holy texts denounce SS heretical exactly the policy previously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Moscow are given new texts to expound , it is time to expect a change in the party line . Sure enough , during the summer new directives went out to thecommunisteof Italy and France , and were subsequently embodied in the supersacred resolution of the Cominform meeting . The resolution 's hieratic language can be summarized as a series of commands to the Western communists : " Cease all pretense of co-operation . Mobilize all your strength , in the labor unions and elsewhere . Attack at once , with all your power . ? Halt , disrupt , destroy the recovery of Western Europe at all cost , by any means ? " Simultaneously , Providence favored the Kremlin by giving Italy a disastrous harvest last summer . Thus Premier de Gasperi was caught between two fires . One fire was the communist offensive  --  riot to be ignored , in view of the party 's armed partisans and labor influence . The other fire was the discontent of his people , which would surely become uncontrollable if he could get no grain for their bread or dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard was bare at the Banca d'Italia . This was the moment of crisis , when the despairing minister gave voice to the lament set forth above . In the same moment , de Gasperi himself , speaking with a certain sad dignity , told an American visitor that his government was " based on close links with the United States , " and frankly stated that he could not carry on with-out support . And in this moment also , Ambassador James C. Dunn 's tele-grams from Rome became a series of frantic , almost daily variations on the same grim theme : " Make the needed ( Co , , tinchod nn Pn : .. r ? 7 ; 1 fr " ' " .1 .... 01fromPo , n , m aid available or prepare to see n communist-dominated government , in Italy in t he spring . " President Truman was desperately anxious to avoid I he special stawion of Congress . wit hold which he could not , act . Yet the other alternative  --  Soviet capture of Western Eimme ? wait ton catast twine to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was presented . And with the promise of help , de Gasperi remained in office , maintained the bread ration , again de-tied the communists . The big teat . came with the Rome riots in December , which were rapidly put down . And so this round of the battle in Italy went to the West . The case history of France is the same , with h variations . There is no precise French parallel for de Gasperi 's talks at . the State Department , although Premier Ramadier must certainly have known the American attitude when he , too , expelled the communists from office . There is also the special factor of General de Gaulle . But greater than these French variations are the French similarities  --  the rejection of Soviet influence in the clear expectation of American aid ; the crisis arising from concurrent failure of the harvest , exhaustion of dollar reserves and a communist offensive ; the frantic telegrams to Washington from the Paris Embassy ; and the rout of the communists in December by Ramadier 's successor , Premier Schuman . In France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West . . Here , surely , is food for sober thought . France and Italy , two of the three great nations of the continent , hung for weeks in the balance , while the President and his advisers sought means to succor them . If that help had not been forthcoming , their governments would quite certainly have lacked the will power to meet the challenge of the communists . In short , these governments were preserved by our aid . Remember also that this challenge will be renewed . There is every indication that the Kremlin regards these first reverses only as early misfortunes in a long war . The need of France and Italy will continue until their wounds of war are healed . If either France or Italy is again permitted to sink into hunger and despair , the battle for Western Europe will assuredly be lost . Meanwhile , American policy will inevitably continue to exercise a deep influence on the sit cations in both these countries . You would suppose that this yardstick was sufficient to measure the American world responsibility . Yet it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Britain , the miatreas of an empire upon which , even today . the sun does not . set .. It was Britain whose history was most affected by the peevishness of Secretary of the Treasury John Snyder . Last . winter , officials of the British Treasury came to Secretary Snyder to ask for relaxation of the so-called convertibility clause of the American loan agreement . This clause required the Brit jab Treasury to establish convertibility of the pound  --  to give dollars for pounds sterling to any nation doing business with Britain  --  after July first . last year . Last winter , only minor modifications were asked of Snyder , and were angrily opposed by him . By the spring , however , the dollar shortage was acute all over the world . It was obvious that . after July first every nation might rush to turn pounds into dollars , leaving the cupboard of the Bank of England as bare as that of the Bence. d'Italia . Our own Government was concerned about the danger , and sent Ambassador Lewis Douglas to Britain 's Chancellor of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars for pounds might well he deferred . Within the British govern . ment there was an argument . Chancellor Dalton and the Bank of England , who share the chief responsibility for what followed , hot h favored going ahead with convertibility as originally planned . Snyder 's peevishness logically had been canceled by Douglas ' overture . Yet Dalton argued that Snyder 's attitude foreshadowed the react ion of Congress to any request for changes in the loan agreement . Dalton won the argument . The pound became convertible . The stampede to get dollars for pounds began at once . Before emergency action was taken , more than $1,200,000,000 of the American loan  --  paid for by our taxpayers , heartbreakingly necessary to feed the British people and rebuild their country  --  flowed away into shiny new cars for Egyptian pashas and mink coats for Argentine fancy women . Nor is that all . Last summer 's shocking misfortune reduced Britain to her bedrock reserves of dollars and gold . Yet for the merest austere es That -s right !

And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Britain 's commonwealth is partly founded on a banking system which is technically called the sterling area , The member nations , dominions and colonies do their banking in London and keep their surpluses there . From thiss standpoint. , London is simply a huge imperial bank . Any bank , even an imperial bank , must have reserves in hand , if runs are to be avoided . The depositors  --  the bankers , industrialists and merchants of the member nations , dominions and colonies of the Brit ish Commonwealth  --  are nervously watching the outflow of gold and dollars from the London bank . If the depositors panic , there will be a run on Britain 's remaining hard assets . The American and British experts believe that they will panic , and that if Marshall Plan dollars do not replenish Britain 's exhausted cash reserves this spring there will be a run . If such a run occurs , Britain will be bankrupt . Senators desiring to eviscerate the Marshall Plan will do well to ponder the consequences . Along the whole vast periphery of the Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , British troops and British power atop gap after gap in the West 's defenses against Soviet aggression . No imaginable effort  --  not the war mobilization of every American man and woman and the war conversion of all America 's industry  --  can enable this country to fill all the gaps now stopped by Britain . A bankrupt Britain will not maintain her power and her garrisons overseas . The first act of a bankrupt Britain will be to liquidate every one of these costly commitments . She will turn , in deep bitterness , against the American ally that has failed her in the hour of need . And if we do not then supply the fantastically costly cure that could have been avoided by a little , relatively cheap prevention , Britain will ultimately be forced to make what terms she can with Moscow . The Kremlin , listening from afar to the peculiar antiphony of our Robert R. McCormicks and Henry A. Wallaces , is eagerly hoping and preparing for just this eventuality . It is well to remember that the grim year 1947 closed with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade agreement . The case histories tell our story , for those who will stop to ponder their meaning . Britain and France and Italy are old and proud and very conscious of being chief sources of the new America . They do not love us merely because we aid them . Who ever loved a rich relation ? What we need from our partners is not affection , but respect and loyalty flowing from common interest . Respect and loyalty are not to be achieved , moreover , merely because we hold great power . All three of these nations , even the sturdy British , have been battered by the war into a state perilously near to national neurosis . In 1941 , Winston Churchill marched into Washington with his cigar at a bold angle , eager to show the inexperienced Americans how to run a war . The American contribution to the war in money and in men was about as great proportionally as the American contribution that must now be made to the peace . Yet Churchill had no fear of American bullying and dictation . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " After Napoleon , Britain paid to rebuild Europe and to build a peace . If I had the cash in hand , I would do it now . But now it 's up to the Americans . " When he says this there is an edge of bitterness on his voice . There is , to be sure , a personal change of some importance from Churchill to Bevin . The more improvident ducal houses live by mortgages , after all , and think they honor their bankers by taking them out . Bevin began life as a child bird-scarer on a farm , and must ever since have felt the fear and hatred of the moneylender which are natural among honest , poor people . But this edge of bitterness , this fear of American bullying , is nonetheless common today among all kinds of Englishmen . Anglo-American relations had deteriorated gravely until Secretary of State Marshall restored them at December 's London conference . And when there is this neurosis , it must not he supposed that our aid will be accepted on any terms . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ourselves . nitnom iii ; successfully by festooning Ilse Morelia Plan with humiliating conditions us by withholding aid altoget her . As for the consequences of withhold-in aid or giving too little , what applies to Britain applies as well to every of her weakened nation of the Western world . These nations look to us for help be-alum they have nowhere else to look  --  except always Moscow . In their postwar neurosis , all of them will turn from um in despair if we give I hem no help or too little . In some of them we may briefly see the triumph of the totalitarianism of the right . But soon or late , in default of American aid , all of them will straggle into Moscow , seeking to make a deal with the Kremlin . Consider this dark prospect and then look at the map . Britain , and France , and Italy . and Greece , are not the only nations battered by the war and pressed by the Soviets . Germany , once the world 's third great industrial power , is held against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops . So is Austria . There are American troops  --  and British  --  in Trieste . American funds and sea power help to safeguard Turkey as well as Greece . British and American power and influence mingle  --  with British power predominant  --  to protect Iran , Iraq , Syria and Tranejordan . China faces a dangerous crisis , for want of agreement on an American policy . And in Korea and Japan , American garrisons stand fast . Such is the condition of the long border between the Soviet and Western worlds . Let the Soviets only break through at any major point along this border  --  in Western Europe , or the Middle East , or the Far East  --  and the phase of mere political and economic warfare will abruptly end . Such a break-through would confront us with the appeaser 's choice , to fight or to surrender . These are the harsh realities which Secretary Marshall had in mind when he launched his brave proposal for European reconstruction . If you think , as it is correct to think , in military terms , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will also have the effect of an offensive . In its offensive aspect the European Recovery Program may be thought of as a great flanking attack . The Soviet 's vulnerable flank is in Eastern Europe , where Russia has overrun nations accustomed to greater freedom and a richer life . If the Marshall Plan succeeds in reconstructing Western Europe , there will he two re-sulfa . First , the Western world will be greatly strengthened . Second , as conditions in Western Europe improve , the Eastern European nations will be attracted westward , reversing the situation originally planned by the Soviets . Thus the Soviet world will concurrently be weakened by internal difficulties . Meanwhile , however , we must expect the Soviets to attack our vulnerable flank exactly as we shall soon be pressing upon theirs . They are doing so already in Greece , in the Middle East . and in Manchuria and China . They can be repulsed if we stand firm , for they do not want open war . But there are trying , testing times ahead . As we go forward into these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not meet the tests in our present mariner of a somnambulistic giant holding up the Western world in his uneasy sleep . Ours are responsibilities which can be safely discharged only with full alertness . Nor can we meet the teals ahead if the Government is always to be rendered impotent by conflict between the Administration and the Congress . The cost of our job has been greatly exaggerated  --  Harold Stamen 's proposed tithe of the national income , which would he more than $20,000,000,000 a year , is more than we need to spend . But the errors of too lit tie and too late , which are committed because inner conflict hi-nstrings American policy-making , always multiply all costs by nt least ten . If the job is to be within our powers , we must act promptly , adequately and decisively , as circumstances demand . Then , too , we must learn to think of this as a world job . The food and raw-material resources , not of this country only but of South America and Southeast Asia and every other accessible productive area , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic strength . The power and policy of the United States , Britain especially , and every other Western nation also , must , be carefully coordinated to hold the long , threatened border against Soviet attack . The world job calls for economic mobilization and political organization of the nations that are free . Again we must take the lead . The object of all this effort is supremely simple . If the West shows to the Soviets an impregnable front of unity , health and strength , the Kremlin will he dissuaded from its present course . If the Kremlin is dissuaded from its course , the world can hope at last for the coming of the true peace that the whole world longs for . Peace is our aim , which we can attain if we are confident and wise , bold and generous . Such , at least , is the reasoning of the American policy makers , from Secretary Marshall downward . Yet while we should take pride in our historic role , it is also natural for America to be confused and divided by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with deep nostalgia upon the days when our responsibilities were nil . The scenes of that America before 1 he first World War now float before our eyes like pictures in a dream . We seem almost to smell the sweet dust of summer raised in the air by the passing surrey ; our passions are tenderly engaged in the arguments around the cracker barrel , where the men disputed political issues so small that they seem almost cozy . It would be pleasant to relive those times , when we were strong but unburdened , hopeful and unscarred . The danger of trying to live in the past. , of blinding ourselves to the realities of the present. , is all the greater because those were the times when we formed our political habits . But these dread responsibilities now confront . us because we are infinitely stronger , infinitely richer , infinitely greater than that simple America . And here it will be well to conclude with an old tale . After mature consideration , the embattled New England authoress , Margaret Fuller , startled her friends with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " On hearing of the lady 's decision , Thomas Carlyle remarked dryly , " By gad , she 'd better . " He meant , of course , that Miss Fuller had only one alternative to acceptance , which was to commit suicide . For nations confronted with national responsibilities there is also only one alternative to acceptance , and it is also suicide . If the biggest ' story on earth has any moral , this is it .
