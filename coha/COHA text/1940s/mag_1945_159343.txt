In 1910 Ensign John Henry Towers was a young man with a consuming idea : he thought the Navy should have an air arm . When Congress prodded the Navy into an experimental aviation program , Jack Towers was one of the first three pilots trained . He survived accidents in the air , his two colleagues ( thus becoming Naval Aviator No. 1 ) , and his disappointment over the kicking around the air service got from the battleship admirals . <P> His fixed idea on the importance of aviation won him few friends among the top brass . To his seniors on the quarterdeck he was a baleful-looking , bulldog-stubborn revolutionist , a man to be viewed with suspicion . <P> Twice the battleshipmen passed him over for promotion ; a third time he probably would have been out . But President Roosevelt saved him by jumping him to Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics . <P> Turn of the Wheel . He was not master of his house in BuAer . He got no credit for cutting administrative corners to procure new planes which paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Hellcat . He became Commander , Air , Pacific ( in 1942 ) and it looked like the fulfillment of his dreams , until it turned into desk duty . When a commander was picked for the great central Pacific offensive in 1943 , not Jack Towers but Battleshipman Raymond Ames Spruance got the job . <P> In July 1945 Towers was named boss of Third Fleet carrier forces . It was his chance at last to show his mettle in a combat command with the air weapon he had done so much to forge . But the Japs surrendered before he could strike a blow . Last week to Birdman Towers came as much recognition and vindication as he could now expect ; with an admiral 's four stars , he was named to succeed Spruance as Commander in Chief , Pacific Fleet and Pacific Ocean Areas . Naval aviators , already winning key posts in Washington ( TIME , Dec. 10 ) , were at last , if tardily , getting some of the top sea commands . Raymond Spruance headed ashore to run the Naval War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
