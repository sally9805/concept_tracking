Canada 's Liberal Government , which has been pushed steadily left by the socialist CCF , last week went the whole way in its control of wheat . The Government whipped through two readings in the House of Commons a bill to permit the Government Wheat Board to buy , sell and regulate the marketing of all Canadian wheat until at least 1950 . ( The third and final reading of the bill would be routine . ) <P> The Government took control of wheat during the war and closed free trading in wheat on the Winnipeg Grain Exchange . But this was the first time Canada has stretched a wartime expediency into long-term peacetime policy . The new bill would make the Wheat Board the world 's biggest trader in wheat . Buyers both in and outside Canada could deal only with the Board ; Canadian farmers could sell only to the Board at its price ; no railway or elevator company could receive wheat without a Board permit . The Board could even suspend any farmer 's right to ship grain . <P> Without a Murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for state trading , thought this was wonderful . No one was surprised at that . The surprise was that men who believed in free enterprise and free trading swallowed the bill without a murmur . The only loud protest came from the Progressive Conservatives in Parliament who cried that the " Government was out to outsocialize the socialists . " But the Canadian Federation of Agriculture , which represents the farmers , announced that they were " 100% behind the bill . " The Government had counted on the farmers ' long-standing dislike of the feast or famine days of free trading in wheat before the war ; it promised that if it did the trading it would stabilize wheat prices and farmers ' incomes . <P> The Government system of evening up farmers ' incomes was simple compulsory saving in good years to put aside something for the lean . The Government had paid the farmer $1.35 a bushel for wheat . It sold to Britain under a special wheat deal ( TIME , Aug. 5 ) at $1.55 , and to other nations and the world markets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kitty along with profit from , selling wheat in Canada . In 1950 the kitty will be split up among farmers on a participating basis . <P> While the current high prices last , the Government plan is bound to work . But would it work if wheat fell to prewar prices ? Some free-trading Canadians were sure that it would not . Then Canada might also find-as wheat-wise John Bracken , leader of the Conservatives , warned-that Canada 's old customers were turning elsewhere . Some might well feel that they were not getting a fair deal under the multiple price plan .
