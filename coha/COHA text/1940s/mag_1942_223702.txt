First round of the American offensive in the Solomon Islands was over . The Navy had announced that the three islands where the Marines had landed-probably Florida , Tulagi and Guadalcanal-had been captured . There might still be bands of Japs to be mopped up in bloody battles in the interior hills and jungles , but the opening battle was over and the Americans had won . <P> After the opening round the only question was how quick and how powerful the Jap counterattack would be . One naval attempt to relieve the Jap defenders had already been beaten off at the very outset of the U.S. offensive in a bloody seafight on the night of August 8-9 . But that time the Japs had sent a boy to do a man 's work , and they would not make that mistake again . <P> The counterattack came fast on the heels of the Navy 's announcement that the first phase of the battle for the Solomons , had been successfully completed . Down from the North , probably from Japan 's great naval base on Truk Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great Japanese armada of battleships and carriers , cruisers and transports . <P> The fighting began Sunday , August 23 , with a strong enemy air attack on Guadalcanal Island , in which 21 Jap planes from the Carriers were shot down with minor losses for the Americans . That night enemy destroyers opened fire on the Marines ' shore positions on Guadalcanal . <P> By the next day a great naval battle had been joined , in which both sea and air forces were taking part . Before Tuesday noon Army and Navy carrier-based planes had effectively bombed two Jap carriers , one battleship , several cruisers . One cruiser and one transport were left burning fiercely . Four hits had been scored on the larger Jap carrier by Army bombers . The smaller Jap carrier , the 7100-ton , 24-plane Ryuzyo , had been " severely damaged " by U.S. Navy aircraft . <P> One thing the defenders could be glad of was that the counterattack did not come even sooner than it did . By the time it came , the U.S. was in full possession of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chief airdrome on Guadalcanal Island . They had driven the Japs from subsidiary airdromes and land bases on the others . Army bombers were already based on the captured airdromes with Naval and Marine planes . Island airports were " unsinkable carriers " and they gave the Americans a great advantage in the air-an advantage which became all the greater after two of the Jap carriers had been bombed . <P> No American losses were announced in the communiqu which described the opening of the battle , and it was far too early in this second phase of the Battle for the Solomons for anyone to tell how well the U.S. forces were doing . But the Navy did say that the Army and Navy units backing up the U.S. Marines in the Solomons had been expecting the Jap counterattack . Americans who read the news could only hope that the commanders who foresaw the attack had also been able to bring up enough ships and planes to beat it off . The Japs could ill afford another reverse at sea like the Battle of Midway . And the Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the only United Nations offensive since Pearl Harbor .
