UNDER COVER-John Roy Carlson-Dutton ( $3.50 ) . <P> For four years pseudonymous Author John Roy Carlson , a youthful Armenian-born journalist , has sat in on the conclaves of some 30 U.S. fascist and near-fascist groups . What he saw and heard , and what he thinks about it , makes a bulky ( 544 pages ) , jumbled , fact-crammed book . * It is good reading and worth reading ; it is a believable account of real viciousness , relieved by fragments of pure absurdity . Smart readers will make allowances for Investigator Carlson 's enthusiasms , distinguish for themselves between stooges and stars . <P> The Line . Before Pearl Harbor U.S. fascism was blatant and aggressive . Federal agents and public hostility have driven it to cover . So today 's techniques are largely confined to whispering campaigns in industrial centers , promotion of racial violence , draft dodging , food hoarding , agitation for " democratic " opposition to the Administration . The objective , says Carlson , is to sabotage " with every means at their command , a quick Allied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensify . . . work of dissension . . . . " <P> " The America First spirit , " said Senator Gerald Nye to Carlson , " is much stronger now . But . . . you can ruin a good thing by coming out with it at the wrong time . " When the time comes , explained the " ' dean ' of American intellectual fascism , " suave Lawrence Dennis , " such slogans as ' America for the Americans , ' ' White Supremacy , ' . . . ' Europe for the Europeans ' . . . will become popular . Reactionary feeling will become rampant , followed closely by antiSemitism . . . . Declare yourself for the war now and after you say this begin to explain that we 're fighting for Communism . " <P> This line , in more practical form , was explained , to Carlson by a self-styled Detroit labor organizer . " You begins your work , " said he , " by talking against the Jews and the nigger . The Jew got us into the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping labor down by controlling the money . It 's the Jew who hires niggers and gives them low wages . . . . You ties in the niggers with the Jew , den you call the Jews Communists . That gets ' em . " <P> Crazy Shambles . Slowly , surely , Author Carlson learned every trick and subterfuge of American fascism . He adopted the name " George Pagnanelli , " modeled his speech , clothes and gestures on those of a youthful Italian , became a trusted lieutenant of Yorkville 's Joe McWilliams , and a salesman for Nazi agent George Sylvester Viereck 's Flanders ' Hall Publishing Company . He was made a captain ( Grand Central District ) in the underground Army of Christ , alias the Iron Guard , alias the Midtown Sporting Club ( " interested in shooting rabbits , see ? " ) , alias the American Phalanx ( PAX for short " In Latin it means peace " ) . <P> " Our first goal , " said Phalanx Chief James Banahan , " is to blow up the Communist headquarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon . . . .
