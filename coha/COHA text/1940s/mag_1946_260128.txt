In 1920 , just as an irate printer was about to destroy the plates for nonpayment of a bill , Sears , Roebuck &; Co. stepped in and bought the bankrupt Encyclopaedia Britannica* Three years ago Sears decided that the publication of an encyclopedia was " foreign " to its merchandising business , made an outright gift of the venture to the University of Chicago . Last week Chicago 's Chancellor Robert Maynard Hutchins decided that it was time to make better use of Britannica and its film and publishing subsidiaries in his favorite crusade : adult education . He turned over the university to President Ernest C. Colwell for nine months , and moved to the Loop to work full time at Britannica . <P> Explained earnest Bob Hutchins : " We have been saying for years that the way to improve society is to educate the people , but we have limited education to infants between the ages of six and 21 . . . . The world may not last long enough for the restricted campus education of today to affect the course of events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ youth and adult education , then the urgency of our time gives priority to the adult . " <P> Hutchins , who already holds four jobs in the Britannica hierarchy , will add a fifth : chairman of the board of editors . He plans to concentrate on two projects : 1 ) hopping up Britannica 's 24 films a year ( most of which strike him as " too timid , too unimaginative " ) , thereby leading the way in an " enormous development " of educational films aimed at new , cheaper projectors ; 2 ) editing a 63-volume , " popular-priced " ( $200-$250 ) set of " the great books of the western world , " first one-package edition of the " 100 Books , " many of which are out of print . <P> The new Great Books set will include introductory essays by Hutchins , Mortimer Adler , Carl Van Doren , Stringfellow Barr , plus a cross-index of the world 's great ideas and idea-men . An entire building on the Chicago campus is filled with ripe scholars and raw materials for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few years Britannica expects an annual sale of 5,000 sets . <P> <P> * The world 's oldest continuing publication , founded in 1768 in Edinburgh by " a society of gentlemen " ; first edited by one William Smellie , a tosspot crony of Robert Burns .
