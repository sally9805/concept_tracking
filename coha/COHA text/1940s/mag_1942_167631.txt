( See Cover ) <P> The nation 's greatest concern was far across the seas . Russia must not be allowed to fall if U.S. aid can prevent it . Russia 's fall would turn loose on Asia and Africa a terrific Nazi army , an army of millions of men , thousands of planes and thousands of tanks , an army big enough to fight on a 2,000-mile front-as it is now doing . <P> That was why last week U.S. eyes &; ears were fixed on that great stretch of unknown land thousands of miles away ; a land few Americans had ever seen , and whose place names few Americans could pronounce . On the reaches of Russia , from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea , World War II would be very nearly decided . Ahead lay six months of good military weather . In those six months probably lay the great decisions of the 20th Century . <P> Throughout the United Nations , suspense mounted . All winter long , retreating here &; there , Hitler and his troops had endured , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle . Now spring spread northward in ever-widening circles ( see map ) . The zero hour was hard by . Hitler had feinted with one of the " peace offensives " which are always his last step before war of nerves turns to war of gunpowder ( see p. 29 ) . <P> Only days , hours , minutes of this ticking silence-and the blow would fall in the greatest cataclysm of blood and steel the world had ever borne . <P> Hitler has to destroy the Russian Army in 1942 or lose the war . And the U.S. has to keep Russia fighting or face a war that will be immeasurably longer and tougher . <P> Man &; Job . In the big , elegant greystone Embassy on Washington 's 16th Street , Russian Ambassador Maxim Maximovich Litvinoff ( pronounced Lit-VEEN-off ) heard the seconds tick . Watching the dogwood bloom on the lawn , he could picture the Russian spring : no Russian , however far from his homeland , can forget the feathery pastels of white birch and oak , the woods alive with the calls of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mushrooms and flowers sprouting in soil musty-damp from the winter 's snow . <P> May , Litvinoff remembered , is Russia 's most beautiful month . In the south , the cherries and peaches ripen ; the rich black loam of the Ukraine bakes from mud to dust ; on the Central Front , around Moscow , the spongy forest land is thick with violets and lilies-of-the-valley , and the cuckoo and nightingale sing . <P> This year the Russian spring is a threat , not a promise . The sun drying out the mud ever farther north unrolled a great firm highway for the Nazi war machine . Maxim Litvinoff could guess at the pattern of the Nazi drive : this time , probably , Hitler would smash south , toward the oil of the Caucasus , the Suez Canal , the Indian Ocean . At the same moment the Japanese , with perhaps 1,000,000 men in Manchukuo , their railroads fanned out to the Siberian border , might smash at Russia 's Asian end . This was Russia 's crucial hour . <P> Litvinoff , six months out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been even when the Nazis battered at Moscow 's gates and the whole world thought Russia crushed He could ponder Joseph Stalin 's new order of the day to the Russian Army ( see p. 26 ) , loaded with assurance that Russia had grown stronger , Germany weaker .
