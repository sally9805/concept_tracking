As he neared 50 , large and lusty Writer Paul de Kruif felt his considerable powers waning . His customary four-mile trot along a Lake Michigan beach slowed down to a walk . Three or four hours with the double-bitted ax and cross-cut saw were all he could stand . He tired easily , slept fitfully , found himself a prey to causeless fears . <P> Youthful-looking Herman Bundesen , 63 , unorthodox president of Chicago 's board of health , suggested that De Kruif 's decline might be due to a hormone deficiency . Dr. Bundesen believed that the vitality of men and animals is linked to their sexual vigor . He informed De Kruif that organic chemists had isolated and synthesized the essential product of the male sex glands ( the female hormones , estradiol and estrone , had been discovered and put to fruitful use still earlier ) . <P> It was enough to send De Kruif , often criticized for his own expansive scientific optimism , plunging through the literature of the subject , digging out the facts for his own benefit and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ microbe-hunting , hunger-fighting heroes of the test tube . Last week he published his findings , in a mixture of laboratory slang , movie-travelogue lyricism and man-to-man locker-room candor , in The Male Hormone ( Harcourt Brace ; $2.50 ) . <P> Sneers &; Jeers . In 1889 Charles-Edouard Brown-Sequard , eminent French physiologist , announced at the age of 72 that he had succeeded in revitalizing himself by brewing the mashed-up sex glands of dogs and guinea pigs in a salt solution and injecting the mixture under his skin . An audience of distinguished French scientists listened spellbound to details of the miraculous transformation . But Sequard 's new lease on life lasted just one month ; then he began to wither . When he died in 1894 , he and the potentialities of the male hormone were both badly discredited . <P> During the ensuing years , while other endocrines yielded up their secrets to the " hormone hunters , " study of the male hormone languished . Pioneers who dared to experiment in the field drew sneers &; jeers at " rejuvenations , " " elixirs " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago Chemist Fred Koch and his assistant Lemuel McGee began dissolving , fractionating and distilling tons of bulls ' testicles in an attempt to discover what it is that makes bulls bulls . They developed a method for obtaining from some 40 Ibs. of bull glands 20 milligrams of a substance which , when injected into capons , restored them to roosterhood . It was also tried on a 26-year-old eunuchoid male who lacked all libido and most of the outward signs of masculinity ( beard , deep voice , etc . ) . After 53 days of injections , both the sexual urge and the power to consummate it appeared . But the transformation exhausted Koch 's supply of the hormone , and the patient lapsed into his former condition .
