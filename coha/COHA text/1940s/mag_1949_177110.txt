FOREIGN RELATIONS <P> The North Atlantic Treaty became public last week . It was greeted in the U.S. by what , considering the immensity of the commitment , seemed almost a disinterested silence . <P> The pact was perhaps the most fateful peacetime step in U.S. diplomatic history since the Monroe Doctrine . The concern that President James Monroe had extended to the Americas , President Harry Truman had extended from the Tana to the Rhine , and perhaps to Trieste . And how did the U.S. people feel about it ? The State Department , which gets bushels of letters when Palestine , China or Spain is involved , had gotten only a trickle in the 14 weeks the North Atlantic pact was being negotiated . Did this indicate apathy or agreement ? As far as anxious State Department men could discern , the U.S. public had accepted , long since , the important principles involved . <P> State 's presentation had been grave , cautious and deliberate . The reaction was in kind . In the Senate , no jingoistic ranters sawed the air . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would vote against it . Most of the nation 's editorialists gave their sober approval-with the notable exception of the nation 's largest newspaper , the America Firsting New York Daily News . Snapped the Daily News : " Uncle Sam or Sap is now . . . making official his scrapping of President George Washington 's solemn warning to this country to keep out of foreign entanglements . " The Omaha World Herald slyly demolished that classic argument by predicting : " Washington 's words about foreign alliances . . . will be as dead as his warning against the formation of political parties . " <P> For the majority of newspapers , the New York Herald Tribune declared : " It is a pact for peace . . . essentially and inescapably defensive ... No nation that respects the rights of its neighbors need fear the pact ; only a guilty conscience could see a threat in its terms . " <P> The North Atlantic pact confirmed on paper what most people knew in their hearts : that the world 's nations are divided into two massive blocs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high hopes of San Francisco to the bitter lesson learned at Munich in 1938 . There were some Americans who feared that the pact might seem provocative . But peaceful men have always found it only common prudence to build stockades in the face of danger .
