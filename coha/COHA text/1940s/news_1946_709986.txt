txt Among five traffic relief projects proposed for inclusion in the 1947 capital budget of the city is an item of 380.000 for " final " plans for pedestrian underpasses along Forty-second and Thirty-fourth Streets . These were suggested by engineering consultants for the City Planning Commission , their estimated cost for construction is put at $2,750,000 , and they were approved by the commission in a 6-to-1 vote , with Commissioner Newbold Morris dissenting . Some opposition has already been voided to the Thirty-fourth Street project , which would involve improvement of existing passageways and introduction of escalators to induce greater use . So general and . insistent is the eagerness for traffic relief that the Board of Estimate seems likely to endorse the order for final plans on these underpasses  --  and the other traffic proposals also , for that matter ? without adequate examination . There is a tremendous amount of travel , by vehicle and on foot , across town at Forty-second Street and in near-by streets . It seems logical that this will increase as time goes on , under the impetus of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ island and the pressure of congestion in the central panel . The subway shuttle , now more than twenty-five years old , inadequate in rush hours , annoyingly inconvenient in its failure to make close connection with the Lexington Avenue and West Side lines , and a long city block short of connecting with the Eighth Avenue line , is an inefficient disgrace . What we need is reasonably rapid underground transportation from river to river , if that is feasible from an engineering standpoint . The shuttle now carries nearly fifty million passengers a year . There must be millions more who walk because of its various forms of inconvenience or who would ride an efficient underground railroad if it took them farther east or west . Instead of drawing " final " plans for this inadequately considered underground walk , why not tackle the whole Forty-second Street problem in a broad way , perhaps examining anew the practicability of installing underground moving sidewalks such as were used and found workable as long ago as the World 's Fair of 1893 at Chicago , the somewhat similar ribbon at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shopping center . This idea is not new for Fortysecond Street . In the early Nineteen Twenties , Daniel L. Turner , transit official and engineer , estimated the cost of such a project at $10,000,000 from river to river . There would have been three underground adjacent ribbons on . each side of the street , moving at three , six and nine miles an hour respectively , and seats would be provided on the fastest strips . He even suggested that shops line these strips , just as the Planning Commission 's consultants propose , a feature that might offer a profitable asset to both business and the city . Such a form of transportation could be boarded in3tantl , y at any one of numerous points across Forty-second Street . ' Perhaps the Turner idea is fanciful . But engineering now admits no impossibilities , and sometime we shall have to remake that shuttle . Now instead of spending a couple of million dollars or more on an underground footpath , rewiring one more tunnel , we should face up to the whole problem of doing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
