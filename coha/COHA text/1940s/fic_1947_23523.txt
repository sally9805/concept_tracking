SIGN FOR SELINA A Story JOHN D. WEAVER s LINA WALLER rolled the egg around in the palm of her hand , frowning . " They 's gon ' be trouble , " she said . It was an ordinary hen egg , dull white , not unusual in size or shape , but smack on one side was a brown mark which had the unmistakable outlines of a human hand . " They 's gon ' be trouble , " Selina repeated . " We got the sign . " Selina sat down in her high-backed rocker . She took the Bible off the small walnut table beside the phonograph , She 'd have to hunt for hand signs . " You go git the boys , " Selina told Rosa Lee , who was still out of breath from racing across the chip yard with the egg in her hand . The three boys , Press , Roy , and Gil , were all of a size ; they were nine , ten , and eleven . Rosa Lee was thirteen , and the other girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the twisted foot would have been twelve if he 'd lived . ) The boys lined up like three young cedars in front of Selina , the prints of their bare feet dusty on the sitting room floor . " Roy , I want you to run over to Laurel Branch for me , " Selina said . " I want you to run over to Laurel Branch an ' ast at Cousin Will 's store if the fam'ly 's awright . You tell ' em I got a sign . " Selina turned to theoldest boy , GiI . " Now , Gil , " she said , " you hike up the branch path to Mother Waller 's , an ' you tell ' er I got a sign , an ' I wanta know is she awright . " Selina smiled at Press , the youngest boy , her favorite . " Press , you trot down the pike to the Anderson place , an ' you tell ' em you 're Hawg Waller 's boy , an ' you wanta see your pap , an ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mama 's got a sign , an ' he best watch out for trouble . " The boys scampered toward the door , Selina calling after them , " Now doan y ' all stop ' long the way to fritter nor frisk . " " Ca n't I hep , too ? " Rosa Lee said . " You go tend after li'l Sunny Sue , " Selina said . " Leave me study my Bible for the sign 's meanin ' . " Selina carried her rocker out on the front porch . She was a gray rail of a woman , with a thin face and gray-green eyes . She sat in the shade of her trumpet vine , staring out over the white bushiness of snow-on-themountain , her eyes on the blue Virginia hills rising up behind the twisting Shenandoah . ( Did n't Scriptures say to look unto the hills ? ) Selina 's Bible lay open in the gingham valley of her lap . Selina read and rocked . The sun flecking through the trumpet vine was warm on her face . Selina drowsed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was dead asleep when Gil came loping out of the pines behind the Wailer 's cabin . Gil touched his mother 's hand , trying to waken her ; he shook her shoulder , and Selina roused up with a start . " Granma Waller 's awright , " Gil said . " Only she 's got a kinda ache in her back , an ' she says to tell you she 'd be obliged to have a nice broth of chicken , if you got a stewin ' hen handy . " Selina nodded . " You go down the pike a ways , " Selina said , " an ' see what 's happened to Press . " Sunny Sue ran out from the sitting room , screaming , Rosa Lee racing after her . Sunny Sue had broken the white egg with the brown hand mark all over the front of her dress . " ' Twa n't my fault , " Sunny Sue blubbered . " Rosa Lee made me break it . " " I was only tryin ' to git it away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put a fresh dress on Sunny Sue , " Selina said , " an ' see she washes her face . " Selina began to rock slowly , shaking her head . Breaking the sign might double the trouble . She could see Roy dawdling up the footpath from the pike . Roy was chewing the last of the licorice drops Cousin Will had given him to take home to Sunny Sue . Roy crumpled the empty sack , threw it at the hollyhocks . " Cousin Will told me to tell you wa n't no trouble up ' round Laurel Branch , " Roy said , wiping a licorice smear from below his mouth . " He said it maybe wa n't no sign you got . " " It 's a sign awright , " Selina said . " It 's a sign , an ' they 's gon ' be trouble . " Selina went back to her rocker and her Bible . The Lord never gave a sign but what he gave a meaning for it . She began to read Revelations . The sun was lowering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching along beside him . The sun was red-gold above the muddy Shenandoah . Selina had to squint to make out the words of Psalms . " Press went clean to Tater Run , " Gil said , " an ' I went after ' im . " " Nobody knowed where pap 's got to , " Press said , afraid Gil would get to do all the talking . " Mister Anderson said he come to work on time this mornin ' , an ' he laid a few stones on the wall he 's buildin ' out to the pike , then he went off summers , lef ' his lunch under a old locust tree , had n't teched it . " " Nobody had n't seen ' im in Tater Run since the Rice girl 's funeral , " Gil said . " Somepun 's happened to ' im , " Selina said . " Somepun 's happened to Hawg Waller . " Selina called Rosa Lee . She told her to feed the young ones , and put them to bed . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waller , " Selina said . " They 'll maybe come carryin ' him up from the river where he 's stepped off'n a ledge an ' got hissef drowned , or they 'll come drivin ' him out from town where he 's got hissef knifed in'r fight , or he 's maybe gone up in the hills to shoot a fat groundhog , an ' he 's shot hissef daid . They 'll came bringin ' Hawg Walter , or they 'll come bringin ' word . Hawg Waller 's daid . I 'm as sure of it as I 'm sure of glory an ' life ev'Iastin ' . Hawg Waller 's got hissef killed . " Selina sat down to wait . She folded her hands in her lap . She closed her Bible . HALF moon had risen above the far hill ridge where foxhounds barked , and the first treefrogs were screeching from back of the cornfield , when Rosa Lee crept shyly out on the front porch , coughed and asked if she could bring Selina some supper . " I ai n't gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawg Waller come to meet his Maker ' fore his time , " Selina said . Rosa Lee brought her buttered biscuits stuffed with ham . Selina ate them " An ' me without'n a black dress to my name , " Selina said . Selina rocked in the moonlight , her eyes on the footpath weaving up from the pike . Selina felt a sick hollowness at the thought of Hawg Waller 's being dead . There would have been time for dying later . " Somebody 's comin ' up the path , " Rosa Lee said , pointing at the hollyhocks . Selina squinted through the bluish blur of the night . " They is for a fac ' , " Selina said , and she walked to the head of the front steps , squaring her thin shoulders . When people asked , " How did Selina Waller take the bad news ? " she wanted it told over the hills , " Selina took it like a brave widder woman . " Selina trembled in the warm night hush . " He 's walkin ' queer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark figure moving toward the front steps . Selina 's throat was dry and choked . " It 's Hawg Waller , " Selina said , and she had to lean against Rosa Lee to steady herself , she was that weak . " He 's walkin ' from side t'side , " Rosa Lee said . " Lord hep us , " Selina said , " he 's knifed or shot , an ' he 's puny from losin ' all that blood . " Selina gripped the girl 's upper arm . " Hawg Waller 's comin ' home to die like a old fox crawlin ' up in the hills to die in the rocks . " Rosa Lee began to cry . She did n't want to see him dying , all over blood , " It 's better thisaway , " Selina said , stroking the girl 's hair . " Hawg Waller 'd wanta say his last words to his wife an ' his chillren . He 'd wanta breathe his last breath in the softness of his own bed . " Rosa Lee whimpered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her fingers clenching the gingham of her mother 's skirt . The tall black shadow stumbled toward the house , almost fell , straightened up , then staggered forward . A great singing shout cut like a comet through the darkness . " Ida Red , Ida Red ! I 'm in love wif Ida Red ! " Selina stiffened . " Hawg Waller ai n't dyin ' , " Selina said . " Hawg Waller 's drunk . " s Entr4A turned and walked in the house . She boiled water on the cookstove . She made coffee in the big pot . Hawg Waller sat at the kitchen table , staring at her with puffy , red-shot eyes . Hawg Waller 's long-snouted face and flat-topped head were like a hog 's , and his thick shoulders fitted like a hog 's onto his flour-barrel chest . His hands were red and rough ; they were like two big clay-colored rocks that had spilled down from a wall or a chimney Hawg Waller was masoning . " Selina , " Hawg Waller said , sugaring his fifth cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're drunk , " Selina said . " The Waller whiskey thirst has got me , Selina , just like I was caught in'r wrench . It 's a curse in the blood of the Walters , an ' I 'll never git shed of it . Once a Waller starts to drinkin ' you ca n't stop ' im no more'n you can stop the rain from rainin ' . " " They ai n't no drunkenness lasts Pr-ever , " Selina said . " I been drinkin ' since ' fore noon , " Hawg Waller said . " I drunk ' nough white whiskey to float a flat bottom fishin ' boat , an ' I still ai n't got my fill of it . Now that the thirst 's got a halt of me , Selina , I 'll go to my grave a-drinkin ' . " " You got a ten-acre farm , an ' you make good money masonin ' , Hawg Waller . You got a d'voted wife an ' five livin ' chillren . You got no business drinkin ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My pap was a hard-drinkin ' man , an ' his pap b'fore ' im . My Uncle Soley died of his drinkin ' , ended up on the county , an ' you know my two brothers ca n't set down to their supper less'n they 've had their quart of whiskey . " " I got a sign this mornin ' , a white hen egg with a brown hand on it , " Selina said . " The minute I seen that egg I knowed they was gon ' be trouble the same as if the Lord 'd come in my kitchen door and said , Selina , they 's gon ' be trouble . ' " " It doan take no sign to start a Waller to drinkin ' , Selina . I 've wrasseled this thirst for fifteen years , ever since I stood up with you at the church . I 've wrasseled till I ca n't wrassel no more . " " How come you could fight it of for fifteen years , an ' alla sudden it gits sech a holt on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ layin ' out the stone for Mister Anderson 's wall this mornin ' , an ' I was hummin ' a jig tune to mysef the way I sometimes do , you know , an ' Missus Anderson driv by , an ' she told me she had a little present for you . She give me a half-gallon jug of dandelion wine , Well , Selina , the more I worked on that wall in the hot sun , the more I got to studyin " bout that wine settin ' b'side my lunch under the old locust tree . An ' finally I d'cided I 'd take me a little taste of that wine , an ' the very next thing I knowed I was throwin ' away that empty jug , an ' I was makin ' tracks up the hill to Dolph Burch 's . I knowed Dolph 'd have fresh whiskey . " " A woman 's hand reachin ' out to sorrow an ' grieve me , " Selina said . " Missus Anderson'Il hafta answer for it . " " It ai n't her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whiskey cravin ' I was born with , Selina . It 's like floodwater or breshfire . " " I 'm gon ' pray for you , Hawg Waller . " " Prayin ' wo n't hep . " " Prayin 'll move mountains , " Selina said . " You might pray Buck Mountain over the line to West Virginia , " Hawg Waller said , " but you ai n't gon ' pray the Waller whiskey thirst out'r me . " Hawg Waller went to bed . Selina drew a kitchen chair up to the table . She wiped her spectacles with the hem of her skirt . She opened her Bible to the Book of Job . H AWG WALLER woke up next morning with a throat like dried apples . Selina brought him black coffee and thick white cream in a blue pitcher . Hawg Waller shook his head . " It ai n't coffee nor cream I want , " he said , and he sent for Gil , the oldest of his three boys . " Gil , " he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' tell ' im I ca n't come work on his wall today . An ' then I want you to hike up the hill to Dolph Burch 's place , an ' tell Dolph I want a half gallon of white whiskey . Tell ' im I doan want it reddened with burnt sugar . I want it white an ' clear 's branch water . You tell Dolph I 'll pay ' im the money when I git my next wages . " " It ai n't like you to throw away the little bit of cash money as comes your way , " Selina said , " money your fam'ly needs for clothes an ' winter eatin ' . " " Waller men 've fought an ' stole to git whiskey , " Hawg Waller said . " They 've lost their land an ' the love an ' r'spect of their kinpeople . They 've sold the clothes ofrn their backs , an ' they 'd cut the hand ofr'n their arm if they wa n't no other way to git whiskey . It 's like bein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put it out . " Hawg Waller drank all day . He carried the phonograph out on the front porch , and the three boys took turns cranking it . Hawg Waller drank white whiskey from a jelly glass , and sang to the music of the phonograph records . His singing rattled the panes of the front window . " I 'm gon ' pray , " Selina told Rosa Lee . " The minute I git my beds made up an ' my dirt to the door , I 'm gon ' pray . " The moon was just rising when Hawg Waller suddenly slid from his chair , crumpling on the porch beside the phonograph and the near-empty jug . He lay snoring on the wide planks , sprawled like an old horse blanket . " Leave ' im be , " Selina said . " It 'd take six men to lif Hawg Waller . " Selina went to bed . Tomorrow she 'd send Sunny Sue up to Granma Waller 's , and she 'd ask Cousin Will to keep the three boys . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep ; she got up and carried a quilt out to Hawg Waller , walking softly so as not to waken the young ones . She doubled an old coat under Hawg Waller 's head . She knelt beside him , her hand on the whiskery warmth of his face . She 's rather have Hawg Waller , even dead drunk , stretched out stiff as a side of beef , than any man in the great valley of the Shenandoah . Hawg Waller woke next morning with a head that was like a fist opening and shutting . He raised himself up on one elbow , drained off the last two fingers of whiskey in the jug . He shouted for Selina . " Where 's the boys ? " he said , and Selina said they 'd gone over to Laurel Branch . " Cousin Will wanted ' em to hep in the store , " she lied . Hawg Waller dragged himself to his feet , rubbing the ache from his head with the back of his right hand . His head was like a branch spring someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys away , Selina , " he said . " You did n't want ' em to see their poor old pap ruin hissef drinkin ' . " Selina turned away , not saying anything . " You did n't want them boys to see the awful pow'r of the Waller thirst , " Hawg Waller said . " You best come eat your breakfast , " Selina said . " You 're late for your work . " " I ai n't workin ' today , Selina . An ' I ai n't stirrin ' till I git me a little drink . " " You know they ai n't a drop of nothin ' in this house , Hawg Waller . " " Then I 'll go git me a drink . The devil hissef ai n't gon ' stop a Waller from drink-in ' once the thirst gits holt of him . " Hawg Waller marched down the front steps , strode the length of the path to the pike , then disappeared . " It 's Iike the end of the world , " Selina said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hands . She cried into the soft gingham hem of her skirt . Rosa Lee put her arm around her mother 's shoulders , trying to comfort her . " It ai n't no use , " Selina said . " This is the end of Hawg Waller , the same 's if he 'd blowed off his head with a twelve-gauge shotgun . " H AWG WALLER was gone three days . When he came home , he had a yellow-rimmed bruise under his left eye and a three-inch cut healing crookedly on his right cheek . There was no skin on his knuckles , and his clothes hung from him like dirty quilt rags . " It 's a turbul thing you 're doin ' , Hawg Waller , " Selina said , " bringin ' disgrace an ' starvation on your fam'ly . " " I wo n't be the first Waller to go to a drinker 's grave , nor the last neither , " Hawg Waller said , splashing apple brandy into a tin well cup . " What 'll folks say when word gits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's a Waller , an ' it 's the way of the Wailers to drink . ' " The smell of whiskey was so strong in the house the pigs would n't come rooting past the lilac hedge . Rosa Lee said it made her right sick to smell the whiskey , and Selina said she would n't hardly have time to get sick if she 'd stop complaining and do her share of the work around the house . Selina grew more and more irritable , snapping at Rosa Lee like an angry turtle . Hawg Waller drank all day and slept all night ; sometimes , when his whiskey or his brandy ran out , he 'd disappear for a day or two , then he 'd come back with another jug or a couple of fruit jars , and he 'd sit on the porch and drink . He did n't sing with his drinking any more . He just drank . " I wisht I 'd never of been born , " Selina said , " nor lived to see Hawg Waller come to sech an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her eyes on Hawg Waller . He lay sleeping on the porch , curled like a big , overfed bird dog around a half-filled jug of whiskey . His breathing was heavy , and there was a sound in it like the creaking of a rusty axle . " Sometimes , " Selina said to herself , " I think Hawg Waller 'd be better off daid an ' in his coffin . " She twisted her hands together and asked the Lord to help her , maybe send her another sign , so she 'd know what to do . Selina looked up at the pale blue sky , wadded with white dogwood clouds . The Lord could splash a sign clear across the sky , if He wanted to , a sign like a smear of paint across a notebook page . She clamped snuff against the ache in her gums , and when she closed the Copenhagen snuffbox lid , she frowned thoughtfully at her thin , long-fingered hand , the color of an old saddle . For the first time she wondered if she 'd misread @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hen egg was meant to be her hand , not Mrs. Anderson 's . " A sign can be a contrary an ' confoundin'thing , " she said to herself , " an ' some-times the meanin ' is harder to dig out than garden rocks . " She opened her Bible and , with her eyes closed , put one finger down on the page , then she opened her eyes and read the lines above her fingertip . " Behold , I , and the children whom the Lord hath given me are for signs and wonders . " Isaiah 8:18 . She sat for a long time in the sun , and when she got up and walked back into the house , she was carrying Hawg Waller 's half-filled jug . " I got the meanin ' of the sign , " she told Rosa Lee . " The Lord meant it should be my hand that 'll save Hawg Waller from his doom . " S ELENA sat the jug on the kitchen table . She poured some of her green asthma medicine into a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a bit of mutton suet . Then she asked Rosa Lee to hurry over to Cousin Will 's store and get some of his big yellow horse pills . " An ' if Cousin Emma 's got any of her backache powders you bring some . " Selina stirred the greenish mixture in the pan . She dropped in a teaspoonful of Red Arrow garden spray , a pinch of her bean beetle dust , and six plant life pills . " An ' on your way home , " Selina called to Rosa Lee , " you go by Aunt Joy 's place , an ' you tell ' er I want some hill ' erbs . It doan matter much what kinda ' erbs she sends , only just so long as they 's pow'r in ' em . " Selina was humming her favorite hymn when Rosa Lee got back from Laurel Branch . Rosa Lee gave her three yellow horse pills , about the size of metal overall buttons . Selina crumbled them into the mixture which she 'd just darkened with a tablespoonful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cookstove . " You git the ' erbs ? " Selina asked . " Aunt Joy sent some jewel weed juice on accounta she thought maybe some of the young uns had got poison ivy , an ' she sent some blood purifiers , too . She said the purifiers 'd cure ' most anything common . " " This ai n't common , " Selina said , but she added the purifiers to the thickening mixture anyway . Then she began to thin the dark , steaming liquid with cool well water . She told Rosa Lee to take the jug of whiskey out back of the icehouse and empty half of it . " Just half now , mind you , " Selina warned . Then Selina poured the yellow-green mixture into the jug , filling it back up to the halfway mark . Selina shook the jug . " Oh , Glory , you gon ' poison ' im ! " Rosa Lee cried , backing away from Selina , her frightened eyes on the row of small bottles and boxes of powders lined up behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sign told me to do , " Selina said , and she put the jug back on the porch beside Hawg Waller . Then she sent Rosa Lee up to Granma Waller 's to spend the night . " You hep ' er look after Sunny Sue . " Selina sat down in her rocker to wait for Hawg Waller to wake . She squirmed the chair closer to the front window . She began to read Proverbs . She was still humming . I T WAS dark when Hawg Waller woke up . He stretched his arms , then pushed his feet against the porch darkness , working the cramped achiness out of his legs . He rubbed his throat , dry and caked inside . Then he fumbled across the porch planks for the jug , his fingers sliding over the smooth , cool surface , fastening on the neck . He splashed the hot liquid down his throat . He choked , spat , cursed . " Who 's been meddlin ' wif my drinkin ' ? " he roared . " Ai n't nobody teched that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand about the little lies she was having to tell Hawg Waller . " It must be singlin 's , " Hawg Waller said , taking another swig from the jug . " No double-run corn whiskey ever tasted thataway . " Hawg Waller was nearly two hours draining the jug . Then he went to sleep again . Selina was thankful for the loudness of his breathing . No dying man ever made a fuss like that . " It 's a turbul thing I 've done if I ai n't read the sign right , " Selina said to herself . The scream of a hawk ripped the dark sky above Selina . She shivered , wrapped her shawl higher on her neck and throat . Hawg Waller rolled over with a sound like a wallowing colt . He moaned , flailed his Anne Cleveland arms over his face and chest . " Oh , Lord , I 've maybe kilt ' im , " Selina cried , springing up from her rocker , kneeling beside Hawg Waller . She shook him , and he tried to sit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter , Hawg Waller ? You sick ? " " I 'm all twisted up inside . I 'm like if somebody took my stummick an ' looped it around an ' around . " " It 's the whiskey , " Selina said , " It 's the whiskey payin ' you back for the trouble an ' disgrace you 've brung to your fam'ly . They ai n't no sin but what has its own payin ' back . " Hawg Waller doubled his knees up into his stomach , wrapping his arms around his lower legs , working his body into a round lump , as though he had to hold onto himself to keep from bursting open . " Ai n't you gon ' hep , Selina ? " He clawed through the darkness for her hand ; he almost broke the bones with the power of his grip . " Do somepun . " She wrenched her hand free , and stood up , her body tightening against the impulse to stroke his forehead . She knew she had to let him wrestle the pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " You told me yoursef they 's no use tryin ' to fight the Waller thirst . " " But I 'm dyin ' . " His body doubled up in a clenched cramp . He began to beat his fists against the porch planks , as though hammering at Death . " My God , I 'm dyin ' for sure ! " He groaned , and when all the strength was gone from his hands , he lay panting on the porch . " It ai n't right for me to die , " he said , whimpering . " I got my five chillren to raise up . I got my work to finish . " " You should 've thought of that , Hawg Waller , ' fore you give in to the thirst . " She turned and forced her legs to carry her toward the door , away from him . " Selina ! Selina ! " He squirmed and wriggled across the porch , catching hold of the hem of her dress . " You ai n't gon ' leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hawg Waller , but when the thirst come on you , it was you that Id ' me , lef ' your home'n fam'ly . " He turned his face away , lying hunched , his back to Selina , and when he spoke again , his voice was low and trembling , like a lantern guttering out for want of coal oil . " I know it , Selina . I know what I done . I just ai n't fitten . " S HE looked down at him , remembering all the years of their being together , and when she swallowed , it was like wool in her throat . " I ai n't even got the right to ask it , " Hawg Waller said , twisting around , facing her , " but if you 'd only hep me , Selina , I vow I 'd never . . . " The pain suddenly struck full force again . He screamed . " See-line . . . " Her name choked off in his throat . She knelt quickly beside him , his head pillowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writhing slowly stopped . " All right , Hawg Waller , I 'll do what I can , but I ai n't heppin ' you to your feet only to give the Waller thirst another chance to knock you down . You hear me ? " " I hear you . " She gave him castor oil in the juice of canned peaches , then she brought him two of the white sleeping pills the doctor had left the winter she had the fever . " Sometimes , " she said , " you 've got to git cured of the cure . " She asked him if he 'd like to come get in the bed , but he shook his head ; he could n't move . She made him a pillow and covered him with a quilt . " Maybe you 'd best pray , Selina , " Hawg Waller said . " I was figgerin ' on that , " Selina said . " Only it 's gen'rally best to give the medicine first . " I N THE morning when Rosa Lee came home with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , his elbows on the porcelain top , his head in his cupped hands . His face was gray and hollow , and his hand shook when he lifted his coffee cup to his mouth . Sunny Sue began to cry . " Your daddy 's awright now , " Selina said , and then she told Rosa Lee to go up to Cousin Will 's store and bring the boys home . " You thank ' im , " Selina said , stirring the potatoes frying in the black skillet , " an ' tell ' im I 'm gon ' send ' im a ham one of these days . I know how them three boys can eat . " " I doan reckon I want p'tatoes , " Hawg Waller said , hobbling toward the sitting room . " I think I 'd best lay down . " " On your way home , " Selina said , as Rosa Lee started out of the kitchen door , " You go by Mister Anderson 's an ' tell ' im your daddy 's stummick is a mite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comin ' back to mason that wall t'morrow . You tell ' im your daddy 's had a sort of bilious spell . " Selina turned back to the stove , and her eyes fell on the jug , an inch of yellow-green liquid still in the bottom . " Oh , an ' honey , ' fore you go , " she called to Rosa Lee , " you 'd best empty this medicine . We wo n't be needin ' it again . " She poured a glass of cold sweet milk for Hawg Waller , and as she turned toward the parlor , she happened to glance up at the sky . High above the river was a white cloud which at first looked like an ordinary summer cloud , but the more she studied it the clearer she could see the neck of a jug , the round white belly cut by a shaft of blue , the bottom shattered . It was a sign all right . No doubt about it . She carried the milk in to Hawg Waller , humming a grateful hymn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mathematic thing , Whose logical and logarithmic skill Probes the atomic or celestial ring To calculate and carry out Thy will .
