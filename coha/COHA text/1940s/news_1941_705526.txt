txt Earnings of large companies , especially those in the heavy goods field , would be hit hard under excess profits tax changes contemplated by the Treasury Department . This disclosure came yesterday after Secretary Morgenthau and Assistant Secretary Sullivan formally presented to the House ways and means committee the Administration 's tax program , designed to net $3 6 billion of revenue through new and increased levies on individual and corporate incomes and on commodities and services . Effects of these excess profits tax revisions on the steel , utility , oil , rail equipment , rubber and motion picture industries are discussed on Page 2 . Mr. Sullivan told the committee in his formal statement that corporations can be made to pay an additional $400 million of excess profits taxes by reducing credits . " particularly " the invested capital credit , and by increasing rates . He failed to specify revisions the Treasury has in mind . Changes considered by the Treasury , it was learned , call for a sharp downward graduation in the invested capital credit which exempts from excess profits taxes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computed as follows : 1 . A. return of 8 ' 2 , on the first $1 million of invested capital . 2 . A. return of 8% between $1 million and 3 . A return of 4% above $20 million . Under this graduated credit , a corporation with invested capital of $100 million would have a credit of $4.420,000. consisting of $80,000 on the first 41 million of capital . $1.140,000 on the next $19 million of capital and $3,200,000 , on the remaining $80 million of capital . On the basis of the present ' credit , the exemption would be $8 million . New capital corning Into a company would continue to carry with it an exemption of 8% . Since this plan would make the exemption progressively lower as the amount of invested capital increases , the Treasury 's proposal would fall heavily on any large corporation using this method of computing excess profits tax . During the preliminary discussions with the ways and means committee , the Treasury had suggested that the average earnings alternative to the invested capital credit be reduced from 95% to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Increase In Graduated Rates Studied In addition to these changes in credits , the Treasury is considering increasing the graduated excess profits tax rates by 10% . The rates now range from 25% on the first $20,000 of excess profits to 50% on excess profits in excess of $500,000 . The invested capital method of computing the excess profits credit has been of great benefit to heavy goods companies , especially steel companies , and to the railroads , since their earnings during the 1936-39 period on which the average earnings alternative is based were relatively low . The suggested reduction of nearly 25% in the average earnings method will dip into what is considered the normal earnings of many companies . It is expected here that the automobile companies will be among those which would be hit hard by this change . In this connection , Mr. Sullivan made It clear before the ways and means committee that the Treasury does not think that the excess profits taxes should be limited to those companies benefiting profitswise either directly or indirectly from defense spending . This was the policy insisted upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . Yesterday , Mr. Sullivan said : " It is highly desirable that the profits directly or indirectly attributable to the defense program , as well as all excessive profits , should be subject to special taxation " . Go Before Committee Next Week Asked about the Treasury 's plans for changes in the excess profits tax law . Mr. Sullivan said that final decisions have not been reached , but that he expected to place definite proposals before the committee next week . The Treasury 's general tax program will , serve as a basis for ways and means committee hearings . It may be revised substantially before the committee writes its bill , although the expectation in Congressional quarters at this time is that its general pattern will be followed . Mr Sullivan told the committee the Treasury plans to present later this year many re- visions in the Internal Revenue Code . He said that in this connection the Treasury had been considering changes in the capital gains taxes and recognition of community property tax methods . These things will not be considered at this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testimony before the committee was highlighted by an estimate that $1 billion could be saved in non-defense expenditures . He suggested that Congress might look at the $500 million for soil conservation and funds provided the CCC and NYA , still enrolling men over 21. for a part of this saving . When he was before the committee in January . Mr. Morgenthau suggested that Congress re-examine non-defense expenditures . No action was taken then and it is not expected that any action will be taken now unless the Administration assumes the leadership and submits a program of appropriation cuts . Mr. Morgenthau told the committee yesterday that the $3.5 billion tax program amounted to only 4% of a " rapidly rising national income . " This indicated that the program was based on a $90 billion national income . Under questioning , however , it was brought out that the Treasury now estimates the national income as running at the rate of $80 billion a year . Details of the tax program were outlined by Assistant Secretary Sullivan and followed closely previous reports of what the Treasury had submitted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , would raise about $4 billion , but because of interrelated tax bases the net would be around $3.6 billion , or $100 million more than the revenue goal . Mr. Sullivan made no bones about the fact t. t the new corporation surtax , amounting to 5% on the first $25,000 of net income and to 6% on income in excess of this figure , is aimed at corporate income from tax-exempt bonds He also made it clear that this levy was directed at banks and insurance companies . Past Exemption Cited " It is important to keep in mind , " he said , that in the past many financial corporations have received practical exemption from income tax due to their ownership of tax exempt securities. ** He estimated that corporations hold about $8 billion of the partially exempt bonds .. The interest from these is exempt from normal taxes only and would be reached by the new surtax . " When these securities were purchased it was not anticipated , either by the government or by corporations , that the tax benefit from them would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is undesirable that any additional tax benefit be granted by increasing the normal rate on corporations , " he added . This surtax is estimated to yield $534,500 , - 000 and taken together with the excess profits tax changes , estimated to yield $400 million , will mean a total addition to the corporate tax bill of $934,500,000 . Mr. Sullivan told the committee that at the Mad of the last fiscal year partially , exempt federal securities totaled about $35 billion , with about $8 billion held by individuals . The following table showing holdings of partially exempt securities of the Treasury and federal agencies was given : The tax-exempt question alio is behind the Treasury 's proposals for new individual income surtaxes starting from scratch . An increase in the normal rate of 4% would have increased the tax advantage of income from partially exempt bonds . Individual Surtax Schedule The Treasury 's individual surtax schedule is estimated to raise $1,520,700,000 . The surtax would become effective on the first dollar of taxable income . It would begin at 11% . The graduations are so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $25,000 . However , they would increase present rates all the way up the line to $750,000 . On the first bracket of income above the personal exemption , the tax rate under the Treasury bill would be 16.5% , including the 11% surtax , the 4% normal and the 10% defense tax increase . This compares with a present rate of 4% plus the 10% defense increase . The estate and gift tax revision outlined by the Treasury would raise approximately $347 million . Exemptions would be reduced from $40,000 to ** would apply also to estates in the form of insurance . The estate rate would range from 4% on a net estate ( after exemption ) of $5,000 to 70% on a net estate of More than $50 million . The rate increases bulv sharply on net estates between $5,000 and n6 million and amount to a rise of near 100% on estates up to $500,000 . The gift taxes rates would be 75% of the estate rates . In the excise tax field , the Treaiury program would raise about $1,123,200,000 . Of this amount , $188,300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from increased taxes on alcoholic beverages . Chairman Doughton said that Colin F. Stem , counsel of the joint committee on internal revenue taxation , probably would present his alternative tax plans at . resumption of the public hearings Monday . The joint committee proposals would start individual income surtaxes at 6% instead of 11% , and would allow a flat $2,000 exemption . The corporation tax proposed by ' the joint committee , would be an increase in the normal tax , instead of a surtax , and the list of excise taxes is broader . Procedure for other public hearings next week will be worked out is executive session this morning .
