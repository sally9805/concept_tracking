The biggest battle in the biggest campaign in the biggest war in the history of man was joined last week . The Germans thought , prematurely , that they had won all three . " The campaign in the East is decided , " said Hitler 's Little Sir Echo as he set about explaining to the foreign press how and why Hitler thought they had won . Hitler 's Little Sir Echo is his Press Chief , Dr. Otto Dietrich . As he stood in the palatial auditorium of the Propaganda Ministry , in front of a Russian map three times his own height , the suave , bright-faced unraveler of the Fhrer 's tongue was more suave and bright-faced than ever . <P> First , by way of mental disarmament , he put his professional reputation up for ransom . " I have never misled you on the Western Front campaign , " he said . " I pledge my good name for the genuineness of this information . " <P> Claims . His information was a series of assurances with which he personally had just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &gt; The last intact Russian Armies , those of Marshal Semion Timoshenko , were trapped in two encirclements at Bryansk and Vyazma ( see map ) , and faced inescapable annihilation . <P> &gt; The southern Armies of Marshal Semion Budenny were routed . All that remained to block the German drive in the south was the strain on the Germans ' own human endurance and the speed of their machines . <P> &gt; The best of Marshal Klimenti Voroshilov 's northern defenders were locked in Leningrad . <P> From these facts , said Dr. Dietrich , one could make sweeping deductions : " The military decision has already fallen . The rest of the operations will take the course we wish them to . For all military purposes Soviet Russia is done with . " <P> But was it so easily done with ? What would the German soldiers say who had yet to shed blood to accomplish this supposedly accomplished fact ? What of Leningrad ? What of Odessa ? What of Marshal Budenny 's remnants , who would certainly not ask to be captured ? What of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moscow ? What of the wall of the Urals ? What of the Russian Armies beyond the wall ? <P> And what of hatred ? What of the years of trying to organize this mass of resentment ? Was this not Serbia a thousandfold ? <P> How much , then , could the Germans say last week with truth ? <P> Facts . They could say they had launched the biggest pitched battle ever fought . Acting on the fundamental Clausewitz dictum , " Concentrate the maximum of forces in the direction of the main blow , " the Germans had drawn forces from both southern and northern fronts . They had thrown into this great push toward Moscow more than two-thirds of their entire infantry forces in Russia , three-quarters of their Panzer forces . Altogether the Germans were using some 1,700,000 infantrymen , 450,000 motorized troops , 14,000 tanks . <P> The Germans could say with truth that this time they commanded numerical superiority . They had tricked the Russians into sending important reinforcements to the Ukraine , so that now the most optimistic figure possible for Marshal Timoshenko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2,150,000.
