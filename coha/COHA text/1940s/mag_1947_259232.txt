The prosecution at Tokyo 's International Military Tribunal for the Far East rested its case last week . The defense went through the formality of a motion for dismissal , then buckled down to the task of defending the 26 Japanese in the dock ( including . ex-Prime Minister Tojo and ex-Foreign Minister Shigemitsu ) . The charges : " Crimes against peace , murder , conventional war crimes and crimes against humanity . " <P> The prosecution had taken eight weary months to build up its case , and the defense would probably take no less . The testimony of 103 witnesses , mostly Japanese , had been translated into English , Russian , French , Chinese . The prosecution had amassed so many documents that it looked as though it needed bulldozers rather than filing clerks . Said one officer in the documents division : " At first I listed all incoming documents . Then they came so fast that I listed only incoming bags . Then crates of bags . Now I just list the rooms they 're in . " <P> A question remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power to punish the vanquished ? In Washington last week , where he had flown to report to President Truman , U.S. Chief Prosecutor Joseph Berry Keenan answered with a resounding yes . Said he : " We see this trial as establishing the precedent . . . that wagers of aggressive warfare are . . . outlaws . " <P> Critics still claimed that the desirability of outlawing war did not mean that it had in fact been outlawed at the time the accused planned war . Many of the nations on the tribunal had had such doubts . Britain , Australia and New Zealand ( related Keenan ) had at first wanted to conduct the trial on the narrow grounds that Japan had violated the rules of civilized warfare , while the U.S. and Canada clung to the Nrnberg view that aggressive war was itself a crime . Pragmatic ex-Gangbuster Keenan somewhat naively quoted Webster 's New International Dictionary , second edition , unabridged , 1943 , in an effort to establish a legal definition of aggressive war. * <P> Keenan , in fact , never got beyond Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world 's unwritten common law : " If there is no law now under which to try these people , it is about time the human race made some " ( TIME , Oct. 21 ) . Perhaps the most striking of several legal opinions , diligently gathered by Keenan , was one by U.S. Supreme Court Justice Benjamin Cardozo ( 1934 ) : " International law . . . has at times , like the common law within states , a twilight existence during which it is hardly distinguishable from morality or justice till at length the imprimatur of a court attests its jural quality . The gradual consolidation of opinions and habits has been doing its quiet work . " <P> <P> * The definition : a first or unprovoked attack , or act of hostility ; the first act of injury or first act leading to a war or a controversy ; an assault ; also , the practice of attack or encroachment ; as , a war of aggression .                  @ @ @
