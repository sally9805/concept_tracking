There once was a warm-blooded youth Who dwelt in the town of Duluth . <P> When they asked , " are you froze ? " <P> He said two or three Noes , But he chattered in every tooth . <P> When Duluth 's temperature last week dropped to 25 below zero , it was thus saluted by a warm-blooded oldster , Manhattan Wit Franklin P. Adams . Temperatures were even lower elsewhere in the U.S. : at Montpelier Junction , Vt. it was 45 below , and Gordon , Wis. was almost paralyzed at 54 below . Most of the U.S. , from the Rockies to the Atlantic and south to Texas , Louisiana and Florida , felt the severest cold of an extremely severe winter . <P> Too Cautious . Both in Houston and in Tampa , where papaya trees withered overnight and shivering residents stood in queues two blocks long to buy kerosene for their stoves , snow fell for the first time since 1940 . Tuscaloosa , Ala. had eight inches , and Meridian , Miss . had five . In Knoxville , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tennessee students that he jumped out of his car , pistol in hand , and dared them to throw just one more . They respectfully refrained . <P> The steam-driven towboat Kokoda , running nearly 160 miles ahead of the diesel-driven Helena in a 1,100-mile race up the Mississippi from New Orleans to St. Louis , got stuck in the ice ten miles above Cairo , Ill. , barely managed to get up enough headway to keep its lead . <P> New York City , with many of its streets still edged with the remains of the Big Snow ( TIME , Jan. 5 ) , got seven hours ' advance warning of an all-day blizzard whirling in from Cape Hatteras . Caught short before , municipal authorities worked themselves into a mad dither of preparedness ; firemen were put on 16-hour emergency duty , 1,400 plows and snow trucks were mobilized . But most of the fuss was needless . The blizzard , such as it was , raged over the city for a few hours , then blew itself out to sea . <P> Too Brittle . Even so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven hours late , the Queen Elizabeth 's sailing was delayed twelve hours , and 1,300 Brooklyn homes had their supplies of heating gas cut off . In Buffalo , Pittsburgh , Detroit and many another city , industrial gas and power supplies were slashed . Detroit 's auto plants laid off workers by the thousands . In St. Paul , the cold halted construction work on an ice palace being built for a winter carnival , opening Jan. 31 . At 20 below , the ice was too brittle to be cut into uniform blocks . <P> Birds and animals had a hard time of it . Long Island gulls and ducks , their shoreline food sources cut off by piled-up ice , took to swiping baby trout from the running-water ponds of the state 's fish hatchery at Cold Spring Harbor . In Wisconsin , woodsmen swore that snowshoe hares limited their traveling to man-made paths .
