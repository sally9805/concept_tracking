txt The United States will adhere to its announced policies in Germany and will not try to match Russian moves in Eastern Germany that appeal to fanatic nationalism , John J. McCloy , United States High Commissioner , indicated today . In a prospectus of United States thinking on the situation arising from the creation of the Eastern German Democratic Republic , Mr. McCloy emphasized : 1 . All aid possible would be given to Berlin " in continuation of our policy , a cardinal ' element of which is that we remain in Berlin . " 2 . Whatever the Russians might do , there was no United States policy favoring the withdrawal of United States troops from Germany . 3 . United States policy must be continued in Germany in accordance with previous statements and would not be adjusted to meet Russian propaganda moves . 4 . The exchange of views between the Western German Government and the High Commissioners must be more complete in the future in the face of what Western Allied observers here regarded as a new Soviet offensive against Western Germany . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the Western powers and the Eastern republic although this should not be extended to diplomatic recognition and an exchange of ambassadors . As an example of what he meant by not changing Western policies , Mr. McCloy said that the Western German Government must continue to deal with the Western High Commission . The naming of Western German Ambassadors to Washington , London and Paris to match the Russian moves is not contemplated , he added . Mr. McCloy 's forthright statements were made before any suggestions for an - increase in the sovereignty of the Bonn ' Government had been received by the High Commissioners . The Western legislature will assemble Thursday in Bonn and it is possible that when it does the first effects of the nationalist policy espoused by the Russians in Eastern Germany will be apparent . United States officials in Frankfort , while generally applauding Mr. McCloy 's stand , felt that its full effect would not be known until one factor could be judged fully . That factor was the effect the violent nationalism of the new Eastern state had had upon the extreme nationalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the effect is negligible . Events of this week may change that . Certainly Dr. Konrad Adenauer , Chancellor of the Bonn Government , made at least a curtsey in the direction of the policies of the Communist state today when he announced that a State Secretariat for International Affairs would be set up in Bonn . He added this had nothing to do with the creation of a Foreign Ministry in the Eastern German Government . Adenauer Reaffirms Berlin Stand Dr. Adenauer , who announced he-would make a statement on the creation of the Eastern state - to Parliament Friday , declared Berlin was the " bulwark of Western Europe in the East , " joining Mr. McCloy in new reaffirmation of the West 's intention to remain in the former capital . The statements by Mr. McCloy and Dr. Adenauer revealed that definite progress had been made toward drawing the Western Germans into the general structure of the Ruhr Authority . Dr. Adenauer announced that Dr. Walter Bauer of Fulda , would be German observer with the International Authority for the Ruhr . If the Ruhr Statute were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar controls , Dr. Adenauer implied , Western Germany would be glad to send envoys to participate actively . Mr. McCloy said there was no change in the Western Allied position on dismantling and the questions of reparations and security with which it was linked . If the Germans feel strongly on the matter , he suggested , it is up to them to suggest " constructive measures " to deal with it . In a recent conversation with a correspondent of The Times of London , Mr. McCloy discussed the possibility of including all industrial areas of Western Europe , including Germany , in the European economic cooperation program. , This , he indicated today , might solve the dismantling problem and at the same time take Scare of the security problem . ' But he made it clear that the attitude of the Western Germans on the Ruhr and in the Organize- I tion for European Economic Cooperation first must make it clear to Western Europe that Germany was not seeking again a dominant economic position .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
