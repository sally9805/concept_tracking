It can not be said too strongly that casual , offhand remarks at a press conference are the worst possible way to deal with matters of such great moment . These are things to be done carefully and thoroughly . . . not things to be tossed off in this fashion . Mr. Roosevelt is indulging in a petty vanity , which is that he is very smart . . . . Mr. Churchill , who has as good a brain as Mr. Roosevelt , does not do it , and President Wilson did not do it . . . . If the President is wise , he will henceforth confine his press conferences to domestic questions and to . . . action taken . . . . <P> With these words , Pundit Walter Lippmann last week reprimanded Franklin Roosevelt for talking out of turn about religious freedom in Russia . Certainly the President was not very smart in arousing Mr. Lippmann and others . But perhaps the President was a little smarter than Walter Lippmann knew . <P> At a press conference President Roosevelt was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that over 100,000 Polish soldiers fighting with the Russian Army have been allowed to keep their Catholic chaplains , that a Roman Catholic church and a synagogue , both for Poles , are to be opened in Moscow . The President reminded newsmen that he had suggested , several weeks ago , that they read Article 124 of the Russian Constitution . <P> Asked a reporter : " What does that say , Mr. President ? ' ' <P> Franklin Roosevelt laughingly remarked that he had not learned it by heart . He offered a rough paraphrase : freedom of conscience . . . freedom of religion . . . freedom equally to use propaganda against religion . <P> This , said the President , is essentially the rule that applies in the U.S. , except that we do not put it quite the same way. * <P> These words had hardly left the President 's lips when U.S. churchmen started ramming them down his throat ( see p. 46 ) . Wrote Charles Clayton Morrison , Editor of the rabidly isolationist Christian Century : <P> " His attempt to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of religious freedom ... is far more shocking than the tactical faux pas of Mr. Lindbergh , who mentioned the Jewish influence as a factor in pushing this country into war . " <P> Snorted Representative Martin Dies of Texas , no churchman , but the piety-loving Chairman of the House Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities : " Freedom of religious worship is , and always has been , as nonexistent in Soviet Russia as freedom of speech ... in Hitler 's Reich . " <P> But the President was not done . Two days later he expressed his hope that " an entering wedge " for the practice of religious freedom in Russia is " definitely on the way . " Next day he broke the news that he had instructed W. Averell Harriman , chief of the U.S. mission to Moscow , to take up the question of religious freedom with Joseph Stalin . <P> It was a fair guess that his personal envoy to the Vatican , onetime Steelman Myron C. Taylor , had discussed the same question with Pope Pius XII . At week 's end Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his confidential report to the President .
