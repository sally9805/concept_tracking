This will not only influence the prices of meat and dairy products , but livestock feeding will cut into the record wheat crop , which was estimated at 1,408,602 , - 000 bushels , only slightly under last month 's estimate .

Rathbun , president of the Dairymen 's League Cooperative Association , presented a request to the Production and Marketing Administration at Washington for an increase in milk prices from $5.02 to $5.46 a hundred pounds by Oct. 1 .
