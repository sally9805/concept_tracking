When the Republic of France died last week , four days before the 151st anniversary of Bastille Day , it was a solemn hour for lovers of freedom , especially in the U. S. Although the Declaration of Independence was written 13 years before the Bastille fell , the American and French Revolutions had the same ideological roots , and in the minds of Americans and Frenchmen alike the words Libert , Egalit , Fraternit evoked the same ideals as Life , Liberty and the Pursuit of Happiness . For a century and a quarter the U. S. and France watched those ideals spread across most of the world . For the last few terribly quick years , together they have watched them crumble . <P> To most U. S. citizens last week it was as if a well-loved wife had been unfaithful . The shock was no less because they had expected it . France had been cajoled , betrayed , raped , but what hurt was her final acquiescence . To some it seemed because of that final acquiescence . France , now brazenly fascist , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Perhaps they were right . For by last week it was crystal clear that France 's collapse had been preceded by a long , slow disintegration of the democratic and republican ideal , and in the process of disintegration was many a lesson for thoughtful U. S. citizens to ponder . <P> They could reflect that the inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness implies that good citizens will work together for the happiness of the greatest number ; that in a republic the privilege of self-government imposes the obligation to select representatives who will honestly and disinterestedly govern ; that the preservation of democracy requires all citizens vigilantly to exercise their democratic rights , to give generously of their time and their energy , to maintain their self-respect and respect for their chosen Government , to fight for it when necessary . For 20 years political apathy has been common to most republics . <P> In France realization came too late to save the Third Republic and democracy . Bewildered by what had happened to them , the French people needed time to relearn the lessons they had forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the nucleus of the French nation , and even this was in doubt . To try to save as much as they could , by whatever means they could , was the self-appointed task of the self-appointed leaders of what was left of France . <P> In Vichy , seat of the Government , Vice Premier Pierre Laval told the hastily summoned Chamber of Deputies : " I bring you , not the conviction , but the certainty , that if you want an honorable peace you must give Marshal Ptain what he wants . " <P> What old Marshal Ptain wanted ( on the advice of Pierre Laval ) was for the Chamber and the Senate to vote themselves out of existence and empower him to write a new Constitution . This they meekly proceeded to do , with only three dissenters in the Chamber , one in the Senate . The one Senate dissenter was the Marquis Pierre de Chambrun , who holds honorary U. S. citizenship ( under a Maryland law ) by virtue of his direct descent from the Marquis de La Fayette , and whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
