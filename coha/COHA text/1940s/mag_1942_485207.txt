Last Days on the Shuttle Is it possible to feel sympathy for the situation of - Henry A. Kissinger in his last six weeks as Secretary of State ? After all , he 'll be losing that long official car , those rides in Air Force 2 , all those respectful attendants , the hushed corridors of power . After January 20 , it will be " Dr. Kissinger , " not " Mr. Secretary . " The signs are that Kissinger 's transit from celebrity to history is one of the more personally painful ones in the current WaShington exodus . Still , it is hard to feel sympathy for him . In the dying days of the Republican administration he is up to his old tricks . The latest flim-flam involves this country 's agreement with the Philippines on our military bases there . It is hard to tell from the press reports which side is telling less of the truth on why Kissinger 's billion-dollar deal with the " friendly " dictatorship in , Manila broke down . It is a regrettable result of Kissinger 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumption that the American Secretary of State is the lesser liar . What seems obvious , however , is that Kissinger tried to rush through this bit of unfinished business in his usual way . That is , with offstage noises about how the Russians are going to be using Vietnam 's giant Camranh Bay port installation ( one of our legacies to the winners of that war ) , Kissinger employed the combination of public pressure ( " peace is ' at hand " ) and private misrepresentation for which he is famous . This time it did not work with . the Marcos government , which wanted a higher proportion of the billion to be paid in arms , as against aid . So the deal Kissinger thought he could get away with , after his conversations with Foreign Secretary Roinulo in Mexico City , fell apart . Now ; according to The New York Times ( December 7 ) , relations between Washington and Manila are " severely strained . " - The Secretary of State 's penultimate effort , the grandstand play on RhOdesid and the proposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shambles that was inevitable for it . The Geneva " negotiation " is as close to , total immobility as stich things can be and the fighting - steps up as the conference sits ' still : There is no sign ? that the United States is putting any , kind of pressure on the stubborn ? ? lily-white government Of Ian Smith . The man President elect Carter has chosen to replace kissinger , Cyrus Vance , is about as , diffeient in style as it is possible , to imagine , ' and that is already a relief . Kissinger has generously offered to shard with Vance what the Times calls ' " the ' secrets of the departMent " and he has called Carter 's selection . ' brilliant . " Vance 's riposte , in a this ' eichange , ' Of , amenities , was to 1 ' 4 the outgoing Secretary 's " great , ' great talents " and to " say ; rather ambiguously , that " if the time arisesrInOws he can " count on ' the Secretary to advise and help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not very alit to " arise , " nor do we think tlie'OCcasion should be-sought . Kissinger 's flamboyant style ' hued ' the devious policies of the Nixon Wiiite House . It would not fit the more open , not to say - more honest , ways , of ? handling our relations with the world which Carter has promised and Yance seems to 4 THE NATION/ December 18 , 1976 ? represent . Let Kissinger retire , completely , content with the prospect of his million-dollar memoirs and with the words of Egypt 's President Sadat ringing in his ears ( Newsweek , December 13 ) : " . . . one of my ' most intimate friends . . . a man that you can really trust . . . . " Sadat really said that , and let Kissinger leave office in the belief that the sentiment is universal . The Condemned Accomplices It is convenient for the zealots of law and order , the unquestioning supporters of the death penalty , that they have found two convicted murderers who urgently want to die . Gary Mark Gilmore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with morally comfortable excuses for their attempts to reinstate , and make acceptable , what reformers once called " judicial murder . " It has been called other names  --  an eye for an eye , retributive justice , the ultimate deterrent , and so on . Gilmore and White admit their guilt and demand the punishment which the law , with growing ' qualms , allows . They say that they prefer swift extinction to years of imprisonment ' in our vile ' jails . They hate , among others , the individuals and organizations that are trying to preserve their wretched lives on behalf of some abstract cause in which they have no interest . That cause , of course , is civilized behavior on the part of a society , restraints on the life-and-death power of the state over its citizens . Naturally , these considerations seem remote to men on death row who face ' an awful future whatever their judges decide . The thing they hate the most is themselves , as Gilmore 's quite eloquent statements prove . " Please , Mom , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had her phone disconnected ) , " accept the fact that , I do n't disagree with the law and the ' sentence that has been imposed upon me and I wish to be dead . " He wrote the girl he had been living with before he committed his two murders in Utah ? and before both of them tried and failed at conventional suicide  --  that the idea of execution by the state was " more acceptable and ' easier than suicide. , . , . My soul is on fire and screaming to vacate this ugly house . . . . Death is death is death . A path worn smooth by the many , who have trod it befOre . " As for White , he told a judge in Texas that " if any man ' deserves to die , I do for the crimes I 've committed . " And later he wrote to the clerk of the Supreme Court , of the United States , even as lawyers tried to stay , his execu- tion , that he wished any appeal On his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on death row , " I have had plenty of time to consider my particular situation . " There has not been an execution in this country for almost ten years . A series of Cases ? which reflect changing public attitudes toward the extreme penalty have blocked several states frOm carrying out a'punishinent that , ' not long ago , was almost routine . But the ldw goes on evOlving , the cases- d6g their way to higher and higher tribunals , different ' judges sit on benches and reflect stricter " law-and-order " ' feelings . The condemned exist in their maximum security cells , waiting fdi an ultimate judgment which for them may also be final : For them the waiting is " cruel and unusual , " as were the crimes they committed , and as the judicial system has , with hesitations and qualifications , declared execution itself to be . And now the dam of moral inhibitions , built up over the last decade or two , , may be about to break . Once that happens , even in one case , there may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells and ending those scores of lives by shooting , hanging , electrocution or gas  --  applied by the state in its majesty . If so , it may occur because two of the condemned killers happened to be men of suicidal bent , men who wanted to die . This disposition of theirs , their refusal to plead for - their lives , will have- sprung the leak - that broke the dam and somehow absolved their official executioners . They will thus have made it easier for the state to go ahead with the grim business of retribution , one to which it is notoriously hard to put limits . " To defer to the choice Mr. Gilmore has made , " wrote the ACLU 's executive director , Aryeh Neier , in The New York Times ( November 17 ) , " is to acknowledge the right of the state to engage in savagery and to coerce Mr. Gilmore into becoming an accomplice in legal homicide . " The fact that Gary Gilmore would be an accomplice to a killing in which he is also the victim is sad but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be his accomplice in his suicide . The News that Fits the Purse Newspaper readers in Michigan are worth $592.88 each . In New York City , in the afternoon field , the going price is $60 a head . In England the quote on Sunday paper readers is a fragment of a farthing . These odd figures are derived from three recent transactions in the newspaper business . There was a time when journalists intended a kind of affectionate scorn for their profession , or trade , when they said that they worked in " the newspaper business . " The phrase implied that they knew quite well that the publisher 's cash register was their ultimate editor , but it was also a cocky boast that they could somehow dodge the commercial restraints and manage to get into print some information their readers needed. , - Those days seem to be gone forever . The newspaper business is now just that . The cash register has been buttressed by the computer and , the techniques of opinion polling , and that combine is more in control of daily journalism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assertion from the pages of the trade publication , Editor &; Publisher. , we should explain the calculations on the value of one reader-on-the-hoof. ( 1 ) Samuel I. Newhouse recently bought Michigan 's Booth newspaper chain , made up of eight daily and Sunday pOers with a total circulation of 506,090 , for $300 million . ' ( Booth also puts out , the Sunday , supplement Parade , whose 113 subscribing organs have a combined circulation of 19.354 million , but we choose . arbitrarily to leave ' that out of our calculation . ) Newhonse- is now the -- proprietor of by far- the largest newspaper chain in the country ' : he leaves the local management , wide editorial latitude , by most accounts , as long as the , ? profits keep rising : , ( 2 ) The **26;332;TOOLONG press lord Rupert Murdoch is about to con-dude a deal , we are told , whereby he buys the 500,000 readers of the New York Post for about $30 million , which works out to relative cash values of ten straphangers to one Michigander . The explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper monopolies , which merit the label often pinned on their television analogues ? " a license to print money . " ( It is quite common to have these two money machines under the same corporate roof , thus almost exponentially fattening the profits. ) ( 3 ) The purchase for one sagging pound of The Observer of London by ARCO , the oil conglomerate , falls into another category of calculation alto- - gether . It is not paying even a penny per thought of those 600,000-odd readers , except in the sense of agreeing to subsidize for a while the losses of that venerable weekly . The pro quo for that quid is less obvious , as we observed last week , but it just might have something to do with the gushers-to-be of the North Sea and the British Establishment 's attitude toward the sharing of those spoils . Now back to the way in which American newspaper editors look at the profession , trade or business in which they find themselves , as set forth in the November 13th issue of Editor &; Publisher . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently president of the Associated Press Managing Editors , tells his fellOw editors that , " It does not embarrass me to say that we are all in the business of meeting consumer needs , as other businesses are . " Unembarrassed by that statement , Jinks gives half a cheer for democracy and the First Amendment in a sentence that reads : " Business efficiency , primarily aimed at maximizing profits , does not eliminate journalism 's public responsibility . " He even makes so bold as to deny that it is " pretentious to say that we have a constitutional mandate , to audit governnient and the other major institutions of society . ' There is no way we can , escape that respcinsibility , and most of us would not want to do so . " Those are the ringing tones of the heirs of John Peter Zenger in the year of ' the Bicentenary . , On another page , the general manager ' and president of the Associated Press , Keith Fuller , beats his breast and admits that a " deficiency " of the A.P @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a concept he has a hard time defining . Perhaps with an eye on , the threats froM the Third World to exclude the West 's , news gatherers and , distributors and to substitute their own national press services , Fuller declares that " perspective " may do the , trick , which is " not to sell foreign news , but to bring global happenings closer . " ( To whom , one might ask . ) , On , nearly every page , of this and , other editions of Editor &; Publisher some editor is seeking ? help from pollsters and marketing experts on what , their journal 's " product " should be. , They want to be more closely attuned to their readers ' " interests . " They:see themselves in , competition for- " leisure-time attention ' ' , yv , ith television and one even complains that " our biggest competition is dulthess . " These then are- the worries of the - American daily press , ' that herd of moneymaking monopolies . The idea of the public interest , once so clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the computerized stacks of the profit and ( almost never ) loss statements . Even the Boy Scouts have joined the parade of the " fresh approach to newspaper journalism , " we learn on page 38 of Editor &; Publisher 's November 13th issue . The requirements for the journalism merit badge have been amended to include a " talk with a business executive about relationships between editorial and bUsiness departments and what makes a publication ' good . ' " It might be better if the Scouts , and editors ; stuck to the old scouting tradition of the daily . " good turn . " Any Black Will Do On November 29 Clarence Norris , the last known surviving " Scottsboro'boy , " returned to Alabama to pick up a pardon for a crime that the , state finally recognized he did not commit . Thus came to an end one of the causes celares of the 1930s , the most famous of the cases in Which black men were tried in racist courts for allegedly raping white women . And thus ended , that sad chapter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chapter ' comprised the whole book . Convicted before he was , 20 for raping two girls in a train , Norris spent fifteen , years in prison , five of them ' on death row . After being paroled in 1946 he fled Alabama and lived as fugitive for three more long , Scottsboro-hatinted decades . There is some comfort in the ' fact that justice for Clarence Norris was finally done  --  even justice of a bureaucratic sort , and forty years . too late . But it is disturbing to learn that the , Scottsboro syndrome lives on , as Terry Cannon points out in this . issue ( p. 652 ) . Delbert Tibbs , a young . black man whose 1974 conviction anddeath sentence for rape-murder were overturned by an appeals judge who was outraged by the flimsiness of the evidence , will soon go on trial for his life a second , time . Two other ' cases that fall into the same familiar pattern prove that Scottsboro is not to be found only south of Mason-Dixon . In Bowling Green ; Ohio , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Nation of Islam , Paul X Moody , of attempted rape . Moody had an alibi and did not fit the victim 's original description of her attacker . The police 's presentation of his photograph to the victim was done in a ' fashion that could hardly fail to prejudice her . And most compelling , the ? victim testified that she had left scratch , and bite marks on her assailant . A doctor who examined Moody the day after the assault found no such marks .. In Buffalo , N.Y. , Kenneth Johnson faces 126 years in prison on charges stemming from a series of rapes in that city . , Once again , Johnson does not fit the various descriptions of the attacker , nor the composite drawing prepared from those accounts . His ' defense committee says he has ' an alibi . The police were desperately ' eager to make an arrest in the case because of community outcry . And reports indicate that rapes of the same pattern continued to occur while Johnson was being ' held ' in prison . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I Only wish the other eight ScottShoro boys could be here today  --  their lives were ruined by this thing too . " How many lives of young blacks like Tibbs , Moody and Johnson are now being silently wrecked because their cases have received no attention ? How much longer , must we wait before Scottsboro is placed where it belongs : in the museum-case of ancient horrors ?
