Even book-publishing went on in the French underground . Last week French booklovers were scouring their country for copies of 20 small , paper-covered volumes that are already collectors ' items . <P> Anti-Nazi poems , novels , essays and political reports , mostly written by Frenchmen under pseudonyms and collectively known as Les Editions de Minuit ( Midnight Editions ) , they had been published under the noses of Vichy and Nazi authorities for more than two years . Now the authors ' real names were revealed . <P> They included some of France 's most famous writers : Poet Louis Aragon ( " Franois la Colre " ) ; Franois Mauriac ( " Forez " ) ; Livration Editor Claude Morgan ( " Mortagne " ) ; Poet Jean Cassou ( " Jean Noir " ) , and ( anonymously ) Roger Giron , Chief of Cabinet in Premier Reynaud 's last Government . Reprinted for Les Editions from smuggled foreign copies were John Steinbeck 's Nuits Noires ( The Moon Is Down ) and exiled Catholic Philosopher Jacques Maritain 's A Travers le Dsastre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only 25 people knew the identity of the man chiefly responsible for Les Editions de Minuit . He was shy , thirtyish Jean Bruller , a onetime illustrator whose skittish prewar works included a book of cartoons entitled Twenty-One Delightful Ways of Committing Suicide . <P> In December 1941 Bruller and vivacious young Yvonne Paraf ( who had connections with the underground ) started their dangerous career as anti-Nazi publishers . <P> A Paris doctor donated 5,000 francs and Publisher Bruller bought the necessary paper bit by bit on the black market . Under the pseudonym " Vercors " he also wrote the Editions ' first volume , Le Silence de la Mer ( later translated as The Silence of the Sea and published in LIFE Oct. 11 , 1943 ) . Working secretly nights and Sundays , Underground Printer Ernest Aulard handset the Editions ' first volumes , later managed to obtain a linotype . <P> By Hand and Bicycle . Completed pages were delivered to Madame Paraf 's gaily furnished apartment . Here Bruller and Paraf cut and bound the pages by hand . Two trusted girls on bicycles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ copies were sent boldly through the mails or passed on to resistance groups for distribution . Hundreds of other type written copies were passed from hand to hand throughout France . <P> The Editions ' 21st volume , a stirring story of an escape from the Nazis , is the first to be published in liberty , the first to omit the defiant inscription of its predecessors : " Ce volume , publi aux dpens de quelques lettrs patriotes , a t achev d'imprimer sous l'oppression a Paris " ( " This book , published with the aid of certain patriots of literature , has been printed under the oppression in Paris " ) .
