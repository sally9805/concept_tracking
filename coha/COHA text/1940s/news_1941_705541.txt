txt In spite of a substantial increase in traffic over a year ago , present indications are that with few exceptions the domestic airline companies experienced losses in the first quarter of this year . For a number of reasons operating costs increased at a more rapid ratio than revenues and increases in passenger traffic did not match the gain in miles operated . However , operating results in April were much more favorable for the industry in general and at the present rate theie is good prospect that many of the losses taken in the first quarter will at least be made up in the second . Of the major systems , only two appear to have made money in the first quarter , and net profits for these two did not match the first quarter of 1940 . American Airlines had net profit of $71,060 for the period . equal to five cents a share , compared with $304,053 , equal to 86 cents a share in the corresponding period of 1940 . Eastern 's Net Below Last Year Eastern Airline 's earnings probably will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than the $511.579 , equal to $1.17 a share . shown in the first quarter of 1940 . Its favorable earnings position with respect to the rest of the industry in the first quarter Is the result of the fact that the winter months are the peak period for Eastern because of the vacation travel to the south . However . Eastern itself has been affected by the weather and other factors which have cut into earnings of the other airlines There was a return of unfavorable weather conditions in March which should be a large Eastern month and on only one week-end were the planes 1007 booked . Some days passenger revenue was half what it normally would have been . Transcontinental &; Western Air today reports a net loss of $987,999 for the first three months against a net loss of $254,976 a year ago and other major lines , including United and Pennsylvania-Central , are expected to show substantial losses for the period . Position of Penn-Central in later months . however , is expected to be improved materially by retroactive adjustments for payments on mail now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set . Factors in Earnings Decline Taxes are only partially responsible for the unfavorable showing by the airlines in the first quarter . Air transportation companies are not subject to the excess profits tax . Nevertheless . they are subject to the normal income4x which has been raised to from 18 , I , and allowance must be made for a probable further jump . Decline in earnings in the first quarter was due primarily to the fact that air transportation companies were geared up to handle substantially more traffic than has actually developed so far . The chief factors bringing this situation about have been the acquisition of new and more modern equipment and the consequent necessity for increasing personnel . Fixed operating costs went upward as flight expenses mounted due to increased schedules and the greater number of route miles flown , while weather conditions also had a further adverse effect in reducing load factors . In addition , larger provisions have had to be made for obsolescence and depreciation to offset the increases in equipment .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
