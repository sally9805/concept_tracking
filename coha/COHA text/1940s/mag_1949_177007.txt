If the rocket went in the wrong direction , all that could be done was to cut off the fuel supply ( by radio ) and bring the rocket down . <P> Last week the Air Force announced that it has developed and tested two rockets that are really guided . One , the NATIV ( North American Test Instrument Vehicle ) , is a small contraption 13 feet long , designed for high-speed aerodynamic studies . The other , the 774 , looks like a formidable weapon ( see cut ) . It is 32 feet long ( the V-2 was 45 feet long ) , and , says the Air Force , " is potentially capable of attaining altitudes of more than 100 miles .

" The steering is done by the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not explain how the fins are controlled from the ground , and admitted that the degree of control is " not great . "
