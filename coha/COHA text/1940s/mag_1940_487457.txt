THE hour of decision was over before the election . On the one essential point , the defense of liberty , the two candidates were of one mind . We are committed ; the danger lies in our refusal to admit it , even to ourselves . We are drifting fast into world action , but we are drifting sideways or even backward , still crying peace , neutrality , and isolation when not a shred of these remains . It is this insincerity that Albert Carr would dispel . Isolation is gone ; participation as a mere auxiliary is the kind of entanglement most contrary to our traditions , our interests , and our principles . The remaining alternative , the only one worthy of our power and of our ideal , is leadership . We alone can " end war " and " make the world safe for democracy . " This is our great opportunity , our second chance . It may be our last . " End war ! Save democracy ! " We have sneered for twenty years at these promises . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking and determined action . We must first confess that our cynicism was wrong , and that the despised " idealists " were the only true realists . " America , " says Mr. Carr , " betrayed the world and herself twenty years before the inadequate old gentleman with the umbrella tried in good faith to postpone Armageddon . " " For the American betrayal of 1919 there can be no extenuation . Each year that has elapsed has made the crime against humanity blacker , more sinister . " Yesterday this would have been vox clamantis in deserto . Even today these are courageous words . We are still hampered by the anti-Wilsonian propaganda of the last two decades . We are hampered also by the activities of those men who are at heart with the Nazis and against the democracies , those fifth columnists who paralyzed and betrayed France . As in France , they are an odd coalition , and the most insidious elements among them are those conservatives who " fear that the defeat of Germany would give over Western Europe to a socialist revolution . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Smashing dangerous organizations , " however , is perilous in a democracy . Carr offers two excellent rules . The first is637 that " a democratic government , even in peace time , has every right to insist upon a monopoly of force . " " It should not hesitate to suppress groups set up for organized intimidation , like the Ku Klux Klan . " The second is that " no organization should be dissolved unless it has proved its menace to democracy by a record of overt acts . " Let this have a place in our Bill of Rights . The worst cause of confusion , according to Carr , is our " tender-mindedness , " the wishful thinking which prompted us to " outlaw war " without first creating world law . His longest chapter is entitled We Need to Get Tough . I gladly indorse the idea , but , with all respect to William James , I object to the words . " Tough " is too easily confused with " rough , " " raw , " or " coarse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We need to make our thinking stronger through greater refinement . Reality is tangled . It is " tough " in the wrong sense of the term to dismiss Nazism as " the revolution of nihilism . " Much of the excellent and very definite program proposed by Albert Carr was anticipated by the Nazis ; on this point Mrs. Lindbergh has a lesson for us . It is " tough " to bracket together Germany and Russia ; in Russia the dictatorship is not a permanent principle , and the imperialistic virus has been reduced to a minimum . I fully agree with Carr that " in fact , if England with American aid can throw back the Nazi attack , it will be important to have an understanding with Russia well before the collapse of Germany . For America to reject Russian cooperation would be a piece of ignorant folly . " Frankly , Carr 's book is journalistic in tone , and certain references to history , literature , or philosophy are rather crude . But the thought is cogent and the presentation vigorous . I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more subtle treatment . But I know how hopelessly wrong the sophisticates are apt to be . Between the exquisite culture of the French Academy and the avowed " toughness " of Albert Carr I do not hesitate . As La Bruy  --  re said more than two hundred years ago : " If it comes to a choice , je veux " etre peuple " ( I want to be with the people ) . ALBERT GUERARD The Talk of Ezra Pound ccTCANTOS LII-LXXI . By Ezra Pound . New Directions . $2.50 . HERE is no other poetry like the Cantos in English . And there is none quite so simple in form . " So Allen Tate has written and then added of Ezra Pound : " The secret of his form is this : conversation . " To take this view of the Cantos is very valuable , for no other explains so well the power of Pound 's allusions . The formal approach is conversational ; the secret of the form is another matter and as yet hidden in the recesses of Pound 's mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , talk of men and of arms , of men who fought and got the credit for it , and of those who also fought , as desperately and as bravely fought , and got no name for it , the companions of Ulysses who did not hear how sweetly the sirens sang , and for all their pains had only the recollection of ear wax and of pulling at the oars . ,
