If you want to talk to our correspondent in Batavia , Java , his telephone number is ( or was , recently ) satuh duaw sambulan toojoo . Ask for Robert Sherrod-but do n't expect him to be there . <P> During the last six months Sherrod has traveled 25,000 miles trying to keep up with the news in Southeast Asia and the western Pacific . The Pacific-from Attu to Iwo Jima - was his stamping ground in World War II , and we sent him back there after the war on a roving commission to go anywhere his news judgment dictated . His work to date is fairly typical of the postwar trials , tribulations and rewards of a TIME correspondent . <P> He chose Java , and the Indonesian independence movement , for his first major assignment and , in the process of reporting that story , made two trips through territory forbidden to white men with Sjahrir , Indonesian premier . He also spent some time with rebel leader Soetomo , a fiery five-footer regarded by the Dutch as a most dangerous enemy . Soetomo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old , who said she was born on the Isle of Man , claimed U.S. citizenship through one of her marriages , and was variously known as Miss Tantri , Miss Daventry , Miss Merdeka ( freedom ) , and Surabaya Sue ( for her " freedom " broadcasts over the secret Indonesian radio ) . <P> In the process of meeting and sizing up most of the newsworthy people in his territory , Sherrod interviewed Mahatma Gandhi , who told him with a twinkle in his eye : " I had assumed that Americans were to be the new citizens of the world , but I find them all homesick lads . " Gandhi 's opponent , Mohamed Ali Jinnah , leader of the Moslems , was not so easy to get to . In fact , he wanted a year 's subscription to TIME as the price of an interview . <P> Like almost everything else in the postwar Far East , transportation-like communications , a correspondent 's lifeline-is a shambles . Says Sherrod : " Covering a war was fairly simple , provided , of course , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make your reservations , and nobody worried about priorities because the admirals and generals wanted their war covered . Nowadays , it is every man for himself , and it is a fight from beginning to end . " <P> For instance , Sherrod tried for three days to buy a plane ticket for a quick trip from New Delhi , India , to Shanghai ( via Calcutta and Manila ) . When he finally located the Air Transport Command officer and gave him money for the passage , the ATCman promptly lost it . So Sherrod bought another ticket and got to the airport just in time to watch his plane taking off ( they had given him the wrong departure time ) . In Calcutta , nobody had even heard of his reservation for Manila . There , he found that his China visa had not arrived and , to make things more difficult , a brand new inoculation for plague had been ordered . That meant a seven-day wait . Meanwhile , the ATCman in New Delhi had found the original passage money he claimed Sherrod had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to China .
