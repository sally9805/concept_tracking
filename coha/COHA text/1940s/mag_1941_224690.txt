In 1917 the U. S. Army 's Remount Service consisted of one officer , one clerk . All through War I ( which employed 4.624,220 horses and mules ) , the A. E. F. suffered from a shortage of animals , had to wangle thousands from the U. S. 's Allies . Today the Remount Service consists of 131 officers and 342 men . Last week Remount was able to report that the biggest part of its first defense emergency job had been completed : it had bought 20,000 up-to-specification animals . It will have them all trained and ready for service by June , in the meantime must buy 7,000 more . <P> Already Remount is going at a clip 14 times faster than a year ago . In its three depots ( Front Royal , Va. ; Fort Reno , Okla. ; Fort Robinson , Neb. ) , 56 reserve officers are in training . It has 700 thoroughbred and purebred stallions ( average cost $7.50 at stud ) , and it is looking a long way ahead . But not ahead of more experienced armies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more in France , now has approximately 800,000 in military service . Japan used horses heavily in China , plans to have 4,500 stallions at stud by 1945 . Franco had to raise his cavalry from five to 60 squadrons before he could win his war . <P> Remount 's breeding plan* was designed not so much to increase U. S. horse population ( fallen from 20,000,000 in 1920 to 10,000,000 in 1940 ) as to improve the breed . Army stallions are lent to farmers , ranchers , breeders who have proper equipment and agree not to allow the promiscuity of pasture breeding . These agents of Remount charge mare owners $10 a foal : $5 at the time of service , $5 when the mare delivers the colt . Some agents , such as C. C. Townsend near San Angelo ( who has five Government stallions ) accept payment in chickens , eggs , or a calf . Some of the studs are aristocrats , the get of such lords of the turf as Sun Beau and Man o ' War . Some compete in such high horse company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Square Garden . <P> On farms in the Middle West , at dealers ' stables , in the ranch country of Texas and the Northwest , it 's usually a big day when the " guv ' - ment buyers " come by . They are officers from the Remount depots and area stations . Remount 's buyers travel some 50,000 miles a year over highways and byways , up the creek forks , in fields , pastures , cactus and brush . Sellers know these men want a sturdy , clean-footed , straight-legged horse that " travels right " ( straight , no pacers ) , has good bone , short backs for Army saddles , that they prefer a horse that is to ? thoroughbred , that 75% of the horses they buy are from the Remount 's own studs . The horses must stand 15.1 to 16.1 hands high , weigh 1,050 to 1,300 pounds , be 4 to 8 years old , gentle . <P> For this kind of horse Remount pays an average $165 a head . Within those specifications it must find light riding horses ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , heftier but active and fast horses for field artillery . The buyers know that some day these horses may have to travel as much as 100 miles in 24 hours , gallop a mile in three minutes .
