One afternoon a Michigan farm boy rushed home , clutching the first map he had drawn at school . His mother saw that it was marked " A. " " I think you are going to be like me , Isaiah , " said she . " I think you are going to like geography . " <P> Isaiah Bowman did . From the little boy who liked to pore over stones on his father 's farm , he grew up to become the nation 's top geographer . He wrote 14 books on the subject , was Woodrow Wilson 's boundary expert at Versailles ( " Tell me what 's right , " commanded Wilson , " and I 'll fight for it " ) . His name was stamped on far-off places . There is a Bowman Bay , a Bowman Island , a Bowman glacier . <P> In 1935 , Bowman became president of Johns Hopkins University . " Bow " streamlined the administration , erased the deficit , added top scholars to its faculty . Impressed by his ability as an administrator , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you as a major prophet . Now , I am inclined to think you are the daring young man on the flying trapeze . " Last week , the trapeze was slowing its swing . At 69 , Isaiah Bowman decided that it was time for him to retire . <P> Home of Research . Johns Hopkins , which is about the same age as Bowman , has known prophets before . It was one of the first U.S. universities to emphasize graduate research . Harvard 's crusty President Charles W. Eliot had to admit that his own graduate school , " started feebly in 1870 , did not thrive until . . . Johns Hopkins forced it to . " To the tidy campus on the edge of Baltimore went Poet Sidney Lanier , Viscount Bryce , and James Russell Lowell to teach or lecture . Woodrow Wilson , John Dewey and Walter Reed studied there . Its medical school , which often overshadowed the rest of it , also had its prophets : famed Physician William Osier , Gynecologist Howard A. Kelly , Pathologist William H. Welch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopkins ' undergraduate program-two years of general education , then two years of study in one of foUr special " groups " ( physical sciences , biological sciences , social sciences , the humanities ) . For him , every educated man had a private contract with society : " To respect that contract is to be mature , to strengthen it is to be a good citizen , to do more ... is to be noble . " <P> Romps on the Floor . A stocky man with twinkling , rimless glasses , Isaiah Bowman has run his university with grandfatherly firmness . He has often irritated trustees with his stubbornness , sometimes infuriated faculty members by prompting men regardless of seniority . Though he sometimes gets up at 2 a.m. and works until dawn , he always has time for children . Visitors often come upon him and his four grandchildren ( " Gumdrops , " he calls them ) , rolling and shrieking on the floor , while his wife ( " Pistol Packin ' Mamma " ) looks on . <P> Now he feels too old to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am as good as ever ( if ever I was good ) , " he wrote last week , " such insistence would be in itself clear evidence of senility ! " <P> His next project : to write six books on international affairs .
