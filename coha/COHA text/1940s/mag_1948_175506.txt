All week long the urgent bulletins from harried Dewey lieutenants in Wisconsin reported new gains by General Douglas MacArthur and indefatigable Harold Stassen . Unless Dewey reversed his 1944 strategy , when he swept the Wisconsin primaries without lifting a finger , he might find himself out in the cold after next week 's primary election . At week 's end Tom Dewey made his decision : he would hustle out to Wisconsin this week , would follow up with a trip to Nebraska . <P> The announcement from Albany was carefully phrased to conceal the Dewey-men 's concern . Said Dewey : " The time has come for a frank and blunt statement of the complex and serious problems confronting our nation and the world . . . . The national Administration has failed in its duty of frank discussion . I propose to bring before the American people the facts as I see them and the solutions I believe necessary . " <P> But there was no concealing what had happened . Even before MacArthur 's entry into the race , Harold Stassen 's free-speaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When MacArthur jumped in , his name became a new rallying point for many who had climbed reluctantly onto the Dewey band wagon for lack of anywhere else to go . <P> By the time of the Dewey announcement , MacArthur supporters had whipped themselves up to a lather of confidence . Gathering in Milwaukee 's Plankinton House , 200 MacArthurmen from 19 states met to listen to jubilant speeches by Wisconsin 's Secretary of State Fred Zimmerman and ex-America Firster Lansing Hoyt , national chairman of the MacArthur-for-President clubs . The delegates talked hopefully of winning all of Wisconsin 's 27 convention votes . <P> Even Dewey 's campaigners were willing to admit that a MacArthur victory seemed in the cards . But that could always be explained away as local loyalty to a favorite son . What really worried Tom Dewey was the fear of running behind Harold Stassen , a defeat that would seriously cripple his whole campaign for the nomination . If he was going to do anything about it , there was no time to lose .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
