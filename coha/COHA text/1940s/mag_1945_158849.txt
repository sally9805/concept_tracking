Europe , like the shell of a once great house , now burned out , bullet-riddled , sacked and gutted , groaned and listed as it settled on the debris of its foundations . In practically every country of western Europe last week changes of government were in process or in prospect . In all , so far , the changes were proceeding , if not peacefully , at least nonviolently . But even in the course of the most gradual transitions could be heard the grinding undertones of social change . <P> Norway , Denmark , The Netherlands had just completed , or were about to complete , new cabinets , in which resistance or leftist leaders dominated . Belgium was faced with a political crisis touched off by King Leopold 's decision to return home . In France , the French defeat in Syria had raised new questions about the leadership of General Charles de Gaulle . Would he still be strong enough , by the time of France 's national election next fall , to keep the right and left in suspended solution ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakened by the snub given him by the United Nations ' Conference on International Organization in San Francisco . Italian leaders , after seesawing for weeks , had at last formed a new Government but were promptly faced by a new crisis . Even in Britain , the fiercely fought general election campaign was a test to see whether social change should come gradually or seismically . <P> What the new political carpenters , plasterers and plumbers would do for the old house remained to be seen . So far they had been chiefly partisans and leftists . But if they did not build for all men instead of political parties , all mankind instead of a social class , their work would be patchwork , their tenure , as history reckons time , brief . And the despairing inhabitants would probably ask the next crew to raze the old house to the ground and start building over again from the ground up .
