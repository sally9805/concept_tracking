Ceiling prices designed to protect buyers and assure " reasonable profits " to automobile dealers were established today by Leon Henderson , Price Administrator , for all makes of new passenger automobiles . Using a formula worked out in conferences during the last six weeks with representatives of automobile dealers , Mr. Henderson applied his retail prices to an estimated 500,000 available automobiles which are to be rationed to eligible buyers beginning Feb. 12 .

Added Charges Are Defined " In order to determine the maximum retail price , exclusive of State and local taxes , " the announcement explained , " a dealer takes the manufacturers ' list price for the make and model in question and adds : ( a ) Federal excise tax ; ( b ) an allowance for transportation which can not exceed the actual rail freight charge from the factory at ' carload ' rate ; ( c ) 5 per cent of the total of the list price plus the transportation allowance , or $75 , which ever is lower , and ( d ) an amount equal to 1 per cent of the list price , or $15 , which ever is lower , for each calendar month or greater part thereof that has elapsed between Jan. 31 , 1942 , and the date of sale . " If any of the standard equipment has been removed the maximum price must be lowered by the retail value thereof . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which ever is lower , to the price of a car for each month it remains in storage , OPA has overcome most of the objections raised by dealers , who complained that the expense of carrying cars in their establishments for months and in some cases for more than a year would be too great for the dealer to bear . They argued that the care which must be given a new car held by a dealer costs about $1 a day . This care includes frequent polishing , attention to tires and other services , they said . As to Handling Charges The 5 per cent or $75 listed under ( c ) according to OPA is the maximum that may be charged for handling and delivery and all of the other services customarily performed by dealers in connection with preparing a new automobile for " drive-away " by the customer .

" Those new cars remaining in dealers ' and distributors ' hands as of Jan. 1 , when the government ' froze ' automobile sales , together with the cars produced by the industry in January , number in excess of 500,000 . Roughly 25 per cent of this amount is being ' stockpiled ' for sale in 1943 and after . " An undetermined number will be released beginning Feb. 12 to persons who had purchased , but had not obtained delivery , of cars on Jan. 1 . Theo remainder will be sold during the current year to eligible civilian buyers against certificates issued by local rationing boards and to categories of buyers , such as the Army and Navy , who are not obliged to obtain purchase certificates .

" The exceptions , it was stated , reflect OPA 's approval after Oct. 15 , of applications made by the two companies for permission to increase prices on their 1942 models to bring them in line with earlier increases by other manufacturers . Other provisions of the wholesale schedule require the producer to deduct the wholesale price of any standard equipment which may have been removed from a model which he sells , and also permits the manufacturer , distributor , or exporter to add the monthly storage charge specified in the retail schedule to the price of each car he holds . Manufacturers are required to file with OPA by Feb. 22 a list of standard equipment they held as of Oct. 15 last , for each make and model manufactured , and , further , to keep complete and accurate records of all sales for inspection by the OPA.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
