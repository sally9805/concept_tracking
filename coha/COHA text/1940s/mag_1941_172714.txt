A new German Fleet of small submarines and torpedo boats , floated down the Danube or shipped in pieces by rail , was assembling last week in Bulgarian ports . Only rumor announced the news , but for once rumor had support . Berlin papers carried a photograph of no less a Nazi seaman than Grand Admiral Erich Raeder conversing with Bulgarian officers . The Russian Government sent a sharp note accusing its old friend Bulgaria not only of harboring Axis army and air force units , but of letting Axis warships gather in the ports of Varna and Burgas ( on the Black Sea ) and Ruschuk ( on the Danube ) . <P> For Russia , already neck-deep in the world 's greatest battle , this meant that another battle , perhaps another enemy , soon would have to be faced . <P> Vital to the defense of Russia is her Black Sea Fleet , which has played a part in the defense of Odessa and dominates the rest of the Sea . Last week Turkey stoutly refused to allow Italian ships to pass through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake . But Russia was obviously worried . <P> It would be a large order for the Axis fleet to sweep Russia 's cruisers , destroyers and submarines out of the Black Sea . But the Nazis would hardly have sent so big a shot as Admiral Raeder to Bulgaria for his health . <P> Many observers thought that the Nazis were planning , not a Battle of the Black Sea , but a Battle for Batum and its oil . Remembering the swift air- &-sea; invasion of Norway , they pointed out that Transcaucasia is only 700 miles across the Sea from Bulgaria , less than three hours by troop-carrying plane . <P> Not to be ruled out was an attack on the Dardanelles . For months reports of German and Bulgarian troops concentrating on the Turkish border have kept the Ankara Government jumpy . A land offensive , synchronized with attacks by Admiral Raeder 's fleet on Istanbul and the Italian Fleet on the Mediterranean end of the Straits , might win the Axis control of the Dardanelles , enable an Italian naval force to push into the Black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sea , Russia was not caught napping . Soviet bombers began pounding Rumanian ports . If it should also be necessary to bomb Bulgaria , Russia 's note , next thing to a declaration of war , cleared the way .
