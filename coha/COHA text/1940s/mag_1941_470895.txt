article , " The United States Army , " in the December issue . In that article Mr. Hanighen drew up an inventory of our armed forces and made an appraisal of the merits and deficiencies of the various branches of the Army . Now , in " For a Modernized Army , " Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson goes into a detailed criticism of the methods of training and organization in our military establishment . Major Wheeler-Nicholson was born in Greenville , Tennessee , in 1590 . In 1911 , after his graduation from St. John 's Military School at Manlius , he was commissioned 2d Lieutenant in the 2d Cavalry , United States Army . He served on the Mexican border , was cavalry instructor in the First Plattsburg Camp , served in the Philippines and in Siberia , and was in command of the American Cavalry Squadron in the Rhineland . He has been attache to the Embassy in London and served in a similar capacity with the Japanese and French General Staffs . While on duty in Paris he attended the French War College . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been translated into French , Swedish , Dutch , and Spanish ? and Battle Shield of the Republic . The latter , published last fall , is an extremely critical volume , discussing the organization and fitness of our Army . The third book , A - Blue Print for Action , a consideration of the question Can Britain Win ? will appear shortly after this issue of Harper 's reaches the stands . SPECIAL DELIVERY s 1-1E , explains in the Author 's Note , James L. H. Peck is not the pilot whose trans-atlantic flight he describes in " Bomber to Britain . " But at twenty-eight he is a veteran flier all the same . He received his pilot 's license in 1930 and later served as a pursuit pilot in Spain with the rank of 1st Lieutenant in the Loyalist Army . In addition to his aeronautical skill he has developed a remarkable talent in writing about flying . Readers will recall his hair-raising " 579 Miles an Hour , Vertically , " an account of a test pilot trying out a new Army plane , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a frequent contributor to most of the aviation magazines as well as the New York Times , the Scientific American , and other papers and periodicals . He is the aviation editor of the Associated Negro Press and writes a column which is syndicated to more than 100 weekly newspapers . He has written two books : Armies With Wings was published a year ago ; the second , So You 're Going To Fly ? will be published about the time this issue of Harper 's reaches the stands . Mr. Peck is a member of the National Aeronautic Association and the Aircraft Owners and Pilots ' Association , and is Pennsylvania secretary of the National Airmen 's Association . Here is a paragraph from one of his letters describing his experiences in Spain after " a crazy journey through southern France with thirty other recruits for the Spanish Loyalists " : That frontier crashing is a serious and exciting piece of business we found out in short order . For nearly fourteen hours we stumbled our way across the Pyrenees Orientals ? supposed to be the minor range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were destined to see for months to come , as a young , exhausted Pole tripped and fell from the narrow circuitous trail and plunged to his death 2,000 feet below . Following several days in the ancient hell-hole , Fort Figueras , we arrived in Valencia just in time for the worst air raid to date . My Buddy , Paul Williams of Los Angeles , who was the only other flier in the group , and I were sent to the aeronaval base at La Ribera for examinations and any training we needed ? which was plenty . Our survival we owe to that excellent training , but there was that something called luck involved , for the most part . Of all our combats , two are particularly vivid in my mind . One night over Cartagena , I dove my Mosca at an Italian Caproni bomber , and dove too long . . . Nothing but the most sheer luck enabled me to twist my ship so that the wing barely clipped the bomber 's tail . My buddy , Alberto , a Dominicano , brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made it . The othermemorable expedition was occasioned by a raid upon the fascists ' Balearic Island air base , and the ensuing combat , in which nearly 100 planes engaged . We lost eleven ships and three of our best Spanish friends , but Paul and I survived somehow . Upon our discharge , we went to Paris with the idea of going to China to join some American fliers we knew . However , we could n't make the right connections and returned to the U. S. after a brief visit to England . OUTPOSTS S rRETcHED out in a great arc from the Virgin Islands southward to the coast of Venezuela lie the Lesser Antilles , the barrier islands between the Panama Canal and the Atlantic Ocean . At the moment these islands , including Jamaica , still arc colonies of Great Britain , France , and Holland as they have been for many generations . But their future , dependent upon the outcome of the European war , is in doubt ; the United States has recently acquired air bases on a number of the islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be presently pushed into our laps . Few of us know anything about the West Indies . Tourist literature provokes pleasant dreams but does n't provide much in the way of information . Many persons thought that President Hoover showed ill feeling and bad manners when he said , after a visit , that the Virgin Islands were " a poorhouse . " Now it appears that the Great Engineer blurted out the truth . In " Outpost No. 2 : The West Indies Lawrence and Sylvia Martin perform a dissection on these pearls of the Caribbean . Mr. and Mrs. Martin spent nearly four months last year ? from June 7th until October 1st ? in the islands gathering material . Mr. Martin says : was a college professor ? teaching at various times English , Journalism , and American History ? for sixteen years before my voluntary retirement last year in May to travel about the lower Americas and write a book or two . I was one of the associate editors of Ken , and one of the articles my wife and I contributed to that magazine was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief manuscript reader on Esquire and Coronet . CoAaKi ) FALMOUTH FRENZY " C APE COD Gets a War Boom " is Clark Craig 's first contribution to Harper 's . He is a young Westerner engaged in social research in New England . His article is no arm's-length job ; Mr. Craig wielded a hammer and saw along with the rest and , not long after he went to work , found himself a foreman in charge of a mob of soi-discmt carpenters . The man with the carpenter 's chest made from a bureau drawer was the one who caught our eye ; surely there is hope for the republic so long as this type persists . @AZ EAT FOR LIBERTY TT Looks as though Americans are going to I learn about nutrition whether they will or no . As we go to press with James Rorty 's " Total Defense and Public Health , " the New York Times prints a front-page Washington story to the effect that " In 1917 the slogan was ' Food will win the war . ' With present day knowledge that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' " The task of spreading the gospel of nutrition , says the Times , " has been delegated to Paul McNutt , Social Security Administrator , who has been named to the imposing post of ' co-ordinator of all health , medical , welfare , nutrition , recreation , and other related fields of activity affecting the national defense . ' " The New Yorker 's Roving Reporter thus describes a general mess menu at Camp Dix : The document had been signed in the lower left-hand corner by two cooks , verified by a third cook , checked by an assistant mess officer , and approved by a mess officer . The bills of fare for breakfast , dinner , and supper were printed in three artistically laid-out blocks of type . For breakfast , the selec tees had on that day one half grapefruit , fresh milk , boiled eggs ( four minutes ) , fried potatoes , dry toast , butter and coffee . For midday dinner , they had lettuce salad , baked ham , brown gravy , applesauce , mashed potatoes , baked carrots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For supper , they had pepper salad , salmon cakes , browned sweet potatoes , creamed turnips , eating apples , bread , butter , and hot tea . The parenthesis telling how many minutes the breakfast eggs were boiled is the United States Army 's . It must not be supposed , however , that this intense interest in vitamins has been provoked entirely by those interested in defense . Years of laborious effort by public-health officials and laboratory technicians , millions of words about diet in print , the agitations of food cranks , the change in fashion from the hourglass figure to the slender , and many other causes had gradually worked public interest to a point where it would catch fire . The pharmaceutical houses are pouring oil on the flames ; probably there are few drugstores in the United States that have n't had a window display devoted to synthetic vitamins in recent months . " Our problem , " says Dr. Wilder of the Mayo Clinic , " is to reach Mrs. Tom Jones in terms that she can translate into today 's dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We put this problem up to Mr. Rorty . He replied : Here is a paragraph based on Bridges ' requirement , the same used in my text , and computed on Bridges ' measurement of mineral content of common foods , which to the best of my knowledge and belief has not been superseded : " To supply normal adults with a liberal amount of both calcium and phosphorus , it is sufficient to consume daily a quart of milk or a four-ounce piece of Swiss cheese . The daily calcium requirement could also be supplied by three cups of turnip greens , the phosphorus requirement by a cup and a half of navy beans . Normal adults are adequately supplied with iron and copper if they eat daily a quarter of a pound of beef liver . in practice , of course , all the normal mineral requirements are rather easily supplied if the diet is rich in a variety of the protective foods ? dairy products , eggs , fruits and vegetables . " Mr. Rorty then adds a comment of his own : You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The answer is to balance your diet with perhaps a little more than ordinary emphasis on the protective foods . No ( Continued on second page following ) William Alexander Percy , author of " Jest Fode , " was born in Greenville , Mississippi ? the Mississippi Delta country ? in 1885 and lives there now . He says , " My people have all been planters and lawyers , " and after his education at Sewanee and Harvard Mr. Percy became a lawyer also . He served with the A.E.F. during the last war " Jest Fade " is a chapter from his autobiography , Lanterns on the Levee , which will be published by Alfred Knopf this spring . He has written and published four volumes of ' poetry . At the age of twenty-five Mr. Percy was a participant in a celebrated political fight . James Kimble Vardaman , one of the best known of the Southern political spellbinders ? the gallery includes Ben Tillman , Jeff Davis of Arkansas , Tom Watson , Tom Heflin , and greatest of all , Huey Long ? had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Senate . In 1909 Senator Anselm McLaurin died and the election of his successor , not subject to a primary , was up to the legislature . Vardaman 's popularity with the poor white farmers was very great and his election was a practical certainty . At this juncture his opponents determined to make a number of nominations and split the legislature , eventually uniting on one candidate . The maneuver succeeded and after a prolonged and bitter session Vardaman was defeated and Mr. Percy 's father elected . A year later his term expired and in the ensuing primaries Vardaman was successful . During these campaigns feeling had been worked up to a fever heat and , pistol in pocket , Mr. Percy accompanied his father as a bodyguard . On more than one occasion lie round himself in situations so tense that it was a question whether he would survive to write another poem , let alone an autobiography . *fa GUINEA PIGS H ERE are the thirty progressive schools picked out in 1932 by the Commission on the Relation of School and College for the experiment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for Life " : Mrs. Bromley is an experienced newspaper woman and has written many articles for Harper 's . Last fall she went out to Indiana for us in order to dust off " The Education of Wendell Wilkie . " The piece appeared in the October number . She was born in Chicago , attended Northwestern University , and since 1920 has lived in New York . For some years she held advertising and book publishing jobs ; then she became a free lance . From January , 1935 , to May , 1938 , she wrote for the Woman 's Page of the New York World-Telegram , going from there to the New York Post , where she stayed until last year . Now she is free lancing again . Her books include Birth Control ? Its Use and Misuse and ? with Florence Haxion Britton Youth and Sex . PLAY TROUBLE W alter Prichard Eaton , author of " The Plight of the Dramatist , " is an old hand at dealing with the theater . He began reviewing plays for the New York Tribune in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its power , when Clyde Fitch was the most popular American dramatist , when the road was flourishing and the stage was littered with stars whose name nobody now recalls . ( Who was Fay Davis ? Who was Wright Lorimer ? In what play , employing horses , camels , and a horde of supernumeraries , did he appear for three years ? In what famous play was a sand storm simulated by putting Wheatena through a vacuum cleaner in reverse ? ) Since those days he has been dramatic critic for many-New York papers and has written thirty-six books . Some of them are about plays and the theater , some are about nature , gardens and living in the country , some are plays ? he wrote a successful play with David Carb about Queen Victoria which was produced in 1923 with Beryl Mercer as the Queen ? and some are hooks for boys . After the retirement of George Pierce Baker in 1933 Mr. Eaton took over his courses in play-writing in the Yale Drama Department . &C; &; FUNCTIONLESS E T September we printed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Inflation " in which the author he is the Wall Street correspondent of the Christian Science Monitor ? poured cold water on the idea that there would be a war boom in the stock market . Numerous persons thought there would he one and on these pleasant anticipations a boomlet started and blew up . In " Are Stockholders People ? " Mr. Fleming traces the economic changes which have obliterated the function which the stockholder once had , changes which have left him at the mercy of labor , management , and government . The author would argue also that , as a matter of fact , few stockholders want any voice in management ; the stockholder wants a place to put his money and not an opportunity to participate in the oversight of an enterprise . Mr. Fleming graduated from Harvard in 1920 and for two years worked for the American Relief Administration , first m Prague and then in Moscow . For a time he was a field inspector in Samara in the Volga valley . Crossing Siberia in 1923 he did financial work for the Chinese Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter for the Shanghai Times . In 1924 he returned to the United States and since 1928 he has been in Wall Street . He has been with the Monitor since 1935 . Recently he has been heard on the air , substituting for Raymond Gram Swing . in Pittsburgh in 1907 , grew up in Washington Court House , Ohio , and went to school at Antioch College . He says : " Before this year and back to 1933 I worked with the New York firm of Stevenson , Jordan and Harrison , industrial and management engineers . This work and my association with the firm started in the days of the NRA when I commuted between New York and Washington writing codes and setting up administrative organizations . The virtue of all this work was that it involved a type of economic study and analysis of industries ( at one time the firm managed some forty groups with combined annual income of nearly three billion ) that can only be undertaken in unique circumstances . Some of the reports that we wrote covered resources , markets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and financial structures and , since we were working in a confidential capacity for the industries themselves , we had the real facts . Consequently , we could deal with the real problems . " In the past my travels included four years in the metallurgical division of General Motors Research Corporation , a brief trick as a reporter on a trade journal and an equally brief adventure as Assistant Advertising Manager for the Air Reduction Sales Corporation . " In 1940 Mr. Hitchcock served as Treasurer of the Tung Sol Lamp Works in Newark , New Jersey . Robert Nathan 's " Dunkirk " is the only poem this month . He is best known for his novels ? One More Spring , Portrait of Jennie and others ? but his interest in verse is constant . A volume of poetry by him called Winter Tide was published a few weeks ago .
