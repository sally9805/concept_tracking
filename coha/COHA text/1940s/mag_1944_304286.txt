Sometimes nerves , like pollarded willows or clipped adenoids , will spread and grow after pruning . The growth rate may be an eighth of an inch a day , or even faster . This fact has been the basis of infantile-paralysis treatments by Lieut . Commander Harvey Ellsworth Billig , Jr . and Physiologist Anthonie Van Harreveld of the California Institute of Technology . <P> Their first big success came in 1940 , when they operated on a 16-year-old boy with a weak , wasted lower leg and foot . Through an incision in the calf , they crushed the nerve above the point where it was damaged . Two months later , motion and feeling began to return to the foot . Eventually the boy regained full power in all the affected muscles and his treated leg again measured the same as the other . <P> Last fortnight in Philadelphia , Lieut . Commander Billig showed the International College of Surgeons a startling new technique . He now does the operation bloodlessly , with an air-driven rivet gun with a specially rounded head . The gun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves right through the flesh . <P> Altogether , about 500 patients have been treated in Los Angeles and 40 in Philadelphia , all of them paralyzed a year or more . Considering that any improvement in such cases is remarkable , results so far have been excellent .
