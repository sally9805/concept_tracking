When Premier Alcide de Gasperi 's Christian Democrats won the elections last April , the West sighed with relief and turned to other concerns . Indifference was premature . Last week the Communists were renewing their campaign of sabotage . <P> Red Rash . When De Gasperi outlined the points of his new government 's program in the Chamber of Deputies , Communist deputies shrilled a dissenting antiphon . The Premier said that he would maintain law &; order ; they shouted : " How many innocent workers have been murdered ? " De Gasperi pledged cooperation with ERP ; the Communists screamed " Imperialism ! War ! " + <P> Communists did more than talk . A new rash of Communist-inspired strikes broke out in Italy . In the north , dairy and ricefield workers struck . Sicilian dockworkers and Sardinian coal miners threatened to join . In the Red fortress of Bologna , Communists called a 24-hour general strike . The objects of Communist parliamentary and trade-union tactics : to trip up the government as it inched toward stability . <P> In the long run , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would need to deliver some promised reforms . The program he announced last week included general promises : land reform ( distribution of big estates ) and reclamation , stricter tax collections , relief for Italy 's two million unemployed . <P> Green Peas . Among the 19 ministers in De Gasperi 's new government was sad-eyed , scholarly Giuseppe Saragat , who would try to see that those promises were carried out . His " Party of the Little Green Peas " * had won nearly half of Italy 's four million Socialist voters from Communist Collaborator Pietro Nenni . Saragat was in the new cabinet as Vice Premier and Minister of Mercantile Marine . <P> " I believe the Prime Minister wants to go ahead with necessary changes , " said Saragat last week . " Otherwise I would n't have entered the cabinet . Our task is to give him all possible support , to push and suggest that which will benefit the working classes . " Of Communists , Saragat has said : " Nothing separates us-except a great abyss . " But his alliance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently of his colleague : " Saragat sometimes seems to hear the call of the wild . " <P> The most compelling spur to reforms by the new government was the watchfulness of Italy 's voters . A middle-aged shopkeeper in Rome 's Trastevere slum district put it this way last week : " I voted for De Gasperi because I do n't want to see Communists in power . But if we do n't get something out of it this time , I 'm going to vote for the Communists and see what they can do . " <P> <P> + One piece of Communist propaganda recently miscarried . Even Italian Communists could n't stomach the stick sentimentality of a Russian propaganda movie . It showed a Russian airman ready to die in glory while Comrade Stalin , over the radio , urged him to live on . Interrupted Italian comrades " We want Walt Disney ! " <P> * Italians pronounce the initials of Saragat 's Partito Socialista del Lavoratori Italiani ( Socialist Party of Italian Workers ) as piselli ( peas ) .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
