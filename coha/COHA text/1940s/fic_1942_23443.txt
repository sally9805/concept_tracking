A TRY FOR THE ISLAND A STORY BY PAUL HORGAN I WENT up to Colorado one summer when I was a boy to visit my cousin Jack Winterhood . I did n't know him very well , but his mother was my father 's sister . She was a widow who taught the rural district school in the country of the South Fork of the Rio Grande . I stayed with her and her son , who was a year older than I. They lived in a white painted farmhouse set in the greenest field I can remember on the flat land by the big river which ran past their place two hundred yards away . What a river ! It came rushing grandly down through the open tunnel of rock , and the water was the color of daylight reflected in a dark mirror . One branch of the river came from the west and the north . The other came off Wolf Creek Pass to the south . Where they came together there was a point of /and that narrowed as the division between the streams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an island . It was a long spit of land not very wide across . The river was deep and full of silvery rapids on both sides of it and below . But above it by a curious roil in the meeting of the two mountain flows , there was a deep black pool which turned slowly and mysteriously like a magic lake , lapping delicately at the island 's upper end . My cousin Jack Winterhood was a calm , active boy with brown eyes and a pale freckled face and short-cut brown hair . He had flecks of yellow light in his eyes , and when he was thinking something over he would simply regard me , and those flecks would seem to kindle with deliberation and justice , and when he decided what he thought or would do he spoke crisply , and I could never do other than his will , for it seemed to me to have been so inevitably arrived at . The narrow-gage D. and R. G. railroad ran through that valley , along the river course , in and out of canyons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountains to the west , and it hauled cows back to the plains and connected at junctions for reshipping on broad-gage railroads to the markets of Texas and Kansas . One of the main delights of that summer was to play along the right of way where the miniature engines and cars went trolling by . In that green canyon country , where bare rock looked so silvery in the sunshine , it was music to hear the whistles of the D. and R. G. engines come beating ahead against the Rocky Mountains , and to hold your breath and listen again for the echo that would follow sometimes when the wind was right , and to hear mixed with the whistle the sound of the river slipping fast , fast , through the green and clear-cut channel with the hushing sound of silk . I remember the station , painted ochre-yellow with a dark-red shingled roof . It stood in a miniature park of grass and flower beds filled with cannas that drank the sunshine and turned scarlet among the coal-black shadows of the station house . My cousin Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our age named Ted Barksdale . He regarded me as a native of another country when he heard I came from New Mexico . He thought I should speak nothing but Spanish and ride a burro and eat chili peppers . When I protested that I was an American just like him , and that New Mexico was only a hundred miles away , he would laugh and say that he would understand me if I 'd say it in Spanish . Ted was the cleanest-looking human being I ever saw . It was a quality of his skin , which was smooth and the color of the softest brown buckskin . His eyes were pale blue and below them were rolls of flesh in a perpetual expression of merriment . His hair was buckskin-colored too but on the yellow side . He seemed all of a piece in his coloring . And he was this too in his character . I think he was near to what an Indian of the great prairie days must have been like . I was there only two weeks that summer , with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awful lot during such a short time . Ted got his father to let us all three ride up to Creede on a freight train one time , and we faithfully stayed in the caboose because that was the condition of our agreement . Every time the train crossed the river we could feel the trestle trembling with not only the weight of the cars but the black hurry of the river itself . We all felt bigger than usual in the tiny caboose of the narrow-gage . We sat and listened to Tode Chedester , the brakeman , who was the most evil-mouthed man I ever heard . He told us stories and rhymes and vicious chronicles , all with a hesitant zest which was deceptively modest . It was just the manner to make us think we were hearing about " life . " He went on until Mr. Richards , the freight conductor , came into the caboose . The conductor wasa family man who carried round in his pocket a volume of the sermons of Henry Ward Beecher , in which he marked passages that struck his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " By fire , by anvil-strokes , by the hammer that breaks the flinty rock , God played miner , and blasted you out of the rock , and then He played stamper , and crushed you , and then grace of God 's severity to you . " In this sentence the conductor found himself . My aunt often made us packages of food and sent us off for a day 's tramp , following the river . One day we climbed so far that we caught sight of the tremendous falls of Wolf Creek Pass long before the wagon road could have shown them to us . My cousin Jack was planning to be a lawyer and to live in Denver , which was grander in his dreams than London or Paris or New York . He used to ask me if there was any capitol dome in any of those cities covered with genuine gold ? It is hard to understand now how much the sound of the name Denver could bring alive in the West of my boyhood , but I remember how Jack Winterhood sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly boy even then , in a sense that I never thought of being or that Ted Barksdale never even heard of . One day I asked Jack about the island at the confluence of the two rivers that ran together like liquid obsidian . " There 's nothing on it . " " Have you ever been on it ? " " Lots of times . " " Has Ted ? " " Sure . He took me the first time . " " Is it hard to get there ? " " It 's hard or easy , depending . " " How do you mean ? " Jack explained . You could go to the west end of the island and swim across the backwater there , which was no trick at all . You had to cross the South Fork of the river to do it , and the most conven-ient way was to walk over the railroad trestle on the open ties , with the water running beneath . That was the easy way , if the longer . " What is the other way ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile and a half west along the main river past our house , and when you get opposite this end of the island , why , to try and swim it there . Do you remember how it looks there ? " " Yes , " I said , recalling the willow-laced banks and the fall of the meadow to a pebbly shelf of shallows where the trout played in and out of rays of sunlight on the polished stones . " I remember how it looks there , " I told Jack . " Have you ever swum it ? Has Ted Barksdale ? " " You ca n't get to the island unless you swim . " " Yes , but did you ever swim the rapids at the east end ? " " We always went by the west end , " said Jack . " Where the pool is ? " " Yes . By the pool . " " Has anybody ever gone the east way ? " Jack gazed at me with his lawyer look , keen and yet absent-seeming , the yellow pips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " Judge " even as a boy . " Well , not exactly . There was a fellow here named Hound-dog Cooley who tried it . " " Did he make it ? " " Nope . " " Why ? Did he turn back ? " " Nape . " " Well , what did he . . . " " We fished him out of the Rio Grande eleven miles farther down the next morning . He was cut up pretty bad . Lot of rocks in that water . ' " Oh . " " It can be done though , I believe . Hound-dog was drunk and he took it on a dare . " " Oh . " " I 've always meant to try it . I 'll tell Ted you want to try swimming the east way to the island . " " I did n't exactly say that . " " You sounded pretty interested . " The simplest thing is often the hardest for a boy to say . My cousin Jack Winterhood had it in his mind , at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was dying to swim the Rio Grande at the confluence there , and the next time we were together with Ted he said : " The Mexican wants to go to the Island by the east way . " " You do n't say , " exclaimed Ted . " Has he ever so much as glanced at it ? " " I have , of course I have , " I said , " but I never said I actually wanted to swim it . I just wanted to see what was on the island . " " Why do n't we ? " asked Ted with a rise of his brow . " Well , we 've meant to often enough , have n't we ? " said Jack . " All right . Since my cousin from Mexico really wants to , " he added , " I feel it only meet and fitting that we do our best to entertain him . I believe we ought to go to-morrow and swim the east way , and spend the afternoon on the island . There 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note under a stone and then of course on returning we can always pick up our own note , and tear it up and nobody 'll ever have to bother with it . " " A note ? " I asked , but I knew he meant that in case we never came back somebody would find the note and discover what we had tried and at what we had failed . I could n't tell whether they were nervous about it , and I searched their faces . So far as I could see , they were unconcerned . Later that same day Jack was hunched down over a book in the front room of the Wintcrhood house , and I said to my aunt that I thought I would go for a walk by myself . She looked at me and asked if anything was troubling me , and in her eyes I saw my father 's look  --  she was his sister  --  and I had a lump in my throat ; but I assured her that everything was fine , and that I was having the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted Barksdale this way . I went out and drifted to the river . I watched the willow shadows creep across the glassy flow as the sun fell , and when it was chilling to dusk I came to the point on this bank opposite the east way to the island . How black the rapids were ! What white ruffles they made ! How stony the roar of the waters when I held my breath and turned my head to listen ! A mocking bird was somewhere about , and his powerful pipe was doubled and made into song by the echo off the river . I was surrounded by the rocky dark of mountain and canyon . We shall never make it , I thought . I must persuade them that it can not be done . Remember Hound-dog Cooley , will say , and what happened to him ; how would you like to be found eleven miles downstream gashed by the rocks ? Yet all the next morning I could not speak . We were going to meet before noon , take a lunch from my aunt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ted was in high spirits and Jack was solemn , as befitted one who would enter wholly but not lightly into a pact with death . I thought that they were deliberately not looking at me , and I believe that I must have shown my misery . It was a bright summer day . The air in those mountains was like a mirror for the sun , so clear , so golden . We walked the same way I had gone the evening before . About noon we were there , and Jack said we would eat our lunch first , then lie down for forty-five minutes to take a nap and digest our food , and then we would try it . I asked what we would do with our clothes . He said we would leave them in the willows with a couple of stones on them , where we could find them when we returned . As he lay down he took out an envelope from his pocket and handed it to Ted and nodded to him to read the page within it . Ted glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could imagine what it said . The sunshine cleaved the broken river with swords . We lay down to our naps . Once during that awful restfulness Ted drowsily asked Jack if he thought their things would still be on the Island from the last time they 'd gone there  --  over the west pool of course . Jack replied that he imagined so . A few minutes later with sudden energy Jack raised his head and said to me : " You can swim , ca n't you , Pete ? " I said I could . He sighed with elaborate relaxation , and went back to his nap . I was so tired from anxiety and from choking on my own words that I fell asleep . The next thing I knew Jack and Ted shook me , and danced off down the narrow shelf of sand and pebbles to the water 's edge , calling to me to hurry and come on . It was time to start . They had put their clothes under the flat stones back of the willows a little bit up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the envelope , the " note , " on which Jack had written " To Friends of Judge Winterhood , Ted Barksdale , and Peter Rush , July 27 , 1892 . " I was suddenly overwhelmed with gratitude and pity for being included with their names on this mortuary document . But they were calling me , standing in the sunshine and shivering by the river 's edge . The water was icy cold . We waded upstream gingerly until we should be opposite the deepest and yet most powerful channel . Jack 's purpose was to launch into the current and fight diagonally across it , until by perfect timing we should be deposited on the very last tip of the island , and of safety . There was still time ; but I could say nothing . The river flashed in our ears and in our eyes . Jack began to run with the clumsy gait of one in tugging water . It was like gathering himself for the final plunge . The A TRY FOR sun was hot on our backs . The island had a thick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that lay what we were seeking . I did n't know what it was . I caught my breath when Jack plunged , and then Ted , into the black glassy run of the current . They swam powerfully and with valor , and were taken away it seemed to me so fast that I thought they were lost from the very first . In obedience to something they left in the air , in my mind , behind them , I came to the same place and I plunged in , and I too was lost ; for the bearing motion of the river swept everything else out of me . I beat with my arms and I kicked and I hugely drank in air when / could , and I felt the mindless flow of the water , of the earth , of Nature ; and it seemed to me the very essence of death . " No ! " something cried to me . But there were two ways to make that answer . I turned and buried my head in the current and , given might by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my way back to the shallows I had left behind me . I turned round sickened with what I must see , and at what I saw my heart sank , but not the way I had expected it to . On the edge of the island , dancing in front of the rustling green , were Jack and Ted , yelping like Indians and motioning me to come ; why did I not come , what was I doing there , and look where they were ! Come on ! " Come on ! " they shouted and swept the water from their bodies with their palms . It took them a few minutes to realize that I was afraid . When they knew that , they produced themselves as triumphant proofs that the east way could be swum . Come on ! We ca n't wait here all day ! . . I nodded and shook my head . I had tried it , they knew that , why did they keep making me have to try it again ? They were laughing and playing in the highest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They boxed together and danced apart and turned to me and exhorted . I could hear hardly a word . But I knew everything they were saying and meaning . Jack shook hands with himself at me in the air above his head . Ted put his hands together , pantomiming the act of swimming , and gravely indicated that that was how it was done . I was shaken with the most crippling of agues . It was one within me . I wrung my hands and said no with my whole body . Two were strong and successful , and one was afraid . They finally looked at each other , shrugged , and shook hands , as if in witness . Then , dripping with sunlight , they broke against the willow screen on the island , fought the green fantasy of the boughs for a moment , and were gone into the interior . They had done all they could . I was alone with the river . Then I knew that I must join them . To belong is the strongest of all our forces at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before or that morning . It was worse , alone . I did n't know whether my hunger was going to be greater than the river 's . I tried to swim with long , powerful strokes and to be intelligent about not holding my breath , but to drink deeply of the air when I could and expel it as deliberately . The first time I looked up toward my goal it seemed like a vision drowned , all wavery and slowly moving . But I knew in a moment that a wind was bearing against the willow screen on the island , and I saw sharply that I was going downstream past it . No , I said , and squeezed my eyes shut , and rolled from side to side in the current , as if to bore my way through it like an auger . It could not take forever , I knew , until the results would be clear . But when I saw myself more than halfway across , and the island still tapering a little way below me , the conviction turned round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it . Come on ! they had cried , over and over . I dug a tunnel with my buried head and I beat the slipping , slipping water , and my breast felt like breaking open , Iike the bottom of a wooden ship whose ribs are beating upon rock , while the waves drove after Life within . My breast was stabbed with pain , and I coughed for air and shook and looked up , and I was myself like the ship on the rocks , lying on a jagged stone , and I could stand up and wade the rest of it , to the wild grass along the island edge . In my breast there was a deep cut from the rock and the blood was washing down . I touched it with my fingers and , in some ceremony forgotten and remembered from what primal impulse , I put my bloody fingers to my tongue and tasted the cost and the proof of triumph . Dear river , I have beaten you , and I love you , I said in my blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt was thanksgiving not that I was alive but that I had dared to die . The island was boat-shaped . I tried to walk as well as I could down the center . The sand was white and deep and hot under foot . I startled a bird or two . I turned my head to listen . Everything was washed out of silence by the slide of the river on each side of the island . So I did not hear them and they did not hear me when I came upon them at what would be amidship of the island . Jack and Ted were sitting on the sand , playing blackjack with a withered old deck of cards . They had lighted cigars in their mouths , and the smoke was pale-blue in the sunlight . They had the air of being perfectly at home , sure of seclusion , like members of a club . Half-buried in the sand to keep it standing upright was a pint bottle partly full of whiskey . For poker chips they had piles of those tin disks which are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nails used to tack tar-paper over pine boarding . They had a perfectly settled look , as if their present comforts and refreshments were the most natural thing in the world in that small wilderness . I was shy for a second about intruding : they seemed to have forgotten my existence , and I then thought  --  why should n't they have forgotten my existence ? And this was enough to make me sail forward out of the thicket with a yell and sit down before them . They jumped up and yelled back . They began to fall all over themselves telling me about " their " island , and how often they came , and what they had , see : the wooden box which they kept buried when they were not here , but which they could always find ; it contained their things , their cigars , matches , the playing cards , the whiskey ( come , I had to have a pull at the bottle ) , the tin poker chips , a rather sandy hank of licorice , some reading matter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a cigar and lighted it , and we all sat down again . They taught me to play blackjack , generously handing me a lavish pile of tin chips . I won for a little while , which seemed to delight them all over again . There seemed to be nothing of theirs of which I had not rightfully now earned my due . When we were tired of playing poker Ted said to Jack that , since I belonged on the island now , " How about the telescope ? Why do n't we show that to him ? " Out of the box they got the old leather case and unstrapped the cuplike top , and drew out an old brass telescope tipped with rusty black leather . My eyes swam and my mouth watered atjthe sight of such a treasure . It was evidently the choicest thing they owned too , and they handled it lovingly , passing it back and forth . " Sometimes we spend whole Saturdays here on the island , " said Jack , " looking through this glass at everything around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I went to the edge of the island and they followed . I put the glass between the branches and looked out over the fields across the river . What a world bloomed before my eye in the silver light of the lens , a curious and beautiful halo of blue and yellow around all objects . They let me sweep up and down the valley with the glass , smiling at my exclamations . But at last Ted took it away from me and said that it was fun , and all that , but what was really interesting was to set the glass on a spot  --  any given spot  --  and lie down on your belly and watch . Just watch . Any spot . He 'd bet ten dollars if you watched long enough that something very interesting would come to pass right there , no matter where you plopped your eye . He said that was the way they used the glass . It was a serious scientific instrument and should be respected as such . We settled down with the glass . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack trained the lens on a miniature bay in the opposite bank of the river  --  the side we came from . Leaves hung over it , and shallow water idly backed up into it . Shadows on the grassy bank made it look cool and damp and remote . You could barely notice the little bay with your naked eye . In the glass it was like another country made visible . Nothing moved in my vision . " Just leave it there and keep looking . Chances are you 'll catch something , " said Ted . Jack yawned . But he had good manners and he knew that the telescope experiment would n't be as much fun if he went to sleep and could not be reached with reports if something interesting did come into the lens . So he sat hugging his knees and chewing his cigar , and seemed to be thinking , as Ted Barksdale never seemed to do . After a while . Jack said : " Do you remember the way Tode talked that day we all rode up to Crecde in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jack , " I have decided that if I ever hear him talking like that again I will stop his mouth . " This was a striking promise . I turned away from the glass and stared at my cousin . He was frowning splendidly , his eyes with their yellow flecks flashed with sober spirit . Ted looked happy , like a fawn-colored puppy , lean and big-pawed . " Why , Judge ? I thought you were enjoying all the dirty stories as much as we were , " said Ted . " Yes , " said Jack , sternly , " I suppose I would laugh as loud as anybody if he started sometime again ; but I think now that I would have to tell him to shut up . " " Why ? " asked Ted lazily , rolling over on the sand . Jack hesitated , looking round with his light-kindled eyes . " Well , " he said at last , " it was n't only that Mr. Richards came in and began spouting sermons to us . Though of course that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our power to choose our characters . I just do n't think Tode is a very admirable individual . I do n't think he would do as my Mexican cousin just did , just to prove to himself that he could do it . " Ted looked at me with the impersonal smiling eyes of a forest animal , a deer perhaps . " And besides , " said Jack , " I like the kind of talk that Mr. Richards can do better than Tode's. / am going to study law , and when I stand up and open my mouth you will be stunned at the magnificent things that will roll out . " He got to his feet . " Did you ever read the WebsterHayne debate ? " he asked . Ted Barksdale laughed . " You need n't laugh . We have a set of books at home of the best speeches of all time and I have been reading them . The other afternoon I memorized something . Listen . " He turned and walked off a few steps , and then faced us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , but with great deliberation : " But , sir , the coalition ! The coalition ! Aye , ' the murdered coalition ' I The gentleman asks if I were led or frightened into this debate by the specter of the coalition ? Was it the ghost of the murdered coalition , ' he exclaims , ' which haunted the Member from Massachusetts , and which like the ghost of Banquo , would never down ? " ' Jack 's voice rolled sarcastically forth , and he scowled , revealing his belief that great oratory and anger were indivisible . These words of Daniel Webster were like meat and drink to him then . Ted sat up and stared , as I did . Jack tried his powers and we were enthralled . Denver ! How could Denver one day fail to bow before him , with its pure gold dome , the famous men and women posed by the iron balconies of the ten-storey court of the new Brown Palace Hotel , the cavernous mirrors of the old Windsor Hotel , the superb teams pulling flashing carriages down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this charge of a coalition , in reference to the late administration , is not original with the honorable Member . It did not spring up in the Senate . Whether as a fact , or as an argument , or as an embellishment , it is all borrowed . He adopts it , indeed , from a very low origin and a still lower present condition . " Jack showed , with his hands as well as with his growling voice , how low . " It is one of the thousand calumnies with which ? " Here he forgot . He held his command with lifted arm while his eyes roved back and forth , searching for what came next . He snapped his fingers for it to come to him out of the void . But not wasting too much time on a mere lapse , he shook his head impatiently , and returned to what he believed the character of Webster to have been like , and jumped ahead to his tremendous conclusion , speaking slowly and with a fine-grained irony that held us transfixed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polluted and shameless press . Incapable of further mischief , it lies in the sewer , lifeless and despised . It is not now , sir , " ( he glanced at the imaginary president of the Senate , a lightning dart ) " in the power of the honorable Member to give it dignity or decency by attempting to elevate it , or introduce it into the Senate . He can not change it from what it is , an object of generaldisgust and scor-r-n . On the contrary , the contact , if he choose to touch it , is more likely to drag him down , down , to the place where it lies itself . " Ted and I were spellbound when Jack finished and could only look at him with open mouths . He rubbed his short-cut hair and in his modest voice he tactfully brought us back to the present . He said ; " I just do n't think I have room in myself to entertain both Tode and Daniel Webster in my studies . " Ted was too excited by the performance to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , yelling and slapping his hips , bounding like a dog . It was , in its way , a real tribute to an eloquent communication . Jack and I laughed in delight at him . " I ca n't make hide nor hair out of what you recited , " said Ted , when he settled down again , " but it certainly was pretty the way you did it , Judge . . . What about our books , in the box over there ? " " That is true , " said Jack . " I had forgotten them . " " What books ? " I asked . " Just some dirty books we 've got . . . . You have n't looked in that glass for a long time . You might be missing something . " I turned back and set my eye and called out at what I saw . In the silvery gray field of the telescope , a round picture cut forward out of another world , I saw a big striped snake trying to swallow a fat frog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was struggling to enwrap the other one . The frog was struggling slowly . Slowly the snake was working . The mortal combat went on with slow intensity and the blades of grass in which they moved showed up clear and bright and stiff in the lens . Jack and Ted came and looked , and we all hated the snake . We pulled for the frog , watching the sun-fixed struggle as helpless partisans . " You should have watched ! " shouted Jack . " Maybe we could have thrown stones and scared him off if we 'd seen it start ! " The lens was so faithful and so powerful that we could sec the snake 's eyes like drops of dew , black with a pin of light in them . As he worked and swallowed , his eyes would roll from sight and then as he relaxed they would show again . The frog 's eyes seemed to look nowhere and everywhere . The snake coiled himself elegantly about the frog 's body to reduce it if he could into a palatable shape . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one point in his sliding efforts , the snake 's tail wove in and out of the laplets of water behind them . Now the battle seemed halted . They rested a moment , perfectly still , locked in their parable of life and death . I could not take my eye off them and the others let me keep the glass . " What was that ! " I cried suddenly . " Where ? " " Something came across the glass , a shadow . . . . There it is again ! " Jack looked along the telescope as if to see with his own eye what I was seeing in the brass tubes . But it was Ted who saw it first . " Look up ! " he whispered loudly . " It is a hawk , he 's sailing around to make a dive . You must have seen his shadow when he came down before . " We looked up and there in the white sunlight was the superb bird . He was sailing down in a narrowing ring , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snake strove and the frog strove so silently . " Watch ! " said Ted . Even before the hawk dropped he knew when it would ; many the hawk he had had in his days outdoors . " Use the glass ! " whispered jack to me . I looked . The clash of claw and beak and feather was tremendous in the lens ? the black beating shadow with the golden flecks of feather , the white breast , the green whip of the snake . I saw the sharp , elegant talons make their clutch , and the cloudy wings batter the ground for a second before the heavy rise into the sky . The hawk 's scowl in the powerful head flashed once into vision . The snake curled and relaxed , curled and relaxed , but was taken away , and the frog fell free on the grass and remained panting . Its white throat vibrated like a little drum . I moved away from the glass and told them to look . The hawk climbed and climbed . . . . Jack used the glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying if he can move . . . . There he went . He jumped into the water . I 'll bet he 's glad ! " So were we . Ted was true to himself when he said : " Golly , I wish I 'd had my rifle with me ; I 'd sure potted that hawk on his way up . I could do it easy from this distance . " Jack said , " Well , that is the law of wild creatures . They take what they are . But we may say for ourselves what we shall be . " He went over to the box . " What 're you doing ? " asked Ted . Jack nodded but did not answer . He picked up the gray-looking paper books I 'd seen in the box , and with exaggerated ceremoniousness , he carried them to the edge of the island and threw them into the river . They floated rapidly off downstream . Ted shrugged . " Well , I had read them all , anyway , " he said . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was n't much whiskey in the pint bottle . We passed it round . We all choked on it and swallowed it and felt important and secure in our island league . They showed me how things were stowed away in the box and how the box was fastened and how the box was buried . They told me that I was now privileged to come here and use the box at any time . They said they had built the box , using Mr. Barksdale 's tools at the freight house . It was turning chill with the lessening light . The water already looked dark , like shining mineral . Jack said when we were ready that we would go back by the west pool , where there was hardly any current to speak of . " We have earned the easy way , " he stated , like a judge handing down a decision . We ran through the little trees to the other end of the island . The sky was still white over us , but the ground was blueing with shadow . The pool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow wide wheel . We dived in and crashed across to the other bank and climbed up on a cool green field . That was where the river made a Y , and we had landed where the two arms came together . We still had to cross the leftmost arm of the Y to reach our clothes and be on our home side of the river fork . It was now twilight , and the fields were quiet . A few hundred yards off was the D. and R. G. trestle . We were going to walk across that to the other side . Just before we reached it we heard an engine whistle . It came from behind us , up the canyon . We might not be able to beat it across . We crouched below the cindery embankment and waited till it came . It was a combination freight and passenger train , and it was on us before we knew it , trembling the earth as it went by above us , clouding us with steam , and adding to the fall of night with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve which the tracks made approaching South Fork . We stood up when it had passed and saw the red and green caboose lights drifting evenly through the dusky distance . I thought of Tode and the freight conductor within , and of their two wills . We hopped on the ties across the trestle , came down to the branchy cover of the other bank , following it to our flat stones . Jack said " H 'm , " when he lifted the stone and found the envelope he had left there . With a kindly sort of indulgence of ourselves as we had been a few hours ago , he tore it up , and we dressed . We started back toward the houses across the fields . There were a few lights showing . We suddenly felt hungry and cold and were ready to go our separate ways . When we reached the freight house where there was no trace of the important little train that had just passed through , we paused and said good-by to Ted Barksdale . " Well , Judge , one thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that there would be no further point in speaking of me as a Mexican since I was no longer a foreigner , They shook hands on that point . Jack and I went on home to his house .
