txt  | STEVIN CONFUTES ARISTOTLE 'S VIEWS ON FALLING BODIES " . . . The experiment against Aristotle is this : let us take ( as I have done in company with the learned H. Jan Cornets de Groot , most diligent investigator of Nature 's mysteries ) two leaden balls , one ten times greater in weight than the other , which allow to fall together from the height of thirty feet upon a board or something from which a sound is clearly given out , and it shall appear that the lightest does not take ten times longer to fall than the heaviest , but that they fall so equally upon the board that both noises appear as a single sensation of sound . The same , in fact , also occurs with two bodies of equal size , but in ten-fold ratio of weight .

Having placed the said Prisme Pendent ( i.e. inclined ) raising one of its ends above the Horizontal Plane a yard or two at pleasure , we have let the ball ( as I said ) descend along the Groove , observing , in the manner that I shall tell you presently , the Time which it spent in running it all , repeating the same observation again and again to assure ourselves of the Time , in which we never found any difference , no not so much as the tenth part of one beat of the Pulse .

" Let us make a supposition ( either by reasoning or experiment ) as to the amount of blood the left ventricle holds when dilated ( when it is full ) , whether two , or three , or one-and-ahalf ounces : I have found two in the dead body . Let us in the same way assume that the heart , ( when contracted ) holds that amount less , by which it is smaller under those conditions , and by which the ventricle is then less capacious ; and let us suppose that the above amount of blood is forced out of the ventricle into the aorta : . . . then one may reasonably conjecture that a fourth or fifth or sixth or at least an eighth part is sent into the artery . So we may assume that in man there is put forth from the heart half an ounce or three drachms or two drachms ; which because of the closing of the valves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In one half-hour the heart makes more than a thousand beats ; and in some people and at some times , two , three or four thousand .

First published , 1628 . ) FRANCIS BACON ON THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD Man , who is the servant and interpreter of nature , can act and understand no farther than he has , either in operation , or  | in contemplation , observed of the method and order of nature . Neither the hand without instruments , nor the unassisted understanding , can do much ; they both require helps to fit them for business ; and as instruments of the hand , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments of the mind either suggest to , or guard and preserve the understanding . ... Those who have treated the sciences were either empirics or rationalists . The empirics , like ants , only lay up stores , and use them ; the rationalists , like spiders , spin webs out of themselves ; but the bee takes a middle course , gathering her matter from the flowers of the field and garden , and digesting and preparing it by her native powers . In like manner , that is the true office and work of philosophy , which , not trusting too much to the faculties of the mind , does not lay up the matter , afforded by natural history and mechanical experience , entire or unfashioned , in the memory , but treasures it , after being first elaborated and digested in the understanding ; and , therefore , we have a good ground of hope , from the close and strict union of the experimental and rational faculty , which have not hitherto been united . . . . Again , in the very stock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as principally conduce to the information and the understanding . For the mechanic , being in no way concerned about the discovery of truth , applies his mind , and stretches out his hand , to nothing more than is subservient to his work ; but we may then rationally expect to see the sciences farther advanced , when numerous experiments shall be received and adopted into natural history , which of themselves are useless , and tend only to the discovery of causes and Axioms ; those being what we call experiments of light to distinguish them from experiments of profit . And they have this wonderful property , that they never deceive or frustrate the expectation : for being used , not in order to effect any work , but for disclosing natural causes , in certain particulars ; let them fall which way they will , they equally answer the intention , and solve the question . And not only a larger stock of experiments is to be sought , and procured , of a different kind from what has hitherto  | appeared , but also a quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be introduced , for continuing and advancing experience itself ; for vague experience , that pursues nothing but itself , is , as was before observed , a mere groping about in the dark , and rather amazes mankind , than informs them . But when experience shall be conducted by certain laws , orderly and consequentially , we may have better hopes of the sciences . And when a proper quantity of suitable materials , for such a natural and experimental philosophy , as is required for the work of the understanding , or the business of philosophy , shall be provided and got ready , yet the understanding is no way qualified to act upon these materials . spontaneously , and by memory , no more than a man should expect to make the calculations for an almanack , * by the bare strength of his memory . Yet contemplation has hitherto been more employed in invention than writing , nor is experience yet made learned . But no invention should be allowed , or trusted , except in writing . And when this comes into use , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ science , we may then have better hopes . Again , the number , or , as it were , the army of particulars , being so large , scattered and confused , as to distract and confound the mind , little good can be expected from the skirmishes and sallies of the understanding , unless it be fitted , and brought close to them , by means of proper , well-disposed and actuating tables of invention , containing such things as belong to the subject of every enquiry ; and unless the mind be applied to receive the prepared and digested assistance they afford . And even when a stock of particulars is exactly and orderly placed before us , we must not immediately pass on to the enquiry and discovery of new particulars or works at least if this be done , we must not dwell upon it . We deny not , that after all the experiments of every art shall be collected , digested . and brought to the knowledge and judgment of a single person , many new discoveries may be made , for the use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiments of one art into another , by means of what we call learned Footnote  | experience ; yet less hope is to be conceived hereof and a much greater of a new light of Axioms , drawn regularly , and in a certain manner , from those particulars , so that such Axioms may again point out , and lead to new particulars . For the way lies not through a plain , but through mountains and valleys , first ascending the Axioms , and then descending to works . But the understanding must not be allowed to leap , or fly from particulars , to remote , or the most general kind of Axioms , at once ( such as are called the principles of arts and things ) , and so prove , and draw out middle Axioms , according to the established truth of the former , as has hitherto been done by a natural sally of the understanding , which is naturally inclined this way , and has been long trained and accustomed to it , by the use of those demonstrations which proceed upon syllogism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when , by continued steps , like real stairs , uninterrupted or broken , men shall ascend from particulars to lesser Axioms , and so on to middle ones ; from these again to higher ; and , lastly , to the most general of all . ...

And this was the judgment of antiquity , which attributed divine honours to inventors , but conferred only heroical honours upon those who deserved well in civil affairs , such as the founders of empires , legislators , and deliverers of their country . ... If anyone , in the last place should object that the arts and sciences may be wrested , and turned to evil purposes , or sin , luxury , etc. , this can have little weight , because it may be said of all the best things in the world , such as great capacity , courage , strength , beauty , riches , light itself , etc .

( Discours de la Mi'thode pour bien conduire sa Raison et chercher la rerite Bans les sciences . Rene Descartes . Second Part . 1 ( 337. )  | Man Learns the Nature of the Solar System Astronomical teaching before 1610 The Copernican theory was published in 1543 , but it gained ground very slowly and even at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckoned only in dozens , and the whole mass of the learned world adhered to the views that had been current from antiquity . Yet by the end of that century , the ancient astronomy was entirely discredited ; and it is our task to show how that came about . What were the fundamental views of the old astronomy , based on Aristotle ? The universe was a closed sphere . At the centre was the motionless earth , around which there revolved successive and ever wider spheres carrying the moon , sun , planets and fixed stars respectively . Everything below , i.e. within , the sphere of the moon was terrestrial , made of earth , air , fire and water , and was subject to change and decay . The natural motion of terrestrial bodies , i.e. that which they pursued if not restrained or impelled by violence , was up ( fire ) or down ( earth ) ; up and down meaning away from and toward the centre of the universe . Outside the sphere of the moon was the celestial region . Everything there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eternal , immutable . Nothing above the moon could come to be or pass away . Objects which obviously did so , such as comets and shooting stars , were not considered to be in the celestial region but in the upper air . The natural motions of heavenly bodies were circular , uniform and unchangeable ; and , being natural , required no explanation . The complex motions which the heavenly bodies actually displayed were explained as the resultant of several simultaneous uniform circular motions . The Ptolemaic theory , as held in the sixteenth century , admitted all this , but it also allowed of motions in circles whose  | centres were not at the centre of the universe , and it also required a circular motion which was not strictly uniform ; this latter was Copernicus 's chief objection to it . The Aristotelean view of astronomy was not , of course , a part of religious dogma , but naturally all the great theologians and philosophers had held it , for the same reason that they now hold the Newtonian view , namely , . because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . Since it is difficult to discuss the origin and nature of the universe without bringing in astronomical views , the works of the great mediaeval theologians and philosophers , such as St. Thomas Aquinas , contain a great deal of Aristotelean astronomy , and the respect that was rightly given to their philosophy and theology was apt to be extended to their astronomy ; nor was a welcome given to those who sought to overthrow it . The University Professors , too , were Aristotle-experts , one and all , and naturally disliked the prospect of having to discard their methods and learn astronomy afresh from the experimental scientists . It is not surprising that these influential adversaries gave the new astronomical views a stormy passage . The two great systems of the world are usually referred to as respectively geocentric ( having the earth at the centre of the planetary system ) , and heliocentric ( having the sun at the centre of that system ) , although after the time of Kepler it was clear that the sun was not at the geometrical centre of the planetary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ptolemaic : while the heliocentric includes the Copernican system and all its modern modifications . Evidence for the Heliocentric System Copernicus produced no compelling evidence that his system was the true one . He showed that it was simpler and more orderly than the geocentric , and that it agreed quite as well with the observations . But the agreement was far from perfect , because , in fact , the planetary orbits are not circles but ellipses , and also because Copernicus made use of many old incorrect observations that no theory could possibly have accounted for . During the hundred and fifty years which elapsed between the  | publication of the theory of Copernicus and its universal acceptance there were three great events made people believe in it : ( I ) The astronomical telescope was invented and disclosed some things which confirmed the heliocentric view ( Galileo , 161o ) . ( 2 ) The Copernican theory was modified by adopting elliptical orbits and was then shown to agree with the observed motions within the limits of error of observation . ( Kepler , 1609-19. ) ( 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the heavenly bodies obeyed the same laws of motion as do bodies on earth , the whole Copernican system , as modified by Kepler , could be deduced from those laws ; and this left no reasonable grounds for doubt that the heliocentric system , with planets revolving in elliptical orbits , was the true one . The astronomical Work of Galileo We have already shown how Galileo disproved Aristotle 's laws of motion , and a great deal of the older astronomy was based on those laws . In the years between 1600 and 1610 Galileo gave some attention to the phenomena of comets and new stars , novae , of which two very conspicuous examples had occurred in 1572 and 1604 . He showed that these were further away from us than the moon , that is to say that they were outside its sphere ' and in the celestial ' region . Therefore they were celestial bodies and the appearance and subsequent fading out of these stars were changes in celestial bodies , and so Aristotle 's notion of their immutability and freedom from generation or destruction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still inaccurate , and Galileo 's adversaries found plenty of evidence in support of the view that these bodies were really below the moon , and were mere atmospheric phenomena . In 16o9 Galileo heard that a Dutchman had made a telescope , and he at once figured out how it might be done , and set to work to make one . He had to make it himself and to grind his own lenses , so naturally the earlier ones were not very good .  | But he had great mechanical skill , and within a few months was able to direct the first telescope to the sky , and reap a harvest of discovery . A great part of the rest of his life was spent in applying these discoveries and other evidence to the attempt to support or prove the Copernican view . We may tabulate these great discoveries . ( I ) Galileo interpreted his telescopic view of the moon as showing it to be a rugged rocky body like the earth , not a smooth lucid globe of a pure fifth element . This seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same stuff as the earth . Not only did this seem to disprove the existence of Aristotle 's celestial element , but it led to the argument that if the moon , which was a planet , was of the same stuff as the earth , it was reasonable to suppose that the earth was a planet , as Copernicus had said and his opponents had denied . ( 2 ) Venus showed phases like the moon ; so presumably it was also a solid opaque body like the moon , and did not shine by its own light . ( 3 ) The telescope showed spots on the sun , * and these came into being , shifted and disappeared : so the sun , noblest of all celestial beings , was not immutable . ( 4 ) The telescope showed Jupiter to be surrounded by four little satellites which rotated about him in very short periods . Here was an ocular demonstration of what Copernicus had asserted of the earth and moon , and it showed , moreover , that the smaller bodies revolved about the bigger , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geocentric. ( 5 ) The telescope showed a host of stars far exceeding in number those visible to the eye . It was evident that all these stars had been unknown to the ancients , whose view of the universe was thereby demonstrated to be incomplete . Footnote  | Galileo , when he wrote his great book the Dialogues Concerning the Two Principal Systems of the World ( 1632 ) , advanced all this evidence and more , and utterly demolished the ancient astronomy . But he was not content to break down the old views , and his great desire was to establish the Copernican system in their place . But in trying to find proofs of the heliocentric system he over-reached himself . He attached special importance to a pet theory that the tides were caused by the earth 's rotation in a manner which was not only fallacious , but did not even agree with the well-known fact that there are two high tides a day and that these may occur at any hour of the day , and he also produced another fallacious proof from the apparent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his other good arguments , but in spite of them he converted most of the scientific world to the heliocentric view . A word must be said of Galileo 's unhappy conflict with the Church . He had made himself many enemies among the university professors ( who were almost all ecclesiastics ) , and he was several times denounced to the eccesiastical authorities . For some time they supported Galileo , but in 1616 a judicial opinion was given that the heliocentric system was heretical . It seems that this decision was not only unwise , but had no satisfactory grounds in theology . Galileo was ordered to keep silent on the subject of heliocentric astronomy and agreed to do so ; but some years later , counting on the expected favour of the new Pope , Urban VIII , he published his Dialogues in 1632 , and was summoned before the Inquisition , forced to recant , and confined to his house for the rest of his life . These events did no credit to the ecclesiastics who were responsible , nor do Galileo 's shifty methods of trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obedience to it in letter make us think the better of him . This is the only case of real conflict between the Catholic Church and Science , for the few other men of science who were punished by the Inquisition or were excommunicated , were so treated on account of heretical theology , or a suspicion of witchcraft , sometimes well founded .  | Kepler 's Laws Johann Kepler ( 1571 ? 1630 ) is an interesting figure . He was deeply impressed with the order and harmony of the universe and he felt quite sure that , if he could but discover them , there were simple mathematical formulae or relationships which would express the connection between such apparently unrelated quantities as the distances of the planets and the times of their revolutions . He would not be content with anything but the most precise agreement between his formulae and the observed facts ; and it was this extreme persistence in looking for perfection that brought him his success . His main work was the study of the motion of Mars . He began as Tycho Brahe 's assistant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Figure proved to be of use to him . He himself made accurate observations over many years , and being a Copernican , he expressed them in terms of revolutions of Mars about the sun , not about the earth , and it was this that made his success possible . His problem was to find some path that accounted for the fact that Mars moved sometimes more swiftly , sometimes more slowly . Circular motion would not do , whether concentric or eccentric :  | Figure he then tried various kinds of oval ' paths , which brought him within 4 ' of the correct positions . Even then he was unsatisfied , though the agreement was so close that Copernicus could not even have measured so small a discrepancy . So he finally was led to the idea of an elliptical path , and in 1609 he formulated the following two laws which appeared to hold exactly : ( 1 ) The planets describe ellipses about the sun , the sun being in one focus .  | ( 2 ) The planets move so that the line joining the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ellipse in equal times . Ten years later he arrived at the generalisation which satisfied him best , as being of such mathematical simplicity , namely : ( 3 ) The squares of the periodic times* of the planets are proportional to the cubes of the major axes of their orbits . Here were the accurate laws which ( within his powers of observation ) the planets seemed to obey . Why did they behave thus ? What kept them in their ellipses , speeding up as they neared the sun and slowing down as they receded from it ? Kepler could give no satisfactory answer and this was left for Newton . Descartes and his Vortices Descartes thought that the planets might be impelled by a fine and subtle kind of matter which rotated like a vortex or whirlpool around the sun as centre . This theory was satisfying to those who wanted to be able to imagine all motion as being due to something pushing against something else . It agreed roughly with the facts , for as bodies circulate in a shorter period as they approach the centre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolve more rapidly than those at a distance . This system he greatly elaborated , and , although Newton showed that it did not account for the planetary motions , it remained the prevailing one on the Continent until 1730-40 . The work of Isaac Newton There is no doubt as to what Newton did , but it is not very clear what mental processes led him to it . In the year 1666 , when he was only 24 , he arrived at his fundamental notion that every particle of matter attracts every other particle , and he thought that the attraction probably varied directly as the product of the masses and inversely as the square of the distance between them . He could not verify this by an experiment because the force of gravitation between two bodies small Footnote  | Figure enough to be handled is so minute . It struck him that the force that makes bodies fall ( i.e. that attracts objects to the earth ) being apparently undiminished at the tops of high mountains , might extend indefinitely as far indeed as the moon . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that on earth a stone fell 16 feet in the first second . Then if he supposed ( what he could not yet prove ) that the stone was attracted by the earth as if the latter 's attractive power were concentrated at its centre , he could say that the moon ought to be falling in every second a distance given by Now the moon actually is falling . If the earth 's attraction were suddenly removed the moon would travel on in a straight  | line MT ( Fig. 37 ) , so in the time the moon takes to travel from M to M1 it has been forced to approach the earth by a distance TM1 , i.e. to fall that distance . Knowing the circumference of the moon 's orbit and the period of rotation ( 1 month ) , it is easy to calculate the speed of fall . Newton did so and it came to about 15% less than his former calculation indicated . This , though it answered pretty nearly ' , was not good enough for him and he laid the calculations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Simply that Newton adopted for the radius of the earth the current value , which had been in use since the time of Ptolemy and was a good deal too small . Some twelve years later , better measurements were made , and Newton thus discovered that his former calculation had been based on incorrect observations . He waited three years before recalculating the results , probably because he was unable to prove , as yet , that a body at the surface of e.g. the earth was attracted by it with the same force as would be exerted by its whole mass concentrated at the centre . His calculations then came out correct ? thus giving very strong evidence for his theory . He followed it up and showed that if the force that kept the planet in their orbits was gravitational attraction varying inversely as the square of the distance between attracting bodies , those orbits must be ellipses . But Newton had no interest in publishing his discoveries , for he hated the controversies to which publication generally led ; so he let this gigantic achievement lie by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only when the astronomer Halley asked him what would be the path of a planet moving under the attraction of a force which varied according to an inversesquare law , did he reply " An ellipse " ; and only at Halley 's persuasion did he undertake to publish his theory . Once he was moved to work , Newton 's power was astonishing . His great book Philosophise Naturalis Principia Mathematica ( 1687 ) is perhaps the most powerful and original piece of scientific reasoning ever published . Newton created the science of dynamics , defining force , momentum , etc. , for the first time . He invented most of the mathematics needed for the work ; the inverse-square law , the principle of gravitation and the  | idea of applying it to the heavens were his . Starting with these simple principles , he builds up , by a process as rigid as that of propositions in geometry , the proof of the whole motions of the solar system as they were then known . He disproved Descartes ' theory of vortices , and explained the precession of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Researches on Colours In January 1666 Newton made one of his greatest discoveries , the theory of colours , which , since it led him to the invention of the reflecting telescope , may be mentioned here . He passed a beam of light through a prism and found it lengthened out into a multicoloured strip . He did not announce this till six years later ( 1672 ) when he communicated it to the Royal Society . In this paper he concluded then that white light was compound , consisting of rays which were refracted to different extents , and that each colour was not a " qualification " of light , but was a property of rays of a particular refrangibility ' . Here was a very startling expression of a quality in terms of a quantity . Lenses were well known to give images with colour fringes and this was already the chief obstacle to clear vision with telescopes and microscopes . To Newton it seemed that this fault was inseparable from a refracting instrument , and so he set to work to make a telescope using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of time on compounding alloys suitable for the metal mirrors . The reflecting telescope came into its own in the second half of the eighteenth century , but after achromatic refracting telescopes were perfected the reflector suffered a period of eclipse , but has now regained its position for telescopes of the highest powers . Newton 's theories of the nature of light were very influential . The wave-theory of light had been put forward by Huyghens , but Newton could not accept it because he did not believe that a wave-motion could cast sharp shadows , and supposed that it would bend round the corner of an obstacle . None the less the colours of thin films ( e.g. Newton 's rings ) required some periodic property to explain them . So he adopted the theory that light consisted of particles which could arouse a vibration .  | He tells us that " . . . it is to be supposed that the acther is a vibrating medium like air , only the vibrations far more swift and minute . . . . I suppose light is neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different kind propagated from lucid bodies . " Newton 's successors Newton gave the world the main outlines of the plan of the solar system and the principles by which it was to be understood ; for the next 150 years the astronomical and mathematical world did little else but develop what he had started . The chief astronomical problem was to calculate the extent to which the elliptical motion of the planets as set out by Kepler 's laws is modified by the small attractions of the planets on each other . This requires very difficult and tedious mathematical analysis . The various small irregularities of the planets were explained one by one . The final triumph came in 1846 , when Adams and Leverrier independently deduced the existence and place of a planet more distant than Uranus from the unexplained irregularities of the motion of the latter . The discovery of this planet , Neptune , virtually concluded the story of the mapping of the solar system , though many small bodies , satellites , asteroids , and recently the distant planet Pluto , have since been added . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten months ago a rumour came to our ears , that an optical instrument had been made by a certain Dutchman , by aid of which visible objects , though very distant from the eye of the observer , were seen distinctly as if near to him . . . . The same was confirmed to me a few days later by a letter written from Paris by the noble Frenchman Jacob Badovere of Paris , and so I set myself to inquire into the principles and means by which I might be able to arrive at the discovery of a similar instrument , in which a little later I succeeded by a study of the theory of Refraction . And so I prepared a leaden tube , at the  | ends of which I fixed two glass lenses both plane on one face , one of them being spherically convex , the other concave on the other face . Then applying my eye to the concave end , I saw objects as quite large and near , for they appeared three times nearer and nine times larger* than before . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no expense , I succeeded in making an instrument so excellent that things seen through it appeared nearly a thousand times larger and more than thirty times nearer , than if viewed by natural vision alone . ( From Sidereus Nuncius , or The Starry Messenger , Galileo Galilei. 161o . ) THE MOUNTAINS ON THE MOON .. . from my observations . . . I have been led to understand clearly that the surface of the Moon is not polished , even , and very exactly spherical , as a large school of Philosophers consider her and the other heavenly bodies to be , but on the contrary is uneven , rough , full of hollows and protuberances , not otherwise than is the face of the earth itself which is everywhere marked out by peaks of mountains and the hollows of valleys . The appearances from which one may deduce this are as follows : On the fourth or fifth day after new moon , when the Moon displays itself to us with bright horns , the boundary which separates the part still dark from that which is bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curve , as would happen with a perfectly spherical solid , but is marked out by an uneven , rough and decidedly wavy line , as the attached figure shows . For several bright excrescences , as it were , extend beyond the boundary of light and darkness into the dark part and on the other hand dark portions enter into the light part . Indeed , a great number of small darkish spots , altogether separate from the dark part are scattered about almost the whole part which is then flooded with the Sun 's light . . . . And I have noticed that these small spots always and in every case agree in having the dark part on the same Footnote  | side as the Sun 's position and on the side opposite to the Sun they have brighter boundaries , as if they were crowned with shining peaks . But we have a quite similar appearance on Earth about sunrise , when we see the valleys not yet flooded with light but the mountains surrounding them on the side opposite to the sun already blazing with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places of the earth diminish as the sun grows higher , so also these spots on the Moon , lose their darkness as the bright portion grows larger ... . ( From the work cited above . ) ( This phenomenon is readily observable with a field-glass or small telescope , which will give a good idea of what Galileo saw . The definition of his telescope must have been poor , and probably an x8 field-glass shows us as much as he could have seen . ) GALILEO CONFUTES THE ARGUMENTS USED AGAINST THE COPERNICAN SYSTEM ( From the time of Ptolemy , text-books of astronomy repreduced stereotyped arguments which were designed to prove that the earth is stationary . Here is an example of such a proof ' taken from the Epitome Astronomiae of Michael Ma ? stlin , published in 1582 . M2estlin must be remembered with gratitude for having persuaded the youthful Kepler , who had leanings to literary studies , to take up astronomy . ) Proof that the Earth is not Moved with a Circular Motion If the Earth were carried about from East to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings would not occur nor would there be the alternation of days and nights but there would be always noon in one place , in another always dawn , etc. * For if it were moved with any other circular motion whatever , the clouds would be seen to fly always and only in the opposite direction . Heavy bodies projected vertically upward would never fall back on to the same spot . The same heavy bodies Footnote  | also when falling back would not drop perpendicularly on to the places beneath them , for these would be carried from under them by the swiftness of the Earth 's motion ; also animals and buildings , shaken by this violence of motion , would fall down . Furthermore all the parts of the earth ( at any rate if the earth be supposed to undergo a daily rotation ) would be scattered abroad by its irresistible swiftness , and the whole earth would have by now been consumed and fallen outwards into the sky ( which is absurd ) . Lastly since Nature has granted to a simple body only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Earth ( as is to be seen in its parts* ) therefore it is impossible to justify a circular motion for it . Therefore the Earth remains immovable , set in its place , which is the centre of the universe . ( Here is a part of the argument by which Galileo refutes the assertion that a stone would not fall vertically from the top of a tower if the earth were rotating . ) Salviati . . . " The error of Aristotle , Ptolemy , Tycho , yourself , and all the rest , is grounded upon that fixed and strong persuasion , that the Earth standeth still , which you have not judgement nor power to depose , no , not when you have a desire to argue of that which would ensue , pre-supposing the Earth to move . And thus , in the other argument , not considering that whil'st the Stone is upon the Tower , it doth , as to moving or not , the same that the Terrestrial Globe doth , because you have concluded with your self , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall of the stone , as it were to depart from ' rest : whereas it behoveth to say , that if the earth standeth still , the stone departeth from rest , and descendeth perpendicularly ; but if the Earth do move , the stone likewise moveth with the like velocity , nor doth it depart from rest , but from a motion equal to that of the Earth , whereunto it intermixeth the supervenient motion of descent , and of those two composeth a third which is transversal or sideways . " Simplicio . " But for God 's Sake , if it move transversely , how is it that I behold it to move directly and perpendicularly ? ... " Footnote  | Salviati , " In respect to the Earth , to the Tower , and to our selves , which all as one piece move with the diurnal motion together with the stone , the diurnal motion is as if it had never been . . . " Sagredo . " Now I do remember a certain conceipt that came one day into my fancy , whilst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neb of a writing-pen that I carried along with me in the ship , through all my navigation from Venice to Scanderon , * had had a facultie of leaving visible marks of its whole voyage , what signs , what marks , what lines would it have left ? " Simplicio . " It would have left a line distended from Venice thither , not perfectly streight or to say better , distended in a perfect arch of a circle , but in some places more , in some less curved , according as the vessel had gone more or less fluctuating ; but this ... without any considerable error , might have been called the part of a perfect arch . " Sagredo . " If a Painter then at our launching from the Port had begun to design upon a Paper with that pen , and had continued his work till he came to Scanderon , he would have been able to have taken by its motion a perfect draught of all those figures perfectly interwoven and shadowed in on several sides with countreys , buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true , real , and essential motion traced out by the neb of that pen , would have been no other than a very long but simple line ; and as to the proper operation of the Painter , he would have delineated the same to a hair , if the ship had stood still . That therefore of the huge long motion of the pen there cloth remain no other marks , than those tracks drawn upon the paper , the reason thereof is because the grand motion from Venice to Scanderon , was common to the paper , the pen , and all that was in the ship ; but the petty motions forwards and backwards , to the right , to the left , communicated by the fingers of the Painter into the pen , and not to the paper , as being peculiar thereunto , might leave marks of itself upon the paper , which did not move with that motion . Thus it is likewise , that the Earth moving , the motion of the stone in descending downwards was really a long tract of many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could have been able to have delineated in a calm air or other superficies , the track of its course , it would have left behind a huge long transverse line . But that part of all this motion which is common to the stone , the Tower , and ourselves is imperceptible to us , and as if it had never been , and that part onely remaineth observable , of which neither the Tower nor we are partakers , which is in fine , that wherewith the stone falling measureth the Tower . " ( Dialogues concerning the two principal systems of the World , by Galileo Galilei . In Mathematical Collections and Translations . T. Salusbury. 1661 . ) WHAT NEWTON DID AT THE AGE OF TWENTY-THREE In the beginning of the year 1665 I found the method for approximating series and the rule for reducing any dignity power of any binomial to such a series i.e. the binomial theorem .

All this was in the two years of 1665 and 1666 , for in those years I was in the prime of my age for invention , and minded mathematics and Philosophy more than at any time since . ( MS of Newton cited in D.N.B. XIV . 371 . ) NEWTON 'S ACCOUNT OF KEPLER 'S THIRD LAW Phenomenon IV That the fixed Stars being at rest , the periodic times of the five primary Planets , and ( whether of the Sun about the Earth , or ) of  | the Earth about the Sun , are in the sesquiduplicate* proportion of their mean distances from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kepler , is now receiv 'd by all astronomers . For the periodic times are the same , and the dimensions of the orbits are the same , whether the Sun revolves about the Earth , or the Earth about the Sun . And as to the measures of the periodic times , all astronomers are agreed about them . But for the dimensions of the orbits , Kepler and Bullialdus , above all others , have determin 'd them from observations with the greatest accuracy : and the mean distances corresponding to the periodic times , differ but insensibly from those which they have assign 'd , and for the most part fall in between them ; as we may see from the following Table . The periodic times , with respect to the fixed Stars , of the Planets and Earth revolving about the Sun , in days and decimal parts of a day . Table NEWTON 'S PROOF THAT THE GRAVITY IS THE FORCE THAT KEEPS THE MOON IN HER ORBIT BOOK III . PROPOSITION IV . THEOREM IV . That the moon gravitates towards the earth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rectilinear motion , and retained in its orbit . ( See Fig. 37 ) Footnote  | Figure The mean distance of the moon from the earth in the syzygies* in semi-diameters of the earth , is , according to Ptolemy and most astronomers 59 , according to Vendelin and Huygens 6o ; to Copernicus 6o 1/3 ; to Street 6o 2/5 ; and to Tycho 56i ... t Let us assume the mean distance of 6o semi-diameters of the earth in the syzygies ; and suppose one revolution of the moon , in respect of the fixed stars , to be completed in 27d. 7h. 43 ' , as astronomers have determined ; and the circumference of the earth to amount to 123249600 Paris feet , as the French have found by mensuration . And now if we imagine the moon , deprived of all motion , to be let go , so as to descend towards the earth with the impulse of all that force by which ( by cor. prop . 3. ) it is retained in its orb , it will , in the space of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris feet . This we gather by a calculus , founded either upon prop . 36 , book I. or ( which comes to the same thing ) upon cor. 9 , prop . 4 of the same book . For the versed sine of that arc , + which the moon , Footnote  | in the space of one minute of time , would by its mean motion describe at the distance of 6o semi-diameters of the earth , is nearly 15 1/12 Paris feet , or more accurately 15 feet 1 inch , and i line 4/9 . Wherefore , since that force , in approaching the earth , increases in the reciprocal duplicate proportion of the distance , and , upon that account , at the surface of the earth , is 6o. 6o times greater than at the moon , a body in our regions , falling with that force , ought , in the space of one minute of time , to describe 6o x 6o x 15 1/12 Paris feet ; and in the space of one second of time to describe 15 1/12 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch and 1 line 4/9 . And with this very force we actually find that bodies here upon earth do really descend ; t for a pendulum oscillating seconds in the latitude of Paris will be 3 Paris feet and 8 lines in length , as Mr. Huygens has observed . And the space which a heavy body describes by falling in one second of time is to half the length of this pendulum in the duplicate ratios of the circumference of a circle to its diameter ? and is therefore 15 Paris feet 1 inch 1 line 7/9 . And therefore the force by which the moon is retained in its orbit becomes , at the very surface of the earth , equal to the force of gravity which we observe in heavy bodies there . And therefore ( by rule 1 and 2 ) 11 the force by which the moon is retained in its orbit is that very same force which we commcnly call gravity , for were gravity another force different from that , then bodies descending to the earth with the joint impulse of Footnote  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the space of one second of time would describe 30 1 /6 Paris feet ; altogether against experience . ( From Principia Mathematica . Sir Isaac Newton . 1687 . Trans . Motte. 1803 ed . ) This whole proof requires no more than elementary geometry and mechanics and the student is recommended to work it out in detail .  | The Mechanical Philosophy Science , Abstraction and the Real World All science in the intellect ; and things , if there are any things , become intelligible by being first perceived , and then abstracted from our crude sense-perception . What we regard as the real world is not science , but it is that from which , by the aid of our minds and senses , we extract the accurate , reliable , and well-tested assertions which are the raw material of Science . Science itself consists of these assertions , linked into intelligible schemes which show how they are connected , and how new and reliable assertions flow from and are linked to them . In a sense natural science might link up every observation in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as we can see will be for ever , it will remain divided into a number of not very closely linked departments . As we have seen , the new science of the sixteenth century ( Ch . VI ) was little more than description , and there was , except in astronomy , very little explanation . Accordingly the new scientific men of the early seventeenth century ( Ch . VII ) had to find a scheme by which their observations could become science . We suppose that there is only one real world from which we draw our science ; but it does not follow that our science is the only science ; for if that real world exists apart from the human observer , it doubtless has many aspects which we could but do not study , and probably many more of which we are totally unaware . But , regarding science as a way of studying nature , as we know it , the two chief questions we may ask about a thing are : ( I ) What is it for ? ( 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it change ' Thus the flower of a lily may be regarded : ( z ) As an arrangement for producing fertile seeds and perpetuating the race .  | ( 2 ) As a cone-shaped structure built of cells of such-and-such internal constitution and mode of operation . Both of these are valid and valuable accounts of the flower ; but when we come to study the phenomena of physics or chemistry , the conduction of heat or the rusting of iron ? we do not to day find ourselves asking the purpose of these phenomena , but only how and when they occur . The science of Aristotle and of the scholastics had been primarily a science of purpose . It was transparently clear to the latter that the world and all that 's in it was created for the service of man , and that man had been created for the service of God . That was a perfectly intelligible scheme of the world . The sun was there to give us light and to tell the time and mark out the calendar by his motions . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maleficent influences to the things on earth to which they were sympathetically linked : plants and animals were there to give us food and pleasure , and we were there to please God by doing hi will . Modern science does not produce any evidence that all this is not perfectly true , but it does not regard it as a scientific explanation ; it is not what science wants to know about the world . The usual way of explaining the behaviour of things in the Middle Ages was to suppose they had been gifted with a " natural appetite " to do what they were known to do . Thus , " He who gave gravity to stones inclined them to fall naturally downwards . " Yeast caused dough to rise because it had a natural fermentative virtue : poppies caused sleep through their inherent quality of coldness . The disadvantage of this kind of explanation was that it took you no further . The fermentative virtue , or the coldness , or the appetite to fall , were " occult qualities " and there was no way of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no more than saying that the various objects in the world behaved according to a hidden nature implanted in them by God at the creation . This the succeeding generations would not deny , but they believed that the world when studied more closely would prove to be more orderly and reasoned , and less arbitrarily ordained than it had seemed to be .  | The Mathematical World A new way of looking at Nature was needed , but complete novelties are extremely rare events in the history of man . The revival of science , as we have seen , came from the new study of Greek texts , and of these the most admirable were the works of the Greek mathematicians . So it was very natural that when the reading of the works of Archimedes stimulated Galileo to re-found physics , he should follow the methods of his master and make his physics a branch of mathematics . Indeed , what we call a physicist was , at this period , termed a mathematician . Galileo was " First Mathematician to the Duke of Tuscany " . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of physics ( chiefly dynamics , statics and hydrostatics ) as mathematical propositions ; and so successful was this , that it seemed to the scientists of the time that all nature could be understood mathematically . All Galileo 's physical discoveries , except that of the telescope , are concerned with measurements or numbers , and he is the first to present the scientific view of the world in the form of mathematical formula . This is a very fruitful practice , because all mathematical expressions are exactly and fully intelligible to all who take the trouble to learn mathematics , while the same can not be said of any other mode of describing things . Descartes enthusiastically followed Galileo , and all the scientific men of the century who worked in any field capable of mathematical treatment resorted to mathematical methods ( cf. Harvey , p . Io2 ) . Now mathematical formule can not deal with anything other than numerically measurable or geometrically specifiable data , such as size , shape , position , velocity , weight ; and they can have no concern with the other things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as beauty , purpose , dignity and the like ? all of which were very real and important qualities to the medieval man of science and are still so to men and women in their daily lives . Thus the expression of science in terms that could be mathematically investigated meant the omission from science of all those elements of the real world that could not be quantitatively expressed .  | Atomic Theories It was obvious to all the seventeenth-century scientists that a number of common phenomena did not follow in any obvious way from the size , shape or movement of a body . Such were its degree of heat , * its colour , its lustre , its density , hardness , combustibility , solubility , fusibility , and so on . Of these properties of bodies there were two standard explanations : ( I ) Aristotle 's theory that all bodies were composed of a continuous prime matter , modified into a composition of the four elements ' ? ( earth , air , fire and water ) and specified by various forms ' so as to produce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) The theory of Democritus , that matter was discontinuous , being composed of many different kinds of atoms , whose various shapes and sizes and motions could account for all the properties of all kinds of matter . Aristotle 's theory prevailed in the Middle Ages , partly because it was a part of his system ( adopted for other reasons ) , partly because the atomists of antiquity ? Democritus , Epicurus , Lucretius ? had been anti-religious , believing as they did that the chance meetings and associations of atoms determined all the happenings of the world , including those of the human mind . Moreover no one had ever seen these atoms and any phenomenon could be explained by inventing a new sort of atom to account for it , which made the theory a little unconvincing . But in the atomic system the seventeenth century saw a way of explaining the whole world mathematically . If atoms were of known shapes , sizes and weights , and all phenomena were the result of atoms pressing or striking against other atoms , then every physical effect followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideally could be calculated from the laws of mechanics . The atomic theory of the seventeenth century differed from the present one in many ways , including the following : Footnote  | ( I ) The atoms were regarded as hard , imperishable particles like so many minute shot or sand-grains. ( 2 ) They had a precise shape , round , square , pointed , hooked , spiral , or the like . ( 3 ) They were not believed to exert any field of force . ( 4 ) They were not generally or necessarily thought to be in any rapid motion . ( 5 ) Many , but not all , scientists considered atoms were permanently in contact ; and that the world was completely full of them . Galileo and Bacon both believed in atoms and the latter reasoned out that heat was a motion of atoms . Descartes in his Principia Nature tried to explain all the phenomena of the world in terms of the motions of the various kinds of atoms , and although his success was not marked , the book was very in-Figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gassendi carried the matter further , and in this country Robert Boyle , who studied a great variety of chemical and physical phenomena , tried to explain them all in terms of atoms . The Mechanical Philosophy Boyle 's view of the world ( c. 166o ) is very typical . He is convinced that it is the direct creation of God , but for him , unlike the medieval philosophers , this is not enough ; for , as he says , a man would be a dull fellow if , when he wanted an explanation of a watch , he was to be satisfied with being told it was an instrument made by a watch-maker ? true though it is . An intelligent man , Boyle thinks , would want to know how the spring and balance and wheel and hands co-operate to form a time-telling instrument . So he gives us his opinion that " the world being once constituted by the great Author of things as it now is , I look upon the phenomena of nature to be caused by the local motion of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , is the " mechanical philosophy " , as it came to be called . Everything is to be explained by the motion of the particles of bodies . Newton followed Boyle in this view , but makes a further advance . He had shown ( Ch . VII ) how the assumption of universal gravitation , acting according to the inverse-square law , explained the motions of the planets in the skies ; and so he took a further step towards our present view by assuming that atoms act as centres of force , so that an atom would not have actually to press against or touch another atom to put it in motion . The motions of atoms acted on by mutual forces could in theory be calculated , and so for Newton , every natural phenomenon , which could be the subject of science , whether on the earth or in the heavens , was ultimately to be explained by mathematical laws , deduced from reliable observation of nature and verifiable by further observation ; ideally nothing else than accurate observation and mathematical reasoning was to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth about the observable material world , though it would not be complete truth about the real world .  | Thus according to Newton there was hope that every phenomenon , if knowledge were far enough advanced , " could be explained by the action of forces representing either attraction or repulsion depending only upon distance and acting between unchangeable particles . " * Actually this view , when applied in the limited field to which it belongs , was near enough to the truth to serve for a couple of centuries , but to-day it has had to be a good deal modified ( Chs . XVII , XIX ) . Science and the Mind of Man Hardly anyone in the seventeenth century was rash enough to try to explain the human mind or soul in terms of the movements of atoms . Generally a very sharp distinction was drawn between the material body and the immaterial soul . Descartes regarded the body as a machine , the soul being by the special act of God in communication with and in control of it through a special organ , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a loss to explain how the immaterial human mind was related to the material body . In the Middle Ages , and later , the body was not regarded as a machine . The soul was the form of man , the body stood to it in the relation of matter , so there was no part of the body that was not informed by soul . But when Descartes and his followers put forward the theory that the body was a machine completely governed by the laws that governed phenomena outside it , he had to restrict the soul to a minute portion of it and to suppose that the soul received its information about the world through the brain and senses ; and consequently it followed that this information might be greatly coloured or distorted by the perceiving and transmitting mechanism . This fitted in very happily with the views of Galileo and others that were being expressed about this time . In science , as conceived by them , there was only room for the mathematically expressible properties of size , shape , and motion . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shape , but no less clearly do we perceive its colour , lustre , Footnote  | Figure beauty . Galileo distinguished the qualities of the feather that did not depend on the human senses from those that did . Redness , greenness , lustre , beauty , can not be thought of existing apart from an eye and a brain , but size , shape and motion could . So the latter he regarded as the real or primary qualities to be studied by science and the former as little more than illusions or at most properties of one little corner of the world ? the human brain . This view has remained substantially the view of science till the present day . The objects of the scientists ' real world ' have size , shape , motion , but there is no colour , scent , beauty in that world : there is no purpose , no emotion , no love . That is why it is so utterly dangerous to treat the world which the scientist  | has abstracted for study from what he perceives , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fallacy of the materialist . Because science is so intelligible , works so perfectly , and gives us such power , we are tempted to treat its world as the real world , despite our knowledge that the things which are important in human life are not quantitative or extended and so can never enter into science . Examples Illustrating the Seventeenth-Century View of the World GALILEO REGARDS THE UNIVERSE AS MATHEMATICAL Philosophy* is written in that very great book , which continually lies open before our eyes ( I mean the Universe ) ; but we can not understand it , if we do not first learn the language , and comprehend the characters in which it is written . It is written in the mathematical language , and its characters are triangles , circles and other geometrical figures , without the aid of which it is impossible to understand a word of it , without which one wanders vainly through a dark labyrinth . ( II Saggiatore , Galileo Galilei , p. 171 of Florentine Edition . 1842 . ) GALILEO DISTINGUISHES THE HEAT WHICH WE FEEL FROM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider the thing that we call heat , concerning which I doubt very greatly if the generally accepted concept be not very far from the truth , inasmuch as it is believed to be a true accident , affection , and quality which really resides in the matter which we perceive to be heated . However , I say that I feel myself necessarily compelled , as soon as I conceive of a piece of matter or a corporeal substance , to conceive of it as determined and shaped as of such and such a figure , as being great or small in relation to other bodies , as being in this or that place , at this or that time , as being in motion or at rest , as touching or not touching another body , Footnote  | as being one or many ; nor can it by any imagination be separated from these conditions : but that it must be white or red , bitter or sweet , sounding or mute , of pleasant or unpleasant smell , I do not find myself mentally forced to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senses were not its escorts , perhaps neither reason nor imagination by itself would have arrived at them . Thence I am led to think , that these tastes , odours , colours , etc. , from the point of view of the objects in which they appear to reside , are no more than pure names , and have their only residence in the sensitive body , so that if the animal* were removed all such qualities would be removed and annihilated . . . . ( Therefore ) I say I am much inclined to believe that heat is of this nature , and that the thing which in us produces and makes us feel heat and to which we give the general name of Fire , is a multitude of very small corpuscles figured in such and such a manner , moved with such and such velocity which encounter our body and penetrate it by reason of their exceeding fineness ; and that the contact made by their passage through our substance and felt by us , is the affection that we call heat . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , penetration and contact , there is in fire another quality , that is heat , I do not believe . . . and I judge that it is so far due to ourselves that if the animated and sensitive body were taken away , heat ' would remain as no more than a mere word . ( Il Saggiatore . Galileo Galilei . Florentine Edition . 1842 . PP. 333-336 . ) ( This view of heat is not the modern one . Galileo considers it to be a subtle material substance ; we hold it to be the energy of motion of the particles of ordinary matter . None the less , the distinction between this motion and our sensation remains a true one . ) BOYLE ACCOUNTS FOR THE QUALITIES OF THINGS BY AN ATOMIC HYPOTHESIS We teach then ( but without peremptorily asserting it ) : Footnote  | 1 . That the matter of all natural bodies is the same ; namely , a substance extended and impenetrable. 2 . That , all bodies thus agreeing in the same common matter , their distinction is to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That motion , not belonging to the essence of matter ( which retains its whole nature when it is at rest ) and not being originally producible by other accidents , as they are from it , may be looked upon as the first and chief mood or affection of matter . 4 . That motion , variously determined , doth naturally divide the matter it belongs to into actual fragments or parts ; and this division , obvious experience ( and more eminently chymical operations ) manifest to have been made into parts exceedingly minute , and very often too minute to be singly perceivable by our senses . 5 . Whence it must necessarily follow , that each of these minute parts or minima naturalia ( as well as every particular body made up by the coalition of any number of them ) must have its determinate bigness or size , and its own shape . And these three , namely , bulk , figure , and either motion or rest ( there being no mean between these two ) are the three primary and most catholick moods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each of them apart . t 6 . That when divers of them are considered together , there will necessarily follow here below both a certain position of posture in reference to the horizon ( as erected , inclining or level ) of each of them , and a certain order or placing before or behind or beside one another . . . and when many of these small parts are brought to convene into one body from their primary affections , and their disposition and contrivance as to posture and order , there results that which by one comprehensive name we call the texture of that body . . . . And these are the affections that belong to a body , as it is considered in Footnote  | itself ; without relation to sensitive beings or to other animal bodies . 7 . That yet there being men in the world whose organs of sense are contrived in such differing ways , that one sensory* is fitted to receive impressions from some , and another from other sorts of external objects or bodies without them ( whether these act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or by propagating some motion to the sensory ) the perception of these impressions are by men called by several names , as heat , colour , sound , odour ; and are commonly imagined to proceed from certain distinct and peculiar qualities in the external objects , which have some resemblance to the ideas their action upon the senses excites in the mind ; though indeed all these sensible qualities , and the rest that are to be met with in the bodies without us , are but the effects of consequents of the above-mentioned primary affections of matter , whose operations are diversified according to the nature of the sensories or other bodies they work upon . 8 . That when a portion of matter , either by the accession or recess of corpuscles , or by the transposition of those it consisted of before , or by any two , or all of these ways , happens to obtain a concurrence of all those qualities which men commonly agree to be necessary and sufficient to denominate the body which hath them , either a metal or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any particular and determinate species of bodies , then a body of that denomination is said to be generated .

It is to be remembered that there was as yet no theoretical chemistry nor were any particular substances characterised as chemical elements , in the modern sense . ) Footnote  | NEWTON ON ATOMS AND OCCULT QUALITIES All these things being consider 'd , it seems probable to me , that God in the Beginning , form 'd Matter in solid , massy , hard , impenetrable , moveable Particles , of such Sizes and Figures , and with such other Properties , and in such Proportion to Space , as most conduced to the End for which he form 'd them ; and that these primitive particles being Solids , are incomparably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so very hard as never to wear or break in pieces . No ordinary power being able to divide what God himself made one in the first Creation . While the Particles continue entire , they may compose Bodies of one and the same Nature and Texture in all Ages : But should they wear away , or break in pieces , the Nature of Things depending on them would be changed . Water and Earth composed of old worn Particles and Fragments of Particles , would not be of the same Nature and Texture now , with Water and Earth composed of entire Particles in the Beginning . And therefore that Nature may be lasting , the Changes of Corporeal Things are to be placed only in the various Separations and new Associations and Motions of these permanent Particles : compound bodies being apt to break , not in the midst of solid Particles , but there those Particles are laid together , and only touch in a few Points . It seems to me farther , that these Particles have not only a Vis inertire ( inertia ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result from that Force , but also that they are moved by certain active Principles , such as is that of Gravity , and that which causes Fermentation , and the Cohesion of Bodies . These Principles I consider not as occult Qualities , supposed to result from the specifick Forms of Things , but as general Laws of Nature by which the Things themselves are formed ; their Truth appearing to us by Phaenomena , though their Causes be not yet discovered . For these are manifest qualities and their Causes only are occult . And the Aristotelians gave the Name of occult Qualities Not to manifest Qualities , but to such Qualities only as they supposed to lie hid in Bodies , and to be the unknown causes of manifest Effects : Such as  | would be the Causes of Gravity , and of magnetick and electrick Attractions , and of Fermentations , if we should suppose that the forces or Actions arose from Qualities unknown to us and uncapable of being discovered and made manifest . Such occult qualities put a stop to the Improvement of natural Philosophy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To tell us that every species of Thing is endow 'd with an occult specifick Quality , by which it acts and produces manifest Effects , is to tell us nothing : But to derive two or three general Principles of Motion from Phenomena , and afterwards to tell us how the Properties and Actions of all corporeal Things follow from these Principles would be a very great step in Philosophy , though the Causes of those Principles were not yet discovered : And therefore I scruple not to propose the Principles of Motion above-mentioned , they being of very general Extent , and leave their Causes to be found out . Now by the help of these Principles , all material Things seem to have been composed of the hard and solid Particles abovementioned , variously associated in the first Creation by the Councel of an intelligent Agent . For it became him who created them to set them in order . And if he did so , it 's unphilosophical to seek for any other origin of the World , or to pretend that it might arise out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being once form 'd , it may continue by those Laws for many Ages . ( Opticks : or , A Treatise of the Reflections , Ref , actions , Inflections and Colours of Light . 1704 . Sir Isaac Newton . pp. 375-8 . ) NEWTON SUSPECTS THAT ATOMS EXERT FORCES We offer this work as mathematical principles of philosophy ... by the propositions mathematically demonstrated in the first book we then derive from the celestial phenomena the forces of gravity with which bodies tend to the sun and the several planets . Then , from these forces , by other propositions which are also mathematical we deduce the motions of the planets , the comets , the moon and the sea . I wish we could derive the rest of the phenomena of nature by the same kind  | of reasoning from mechanical principles ; for I am induced by many reasons to suspect that they all depend upon certain forces by which the particles of bodies by some causes hitherto unknown , are either mutually impelled towards each other and cohere in regular figures , or are repelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , philosophers have hitherto attempted the search of nature in vain . But I hope the principles here laid down will afford some light either to that or some true method of philosophy . ( Principia Mathematica . Sir Isaac Newton . Tr . La Motte , Part I. )  | The First Principles of the Sciences The development of laboratory technique Even before the year 1700 everyone recognised the scientific method as the only appropriate way of investigating the external world . But the scientific method gives no more than an outline of the way to plan and conduct a scientific research , and is of no help towards the devising of the practical laboratory methods by which discoveries are made . The scientists of the eighteenth century had therefore to occupy themselves in discovering practical laboratory techniques , and for this reason the period often seems a little disappointing in its results , as compared with the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries . The most notable advance in scientific technique was the discovery of numerous ways of recording the behaviour of things in terms of numbers . Measurement was , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bushel and gallon went back to at least the thirteenth century , but the official standards of length , capacity and weight , were intended rather for commerce than for science , and it was not until 1 747 that the Royal Society was called in by the government to construct standards . This became the more necessary when measuring instruments of many kinds were invented . In the period 1650 ? 1700 instrument-makers capable of fine and accurate craftsmanship were to be found in every great town . Thus accurate measurement of length was made possible by the vernier scale ( 1631 ) and micrometer ( 1638 ) . These discoveries also permitted precise measurements of angles . The accurate measurement of time was an enormous advance . An exact standard of time was always available , namely the rotation of the earth , but the only means of discovering the time before the middle of the seventeenth century was an astronomical observation . Well-designed apparatus could do this very closely , but portable apparatus , e.g. astrolabes , quadrants and sundials , had an error of at least  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ + 20 minutes a day , but when Huygens applied the pendulum , and Hooke the balance-spring , to clocks , their errors were reduced to those we find in the ordinary domestic clocks of to-day . But the effect of changes in temperature upon the length of pendulums and the stiffness of springs prevented really accurate time-keeping until Harrison discovered methods of compensation and gave us chronometers that kept time to a minute or so a month ( 1757 ) . Weights had always been pretty accurately measurable in jewellers ' balances , but these were also greatly improved . The pendulum clock revealed the fundamental distinction of mass and weight . When Jean Richer took his astronomical apparatus , including a pendulum clock , from Paris to Cayenne in 1671 he found the clock lost 21 minutes a day . The clock was corrected , but when brought back to Paris it gained 21 minutes a day . The gravitational force that attracted the pendulum-bob was different at Cayenne , but its inertia was the same . The effect was explained by Huyghens , whose work On the Vibrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , time and mass are the fundamental units , but instruments for measuring other quantities were soon available . Thus alcohol-thermometers , standardised in accordance with arbitrary standard thermometers , were available from the middle of the seventeenth century , though the use of natural fixed standards , such as the temperature of melting ice or boiling water , dates only from soon after 1700 . The mercurybarometer was in use from about 1645 , and pressure-gauges soon followed . Photometry , the measurement of quantity of light , was also a seventeenth-century invention , and simple electrometers were also in use . Thus the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries provided the means of obtaining and recording numerical results . Scientific Explanations in the Eighteenth Century As we have seen , the theory that matter is made up of atoms endowed with attractive and repulsive forces was suggested by Newton in his Principia ; but , as he recognised , science was then  | very far from being able to explain the phenomena it studied in terms of these atoms and the forces acting on them . Heat , light , electrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action : all these seemed to be disconnected separate principles , and although the theory that matter consisted simply of atoms in motion and exerting forces could be believed , it was not yet a practically useful guide to laboratory experiments . But all the above are fundamental principles ; and it is difficult ( though not impossible ) for example , to study heat without some working hypothesis as to what makes the difference between a hot body and a cold one . Even today we have not elucidated the whole of these problems , but we can classify and connect all the above phenomena as being manifestations of energy , the capacity for doing work . The eighteenth century , on the other hand , regarded heat , electricity , magnetism , and chemical energy as imponderables ? material fluids , in some ways like a gas or liquid , but invisible , without weight , and capable of flowing into and permeating solids or liquids : thus Lavoisier places heat and light in his tentative list of chemical elements . The fact that these fluids do not really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the men of science of that age realised that the evidence for the presence of " caloric " in hot bodies or " electric fluid " in electrified ones was , to say the least of it , scanty , and they were consequently more concerned to observe and record how things behaved than to explain their behaviour . So from simple laboratory experiments the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries learnt a great deal of correct fact , of which the nineteenth century gave correct explanations . Progress in the individual Sciences ( a ) Mechanics . The fundamental principles had been set out by Newton , and although there was little engineering to stimulate it until nearly the end of the eighteenth century , statics , hydrostatics , and dynamics advanced very rapidly in the hands of the numerous brilliant mathematicians of the age . The other physical sciences lagged far behind because their fundamental  | principles were not understood and the results of experiments often seemed disconnected and irrational . ( b ) The study of heat . Thus in the study of heat very little could be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished . Heat ' remained a confused notion , not properly separated from what we now call flame , combustion , chemical energy , until after the turn of the century . But this did not stop the experimentalists from measuring the effects of temperature changes . Coefficients of expansion were carefully measured ; these were of practical importance for compensating chronometer-springs , pendulums , surveying-chains , etc. , for errors resulting from temperature changes . Joseph Black did work of fundamental importance when he distinguished quantity of heat and temperature , and gave us the notions of specific and latent heat . Lavoisier and Laplace followed him and founded calorimetry . Radiant heat was studied : the existence of it was a difficulty for the caloric theory ( p. 158 ) , and by 1800 it seemed that heat-rays might be a kind of invisible light . It was clearly proved that heat had no weight and was produced by friction , compression of gases , etc. : and when Rumford in 1798 was able to produce an apparently unlimited amount of heat from friction ( pp. 159-60 ) it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less was not yet ' extinct in 1850 . The application of this to the practical use of heat in the steam-engine will be considered in Chapter XI . ( c ) The study of light . The facts of the transmission of light were also carefully studied , and the geometry of the transmission of light , its refraction , reflection , dispersion , etc. , were worked out . The great practical advance was in the design of optical instruments . Single lenses necessarily give colourfringed images , which render impossible the use of high powers in microscopes and telescopes . The reflecting telescope dispensed with lenses in favour of mirrors , and this instrument , invented by Newton , was brought to a high degree of perfection in the eighteenth century . In 1758 Dollond discovered a way of avoiding these colour-fringes , by making achromatic lenses compounded of two kinds of glass . These soon came into  | general use in telescopes , but not in microscopes until c. 1825 . These lenses gave much sharper images ; this enabled microscopists to use higher powers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century to great discoveries in biology , notably the cell-theory ; while the improved telescopes led to the study of nebulr , the discovery of the asteroids and of the two great outer planets . All this was the result of experimental work , and was independent of the question as to whether light consisted of waves or particles . ( d ) The study of electricity . Electricity excited great interest . At the beginning of the eighteenth century frictional electric machines were invented . These gave extremely minute currents at very high voltages , but even so they allowed of the discovery of some of the main phenomena , such as electrical attraction and repulsion , the distinction between conductors and nonconductors , the use of condensers such as the Leyden jar , and the discovery of the electric shock . Benjamin Franklin made the great discovery that lightning was no more than a huge electric spark , and so invented the lightning-conductor . Coulomb , from 1784 on , began the quantitative study of electricity , measuring the repulsion between charges and proving that this followed the inverse-square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Volta invented the electric battery , for only then could electrolysis and electromagnetism be studied . ( e ) The study of chemistry . Chemistry was in the same plight . Active experimentalists , such as Scheele and Priestley , discovered new and important compounds by the dozen , and the ideas of the great classes of acids , bases , salts , earths , etc. , became well defined and their combining proportions began to be studied . A beginning was made in chemical analysis . Nevertheless , there was no clear notion of the relation of one compound to another . The idea of chemical elements and compounds had been initiated by Boyle in the seventeenth century , but until the time of Lavoisier nobody had tried to make a list of supposed elements . The Aristotelian four elements and the alchemical three principles ( salt , sulphur and mercury ) were discredited , but there was nothing to put in their place .  | Little progress in chemical theory w as made , because the allimportant element , oxygen , was unknown , and a hypothetical matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the phenomena of oxidation and reduction . Thus the rusting of iron or burning of charcoal really involve a combination with oxygen ; but they were explained as the loss of this hypothetical phlogiston . Worst of all , the most universal and important of elements ? oxygen ? remained unknown until 1774 . After Lavoisier had realised the importance of this element , chemistry could be explained in terms of the combination and separation of known material elements , and it is here that modern chemistry begins . These matters will be taken up again in Chapter X. ( f ) The study of biology . We see much the same in the study of living things . Their classification and the mapping of their anatomy went ahead rapidly , but their physiology , i.e. how they worked , remained nearly stationary . The fundamental processes of animals and plants are chemical reactions taking place in their individual cells , and until there was a little elementary chemical theory and microscopes good enough to demonstrate more than the most obvious of cell-structures , not much could be done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sciences there was a similar difficulty , which we may put down to the lack of the notion of energy . Kinetic energy , vis viva , was known to the men of the eighteenth century , but they had no idea that heat , light , magnetism , electricity , and the power that lay hid in coal or gunpowder , were all manifestations of this same energy , which was as real as matter . What is the difference between a hot body and a cold one , between an electrified piece of sealing-wax and an unexcited ' one , between a magnet and an ordinary piece of steel2 We say that it is some movement or disposition on the parts of the bodies ? molecules , atoms , electrons ? which give the hot , the magnetised , the electrified , more energy than the cold , unmagnetised , or non-electrified . The eighteenth-century answer was very different . It was supposed that the active  | forms ? the hot , the electrified , the magnetised ? contained a substance material , but subtle and weightless . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caloric fluid ; electrified wax contained an excess or deficiency of the electric fluid ; a magnet the magnetic fluid ; coal or gunpowder contained phlogiston ; a living organism contained vital spirits , while a dead one did not . All these subtle fluids or spirits were thought of as material , weightless , more subtle ' than a gas , and so capable of penetrating into bodies without any visible apertures . They were thought to form a material link by which two bodies that attracted or repelled each other were drawn together or driven apart . Thus it seemed intelligible that two bodies might repel each other by means of subtle fluids which passed out of them and forced them apart , but no one at the time could see how two bodies with nothing in between them could affect one another . Nor can we : we are completely in the dark as to the process or mechanism by which the magnet makes the iron filings move . But we do not mind taking for granted phenomena for which we can not picture or suggest any mechanism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to invent these fluids in order to give a rational picture of what was happening . The theory worked pretty well for electricity , because it does actually consist of electrons which do move about conductors , very much as a fluid might move . For heat it was inadequate because it could not explain the connection between heat and work , nor were the other imponderables ' of much more use in their respective sciences . They served their turn , however , in providing a means by which men could picture these energy-phenomena , and as a means of prompting further experiments . When truer notions of heat , light , electricity , chemical energy came into being , the facts discovered and explained by the aid of the older ideas still remained true , and the terminology was easily changed . No matter what happens to scientific theory , scientific fact remains ; and in this is the substance of science . A part of the great structure may need to be rebuilt in a new style from time to time , but the hewn stone of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fate of these imponderables ? The notion of  | the caloric fluid died hard , but when it became clear that heat was converted quantitatively into work and vice versa , it became quite untenable , because work was certainly not a material substance at all : yet for all that the caloric theory was not quite extinct in the eighteen-fifties . The matter of light ' was no more heard of after the eighteen-thirties , when the wave theory , which since the time of Huygens had always had its exponents , was generally accepted . The notion of phlogiston and of the vital spirits died out after 1790 when Lavoisier had explained the essentials of respiration and combustion . The electric fluid lasted longest . Electricity remained a great puzzle through most of the nineteenth century , for it seemed to behave like a real fluid and also like energy . The theory that it consisted of electrons ? particles with great mutual repulsive forces ? only came into general use after 1897 . We are to-day still left with the puzzle that there are three independent kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though Einstein may have incorporated them into a single scheme of description , we have as yet no notion as to how any of them operate . Conservation of Mass and Energy A very great step was the enunciation of two great principles , the Conservation of Matter and the Conservation of Energy . The idea that matter is not created or destroyed in any reaction , but only changed , had been long suspected , and indeed acted on in chemical practice . Newton 's views on atoms necessarily imply it ( p. 142 ) . The law can not be proved , for this would involve proving a universal negative . The evidence for it is the absence of any evidence for creation or destruction of matter in any of the countless chemical experiments in which it might have been detected , if it had in fact occurred . Lavoisier rightly assumes it as an axiom " . . . nothing is created in the operations either of art or of nature , and it can be taken as an axiom that in every operation an equal quantity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The law of the Conservation of Energy was a much more sweeping generalisation . The notion of kinetic energy had been developed by Huygens in the seventeenth century , and the law  | chat the quantity of mechanical energy in a system remained unchanged was employed in eighteenth-century mechanics . After the end of the eighteenth century the " convertibility of the powers of nature " began to be appreciated . Chemical energy could be changed into electrical in the voltaic battery ; electricity into heat and vice versa ; magnetism into electricity and vice versa by the interaction of magnets and conductors ; heat into mechanical energy in the steam-engine ; heat into light and vice versa . How then was it possible to regard heat , light , electricity , etc. , as different fluids ? Quantitative studies settled the question . Joule showed a numerical connection between quantity of electricity and quantity of heat produced by it , and between the quantity of work and the quantity of heat produced by it . The final establishment of the principle came from Helmholtz as late as 1847 . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another . He assumed that it was impossible , as experience also showed , to obtain an indefinite amount of work from any closed system of bodies : he also assumed that all the activities of nature could be derived from attractive and repulsive forces acting between material particles . From such assumptions he showed that the sum of the kinetic and potential energies in any such system must always be the same and consequently that energy was never lost , but only transformed from one state of manifestation to another . Science in the eighteenth century The eighteenth century may seem to us a disappointing period . The seventeenth century seems , and indeed was , a brilliant age of science , but it is to be remembered that its triumphs are to be contrasted with earlier ages when the scientific method did not exist . Startling discoveries and grand generalisations were made , but there was not enough talent , time , or opportunity , to make more than a beginning . Thus the first three-quarters of the eighteenth century were taken up with observations and experiments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspectacular work was the basis of the great harvest of discovery which filled its closing years . Throughout the century there was little professional  | science teaching and few whole-time men of science , except in the medical profession ; the work was mostly carried on by enthusiastic amateurs , many of them clergymen . Science began to be popularised in the eighteenth century , and numerous books , encyclopxdias , etc. , were written , not for the learned , but for the general public . The chief matter of public interest was the Newtonian system : as always , people wanted to know what sort of a universe they inhabited . From these accounts some drew the conception of a universe made by a good and orderly Creator , while others were led to regard the All as a vast inanimate machine . The former school was most conspicuous in England and Germany , the latter in France . Examples of Eighteenth-Century Science ELECTRICITY AND LIGHTNING . A LETTER OF BENJAMIN FRANKLIN , ESQ. , TO MR . PETER COLLINSON , F.R.S. , CONCERNING AN ELECTRICAL KITE Philadelphia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the public papers from Europe of the success of the Philadelphia experiment for drawing the electric fire from clouds by means of pointed rods of iron erected on high buildings , etc. , it may be agreeable to the curious to be informed that the same experiment has succeeded in Philadelphia , tho ' made in a different and more easy manner . which any one may try , as follows : Make a small cross of two light strips of cedar ; the arms so long , as to reach to the four corners of a large thin silk handkerchief , when extendeed : tie the corners of the handkerchief to the extremities of the cross ; so you have the body of a kite ; which being properly accommodated with a tail , loop and string , will rise in the air like those made of paper ; but this , being of silk , is fitter to bear the wet and wind of a thunder gust without tearing . To the tip of the upright stick of the cross is to be fixed a very sharp-pointed wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | To the end of the twine next the hand , is to be tied a silk riband ; and where the twine and silk join , a key may be fasten 'd . The kite is to be raised , when a thunder-gust appears to be coming on ( which is very frequent in this country ) and the person , who holds the string , must stand within a door , or window , or under some cover , so that the silk riband may not be wet ; and care must be taken that the twine does not touch the frame of the door or window . As soon as any of the thunder-clouds come over the kite , the pointed wire will draw the electric fire from them ; and the kite , with all the twine , will be electrified ; and the loose filaments of the twine will stand out every way , and be attracted by an approaching finger . When the rain has wet the kite and twine , so that it can conduct the electric fire freely , you will find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your knuckle . At this key the phial* may be charged ; and from electric fire thus obtain 'd spirits may be kindled , and all the other electrical experiments may be performed , which are usually done by the help of a rubbed glass globe or tube , and thereby the sameness of the electric matter with that of lightning completely demonstrated . I was pleased to hear of the success of my experiments in France and that they there begin to erect points upon their buildings . We had before placed them upon our academy and state-house spires . ( Philosophical Transactions . Vol. 47 , p. 565 . ) PRIESTLEY 'S VIEW OF THIS DISCOVERY There is nothing in the history of philosophy more striking than the rapid progress of electricity . Nothing ever appeared more trifling than the first effects which were observed of this agent in nature , as the attraction and repulsion of straws and other light substances . It excited more attention by the flashes of light which it exhibited . We were more seriously alarmed at the electrical shock , and the effects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were astonished to the highest degree by the discovery of the similarity of electricity with lightning , and the aurora borealis , with the connection it seems to have with waterspouts , hurricanes , and earthquakes , and also with the part that is probably assigned to it in the system of vegetation , and other the most important processes in nature . ( Experiments and Observations on different kinds of Air . Joseph Priestley. 1774. p. 274 . ) ACCOUNTS OF SOME OF THE IMPONDERABLES The human mind , never satisfied , after the cause of some effect has been discovered , or only guessed at , attempts to investigate some more intimate quality , and even the origin of the supposed cause , making further suppositions , and framing other hypotheses , which , by the course of things , must certainly be less probable than the former . This unlimited endeavour to acquire knowledge is often too ridiculous to be pursued , on account of its abstruseness and uncertainty , especially when the steps immediately preceding the subject in hand have but a small degree of probability . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal of time , and trouble , in attempting to discover the properties and causes of what existed only in their own imaginations . Sometimes , however , when a supposed existence comes so very near to truth , that the most sceptic Philosopher hesitates not to confess the probability of it , or when he can invent no argument to evince the contrary , then it is not only allowable , but necessary for the business of Philosophy , to pursue the enquiry further , and , if nothing else can be ascertained , at least to propose some further conjectures upon the former hypothesis . This now is the case in the science of Electricity ; and after we have related the most plausible hypothesis as yet offered , i.e. that of a single elastic fluid , we come in this place to consider the essence of this fluid , in order , if possible , that we might attain to , at least , some probable conjecture respecting its materials . When nothing more than electric attraction and repulsion has been observed , Electricians supposed that these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately from the electrified body ; but when the light , the burning quality , the phosphoreal smell , * etc. , was perceived to be produced by excited Electrics , then it was naturally supposed , that the electric fluid was of the same nature with fire . This opinion has prevailed much among several Philosophers , and it is from hence , that the electric fluid has been commonly called Electric Fire . Besides this supposed identity of the electric fluid , and the element of fire , there have been two other opinions concerning the essence of this fluid ; it having been thought by some to be the ether of Sir Isaac Newton , and by others ( whose opinion seems to be the most probable ) to be a fluid sui generis , i.e. different from all other known fluids . In order the more regularly to examine these conjectures , it will be necessary to premise something in regard to the nature of fire , at least so much as is sufficient for the present purpose . The element of fire may be considered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its existence , and to its effects . In regard to its origin it is commonly specified under the names of Celestial , Subterraneous , and Culinary Fire ; understanding by the first , that which proceeds from the sun , and , by being dispersed throughout the universe , gives life and motion to almost everything that exists ; by the second , that which is the cause of volcanos , hot springs , etc. , and lastly , under the name of Culinary Fire , understanding that which is commonly produced upon the earth by burning several substances . These distinctions , however , are little if at all useful ; for , whatever be the origin of fire , its effects are always the same . In respect to the different states of its existence , the Chymists know only two ; the first obvious one , and indeed that , to which only is given the name of Fire , is that actual agitation of the particles of that element , which produces the complex idea of lucid , hot , etc. that is commonly understood under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real principle of fire existing as a constituent principle in several , and perhaps all substances ; or , that matter , whose particles , when agitated in a peculiar and violent manner , produce the common sensible fire . Footnote  | This , which we may call fire in an inactive state , is the Phlogiston of the Chymists , and is that , which when united in a sufficient quantity with other substances , renders them inflammable . This this principle does really exist , is beyond a doubt ; we may transfer it from one body to another ; we may render a body inflammable , which in its own nature is not so , by superinducing on it the phlogiston ; and we may reduce a body naturally inflammable , to a substance not inflammable , by depriving it of its phlogiston . As to the identity of the Electric , and the ethereal fluid it seems to me quite an improbable , or rather a futile and insignificant hypothesis ; for this ether is not a real , existing , but merely an hypothetical fluid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to be an element of several principles . Some suppose it to be the element of fire itself , others make it the cause of attraction , others again derive animal spirits from it , etc. ; but the truth is , that not only the essence , or properties , of this fluid but even the reality of its existence is absolutely unknown . According to Sir Isaac Newton 's supposition , this ether is an exceedingly subtle and elastic fluid , dispersed throughout all the universe , and whose particles repel the particles of other matter . But on this supposition the electric fluid is different from ether ; for , although the former is subtle , and elastic , like the latter , yet ( as Dr. Priestley observes ) it is not repulsive like the ether , but attractive of all other matter . ( Treatise on Electricity . Tiberius Cavallo. 1786 . ) THE CALORIC FLUID What we call heat is a sensation produced by a substance to which modern chemists have given the appellation of caloric . When caloric is applied to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the system is warmed , and the sensation of heat produced . When , on the contrary , a substance of a lower temperature than our system is applied to it , we feel the sensation of cold , because we then lose caloric . Caloric penetrates all bodies ; it separates their particles by  | lodging between them , and diminishes their attraction ; it dilates bodies , it liquefies solids , and rarifies liquids to such a degree , as to render them invisible , give them the form of air , and convert them into elastic , compressible , aeriform fluids . Hence it follows , that liquids are combinations of solids with caloric , and that gases are solutions of different bodies in caloric , which of itself is the most attenuate , subtile , light , and elastic of all natural substances ; accordingly its weight can not be estimated . . . . All these facts prove , that caloric is a particular substance , and not a modification of all substances , as some natural philosophers have imagined ; and it is far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for the farther we advance in the science of physics , the greater differences appear in the action of these two substances . ( The Philosophy of Chemistry . A. F. Fourcroy. 1800 . ) RUMFORD IDENTIFIES HEAT AND MOTION An Inquiry concerning the Source of the Heat which is excited by Friction . By Benjamin Count of Rumford , F.R.S. , M.R.I.A. ... Being engaged , lately , in superintending the boring of cannon in the workshops of the military arsenal at Munich , I was struck with the very considerable degree of heat which a brass gun acquires , in a short time , in being bored ; and with the still more intense heat ( much greater than that of boiling water , as I found by experiment ) , of the metallic chips separated from it by the borer ... . From whence comes the heat actually produced in the mechanical operation above mentioned ? Is it furnished by the metallic chips which are separated by the borer from the solid mass of metal ? If this were the case , then , according to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacity for heat of the parts of the metal , so reduced to chips , ought not only to be changed , but the change undergone by them should be sufficiently great to account for all the heat produced ? for taking equal quantities , by weight , of these chips , and of thin slips of the same  | block of metal separated by the saw , and putting them at the same temperature , ( that of boiling water ) , into equal quantities of cold water ( that is to say at the temperature of 59- ? F. ) the portion of water into which the chips were put was not , to all appearance , heated less or more than the other portion into which the slips of metal were put . . . . From this it is evident that the heat produced could not possibly have been furnished at the expense of the latent heat of the metallic chips . ( Rumford then designed an apparatus in which a blunt borer was forced against the bottom of a hollow metal cylinder and was rotated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a box containing about two gallons of water . ) ... At the end of an hour I found by plunging a thermometer into the water in the box that its temperature had been raised no less than 47 degrees : being now 1 o7 ? of Fahrenheit 's Scale . ... At 2 hours 20 minutes it was at 200 ? ; and at 2 hours 30 minutes it ACTUALLY BOILED ! It would be difficult to describe the surprise expressed in the countenances of the bystanders on seeing so large a quantity of water heated and actually made to boil without any fire . Though there was , in fact , nothing that could justly be considered as surprising in this event , yet I acknowledge fairly that it afforded me a degree of childish pleasure , which , were I ambitious of the reputation of a grave philosopher , I ought most certainly rather to hide than to discover ... . And in reasoning on this subject we must not forget that the most remarkable circumstance , that the source of the heat generated by friction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is hardly necessary to add , that any thing which any insulated body , or system of bodies , can continue to furnish , without limitation , can not possibly be a material substance : and it appeared to me to be extremely difficult , if not quite impossible , to form any distinct idea of any thing , capable of being excited , and communicated , in the manner the heat was excited and communicated in- the experiments , except it be MOTION . ( Philosophical Transactions . Vol. 88. 1798. )  | The Study of Gases The Importance of Gases The beginner in science , to-day , finds himself much concerned with the study of gases , which are indeed fundamental to physics , chemistry and physiology . The physicist can express their compression by mechanical forces and their expansion by heat in terms of very simple laws , which , when mathematically analysed , lead to the great generalisation of the Kinetic Theory . The chemist finds in them the simplest kinds of matter , elements and simple compounds which take part in a great variety of changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not exist . The physiologist could not understand the fundamental processes of life , ? respiration and photosynthesis , ? until the common gases had been characterised and their relations demonstrated . The discovery of the common gases and their nature occupied rather less than two centuries , from the time of Galileo to that of Lavoisier . The Primitive idea of a Gas From the beginning of the study of matter until the seventeenth century the air was regarded as something not quite material in the sense that earth or water was material . Some ancient Greek philosophers made no clear distinction between air and spirit ' . They had a conception which has vanished to-day , that of breath ' . Mist , vapour , breath , the spirits ' ( p. 36 ) influences ( p. 61 ) , and sometimes even the soul , were all thought of as varying degrees of condensation of the same thing , for which we have no word to-day , but which they called pneuma or spiritus . The mediaeval method of dealing with spiritus was not to try and collect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ,  --  capable of penetrating solids ,  --  but to condense it to a liquid form . Thus the active principle , as it were the soul , of wine was evolved by heating it and condensed as spirits of wine , ? alcohol . The Physicists and Gases The first people to study the properties of air were physicists . The Hellenistic scientists , Heron and Philon ( p. 33 ) made a beginning , but it was not until the late sixteenth century , when their works were printed , that these studies began again . J. B. della Porta has experiments on the expansion of gases , much like Heron 's , but the first quantitative studies were those of Galileo ( pp. 94 , 101 ) . From him came the idea of using the expansion of air to measure heat ' , of weighing air and of trying to obtain a vacuum . Torricelli , his disciple , first produced a vacuum : von Guericke ( p. 95 ) made the first air-pump . In all these experiments air is treated as a substance as material @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignored . An equally important step was taken when Boyle made measurements upon gases and discovered that the volume of air was inversely proportional to the pressure upon it , e.g. that if the pressure were doubled , the volume would be halved , one of the earliest quantitative observations in this field . Boyle was inclined to regard gases as made up of atoms which , like springs or locks of wool , were compressible and elastic , though he saw that the effect could also be explained if they were supposed to be elastic particles in motion . The Chemists and Gases We owe the word gas ' to J. B. van Helmont , about 1620 . The extracts given on pp. 168-69 , show that he meant ' by it a sort of subtle spirit readily acted on by the influence of the stars , and the means of causing the phenomena of weather ; and he identifies this with a wild spirit ' produced in chemical reactions ? that which bursts the vessels in which it is produced . He did not think it could be collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gases : thus he distinguished the gas given off when nitric acid acts on metals , from that pro-  | duced by fermentation and that produced by burning sulphur : indeed he describes fifteen gases , ? not all , of course , different chemical individuals . Boyle , in 1660 , was the first to collect a gas ( hydrogen ) by inverting a bottle filled with dilute sulphuric acid in a dish containing the same acid and iron nails , but the idea of collecting gases was not followed up in that century . Experiments with the air-pump gave Boyle evidence that ordinary combustion would not occur without air , but that mixtures of combustibles with nitre , such as gunpowder , could burn in a vacuum . He thus started the idea that nitre and air had something in common . His experiments on heating metals in closed vessels containing air to discover the reason why they gained in weight led him to no certain conclusions ; indeed he supposed that particles of fire ' passed through the glass to the metal and so increased its weight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in air and saltpetre and that this dissolved ' combustible bodies : he showed very clearly that air was necessary for combustion . John Mayow in 1674 published experiments which showed that in combustion and respiration only a part of the air was used up , and that the same part . He thus proved that air consisted of two parts , one of which was a nitro-aerial spirit ' , while the other was inert . He also showed that red arterial blood gave off bubbles of gas in a vacuum whereous venous blood would not . To us to-day this work seems extremely near to the discovery of oxygen and the true theory of combustion and respiration , and it seems very strange that it should have suffered a century 's neglect . This neglect is usually explained by the appearance of the theory of phlogiston , which has been alluded to on pp. 150 , 158 . This theory appealed to the men of the time , who thought easily in terms of spirits ' , which were as familiar in medicine as in chemistry , but to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply differentiated as e.g. the metals , was wholly unfamiliar . Be this as it may , the phlogiston theory held the field until the seventeen-seventies . The hypothetical phlogiston was a sort of matter of fire ' , a direct descendant of Aristotle 's element of fire . Bodies that  | could burn were thought to contain much phlogiston : when they burned , it streamed out with a whirling motion . Thus sulphur was taken to be peculiarly rich in phlogiston . When it burned , phlogiston was supposed to stream out of it and the product of its combustion ( then supposed to be sulphuric acid ) was left . Thus it was supposed that sulphur consisted of sulphuric acid associated with phlogiston . The theory was a hindrance to chemistry in that ( as we see in the above case ) it made the elements appear to be compounds of their products of combustion with phlogiston , but an assistance in that it gave a general explanation of combustion , which , though wrong , linked together a number of instances of the same type of phenomenon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . It would seem to us that the fact , known to Boyle and many others , that metals when calcined increase in weight , would make the notion that they lost phlogiston appear absurd , but some of the supporters of the phlogiston theory supposed that phlogiston ( like Aristotle 's element of fire ) was absolutely light , and that bodies containing it weighed less than they weighed without it . New Kinds of Gases The reason why the study of gases proceeded so slowly was the lack of a technique for isolating and handling them . Stephen Hales showed how to collect the air ' given off when a body was heated ( Fig. 40 ) , but he was interested in the magnitude of the volume of air ' given off when various bodies were heated , not in the kind of air . It was not until after 1750 that different kinds of gases began to be named . Joseph Black , in 1754 , was the first to describe a gaseous substance different from air . This was fixed air ( carbon dioxide ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were compounds of this gas with calcined magnesia ' and quicklime respectively . In 1766 the eccentric nobleman , Henry Cavendish , published a paper On Factitious Airs . He described inflammable air ( hydrogen ) already collected by Boyle , also fixed air , carbon dioxide . He showed them to be real individuals , not mere varieties of  | air . He gives practical details of the manner of collecting these gases and transferring them from vessel to vessel . It was then quite clear that there were different kinds of gases . In the next eight years Carl Wilhelm Scheele in Sweden , and Joseph Priestley in England discovered a great number of different kinds of air ' . Scheele discovered oxygen , chlorine , and silicon fluoride : Priestley discovered oxygen independently , and also ammonia , sulphur dioxide , carbon monoxide , nitrogen , nitrous oxide , nitric oxide , nitrogen dioxide . The gases which we know to be contained in air and water had now been isolated , but their discoverers had not drawn the correct conclusions from their work . Priestley , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hydrogen combined to form water , were both led by the phlogiston  | theory and by the age-old idea that air and water were elements , into misinterpreting their results . Lavoisier and the Composition of Air After Priestley had discovered the gas we now call oxygen , he was greatly puzzled as to how it could be a better supporter of combustion and respiration than air . He supposed that it was air containing very little phlogiston and that combustibles could therefore burn in it , i.e. transfer their phlogiston to it , with great ease , ? so converting it into air fully combined with phlogiston : thus on Priestley 's theory ( air ? phlogiston ) was the gas we call oxygen and ( air + phlogiston ) was the gas we call nitrogen . Scheele , who discovered oxygen before Priestley but announced the discovery later , supposed that it was identical with the matter of heat ' deprived of phlogiston . Lavoisier in 1774 heard of Priestley 's making of oxygen from mercurius precipitatus per se ( i.e. mercuric oxide ) . He had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found that they increased in weight and absorbed a part of the air . He then performed his famous experiment of heating mercury in a limited volume of air ( p. 170 ) . There appeared on the mercury in the retort red specks and scales of mercurius precipitatus per se and the original 50 cubic inches of air contracted to 42 cubic inches of mofete , mephitic air ' ( chiefly nitrogen ) . When the red matter was collected and heated , 8 cubic inches of vital air ' were obtained and this mixed with the 42 cubic inches of mephitic air reconstituted 50 cubic inches of common air . Lavoisier concluded then that air was a mixture of vital air ( later termed oxygen ) and mephitic air ( later termed nitrogen ) ; that combustion was chemical combination with vital air and that phlogiston had no real existence . Lavoisier 's revival of Boyle 's definition of an element as " the ultimate point that analysis can reach " was another great advance . On this basis a list of elements could be made and thenceforward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighable elements . He invented the chemical nomenclature from which our  | modern one has sprung , and divested chemistry of the ideas and fancies that derived from the Greek doctrine of pneuma and the four transformable elements . Lavoisier and the composition of water Henry Cavendish proved in 1784 that water was formed when inflammable air ( hydrogen ) and dephlogisticated air ( oxygen ) were mixed and exploded by an electric spark . He was somewhat confused by the simultaneous production of a little nitric acid , actually derived from accidental impurities , and also by his firm belief in phlogiston and the elementary nature of water . He therefore supposed water to be pre-formed in each of the gases , so that the combination of the two gases in his view was simply : dephlogisticated air + inflammable air = water ( water ? phlogiston ) ( water + phlogiston ) Priestley and Watt were also working on this subject . Lavoisier heard of Cavendish 's work , hastily repeated it in a much inferior manner and at once published his experiments and the interpretation he gave them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information , as nine years before he had not acknowledged his debt to Priestley 's discovery of oxygen . But he saw the real significance of Cavendish 's work and announced that water was composed weight for weight of inflammable air and vital air . This removed the last difficulties in the rejection of the theory of phlogiston and initiated a new era in chemistry . The significance of oxygen for biology According to the phlogiston theory , the function of air in the animal economy was to remove phlogiston . Lavoisier showed that the oxygen of the air oxidised the carbonaceous materials of the body producing carbon dioxide , water and heat . He supposed that this took place in the lungs and it was only in 1837 that Magnus proved that oxidation went on all over the body . Priestley in 1778 showed that air vitiated by respiration or combustion could be restored by green plants ; in the next  | year Ingen-Housz showed that light was necessary for this to occur and Senebier in 1782 showed that fixed air ( carbon dioxide ) was converted into dephlogisticated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1790 the nature of the two fundamental processes of biochemistry , respiration and photosynthesis , had been explained , and a foundation thus laid for a scientific physiology . Extracts Concerning Gases VAN HELMONT ON GAS He discusses the manner in which the visible vapours from water assume in the air an invisible subtle form , and con-tinues : - ( p. 69 ) " . . . But because the water which is brought into a vapour by cold , is of another condition than a vapour raised by heat ; therefore by the Licence of a Paradox for want of a name , I have called that vapour , Gas , being not far severed from the Chaos* of the Auntients .

In the beginning the acid went over red , then it became colourless , and finally all became red again ; as soon as I perceived the latter , I took away the receiver and tied on a bladder , emptied of air , into which I poured some thick milk of lime in order to prevent the corrosion of the bladder . I then proceeded with the distillation . The bladder began to expand gradually . After this I permitted everything to cool , and tied up the bladder .

( From Collected Papers of C. W. Scheele , translated by Leonard Dobbin . G. Bell and Sons . 1931 . ) LAVOISIER 'S DECOMPOSITION OF AIR " ... I took a flask ( matras ) A of about 36 cubic inches capacity , of which the neck BCDE was very long and had an internal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it as represented in figure 2 : in such a way that it could be placed on a furnace MMNN , while the extremity E of its neck would go beneath the bell jar FG , placed in a bath of mercury RRSS . I introduced into the retort four ounces of very pure  | mercury , then by sucking with a siphon which I introduced under the bell jar FG , I raised the mercury as far as LL : I marked this height carefully with a band of gummed paper , and I observed the barometer and thermometer exactly . Having prepared these things , I lit the fire in the furnace MMNN and kept it going continuously for twelve days in such a way that the mercury was heated almost to the degree required to make it boil . . . . On the second day I began to see swimming on the surface of the mercury some small red particles , which in four or five days increased in volume and number , after which they stopped increasing and remained in exactly the same state . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of mercury made no more progress , I put out the fire and let the vessels cool . The volume of air contained in the retort and in its neck and under the empty part of the bell jar , reduced to a pressure of 20 inches and at to degrees of the thermometer was before the operation about 50 cubic inches . When the operation was finished the same volume at the same pressure and temperature , was found to be only 42 to 43 inches : there was therefore a diminution of volume of about a sixth .

On the other hand , I took the 45 grains of red matter which was formed during the operation , introduced them into a very small glass retort to which was adapted an apparatus suitable for receiving the liquid and aeriform products which might be separated : having lit the fire in the furnace I observed that as the red substance was heated , so its colour increased in intensity . When it finally reached incandescence , the red matter began gradually to decrease in volume , and in a few minutes it had entirely disappeared , at the same time there condensed in the little receiver 412 grains of running mercury and there passed into the bell 7 or 8 cubic inches of an elastic fluid much more suited than air to support combustion and the respiration of animals ... . ( He describes tests that showed it to be Priestley 's dephlogisticated air , which Lavoisier then called vital air . ) ... Reflecting on the circumstances of this experiment it is seen that mercury when calcined absorbs the healthful and respirable part of the air , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this respirable part ; that the part of the air which remains is a kind of mofete , incapable of supporting combustion and respiration : atmospheric air is therefore composed of two elastic fluids of a different and , so to speak , opposite nature . A proof of this important truth , is that on recombining these two elastic fluids that have thus been obtained separately , that is to say , the 42 cubic inches of mofete or irrespirable air , and the eight cubic inches of respirable air , there is once more formed air , in all respects similar to that of the atmosphere , and which is suitable to the same extent for the calcination of metals and the respiration of animals . ( Translated from Traite Elementaire de Chimie . Par M. Lavoisier . Paris . 1789 . I. 35-39. )  | The Age of Steam Productivity It is obvious that a man aided by machinery can produce a far greater quantity of goods than can the same man equipped only with simple tools . The machine , if hand- or foot-driven , enables him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make more rapid and precise movements : and if the machine is power-driven , the quantity of goods the worker can produce in a given time is limited only by the amount of minding ' that the machine requires , that is to say , by the ingenuity and resources of its designer . The extensive use of power-driven machinery created the modern world , in which an enormous variety of machine-made goods are available to all , and distinguishes it from the world before 1800 in which manufactured goods were few and , reckoned in terms of workers ' wages , relatively expensive . The rise of machinery There were remarkably few machines of any kind before the middle of the eighteenth century . Of those that were in use , some had been known from antiquity , for example , looms , cranes , pumps , lathes , flour-mills , presses , and the potter 's wheel ; but none of those were more than very simple devices , and , with the exception of flour-mills and , occasionally , pumps , they were generally worked by hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscles of men and animals , water-wheels , and windmills . Thus we noted in chapter IX ( p. 159 ) that the machine , which Rumford in 1798 describes as being used for boring cannon , was turned by horses . Windmills , horse-mills and water-mills did very well for grinding corn , but there was one heavy piece of work for which they were not adequate ; namely , the raising of water . In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries  | the population increased , and became more refined and cleanly in its habits , though very much less so than ourselves ; consequently large towns began to require a water-supply . Sometimes this could be brought by gravity from higher ground , but sometimes it had to be pumped from a river . Increasing wealth and more complex ways of living created a demand for more metal : the smelting of metals led to the cutting down of much of our forests and so created a further demand for coal . Thus mining became an important industry in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries . Mines were driven deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them springs were encountered ; it was therefore necessary to pump the water out of the workings . A small concern which had to keep a dozen men continuously at the pumps found their wages a heavy charge ; and as it was not often possible to use water-mills to work the pumps , the mine-owners were ready to adopt steamdriven pumps as soon as they were available . The first practical steam-engine for pumping water was invented by Thomas Savery in 1698 . It is shown in Pl . XI . Steam generated in a small strong boiler L is blown into an oval copper vessel ( p. 181 ) . When the supply of steam is cut off , it condenses ; and atmospheric pressure opens the valve at the base of the vessel and forces the water from the minesump into that vessel . The steam is once more admitted to the vessel and thus forces the water to the surface . Two vessels were used so that while water was entering one it was being forced out of the other . There is every reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fuel and somewhat dangerous , for there was necessarily a pressure of 30 ? 50 lbs . sq . in. in the boiler , which had no safety valve . The next improvement was the Newcomen engine which held the field for sixty or seventy years . It was safe because it did not operate by the pressure of the steam but by the pressure of the air , and consequently the pressure of the steam in the boiler was kept low . The engine was reliable and was capable of raising great quantities of water , albeit by great expenditure of coal . The engine ( Pl . XII ) consisted of a rocking-beam , on one end  | of which hung the rod and piston of the pump , and on the other the piston of the steam cylinder . These were made to balance each other by counterpoises so that a very slight pressure of steam would push up the piston of the steam cylinder . Steam was generated in a low-pressure boiler and was admitted by a valve ( automatic or hand-operated ) to the cylinder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The valve was now closed and a jet of cold water admitted , through the valve and pipe below the cylinder . The cold water condensed the steam and the atmosphere pressed down the piston with a force that might amount to several tons . This pulled down the rocking-beam and raised the pump-rod and piston , so forcing the water to the surface . This type of engine was in general use for many years , but was very wasteful because at every stroke steam had to be used to heat the whole cylinder and piston from the temperature of the condensing water up to the temperature of the steam . Wastefulness did not matter very much in coal-mines where fuel was cheap , but in the Cornish tin-mines , where all the fuel had to come by sea and be carted from ports , it was a serious matter . The earlier steam-engines , it should be noted , were pumps , and were not capable of rotating a wheel or shaft , but in Plate XII is shown a Newcomen engine which is being used to turn a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slow-moving Newcomen engine was not , however , at all suitable for such work . Power-driven Machinery We have seen that in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries there were few machines of any kind , but the eighteenth century saw the invention of machinery for spinning of yarn . England had for centuries been a cloth-manufacturing country : in the eighteenth century the population began to increase rapidly , and at the same time new markets were opened in all the lands to which our sea-borne trade penetrated . Traders and merchants began to find that they could sell more cloth than the country could produce . The slowest process in the making of cloth was spinning ; the weavers , dyers , etc. , could have handled  | more yarn than was being made , so there was a strong need for machinery to speed up spinning , and between 1770 and 178o were invented a number of spinning-machines , capable of being driven by power . At first the only suitable power was that of the water-wheel , and so the spinning-machines were congregated in " mills " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a swiftly-flowing stream . This was the beginning of the factory-system , which brought about the greatest of revolutions in human ways of living . One source of power drives many machines , so these must be congregated in one building , and the worker instead of weaving or spinning at home must spend his day in the factory . Before 1770 the great majority of other than agricultural workers worked at home , now almost everybody works in a factory ? a change , we may suppose , that is greatly for the worse . Water-wheels are stopped by severe frost , or by drought or flood , and there were not many places in Great Britain where water-power was available . So textile machinery created a demand for an engine that could act as prime-mover for a factory . The Engines of James Watt The fuel consumption of the Newcomen engine was very high , and Watt was the first to grasp the necessity of economising heat ; he was also the first to make steam-engines which were suitable for turning a wheel instead of pulling a pump-rod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mining appliance to a world-power , were embodied in patents of 1769 , 1781 and 1782 . The most essential were as follows : 1 . The cylinder must be kept as hot as the steam that enters it . The Newcomen engine condensed the steam in the cylinder , which therefore at each stroke had to be heated by the steam from , say , 2o ? C. to too ? C. This heating of the cylinder walls condensed much steam without getting any useful work from it , and indeed this type of engine consumed at each stroke about four times as much steam as was needed to fill the cylinder . Watt avoided this necessity by surrounding the  | cylinder ( Fig. 43 , a ) with non-conducting material and by applying his second principle , namely , that , 2 . Condensation is to take place in a separate vessel , the condenser ( ! z ) , connected to the cylinder through a cock or valve and kept free from accidentally-entering air by a pump . The cylinder was thus kept continually hot and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeatedly changing the temperature of parts of the engine . His third principle was of even greater importance . Instead of using steam merely to make a vacuum in the cylinder , he also used its pressure to impel the piston . He therefore suggests : 3 . Employment of the expensive force of steam and , if necessary , dispensing with condensation . The engine with these improvements was much more efficient . In 1781 Watt used devices to convert the back-and-forth motion of the piston into the rotary motion of a wheel . He did not at first employ the familiar method of the crank , for a rival had patented this . In 1782 and shortly after , he introduced two most important advances . First was the use of double action , i.e. the application of steam on one side of the piston while a vacuum was applied to the other ; this doubled the duty done by each cylinder . Secondly he introduced the plan of stopping the admission of steam when the piston had travelled over but a part of its course and then allowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This effected considerable economy . Finally he provided for steady running by the use of the throttle valve ( B ) and governor ( z z ) which automatically cut down the steam supply to the cylinder if the rate of running of the engine increased ? e.g. on account of the lightening of its load ? and vice versa . Watt may be said to have created the steam-engine as a source of power . His purpose had been to make a more economical pumping-engine , but a far more important result was the use of the new engines , first to drive machinery , secondly to accelerate sea- and land-transport.  | The Factories As we have seen , spinning- and carding-machinery was already invented and waiting for a prime mover , and so it was not long before Lancashire and the West Riding were covered with factories and mills ' in which a large number of textile machines were driven by a single steam-engine . Soon after the turn of the century the power-loom was introduced , and by then the greater part of the textile trade was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First of all the workers who had spun and woven in their cottages were congregated in large factories , and the factories were grouped in the places where coal and water and labour were most easily come by . The result was the migration of the working-people from villages , and the formation of towns of a size hitherto unknown . There was no attempt to regulate building or to provide adequate watersupply or sanitation , so that the workers were horribly overcrowded in damp ill-ventilated houses , under conditions of terrible filth ( pp. 201-204 ) . The factory , moreover , did not require the skilled labour of the former spinners and weavers ; in their place it needed a few engineers and fitters and a vast number of the cheapest unskilled workers , whose task was unendingly to push wool into a machine or guide a piece of cloth through it , or tie threads when they broke , and the like . There were no factory- or labour-regulations , and the employers hired the cheapest form of labour ? children and preferably orphan children apprenticed by workhouses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : their death rate is unknown but must have been gigantic , for even in the eighteenforties , when conditions had somewhat improved , six out of every ten people who died in the textile districts were under twenty ? the proportion today is one in eight . Legislation to prevent this wholesale slaughter of the innocent proved exceedingly difficult to pass , for the workers were quite unrepresented in Parliament ; and it was not until 1847 that any really effective measures were taken to restrict the employment of young children . The new steam-engines and the railways created a further great demand for coal which further increased  | the congestion of the Black Country . Women and children were employed in the mines in even more horrible conditions than in the factories ( pp. 187-89 ) . The goods were turned out . England sold textiles and engines and rails to the world : fortunes were made and re-invested , and by the eighteen-fifties she had founded a great age of industrial prosperity on the blood and misery of the exploited workers . The years from 178o to 185o @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most shameful of our history from the point of view of social morality . Mechanisation outside the textile trade During the first half of the nineteenth century , there was surprisingly little use of machinery in other trades than the textile . Power was used almost exclusively for work which was too heavy for men to perform economically . Thus papermills , saw-mills , rolling-mills , pumping-plant were commonly driven by steam-engines , but the speeding up of output by the use of light workshop machinery did not make much headway until the gas-engine and later the electric motor provided useful small units of intermittent power . Examples Concerning the Early Use of Power SAVERY 'S ENGINE The manner of working the engine The first thing is to fix the engine in a good double furnace , so contrived that the flame of your fire may circulate round and encompass your two boilers to the best advantage , as you do coppers for brewing . Before you make any fire , unscrew g and n , being the two small gauge-pipes and cocks belonging to the two boilers , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twothirds full of water , and d , the small boiler , quite full ; then screw in the said pipes again as fast and tight as possible ; then light the fire at b . When the water in 1 boils , the handle of the regulator , marked z , must be thrust from you as far as it will  | go , which makes all the steam rising from the water in I pass with irresistible force through o into p , pushing out all the air before it , through the clack r , making a noise as it goes ; and when all is gone out , the bottom of vessel p , will be very hot ; then pull the handle of the regulator to you , by which means you stop o , and force your steam through o into p , until that vessel has discharged its air through the clack r , . up the forcepipe . In the meantime , by the steam 's condensing in the vessel p , a vacuum or emptiness is created , so that the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through t , the suckingpipe , lifting up the clack r , and filling the vessel p . In the meantime , the vessel p , being emptied of its air , turn the handle of the regulator from you again , and the force is upon the surface of the water in p , which surface being only heated by the steam , it does not condense it , but the steam gravitates or presses with an elastic quality like air ; still increasing its elasticity or spring , till it counterpoises , or rather exceeds the weight of the water ascending in s , the forcing-pipe , out of which , the water in p will be immediately discharged when once gotten to the top , which takes up some time to recover that power ; which having once got , and being in work , it is easy for anyone that never saw the engine , after half an hour 's experience , to keep a constant stream running out the full bore of the pipe s ; for , on the outside of the vessel p , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as if the vessel were transparent ; for , as far as the steam continues in the vessel , so far is the vessel dry without , and so very hot , as scarce to endure the least touch of the hand ; but as far as the water is , the said vessel will be cold and wet , where any water has fallen on it ; which cold and moisture vanishes as fast as the steam , in its descent , takes place of the water ; but if you force all the water out , the steam , or a small part thereof , going through r , will rattle the clack , so as to give sufficient notice to pull the handle of the regulator to you , which , at the same time , begins to force out the water from p , without the least alteration of the steam ; only , sometimes , the stream of the water will be somewhat stronger than before , if you pull the handle of the regulator before any considerable quantity of steam be gone  | up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let none of the steam go off , for that is but losing so much strength , and is easily prevented , by pulling the regulator some little time before the vessel forcing is quite emptied . This being done , immediately turn the cock or pipe of the cistern x , on p , so that the water proceeding from x , through y , which is never open but when turned on p , or P ; but when between them is tight and stanch ; I say , the water , falling on p , causes , by its coolness , the steam , which had such great force just before to its elastic power , to condense and become a vacuum or empty space , so that the vessel p is , by the external pressure of the atmosphere , or what is vulgarly called suction , immediately refilled , while p is emptying ; which being done , you push the handle of the regulator from you , and throw the force onp , pulling the condensing pipe over p , causing the steam in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other empties . The labour of turning these two parts of the engine , viz. , the regulator and watercock , and attending the fire , being no more than what a boy 's strength can perform for a day together , and is as easily learned as their driving of a horse in a tub-gin ; yet , after all , I would have men , and those , too , the most apprehensive , employed in working of the engine , supposing them more careful than boys . The difference of this charge is not to be mentioned or accounted of when we consider the vast profit which those who use the engine will reap by it . ( The Miner 's Friend . Thomas Savery. 1702. ) // What intervals have these children allowed for their meals ; for breakfast , for instance ? ? I have been in mills at all hours , and I never in my life saw the machinery stopped at breakfast time at any of the mills . How do they get their breakfast ? ? They get their breakfast as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pot of water porridge , with a little treacle in it , placed at the end of the machine , and when they have exerted themselves to get a little forward with their work , they take a few spoonfuls for a minute  | or two , and then to work again , and continue to do so until they have finished their breakfast . This is the general practice , not only of the children , but of the men in the woollen mills in this district . Is there any allowance of time for the afternoon refreshment , called drinking ? ? No allowance for drinking , more than breakfast . How much at dinner time , as far as you have been able to judge , speaking now of the summer season ? ? In summer some of the mills allow an hour for dinner . And some less ? ? Some less ; some 40 minutes . What is the usual time allowed in winter ? ? There is no time allowed in winter , only just sufficient to eat their dinner ; perhaps ten minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases they manage the same at noon as they do at breakfast and drinking . The children are employed as what they call pieceners , are they not ? ? Yes . Does not that require them to be constantly on their feet ? ? Always on their feet when at work ; they can not sit and piece . During the hours of which you speak , then , the children are to be constantly on their feet , excepting these very short intervals ? ? Yes . Only this very short time for dinner ? ? That is the only interval they have for rest , except it may sometimes happen that they may be out of what we call jummed wool , and then the children have a short opportunity to rest themselves , and even then they are frequently employed in cleaning the cording machine . You say you have observed these children constantly for many years going there early in the morning to their work , and continuing at it till so late at night ? ? Yes ; I have seen children during the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and II o'clock , although trade has been so bad with some of the mills that they have had nothing to do ; others have been working seventeen or seventeen and a half hours per day . This requires that the cottagers should wake their children  | very early in the morning ? ? It can not be expected they can go to their work asleep . How early do you think that they leave their homes ? ? I can tell you what a neighbour told me six weeks ago ; she is the wife of Jonas Barrowcliffe , near Scholes ; her child works at a mill nearly two miles from home , and I have seen that child coming from its work this winter between i o and 11 in the evening ; and the mother told me that one morning this winter the child had been up by two o'clock in the morning , when it had only arrived from work at eleven ; it then had to go nearly two miles to the mill , where it had to stay at the door till the overlooker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I suppose ? ? They had no clock ; and she believed , from what she afterwards learnt from the neighbours , that it was only two o'clock when the child was called up and went to work ; but this has only generally happened when it has been moonlight , thinking the morning was approaching . Is this practice general in the entire neighbourhood ? ? It is the general practice of the neighbourhood ; and any fact that I state here can be borne out by particular evidences , that , if required , I can point out . What has been the treatment which you have observed that these children have received at the mills , to keep them attentive for so many hours at such an early age ? ? They are generally cruelly treated ; so cruelly treated , that they dare not hardly for their lives be too late at their work in the morning . When I have been at the mills in the winter season , when the children are at work in the evening , the very first thing they inquire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should answer " Seven " , they say , " Only seven ! it is a great while to ten , but we must not give up till ten o'clock or past . " They look so anxious to know what o'clock it is , that I am convinced the children are fatigued , and think that even at seven they have worked too long . My heart has been ready to bleed for them when I have seen them so fatigued , for they appear in such a state of apathy and insensibility as really not to know whether they are doing their work or not ; they usually throw a bunch of 1 o or 12 recordings across  | the hand , and take one off at a time ; but I have seen the bunch entirely finished , and they have attempted to take off another when they have not had a cording at all ; they have been so fatigued as not to know whether they were at work or not . Do they frequently fall into errors and mistakes in piecing when thus fatigued ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are , that instead of placing the cording in this way ( describing it ) , they are apt to place them obliquely , and that causes a flying , which makes bad yarn ; and when the billyspinner sees that , he takes his strap or the billy-roller , and says , " Damn thee , close it ? little devil , close it , " and they smite the child with the strap or the billy-roller . You have noticed this in the after part of the day more particularly ? ? It is a very difficult thing to go into a mill in the latter part of the day , particularly in winter , and not to hear some of the children crying for being beaten for this very fault . How are they beaten ? ? That depends on the humanity of the hubber or billy-spinner ; some have been beaten so violently that they have lost their lives in consequence of their being so beaten ; and even a young girl has had the end of a billy-roller jammed through her cheek . What is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three yards long , and of two inches in diameter , and with an iron pivot at each end ; it runs on the top of the cording over the feeding cloth . I have seen them take the billy-roller and rap them on the head , making their heads crack , so that you might have heard the blow at the distance of six or eight yards , in spite of the din and rolling of the machinery ; many have been knocked down by the instrument . I knew a boy very well , of the name of Senior , with whom I went to school ; he was struck with a billy-roller on the elbow , it occasioned a swelling , he was not able to work more than three or four weeks after the blow , and he died in consequence . There was a woman in Holmfirth who was beaten very much , I am not quite certain whether on the head , and she also lost her life in consequence of being beaten with a billy-roller . This which is produced ( showing one ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot longer than that ;  | it is the most common instrument with which these poor little pieceniers are beaten , more commonly than with either a stick or a strap . How is it detached from the machinery ? ? Supposing this to be the billy-frame ( describing it ) , at each end there is a socket open , the cording runs underneath here , just in this way , and when the billy-spinner is angry , and sees the little piecener has done wrong , he takes off this and says , " Damn thee , close it . " You have seen the poor children in this situation ? ? I have seen them frequently struck with the billy-roller ; I never saw one so struck as to occasion its death , but I once saw a piecener struck on the face by a billy-spinner with his hand , until its nose bled very much ; and when I said , " Oh dear , I would not suffer a child of mine to be treated thus , " the man has said , " How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What have you to do with it ? " What moral effect do you think it has on the minds of the children who labour thus at this early period of life ? ? With regard to the morals of the children who work in mills , we can not expect that they can be so strict as children who are generally under the care of their parents . I have seen a little boy , only this winter , who works at a mill , and who lives within 200 or 300 yards of my own door ; he is not six years old , and I have seen him , when he had a few coppers in his pocket , go to a beer shop , call for a glass of ale , and drink as boldly as any full-grown man , cursing and swearing , and saying he should be a man as soon as some of them .

In Walkden Moor , at a place called New Engine .  | What is your work ? ? Drawing from a man. * Describe it. ? We have belts and chains round our bodies , and tubs to them . So the tub is fastened to you ? ? We have hooks at the ends of the chains , and so that is fastened to the tub , and we pull it about , bending double in this manner ( bending his head down to the table ) . At what time do you go down into the mine ? ? Mostly we go down at half-past five , or between that and six . When do you come up ? ? We are uncertain ; sometimes at twelve , sometimes before , sometimes after six , sometimes we have been down fourteen hours . When do you eat ? ? We eat mostly about ten or twelve ; we have no time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; we stop about a minute or so , and sometimes we work and eat together ; when the baskets are full we have more time . Do you ever stop longer ? ? Sometimes we stop three or four hours , when our baskets are full . Have you ever worked a whole day together without stopping to eat ? ? Yes , we have ; and sometimes we ca n't eat at all for want of something to drink . Do n't you ever take bottles of drink down ? ? No ; they are sure to break . Do you ever take cans ? ? No ; there is no conveniences at all to take anything about ; and if they took cans full , they would be drunk by others . What do you eat for dinner ? ? Sometimes bread and cheese , and sometimes bread and butter , and sometimes pies of potatoes and flesh ; and in fruit time we get fruit pies . How often do you have flesh pies ? ? Sometimes we have a month or two without them ; I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up again from the mouth . What makes them come up again ? ? It is bending in this manner . Footnote  | You mean that you are sick ? ? Yes . Are the boys often sick ? ? Yes , very often . Do you breakfast in the mine ? ? No ; my breakfast is coffee and butter-cakes at home , and at night we get potatoes and bacon . How much do you get a week ? ? The highest I ever got in my life was 6s. a week , but now about I9s. the last month . Is that the general wages now ? ? Yes . Do girls get the same ? ? About the same . Do you work generally bent ? ? Yes , regularly bent ; we never stand up . Are you often ill ? ? No ; I never was plagued with bad health , not so very much . Hove old were you when you went into the mine ? ? Going nine year since. * At what age do they usually go into the mine ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . Do these little children do the same work as you ? ? What the little ones ca n't manage himself the others help ; there is two to a basket when one can not manage it .

Had you pains in your breast with thrutching ? ? Yes , sometimes . Do the girls thrutch ? ? Yes , when they are little , and when they grow bigger they , draw by themselves . Do the boys and girls work exactly in the same way ? ? Yes , both exactly in the same way . Do they ever get crooked with bending ? ? Yes ; there is some as grows crooked as goes in pits , and some as does not . How are they crooked ? ? Some in their backs and some in their legs ; but very few boys crooked any way ; when they grow into men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they starten a growing crooked .

No ; it is not the same as when they are regularly bent in this manner . What is the weight of the basket you draw ? ? About four hundred weight . Have sometimes two little children under six such a basket to draw between them ? ? Yes ; in an easy place , where it is near where he teams the coal , one will do it ; some of them have 200 yards to draw the baskets , and when their legs martches they stop and stand in this manner with their hands on the basket as well as they can .

( First Report of the Central Board of His Majesty 's Commissioners . . . as to the Employment of Children in Factories . 28 June 1833. )  | Science and Public Health The increase of longevity The amazing increase in the health of civilised humanity is best reflected in the figures for the expectation of life of a human being : that is , the probable number of years a new-born baby may be expected to live . If the expectation of life is 50 , it is roughly true that as many people live to be more than fifty as die before they are fifty : it does not of course mean that everybody or even most people die at fifty . The following table speaks for itself : Table There appears to have been slow but considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till 188o , then a very rapid increase . Why people die Everyone has to die , but those who die young usually do so from what we may call a germ-disease ? that is , the multiplication in the human body of a microscopic organism that may be 191  | a virus-particle , a bacterium or a protozoon . A person can not be infected unless the organism enters his body : he is likely to suffer the more severely , the worse is his state of general health . Bacteria are transferred from the sick to the healthy by : 1 . Sputum droplets ejected by talking , coughing , sneezing . Very many diseases can be so transmitted . This mode of infection is obviously increased by ( a ) overcrowding , ( b ) lack of ventilation . 2 . Infected water . The excreta of typhoid and cholera patients swarm with the bacteria that cause these diseases . If these are drained into rivers , the water will infect all who drink it and are susceptible . 3 . Infected food . Milk is the chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready breeding ground for any bacteria carried by those who handle it . Flies may carry bacteria from excreta to food . 4 . By insects . Infected insects bite men and inject germs . Plague is carried by the rat-flea , typhus by the louse , malaria and yellow fever by mosquitoes. 5 . Venereal diseases . Conveyed by sexual intercourse with an infected person . 6 . By infection of wounds . All natural wounds become infected with bacteria , but certain strains are particularly dangerous . The hands and instruments of surgeons often carried these before antiseptic precautions were discovered . All these modes of infection are partly or completely preventable , as also are deficiency diseases and conditions , arising from insufficient or improper food : e.g. scurvy , rickets , and starvation . These caused few deaths , but much ill-health . Thus disease is rampant in communities which are ill-housed , whose drinking water contains sewage , who drink dirty milk , are verminous , unchaste , and underfed . All this was true of the majority of town-dwellers in the eighteenth century and earlier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of these matters from the sixteenth century onwards . People  | slowly became more refined in their habits , more averse to gross dirt and vermin , and the standard of housing steadily improved . This is reflected in the first steady rise of expectation of life , but in the years round ' Boo this general improvement was countered by the factory-system which caused an enormous increase in the size of towns and a consequent overcrowding , which was very little diminished till the end of the nineteenth century . The town population was also exposed to infected water in a way that the countryman was not ; town-dwellers were moreover generally ill-nourished and overworked . There was a huge unnecessary death-rate from fever ' , which meant typhoid , and also from tuberculosis , which was about eight times as prevalent as it is to-day . From the eighteen-forties certain enlightened people such as Edwin Chadwick saw clearly that the poor suffered from fever ' far more severely than the rich , and managed to establish some connection between the presence of fever and the absence of drains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained at a loss until the years round 1880 . Theories of infection The standard theory of infection , before the germ-theory of disease was accepted , was that of miasma . Marshes , decaying matter , sick persons , were thought to give off a miasma , a subtle gaseous poison or influence which caused disease in those that breathed it . The theory indicated that where there was a stink , disease might be expected ; relics of this are found in people who expect to be infected by a smelly drain . In fact , stink is harmless in itself : it is merely an indication of bacterial action elsewhere . The measures employed to remove bad smells , namely , fresh air , and soap-and-water , are excellent removers of bacteria , so some , such as Florence Nightingale , who warred on disease by cleanliness , were in fact rewarded by a decrease of woundinfections and of the droplet-carried and insect-borne diseases ; but soap-and-water could have no effect on the water-borne typhoid and cholera .  | The germ-theory of disease was found out in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Work of Pasteur and Lister Louis Pasteur in 1857 began to study alcoholic fermentation and thence came to investigate the similar phenomena of the souring of milk and the putrefaction or going bad ' of broths , etc . He observed , as many had done before him , that the process was accompanied by a vast multiplication of microscopic organisms , yeasts , bacteria , etc. ; but he differed from his predecessors in concluding that these organisms were the causes of the changes and not a mere incident , and by a series of brilliantly conceived experiments , such as that described on pp. 206-207 , he proved , in face of much opposition and controversy , that if micro-organisms were excluded from anything susceptible of fermentation or putrefaction it would not ferment or putrefy . This work was not only of enormous theoretical interest , but of great importance for the brewing-trade of France . In 1862 Pasteur was asked to investigate a disease of silkworms which was ruining the industry , and he proved it to be due to living corpuscles ' which multiplied in the silkworms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of ill-health . Meanwhile Joseph Lister had been investigating the fearful mortality that attended surgical operations . Anesthetics had been in use since 1847 , which made for slower and more careful surgery , but the mortality from septicxmia was still enormous , and about half his amputation cases died from this cause . Why did wounds become septic , he wondered ; and it seemed to him to result from a sort of putrefaction of the fluids in and about the wound . In 1865 a colleague drew his attention to the recent work of Pasteur ; putrefaction was due to micro-organisms ? the same might be true of sepsis . Lister then designed a technique for excluding micro-organisms from surgical wounds and killing them if present by means of disinfectants , chiefly carbolic acid . He had immediate and brilliant success , and as years went on he gradually discarded the use of these somewhat poisonous and irritating disinfectants , and developed the modern surgical technique of sterilisation of the surgeon 's hands  | Footnote and the patient 's skin , of instruments and dressings . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wounds , surgical and otherwise , but made it possible to save a great number of lives by surgical operations which would formerly have meant certain death from septic poisoning . It is very remarkable that neither Pasteur 's work on silkworms nor Lister 's on surgical sepsis , nor Davaine 's proof that anthrax in animals was due to bacteria , led to the general inference that infectious diseases were caused by bacteria or other micro-organisms . This great step was mainly due to Robert Koch , who worked out the life-history of bacteria and discovered the technique of cultivating them on jelly and making them readily visible under the microscope by staining them with dyes . The germ-theory of disease may be said to  | date from about 1880 and the next twenty years saw the discovery of most of the important disease-bacteria , and the demonstration of the routes of infection . Preventive Medicine The effect of this work was enormous . For the first time we knew how to find the contagion and how to destroy it , and we knew how to be rationally clean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter from infected bodies must be avoided ; overcrowding , with its consequence of breathing infected sputum-droplets , was shown to be a source of infection . The only important means of infection that remained unexplained until the twentieth century was the carrying of plague , yellow fever , typhus , malaria , etc. , which finally were tracked down to the bites of infected insects . It is very hard to make people change their habits , and improvements followed rather slowly . From 1865 onward England began to get clean water and proper sewage disposal ; from 188o proper isolation of the infectious and surgical cleanliness began to be practised in hospitals and later in the home ; from 1900 when the cheap road transport of the electric tram widened the area of the cities , overcrowding became greatly reduced . These were the great steps towards prevention of disease in England : in tropical countries an equally great step was the control of parasites , more especially the malaria-carrying mosquito . The Cure of Disease Until about ten years ago it may be said that , with few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctor prescribed conditions of rest , warmth , diet , etc. : but the body had to fight and destroy the germs by itself . As soon as the germ-theory of disease was evolved , it became clear that if the germs in the body could be killed , the disease would be cured . But with two exceptions , the drugs that were capable of killing bacteria in the test-tube were poisonous to the patient and had little or no effect on the bacteria in his  | tissues . Yet there was a shining exception . Quinine did kill the malaria parasite without injuring the patient : but the search for drugs effective against other germs remained fruitless for decades . Inoculation and Vaccination It has always been known that certain diseases are rarely , if ever , contracted twice in a lifetime . Perhaps the most universal and dreaded of diseases before the nineteenth century was small-pox . The Turks appear to have invented the practice of inoculation , that is , of infecting children with matter from a very mild case of small-pox , so causing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lasting protection . The practice was brought to England in the early eighteenth century . At the end of the century ( 1798 ) Edward Jenner announced his discovery that an attack of cow-pox protected against small-pox , and so introduced the practice of vaccination . There is to-day almost no mortality from small-pox in countries where vaccination is largely practised . Inoculation with mild strains of living organisms is still practised . Pasteur 's treatment of hydrophobia with an attenuated ' virus , and the B.C.G. treatment designed to protect against tuberculosis is on the same basis . These methods are dangerous , for it is difficult to be certain that the bacteria are of a mild type ; and so inoculation with dead bacteria is preferred . If dead bacteria are injected into the body it is stimulated to produce complex substances ( anti-bodies ' ) which are capable of killing bacteria of the same kind and neutralising their poisons , and these anti-bodies protect against any living bacteria that may subsequently enter it . This process has proved effective as a protection against typhoid , cholera , plague @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which an animal makes the protective anti-bodies . The dead or living bacteria are injected into , e.g. , a horse , which develops an immunity to them : the blood-serum of this horse contains the protective substances and if injected into a human body will destroy the bacterial toxins . This anti-toxin treatment has had great success in combating diphtheria , but although it is of some  | assistance in many diseases , diphtheria is the only disease for which such treatment is a spectacular success . Chemotherapy Chemotherapy is the treatment of a germ-disease by a drug that adversely affects the bacterium or other parasite without having an ill effect on the human body . The effect of quinine on malaria and the effect of mercury on syphilis had been known since the seventeenth century , but no other infectious diseases seemed to be influenced by drugs until the twentieth century , when further progress was made by Ehrlich 's discovery in 1910 of an organic arsenical compound , salvarsan , that had a drastic effect on the germ of syphilis . Some tropical diseases were successfully treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the century has been the discovery of a group of synthetic drugs , known collectively as the sulphonamide drugs , which have the most spectacular effect on a number of bacterial diseases . Septic wounds , the infections which too often result in maternal mortality , pneumonia , meningitis , gonorrhoea , are cured with such ease as enormously to reduce the sickness-rate and the mortality from these causes . The latest of these anti-bacterial drugs , penicillin , is not of the sulphonamide group and is obtained from moulds ; this material appears to open up further possibilities , and we know of no reason why , as research progresses , every type of bacterial disease should not be remedied by some drug . Public Health Services It is not sufficient to know the means of preventing and curing disease : it is equally necessary to provide these means and even to compel their use . A great part of the public health service consists of seeing that people , who can not or will not provide or ensure such things for themselves , have sufficient space , light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ; and none of these things can be provided by the medical man . Legislation is needed to prevent builders from erecting or people , from inhabitating dark , overcrowded , ill-ventilated houses : municipal or state action is needed to provide and control  | water-supply , and to lay down and connect sewers ; last , but not least , a nation with an economic system which allows the unemployed to starve or exist at a low level of nourishment can only be healthy in times of good trade . The English tradition was that " a man may do what he will with his own " ; and accordingly thrpughout the nineteenth century Parliament was very loth to impose any rules or restrictions on landlords , factory-owners , employers , and vestries , * who effectually controlled the lives of the workers . The beginning of public health services was the adoptive legislation of 1848 giving local authorities powers , which they might use if they chose , to appoint medical officers and reform sanitation . In 1866 they were compelled to take action ; in 1871 a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a central authority with powers of compulsion  --  the Local Government Board . In 1919 this was replaced by the Ministry of Health . Before 1907 there was little provision for free medical services except in the hospitals , and by the traditional charity of doctors . In that year the School Medical Services began and have since greatly increased . The greatest step was , however , the National Health Insurance Scheme , which began in 1911 ; the Maternity and Infant Welfare Services are still more recent . The system was far from complete for it could not ensure that every citizen did promptly and automatically have medical or surgical treatment without loss of privation ; but this seems to be assured by the legislation which came into force in 1948 . The Residual Problem Our progress towards the ensuring of the maximum possible degree of health for every citizen has gone far but is not complete . It requires better organised medical and social services , but far more does it require better organised medical research . Medical and social services may diminish the virulence and spread of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ root . If the whole wealth of the country had been expended on preventing and treating pneumonia by the methods of 1935 , it could not have lowered its death-rate by a quarter of the Footnote  | lowering that resulted from the discovery of sulphapyridine ; yet the cost of the research into this was the labour of a handful of men and the expenditure of only a few thousand pounds .

All the patients lay on the boards , and during their illness never had their clothes off . I met with many cases in similar conditions ; yet amidst the greatest destitution and want of domestic comfort , I have never heard , during the course of twelve years ' practice , a complaint of inconvenient accommodation .

Very generally ; but I ought to add , that when the greatest willingness has been shown , very slight obstacles have sufficed to prevent these good intentions from being carried into effect . This happened in the case of a poor water-gilder , suffering from trembling palsy , caused by frequent exposure to the fumes of mercury . I suggested to his employer a very simple plan of getting rid of these poisonous fumes , and he promised willingly and gratefully to adopt it .

( From the Report cited on p. 201 . ) CHARLES DARWIN GIVES UP HIS INTENDED MEDICAL CAREER ( 1825 ) I attended on two occasions the operating theatre in the hospital at Edinburgh and saw two very bad operations , one on a child , but I rushed away before they were completed . Nor did I ever attend again , for hardly any inducement could have been strong enough to make me do so ; this being long before the blessed days of chloroform . The two cases fairly haunted me for many a long year . ( From a private letter . ) SEPSIS IN HOSPITALS There is no hospital , however small , airy or well regulated , where this epidemic ulcer is not to be found at times ; and then no operation dare be performed ; every cure stands still , every wound becomes a sore , and every sore is apt to run into a gangrene : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and is a real gangrene ; it has been named the hospital gangrene , and such were its ravages in the Hotel Dieu of Paris ( that great storehouse of corruption and disease ) , that surgeons did not care to call it by its true name , they called it the rottenness , foulness , sloughing of the sore !

I , Fig. 25 , A , B , C , D ( Fig. 45 of this work ) . I then bring the liquid to the boil for several minutes until the steam issues freely from the open end of the drawn-out neck , using no other precaution . I then let the flask cool . It is a remarkable fact , calculated to astonish anybody who is used to the delicacy of experiments relative to so-called spontaneous generations , that the liquid in the flask remains indefinitely without alteration .

But we have seen by the analyses which I have published in this memoir how this action of oxygen is limited , and that in no case are any organised productions developed in the liquids . It appears that the ordinary air , returning with force at the first moment , must reach the flask quite unaltered . That is Footnote  | Figure true , but it encounters a liquid that is still near its boilingpoint . The re-entry of the air thereafter occurs more slowly , and by the time that the liquid is so far cooled as no longer to be able to deprive germs of their vitality , the re-entry of the air becomes so slow that it leaves behind in the damp curves of the neck , all the dust particles capable of acting on the infusions and bringing about the production of organism .

The past and future must always be known with less certainty than the present ; nevertheless where evidence is plentiful we can have much confidence in our history or prediction ? but where it is scanty , we must accept the results of our reasoning with due reserve . Traditional views of the past An account of the early history of the world is given in the Book of Genesis . From the time of St. Augustine ( fifth century ) at least , it has been recognised that this is not necessarily to be read by the Christian as literal scientific history , but that it is told in such a way as to be understood by its ancient hearers , yet remaining true at all times for all men who had the wits to discover its meaning . This enlightened view was not however general in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , with its plants , animals and men , such as exist to-day , was created in six successive days of twenty-four hours , about the year 4000 B.C. Fossils The most obvious difficulty in harmonising the world as we see it to-day with the literal interpretation of the Mosaic view of Creation is the character of fossil remains of living creatures . How did oyster shells get into the limestone of the Alps ? Had the Alps been under the sea at some time since their creation ? If so , how was it that no such changes as would raise the Alps in so short a period were still to be observed ? That astonishing  | genius Leonardo da Vinci solved the problem in outline in his notebooks written between 1 482 and 1518 , but unfortunately for science not published for centuries after his death . Leonardo brings strong evidence that fossils were once living and that they were covered up by mud which was changed into rock . The sea-bed rose to form the dry land as a result of the shifting of the centre of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land and the deposition of mud in the sea . But Leonardo was almost alone in these advanced views , and the favourite theory was that a formative power , which was thought to cause all living things , and crystals likewise , to assume their characteristic shapes , could act on the rocks and produce there the forms of shells , leaves , bones , etc. , which forms had , however , never been alive . This view was generally , though not invariably , accepted up till the beginning of the eighteenth century . When , however , the first naturalists began to classify fossils , as they classified living plants and animals , it became obvious that these fossils were remains of actual creatures that had once been alive and of species that were no longer to be found on earth . How had these species become extinct ? The Biblical flood was generally invoked both to destroy these creatures and to carry them to the tops of the mountains , and when it became clear that different species of animals had become extinct at different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But what were the naturalists to think of the animals , living in modern times , whose remains were not to be found in the deeper rocks ? Had these animals come into being after the general creation ? All species , it was supposed , had been created by the direct fiat of the Deity : and a usual interpretation was to suppose the six days ' of creation to refer to six great geological periods . But as research went on , it did not seem that there were precisely six or any other such number of geological periods , but a continuous process of extinction and new creation . In 1858 , just before Darwin 's theories were published , the favoured view was that a creative force in Nature , emanating originally from God , had created new species at intervals throughout the ages . It was supposed only by very few that one species could change into another , for the excellent  | reason that no ' evidence of such changes had been observed . Although no clear account of the appearance and disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully studied by such men as Cuvier and Owen ; and palxontology , the study of ancient forms of life , was well advanced by the middle of the nineteenth century . Geological time Between 1790 and 1820 a number of great geologists discovered how the various strata had been laid down . J. G. Werner made it clear that successive strata or layers of rock succeeded each other in time , the deepest being the oldest . William Smith showed how each stratum could be identified by the particular fossil species it contained , and by such means geological maps began to be prepared . James Hutton in 1795 showed how the effects of weathering and the mechanical action of water disintegrated the rocks and led to the deposition of such strata as clays , shales , slates , sandstones , etc . He made it clear that the deposition of these rocks in such gigantic thicknesses as were now revealed by geological researches must have required incalculable ages . The earth was obviously very much more than six thousand years old , and the days ' before the creation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands , even millions of years . Physics had its contribution to make to this problem ; the earth had once been a molten globe , as appeared from its oblate spheroidal shape : how long had it needed to cool to its present temperatures There was hardly sufficient data to answer this , for the cooling of the earth was influenced by the heat of the sun and this itself raised further problems ( pp. 220 , 242-45 ) . Views of the Origin of Species before Charles Darwin The species of animals and plants are obviously not unrelated . Thus there are several hundred species of plants of the onion tribe , several hundred species of bee , several dozen species of mice . A scientific explanation of this fact was required , and a possible one was that all the similar species had developed from a single common stock , as all the domestic varieties of  | the dog were taken to have developed from one ( or a very few ) species of wild dog . The view that all animal species had developed from a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darwin , Charles Darwin 's gl andfather , but it was considered a fanciful and eccentric hypothesis ( pp. 221-24 ) . Lamarck ( 1809 ) suggested a similar theory and explained the alteration of ' species as being due to the effort of the species to adapt itself to its mode of living . Thus , on the Lamarckian theory , the long neck of the giraffe was produced by the efforts of an antelope-like ancestor to stretch up to higher and higher branches of the trees on the leaves of which it fed . This theory was not given serious consideration until the work of Charles Darwin revived interest in these problems . Charles Darwin Charles Darwin was born in ' Bog . He first intended to enter the medical profession , then the clergy , but after taking his degree at Cambridge almost at once joined the surveying expedition of the " Beagle " as naturalist . During this voyage he was struck by the extremely odd flora and fauna of oceanic islands , such as the Mauritius and Galapagos Islands , where perhaps three-quarters of the species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ species had evolved by descent from others , then the long-isolated population of these islands would be expected to be different from those of each other and the mainland , for external conditions on the island would differ from those of the other islands or the mainland , and evolution would not take the same course ; but on a doctrine of the separate creation of each species there seemed to be no reason why isolated islands should be provided with highly aberrant species , e.g. the dodo , the giant tortoise , etc . He was impressed by the fact that the recent fossils of a region were related to , but not identical with , the living animals of that region . The alterations that have come about in domesticated animals and plants likewise struck him forcibly . Man changes these species by selecting the animals or plants from which he wishes to breed , but what agency could be bringing about these changes  | under natural conditions ? Some light was thrown on this by the theories of T. R. Malthus , the economist . He laid down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometrical ratio but subsistence at best only in arithmetical ratio , so that the increase of population must , if unrestrained , be checked by want . Darwin realised that individual animals of the same species vary slightly , and all animals are producing vastly more offspring than survive to maturity : those that do survive will not be average specimens of the race , but will be those individuals best fitted to find food , escape their enemies , etc . The process by which the fit survive in preference to the less fit he termed natural selection . Darwin supposed that these variations were inherited , and that the survivors would therefore pass on their fitness ' to their descendants , who would therefore be fitter ' specimens than the average of the previous generations ; the whole species will therefore change in the direction of fitness ' , i.e. the possession of those qualities that enabled them to survive and produce offspring . Darwin developed the notion very slowly and cautiously , and in 1858 Alfred Russell Wallace reached the same conclusions . They did not quarrel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1859 Darwin published his Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection . Darwin claimed that the propositions put forward in this paragraph and given in his own words on pp. 226 ? 28 served to explain the development of the complex organs and instincts of animals by an accumulation of innumerable slight variations , each good ' for the individual . He brings strong evidence that species have in fact evolved , but he does not clearly prove that natural selection is the means of bringing about that evolution . He could not show that variations sufficiently large to be of use in bringing about survival did occur . or were inheritable : nor was it at all clear how a chance variation in an individual could fail to be swamped by interbreeding with other individuals in whom such variations were not present . Nevertheless Darwin 's theory made the whole world of living organisms into an intelligible pattern , a genealogical tree rooted in the primitive protozoon and extending to every present living type . It explained the fact that , e.g. all mammals ,  | or insects , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the wing of a bat , the flipper of a seal , the hand of a man , the hoof of a horse , though used for such diverse ends , are yet of the same pattern , a fact which was inexplicable on any theory other than that of the lineal descent of all these creatures from a common ancestor ; it explained likewise such strange phenomena as the existence of useless leg-bones within the body of a whale , and of fish-like gill-arches in the human foetus . The Study of Heredity The Darwinian case then depended on the " inheritance of the small variations " , and this was in fact unproven . The improvement in the theory of evolution came from a study of heredity . Weissmann ( 1882 ) attacked the doctrine of inheritance of acquired characters . Darwin had tentatively regarded inheritance as pangenesis , elements ' from the whole body uniting in the germ-cell : on this hypothesis any change in the body of an individual might alter its germ-cells and so be inherited . Weissmann regarded the germ-plasm as the permanent transmissible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Changes in the individual could not , he held , affect the germ-plasm . The next piece of important work ( earlier in time but later in effect ) was that of Mendel , abbot of the Augustinian monastery of Brunn in Moravia . His experiments were carried out in 1866-g , and attracted little or no attention . Mendel studied the inheritance of various characters in the culinary pea . He crossed round-seeded and crumpled-seeded peas ; green-pod and yellow-pod ; tall and dwarf ; and he found that there were hereditary factors , such as yellow-seededness ' , which were inherited as a whole and not in varying degrees . He postulated that corresponding to every inherited character there are determinants or factors ( now called genes ) in the gametes . Each individual has a double set of factors , and the character of the offspring will depend on whether it has none , one or two of these. ; Mendel 's work was not given the attention until the year 1899 when Bateson rediscovered these phenomena , only to find himself partly anticipated . From 1910 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were localised portions of the chromosomes of the cells , and it followed that evolution must involve changes in these genes . Such changes have been brought about experimentally , e.g. by X-ray treatment , and it is quite clear that alterations in the chromosomes ( and therefore genes ) produce variations that breed true . ' It has also been made clear , that changes in the chromosomes do occur without any known cause and give rise to variations in individuals , which may be great or small , advantageous or otherwise ( e.g. hwmophilia ) . The present view , then , is that mutations in the germ-plasm do occur , by the operation of some unknown causes . These mutations are inherited and may be carried by individuals who do not display their characters . Thus a new mutation occurring naturally is not swamped by crossing with those that do not possess it , but rather spreads to their progeny . If the results of the mutation are disadvantageous , the individuals that carry it will be removed by the Darwinian process of natural selection : if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What is not clear is ( a ) how a separate species not breeding with other species is formed , ( b ) what agency produces the large number of mutations in the same direction which would be needed to produce a feather from a scale , or man 's brain from an ape 's . In absence of knowledge as to the mechanism of mutation it is unwise to be dogmatic . The Control of Life In the Middle Ages and earlier times man was aware of a general plan by which the mineral world was the support of the kingdom of plants , which in turn served to nourish the kingdom of animals , whose function was to feed and serve man , its culmination . Whether or no modern man believes this to be a deliberate design , he is rapidly carrying it to its ultimate limit , at which the surface of the globe will be a scientific and highly productive farm . Ever wider areas are being brought under cultivation . Air , water and the rocks are being converted into fertilisers , to nourish plants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be killed early in their highly arti-  | ficial lives to feed the increasing population of men . This increase of production has had its disasters . The invasion of Australia by the rabbit and prickly-pear , the creation of dustbowl ' conditions in the U.S.A. are the result of man 's imperfect knowledge of biology . Ecology , the study of the balance that prevails between species and which man upsets , makes it possible to restore such catastrophes and prevent others . But has man the right to destroy the wild , beautiful and cruel life of Nature , to exterminate some species and to convert others into passive meat-producers ? Science has no answer , for the word right ' is not found in its vocabulary . The Idea of Progress The idea of the evolution of species made a great stir in the world . At first there was intense opposition , due to the apparent conflict of the theory with the Book of Genesis ? especially with regard to the descent of man from an apelike ancestry : this gradually died down as men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and distinguished more carefully the descent of the body and the origin of the soul . On the other hand , the theory was welcomed in many quarters as contributory to the notion of Progress which was very dear to the Victorians . This notion of Progress had not been an effective one before the sixteenth century . The men of earlier times did not look on the future good of the human race in general as the end they sought to attain . It was quite clear to them that each man had an individual destiny and that his purpose was to serve God and by serving Him to attain everlasting blessedness . It was clear to them that the great men of the past were as great as or greater than those of their own age , and if the habits of life of the fifteenth century were more polished than those of the eighth , so much the worse for the men of the fifteenth century who had turned their minds from God to run after country houses , with carpets on the floor , glass in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the sixteenth century this attitude persisted : the Elizabethans might pride themselves on a superiority in manners to a rude ancestry , but they counted  | themselves greatly inferior to the worthies of Greece and Rome . When , however , the ancient science came to be cried down by Bacon , Galileo , Descartes and others , and the new scientific discoveries were seen to be something useful which no previous age had possessed , there came into being the notion that man was progressing . The power of man to provide himself with what he wanted was obviously growing , and his knowledge was rapidly increasing in volume and certainty . Material progress of that type there certainly was ; but more than this was claimed by the exponents of progress , notably in France . An Age of Reason was coming in . Men were no longer to be swayed by superstition ; they were to obey the natural promptings of good sense and reason , whereupon the iniquities of war , persecution , and crime , would disappear . The French revolution was felt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no need to tell how the subsequent course of events threw doubt on the power of reason to control man 's passions and their expression in action . Parallel with this movement in France was a different one in England , where utilitarianism came into fashion . Reason again was the mistress , but instead of being manifest in pure science and philosophical ethics as in France , it was of an industrial and practical turn . The greatest good of the greatest number was preached . Wealth was to increase through production and cheapening of goods . If a few tens of thousands of workers starved ? well , it was just an incident in progress towards prosperity . The cotton-mills , steam-engines , gas-light , steamships , balloons ? the swelling tide of new discovery gave the English a powerful sensation of progress towards a blessed state of prosperity , education and peace ; and this is true even of the ' forties when the country was suffering extremes of famine and disease , which fell , however , chiefly upon the unexpressive poor . Yet even the oppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was coming ; thus the works of Karl Marx and Engels , who were young at this period , show a belief that man would progress to a perfected individual and social way of life . The prosperity which followed on the Great Exhibition of I85I renewed the certainty of progress , and it was in this  | atmosphere that Darwin concocted and finally launched his theory of Evolution . The idea of continual change for the better was there already ; for any voluntary change is thought by self-deluded man to be progress inasmuch as it is the realisation of what he thinks desirable . Here , then , was Darwin , presenting the whole history of the world in a form that could be conceived of as a continuous perfecting of living creatures , the crown of all being Man , who was presumably still evolving to a greater perfection . Laplace 's nebular theory ( pp. 240 ? 42 ) had given a picture of formless gas evolving to the complex solar system : this with Darwin 's theory of Evolution painted on a huge canvas the scientific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from formless gas to Queen Victoria ? and so onward to the super-man of the future . The whole world seemed to be undergoing a ceaseless process of change , transforming the simple and mindless into the complex and intelligent . Small wonder that when doubt was being cast on the foundations of Christianity , this vast plan was made the foundation of a religious philosophy or at least a system of ethics . The influential writer in this field was Herbert Spencer , whose writings covered the half-century 1850 ? 1900 . He was the inventor of the word Evolution and of the phrase " survival of the fittest " . According to Spencer the universe oscillated between Evolution towards the higher ( which was the more complex ) and Dissolution which was the opposite process . Evolutionary ethics would seem to indicate that everyone should take steps to ensure his own survival : this Spencer humanised by the argument that living beings must ( on pain of extinction ) take pleasure in actions that conduce to their survival . Good conduct , therefore , is that which is conducive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so adjusted that each attains his happiness without impeding that of others . All this is somewhat remote from the biological theory of the evolution of species , but the fact remains that the scientific Victorians felt themselves to be in a state of very rapid progress to something higher , without being able to define clearly what was higher and what was not . When the turn of the century came the idea of a Law of Progress seemed more doubtful , and the war of 1914 ? 18 gave it a  | blow from which it had not staggered to its feet before the events of the ' thirties and ' forties gave it what may be its death-blow . But popular beliefs are long a-dying , and this generous faith in progress is still abroad , especially in the U.S.A. and U.S.S.R. , which have been undergoing a process of expansion and increasing prosperity very like that of Victorian England . It is as well therefore to analyse the idea of progress a little further , and especially to distinguish between the progress of species as a result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a result of man 's thought and effort . Some Victorians took the Darwinian point of view and supposed that man himself was progressing . The highest type of man , who wore a collar and carried an umbrella , lived a healthier life and had families of whom more survived , than the lower and obviously undesirable , dirty , and immoral poor . Therefore the former would tend to survive and to transmit to his offspring the qualities that had enabled him to bring them up so well . All that looks very different now . In the first place we are not at all sure what qualities we should regard as those whose increase would constitute progress in man . But if they are intelligence , thrift , imagination , etc. , it is quite clear that in fact the conspicuous possessors of these qualities are bringing up fewer children than anyone else , and so are presumably on the road to extinction . Fortunately , however , we do not regard the matter as so simple ; and we have little doubt that any social section , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of subnormal intellects ) , will yield very much the same heredity . Secondly , we realise that while the breeding of new human varieties , i.e. reshuffling of hereditary factors , is possible in theory ( though excessively difficult to bring about in practice ) true evolution is exceedingly slow ; and we have no evidence that man 's central nervous system has altered by a trace in fifty thousand years . We do not know where Homo Sapiens came from , and we have no reason to suppose he is changing more or more rapidly than the cat or the candytuft , nor do we know what chain of events could lead to the production of a Homo Sapientior . It is true that Evolution , broadly viewed , shows a  | progress from " amoeba " to man , but it equally shows a progress from amoeba to shark or amoeba to hook-worm , to name three of the most flourishing organisms . There is no reason to put man at the top of the evolutionary tree unless we make the arbitrary choice of brain or mind as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biologists , brain or mind has been evolved , because it paid in survival value : if brain or mind operates against survival or fertility , the . evolutionist must suppose that it will die out in a period of geological time . It follows then that if we are to make evolution our criterion of progress we are not enlisting under the standard of mind but of multiplication and self-preservation , for that is the only way it can lead us . That there is a progress associated with modern man is perfectly clear . It is not a progress in the native faculties of the babies born ( which evolution would bring about if it operated ) but a progress in the variety and extent of knowledge and power open to them as they develop and mature . Man remains the same , but he continually develops the means of equipping , his brain and enabling his ideas to have practical effect . Science is cumulative ; everything that each age discovers remains for all ages , and consequently man is receiving an ever greater birth-right of power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spectacle of the world to-day is the clearest demonstration of this danger . The power of the man of 1990 will exceed that of 1940 , to a greater extent than that of 1940 exceeded that of 189o ? before the automobile , electrical supply and aeroplane : history , moreover , gives us reason to suspect that the ability of the unscrupulous to sway man 's passions will be no whit abated . If civilisation is to survive it must discover , adopt , and enforce , an absolute ethical standard . Such a standard is to be found in religion , and it has not been found elsewhere . It is true that at no period of human history has religion been able to restrain more than a part of the world 's wickedness , but it is conceivable that if some of the efforts we have devoted to persuading men to buy luxuries were devoted to trying to persuade them to behave as Christians , a public opinion might be built  | up capable of restraining the excesses that now threaten to destroy us . Man is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that science has proved that he is no more than that . Let the nature of scientific reasoning and evidence be understood ; and its conclusions be applied to the material realm to which alone they are relevant ; then the peculiar eminence of man and the excellence of the good of which he is capable will be once more apparent . The way will then be open for a true consideration of man as organism , as mind , and as soul , from which true consideration will emerge standards of conduct , true , wise , and in the highest sense human , because divine . Examples on Evolutionary Theories JAMES HUTTON PROVES THE EARTH 'S ANTIQUITY To sum up the argument , we are certain , that all the coasts of the present continents are wasted by the sea , and constantly wearing away upon the whole ; but this operation is so extremely slow , that we can not find a measure of the quantity in order to form an estimate : therefore , the present continents of the earth , which we consider as in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the globe , require a time indefinite for their destruction . But , in order to produce the present continents* the destruction of a former vegetable ' world was necessary ; consequently the production of our present continents must have required a time which is indefinite . In like manner , if the former continents were of the same nature as the present , it must have required another space of time , which also is indefinite , before they had come to their perfection as a vegetable world ... . The result , therefore , of this physical inquiry is , that we find no vestige of a beginning , + no prospect of an end . ( Theory of the Earth . James Hutton. 1795 . ) Footnote  | ERASMUS DARWIN ON THE RELATION OF SPECIES It is to be noticed that Erasmus Darwin has advanced evidence for the fact of evolution , but no theory of its mechanism . " Secondly , when we think over the great changes introduced into various animals by artificial or accidental cultivation , as in horses , which we have exercised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying burthens or in running races ; or in dogs , which have been cultivated for strength and courage , as the bull-dog ; or for acuteness of his sense of smell , as the hound and spaniel ; or for the swiftness of his foot as the greyhound ; or for his swimming in the water , or for drawing snowsledges , the rough-haired dogs of the north ; . . . and add to these the great changes of shape and colour , which we daily see produced in smaller animals from our domestication of them , as rabbits , or pidgeons ; or from the difference of climates , and even of seasons ; thus the sheep of warm climates are covered with hair instead of wool ; and the hares and partridges of the latitudes which are long buried in snow , become white during the winter months ; .. . " Fourthly , when we revolve in our minds the great similarity of structure which obtains in all the warm-blooded animals , as well as quadrupeds , birds and amphibious animals , as in mankind ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; one is led to conclude , that they have alike been produced from a similar living filament. * In some this filament in its advance to maturity has acquired hands and fingers , with a fine sense of touch , as in mankind . In others it has acquired claws or talons . . . in others toes with an intervening web or membrane ... in others it has acquired cloven hoofs . . . and whole hoofs in others . . . while in the bird kind this original living filament has put forth wings instead of arms or legs , and feathers instead of hair . In some it has protruded horns on the forehead instead of teeth in the fore part of the upper jaw ; in others tushes instead of horns ; and in others beaks instead of either . And all this exactly is daily seen in the transmutations of the Footnote  | tadpole , which acquires legs and lungs when he wants them ; and loses his tail when it is no longer of service to him . " Fifthly , from their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , all animals undergo perpetual transformations , which are in part produced by their own exertions in consequence of their desires and aversions , of their pleasures and pains , or of irritations , or of associations ; and many of these acquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity . " As air and water are supplied to animals in sufficient profusion , the three great objects of desire , which have changed the forms of many animals by their exertions to gratify them , are those of lust , hunger and security . A great want of one part of the animal world had consisted in the desire of the exclusive possession of the females ; and these have acquired weapons to combat each other for this purpose , as the very thick , shield-like , horny skin on the shoulder of the boar is a defence against only animals of his own species , who strike obliquely upwards , nor are his tushes for other purposes , except to defend himself ; as he is not naturally a carnivorous animal . So the horns of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ branched for the purpose of parrying or receiving the thrusts of horns similar to his own , and have , therefore , been formed for the purpose of combating other stags for the exclusive possession of the females ; who are observed , like the ladies in the time of chivalry , to attend the car of the victor . " The birds which do not carry food to their young , and do not therefore marry , are armed with spurs for the purpose of fighting for the exclusive possession of the females , as cocks and quails . It is certain that these weapons are not provided for their defence against other adversaries , because the females of these species are without this armour . The final cause of this contest amongst the males seems to be , that the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species , which should thence become improved . " Another great want consists in the means of procuring food , which has diversified the forms of all species of animals . Thus the nose of the swine had become hard for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insects and of roots . The trunk of the  | elephant is an elongation of the nose for the purpose of pulling down the branches of trees for his food , and for taking up water without bending his knees . Beasts of prey have acquired strong jaws or talons . Cattle have acquired a rough tongue and a rough palate to pull off the blades of grass .... Some birds have acquired harder beaks to crack nuts , as the parrot . Others have acquired beaks adapted to break the harder seeds , as sparrows . Others for the softer seeds of flowers , or the buds of trees , as the finches . Other birds have acquired long beaks to penetrate the moister soils in search of insects or roots , as woodcocks , and others broad ones to filtrate the water of lakes , and to retain aquatic insects . All which seem to have been gradual y produced during many generations by the perpetual endeavour of the creatures to supply the want of food , and to have been ' delivered to their posterity with constant improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great want among animals is that of security , which seems much to have diversified the forms of their bodies and the colour of them ; these consist in the means of escaping other animals more powerful than themselves . Hence some animals have acquired wings instead of legs , as the smaller birds , for the purpose of escape ; others great length of fin or of membrane , as the flying fish and the bat . Others great swiftness of foot as the hare . Others have acquired hard or armed shells , as the tortoise and the echinus marinus . " The contrivances for the purposes of security extend even to vegetables , as is seen in the wonderful and various means of their concealing or defending their honey from insects , and their seeds from birds . On the other hand , swiftness of wing has been acquired by hawks and swallows to pursue their prey ; and a proboscis of admirable structure has been acquired , by the bee , the moth , and the humming bird for the purpose of plundering the nectaries of flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ original living filament , excited into action by the necessities of the creatures , which possess them , and on which their existence depends . " From thus meditating on the great similarity of the structure of the warm-blooded animals , and at the same time of the great changes they undergo both before and after their nativity ; and  | by considering in how minute a portion of time many of the changes of animals above described have been produced ; would it be too bold to imagine , that in the great length of time , since the earth began to exist , perhaps millions of ages before the commencement of the history of mankind , would it be too bold to imagine , that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from one living filament which the GREAT FIRST CAUSE endued with animality , with the power of acquiring new parts , attended with new propensities , directed by irritations , sensations , olitions , and associations ; and thus possessing the faculty of continuing to improve by its own inherent activity , and of delivering down those improvements by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Zoonomia . Erasmus Darwin , 1794 . ) LAMARCK 'S LAWS ' Lamarck supposed that species underwent change and that all were descended from a common ancestor . He regarded the kind and degree of use of the organs of the animal as the cause of its modification . First Law In every animal which has not passed the term of its development , a more frequent and sustained use of an organ , gradually strengthens that organ , develops it , enlarges it , and gives it a power proportionate to the duration of that use ; while the constant lack of use of such an organ , insensibly weakens it , worsens it , progressively diminishes its faculties and ends by causing it to disappear . Second Law All that nature has caused individuals to acquire or lose by the influence of the environment in which their race has been placed for a long period and consequently , by the influence of the predominant use of any organ or by that of a constant lack of use thereof : all this is preserved by reproduction for the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired are common to both sexes or at least to the individuals which produce the young . Note the difference from Darwin 's view . ( Philosophie Zoologique . Lamarck . 1809. pp. 234-5 . Translated as zoological Philosophy , by H. Elliot . 1914 . ) HUGH MILLER ARGUES AGAINST LAMARCK ... The setting dog is taught to set : he squats down and points at the game ; but the habit is acquired one , ? a mere trick of education . What , however , is merely acquired habit in the progenitor , is found to pass into instinct in the descendant ; the puppy of the setting-dog squats down and sets untaught. * .. . The woody plant of a warmer climate , when transplanted into a colder frequently exchanges its ligneous stem for a herbaceous one , as if in anticipation of the killing frosts of winter , and , dying to the ground at the close of autumn , shoots up again in spring . . . .
