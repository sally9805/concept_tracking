In a sunlit clearing on Belle Isle , between nonbelligerent Detroit and warring Canada , since last autumn there has been building a 90-ft. tower for a carillon dedicated to peace . It was conceived by a little old lady , Nancy Brown , aged 69 , and paid for by the nickels and dimes contributed by those who read her famed lovelorn column in the Detroit News ( TIME , Nov. 13 ) . <P> Every year since 1934 , at sunrise on Easter morning , Nancy Brown has sponsored a sunrise service on Belle Isle . Her readers , who flocked to the services in tens of thousands , heard preachers and speakers , but never were allowed a glimpse of her . With the fur collar of her coat turned up around her face , she mingled unnoticed among her admirers , for they had never even seen her picture . <P> Last week the Peace Carillon was unveiled at a sunrise dedication service on Belle Isle , and with it Nancy Brown was unveiled to her readers . Long before midnight , her audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tower . Detroit police estimated that 100,000 people turned out to wait for Nancy . <P> At 4:45 a.m. , as the sun rose over dewy treetops , the chimes pealed out Nearer , My God , to Thee . The climax of the two-hour service : when diminutive Nancy Brown stepped to the lectern , peeped over and in a tremulous voice spoke to her readers for the first time ( see cut ) .
