Liquor Question <P> Sirs : <P> My thanks to you for your honest reporting of the W.C.T.U. situation in this country . The spectacle of this group trying to exploit our national crisis to enforce prohibition again is to me a nauseating one . <P> At present there are five men in my family in the armed services , the majority of them having enlisted . . . . There is n't one who would drink while on duty , who would drink while driving a car , or who likes to drink and roll in the gutter . But on their occasional weekends home , they have certainly earned the right to relax as they wish and they will certainly find a drink waiting for them in my home . I 'll go further and state that regardless of the success achieved by the W.C.T.U. , these men will always find a drink waiting for them in my home . . . . <P> Let 's clamp down on the dirty dives ; let 's crack down harder on drunken drivers ; let 's ration our remaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prohibition till the war is won and the boys are home to discuss it , too . <P> <P> EDITH L. THORNTON <P> Philadelphia , Pa . <P> Sirs : <P> We who are in the service are what the politicians love to refer to as " the flower of American manhood . " Maybe we are ; however , at the moment I do not feel much like a flower . . . . We are pretty well able to take care of ourselves and if not we at least do n't want Senator Bilgewater and Congressman Bafflebrain telling us when we can have a drink . . . . <P> G. A. MACARTHUR <P> Camp Sutton , N.C. <P> Sirs : <P> We have an 18-year-old in our bunch-the darling of the outfit . He 's the best soldier we have . The kid 's hard as nails . He has character , brains , personality-and more surplus energy than anyone I 've ever known . Like all 18-year-olds , he 's up against the problems of women and liquor . A flat " No " certainly is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage for any youngster . And I do n't think prohibition is making it easier for him to work it out for himself . <P> Our field is in the center of a 100-mile-square dry area . Translated into practical terms , this means the Army drinks $3-a-pint rotgut . . . . <P> My young friend is a sergeant pilot-making $144 a month . He can afford the bootleg liquor . So he 's not learning to drink beer or good whiskey on his nights off-but to drink rotgut straight . As he told me this morning , amid groans , " the stuff tastes so terrible , the only thing you can do is to get drunk as quick as possible so you ca n't taste it . " . . . <P> This letter is , of course , prompted by the resurgence of the powerful dry lobby , and especially its efforts to force prohibition upon the areas surrounding Army posts . I wonder if the much-spoken-for " Mothers of America " really want their 18-and 19-year-old sons to come home used to drinking the cheapest liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think it 's sacrilege to include moderation in drinking as part of the American way . ... At the very least , it 's a damn dirty trick to play on us while we 're away . . . .
