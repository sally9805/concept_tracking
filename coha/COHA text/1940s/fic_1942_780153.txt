 | we should be glad to hear from you . The good wishes of all of us " ? she included Jason and Estelle by a gesture ? " go with you . Dr. Helder took her extended hand and pressed it , spoke for a moment to the children , said goodbye again , and went below . Abigail Carfax gathered her children to her , and crossed the gangplank . Ashore , she found a carriage , and when the luggage was fastened on , and she was seated with the children , she gave the driver the address , that of her brother Henry , with whom she expected to stay for a ' few days . " What big buildings  --  and they are stone ! " exclaimed Estelle , gazing about her in wonder . All the buildings in her experience had been the Persian houses of sun-dried brick and low , flat roofs . " Would n't Father like to see all this ! " Their father had seen all this , yet not all this . Abigail Carfax herself was amazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here were new buildings on every hand , buildings in process of construction , and excavations for buildings to be constructed . Though she had been told that great growth had been taking place , she was hardly prepared for a city that had doubled in population since she left it thirteen years before , and all the crowding and activity which such growth meant . As they wound their way in and out of the traffic , the driver pointed out to them the newer structures . " That 's the McAleny block , ma'am , " he said , pridefully , flicking his whip toward a long granite structure of five stories height , with dormer windows along the roof . " That was built by Sam McAleny . He came over here a penniless Irish immigrant less than twenty years ago , and look at him now ! Owns real estate all over Boston . Expects to be on the Council next election , I hear . A great fellow , he is . And that  --  that 's one of the new public schools . We got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here in Boston , ma'am . Thinkin ' of stayin ' here long ? There 's fine children you have , ma'am . They 'd be a credit to any school . " The driver rambled on , describing this wonder and that , of the Hub of the Universe , as Boston was beginning to be called by its proud-hearted citizens . He did not appear to be one of those upon whom wonders had befallen , being a weatherbeaten , grizzle-haired old fellow , with none too much flesh on him , dressed in a long wrap-around coat of brown denim , of the cut of a warehouseman 's apron coat , badly worn , and probably cast off by some more prosperous workman ; but he pointed out the sights with as much pride as though he were the owner of a dozen granite blocks the size of McAleny 's . Abigail Carfax observed Jason gazing moodily into the distance . " Are you glad to be ashore again ? " she asked , smiling . " I would rather be at sea , " the boy answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are lots of interesting things yet to see , " said Abigail Carfax , hopefully . Ahead of them a dense column of smoke rose into the air , and moved to the accompaniment of a great chugging and roaring . " What 's that ? " asked Jason , suddenly alive and excited . " That ? " answered the driver . " That 's the Boston &; Maine train coming in . The station is just ahead , in Haymarket . " " Trains ! Locomotives ! " exclaimed Jason eagerly , who had read about such things in the books which his parents had been able to obtain for him . " Can we see them , Mother ? " " You 'll see plenty of them , " nodded the driver , contentedly . " A half-dozen lines enter the city now . A new line is to be opened next year , they say , across to New York State to connect with the lines to Chicago and the Great West . They 're marvelous  | contraptions . They 're the pillar of cloud by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribes of this generation go wandering in the wilderness and getting nowhere . They should stay in Boston . There 's all the world in Boston . " " Lots of people are going to California , " the driver went on to explain . " Last year , you would have thought half the town was moving out to California , but they got their heads , and knowed that as much was to be gained by staying here . " " Take us by the Common , " Abigail Carfax directed . It was not on the way to her brother 's , but she wanted the children to see it . The children craned their necks to see the many things their self-appointed guide showed them  --  the old State House , and Fancuil Hall , the new State House on Beacon Hill , with its resplendent dome , and finally the Common . They were stupefied at the last . Never had they seen such green grass , such mab nificent , broad-spreading elms , such display of gardens . In Persia , green grass that lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert would be covered with a green mould , which would disappear after a few weeks under the brilliant sun and rainless days . Gardens there were also , pleasant gardens , filled with a tangled profusion of flowers and fruits , but they , like so many lovely things of the land , were hidden behind high mud walls , and fortunate was he who was privileged to view them . As for the trees , which grew along the watercourses , they might be seen , but mostly they peered from over the tops of the walls like prisoners gazing from their bars into the free world without . What a contrast was here ! Before them , a great sweep of lawn , and many trees , and flower gardens  --  all for public enjoyment , for any to walk among who chose . It was incredible ! It pleased Abigail Carfax to see the children so delighted . She  | was delighted herself . For the moment , she was glad to be home . And she breathed deep , thinking of the walls she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fields , the walls about the spirit , enclosing walls of sun-dried mud , confining walls of age-dried tradition and custom . And then , suddenly she was fearful again , with the fear of a bird that has been released from a cage and trembles on a branch , frightened at the great spaces about it . And , uneasily , she thought of the Firedrake , with its warm bright eyes upon her  --  ready to seize upon her the moment she attempted flight ... . II Abigail Carfax 's brother , Henry Littlefield , to whom she went on her arrival in Boston , lived with his wife in a shabby section of the North End , rapidly being turned into a slum by the crowding of European immigrants . He was not at home when Abigail Carfax arrived ; the driver helped her and the children down , and set the luggage on the stoop . The door presently opened to Abigail 's knocking , and a slight , narrow-featured woman , with lackluster eyes and somewhat unkempt appearance , showed herself . " Agatha ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The two women embraced . " I suppose these are Jason and Estelle , " said Agatha Littlefield . " Come in . Henry would ' a ' been to meet you , but he could n't leave the office . He 's late now . " " Oh , I 'm so happy to see you , " exclaimed Abigail Carfax . " We found our way all right . We had the nicest driver  --  showed the children so many interesting things about Boston . My , but how the city has changed . I could hardly believe my eyes . "  | " Yes , a lot of changes , " said Agatha non-committally . " But I do n't know whether it 's all for the good . Come , and I 'll show you where you may stay . " Henry Littlefield arrived shortly before dinner . He was a thin man , wore glasses , and was dressed in the neat , respectable and economical manner of a clerk who on a small salary must reflect the prosperity of his employers . Like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , the look of a man who has been ambitious for success , unsuccessful in his ambitions , and inclined to blame the world for his failure . " Ah , it 's good to see you again , sister , " he said to Abigail , kissing her on the cheek ; and to Jason and Estelle , " How d'ye do , young man , and you , young lady ? " but without embracing them , or even shaking hands . When they were seated in the parlor , he made awkward inquiry as to his sister 's health , and of his brother-in-law , and of the journey home . " What 's it like out in Persia ? " he asked presently . " Do they have railroads out there yet ? " " Oh , no , no railroads , " replied Abigail Carfax . " We went in and came out by carriage . In his trips up into the hill country , Martin goes by horseback . Then they use camels to carry goods long distances , such as the rugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the villages comes in by queues of mules or donkeys . " " In town , " she added , " porters may be used for short distances . The porters will carry heavy loads upon their backs , as much as three hundred pounds , and even four hundred by some . " " It 's a pretty backward country , I take it . " " Oh , yes , mechanically they have nothing . It 's a civilization built on handicraft . But their rugs are beautiful , as you know . We have brought you a small one as a souvenir of our home . I  | think you would enjoy also their poetry . Almost any porter can recite verses to you . " " Probably should be tending to making a living , instead of learning poetry , " Henry commented . " That 's very thoughtful of you to bring us a present . " Abigail Carfax began to tell about the gardens , which were quite lovely . " You mean to say you have a garden in your own yard , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Abigail 's sister-in-law exclaimed enviously . It was apparent , from her look , that she thought a missionary 's life was not so hard after all . Abigail Carfax explained that unless one had gardens of one 's own , one never saw flowers , because of the walls . Outside of the city , she added , stretched barren desert , except for the oases in the foothills , and these , too , had their walls about them . Only for a few weeks of spring , she said , was nature generous , and then for a moment the desert blossomed , but soon summer came , and it reverted to its somber yellowness . Her sister-in-law , however , could not seem to grasp all this , and Abigail felt that a little barrier had arisen between them . " You mentioned traveling by horseback , " Henry said . " Did you ride horseback ? " His tone was somewhat disapproving . " Tell Uncle Henry about the time you rode up into the hills to find Father , " Jason prompted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lost , and she had gone in search of him . It was an extraordinary thing for a woman to do in Persia , and even Martin had slightly reproved her for having attempted it . She hesitated now to tell her brother about it , and fortunately he did not seem interested in hearing , for suddenly he turned to his wife , as though he had forgotten something , and remarked :  | " Agathy , cotton went up fourteen points today . I told you we should have held on to it . " " Well , maybe so , but I 'd rather be sure of the roof over my head than have a chance on all the gold in Californy . " She excused herself to put on the dinner . " Ca n't I help you , Agatha ? " said Abigail Carfax , rising . " No , thank ye , there ai n't so much as to make it necessary . Seat yourself , and be at home . " Her words were not unkind , or unappreciative , but they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that she had grown unused to such work , which in Persia was required by custom to be given to servants . " I never could see why they spent all that money trying to convert the heathen , " ruminated Henry , aloud . " I know Pa was always talking about missions , and raising money for them , but I never could see it , when there 's so much needing to be done here . Times have n't been too good . " When they went in to dinner , it became apparent that Henry was appalled at the thought of entertaining so numerous a company for any length of time . " D'yc expect to be in Boston long , sister ? " he asked pointedly , while serving the children , and noting their healthy appetites . " I have been planning to take a house here in Boston , brother , " Abigail Carfax replied . " I want the children to be well schooled ? they have missed so much being away  --  and no place has the schools that Boston has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's expensive here , " replied Henry . " It 's terribly hard for a man to get ahead these days . Now , take a little piece of butter like that  --  it costs at least a penny . " " Is that a lot of money , Mother ? " asked Jason , unfamiliar with American coinage . Abigail Carfax colored.  | " No , no , not much , " answered Henry , hastily . " Help yourself , my boy . " The invitation , if well meant , was not cordial , and Estelle , who also wished more butter , set the dish down without taking any . " It 's not a little dab of butter , " explained Agatha Littlefield , seeing her husband 's error , but rushing to his support . " It 's just that everything is expensive these days . Prices keep going up , and Henry do n't make no more than he did five years ago . Yet everybody talks about good times , and prosperity . I do n't understand . " " I keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but somehow I just ca n't get connected , " complained Henry . He was referring to the numerous co-operative communities , which , under the influence of men like Robert Owen , had sprung up in New England . " I do n't dare even mention the idea , " he went on bitterly , " lest I lose my position . People say such things are contrary to our traditions , but I do n't see it . It 's the way we 're living now that is contrary to our traditions  --  everybody working for money , and business . The Pilgrims and the Puritans did n't come here to make money , they came to start a community of brotherly love . That was the tradition they gave us . But progress and prosperity is now proclaimed the American way . " And where 's it all leading to ? Trouble . Have you read the Communist Manifesto ? Workers of the world , unite , ' it says . You have nothing to lose but your chains . ' And I think it 's right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America , and it is n't only of the slaves  --  it 's those that work in the boot factories at Lowell , and in the cotton and woolen mills , and  --  respectable clerks like myself . "  | Abigail Carfax felt sorry for her brother . She remembered how as a boy he had grown restless about going to school , and how finally her father had allowed him to quit and go to work , and later with what self-assurance he had announced that he was going to Boston " to seek his fortune . " She was nine years old at the time , but it returned to her very clearly , as one of the memories of childhood , how she had watched him mount the stage , and wave to her goodbye , and how proud she had been of him , of having a big brother who " lived in Boston . " During the next few years word would come at intervals of the progress he was making , of better pay and promotion , and then suddenly he would have a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somehow it meant less pay or some other disadvantage ? " only temporary , of course . " Abigail had always thought of it as very exciting , to be doing so many different things , though she remembered that her father had shaken his head over these frequent changes , and had remarked to her once , that " Henry is too restless , he should settle down to a task . " " I read the Communist Manifesto , " Abigail said gently . " A German living in Salamat thought Martin would be interested in it  --  for there is a great deal of oppression of peasants and workers in Persia  --  not to mention women . But Martin said that the world would never be saved by such means as Marx advocates . " " flow can he say so ! " exclaimed Henry determinedly . " It 's only by a revolution , by the working classes rising and asserting their might , that we 'll ever improve things . " Abigail Carfax thought no purpose would be served by arguing the question . Passing years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be bridged in an evening , and discussion would probably only widen the gulf the farther . Instead , she asked about South Oaks , and men-  | tioned that she wished to lay some flowers on the graves of their parents . She thought that , as the next day was Sunday , Henry might wish to go with her . " It 's a long ways out , " Henry demurred , " and very expensive . They have n't as yet run a railroad any nearer than Haverly , and you have to take the coach from there . Besides , I have some work to do that I did n't get done at the office . " Abigail Carfax was willing to defer her going to a later date , but Henry showed no enthusiasm about accompanying her , nor did Agatha , and she concluded , with some disappointment , to go alone with the children . III Very early Sunday morning , Abigail Carfax set out with the children to visit her childhood home in South Oaks . Now that it was possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a stage from Haverly to South Oaks , if good connections were made , the whole trip would not take much more than two hours . Jason and Estelle were thrilled at the opportunity to ride in a train , and while they talked excitedly about the adventure , of the speed with which they were whirled along , of the luxury of the car  --  a wood stove in the middle gave off a pleasant warmth against the chill of the early morning  --  and of the sights to be seen from the car window , Abigail gave herself over to her thoughts . She did not expect a great deal from her visit to South Oaks : she had left the town at seventeen , when she married , and for ten years , since her father 's death , she had had no communication with anyone there . South Oaks had never been a place to hold her affections : it was one of those communities , so characteristic of New England , in which the atmosphere is pervaded  | by a sense of discipline and destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up there , might feel repressed , as though confined in a windowless room , and long for a larger world , and a greater freedom . Most of the young men of South Oaks went elsewhere to seek their fortunes , so many , that spinsterhood was prevalent , and gave a certain characteristic to society : an inclination to gossip , a tendency to security and comfort , a rigidness of convention , and an emphasis upon propriety . Yet for all that the community itself had ceased to mean anything for her , Abigail Carfax looked forward to her visit . Partly because of the disappointment at the reception given her by her brother , and partly from the loneliness that was creeping over her and the desire to attach herself to a familiar experience , these scenes , so abruptly abandoned , so long forgotten , now lured her like a structure of dreams . She saw them in her mind 's eye  --  the valley , with its mixture of woodland and pasture and ploughed ground , and the white-painted farmhouses in their groves ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the steeple of the South Oaks church  --  of which her father had been pastor  --  rising austerely above the mass and catching the sunlight on its spire ; and especially the oak-lined main street that ran by the common  --  a majestic thoroughfare it seemed in memory , though all that ever coursed it were farm wagons , the post chaise , and the carriages of the village merchants . For the moment she wondered , as the train rolled on , whether she would not do better to take up lodgings in a simpler environment , such as South Oaks offered , rather than in Boston . . . . Abigail Carfax was desperately eager to recapture the mood of her youth , the enthusiasm and abandon with which she had embarked upon marriage and the career of a missionary , as well as the sense of freedom and independence which , in retrospect , it seemed that she had enjoyed as a girl ... .  | Since she had started home  --  in Constantinople , in fact , when ( ruin the hotel window she had watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so gracefully , so much the essence of the freedom of the New World  --  she had begun to think of what she had been deprived all these years . This feeling of deprivation arose , she knew , because she was tired . Life in Persia , for all its many compensations of charm and loveliness , had not been easy , and always , everywhere , there hung about her the suffocating atmosphere of the wall and the veil . Distance and the irregularity of the mails had practically compelled her to give up communication with people in America , and she had never succeeded in making close friendships with Persian women , who seemed incapable  --  no doubt because of their traditional seclusion  --  of the freedom , the openness , and frankness which friendship demands . Seeing the open fields from the car window , and the orchards , feathered with fresh green , recalled to Abigail Carfax another spring day when she made her first visit to a Persian haremlik . It was the house of Farman-i-Dowleh , a wealthy nobleman noted for his piety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the maximum permitted by the Koran , and a numerous household of concubines , serving women , daughters , and daughtersin-law , all acknowledging him as their lawful master but yielding actual obedience to the Fatmah khanum , eldest of his wives , and the absolute mistress of the haremlik . The greater number of these women were collected , on Abigail Carfax 's visit , to do honor to the foreign lady , and to examine at close range the manners and attitude of a woman who enjoyed a place equal to that of her husband . When Abigail Carfax saw these women about her , seated on rugs and cushions , looking at her with lack-luster eyes , now filled with a pathetic eagerness to meet the foreign woman and to hear  | of foreign lands ; as she observed their sallow faces , pale from want of sunshine ; their infantile conversation , devoid of wit , unilluminated by knowledge or experience ; their preoccupation with unguents , cosmetics , and love philters to attract the attention of the only male into whose presence they were admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of anything that happened beyond the garden walls ; their fascination of gossip in lieu of things of the mind  --  when Abigail Carfax saw all this , she returned home with such a loathing , such a horror for the lot of women in Persia , that she was almost ill . There had been other veils and walls to suffocate the spirit of one used to the freer atmosphere of the West  --  those of the restraints and interdictions imposed upon childhood . After Jason and Estelle were born , being a missionary had ceased to be a crusade and life became a desperate struggle to maintain the atmosphere of her home and defend it from deadening beliefs and traditions . Persian children were taught to be sedate . In the presence of their elders they would stand with their hands respectfully clasped in front of them in the way their elders stood in the presence of their superiors . Abigail Carfax wanted no such attitudes . She wanted Jason and Estelle to have the same sense of freedom and independence which she had had as a child . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carfax spent a great deal of time devising games for Jason and Estelle that would keep their imaginations awake , and in telling them stories that would stir up their moods and widen their interests . Even so , her efforts had not been entirely successful , and the children , Jason especially , were more diffident and restrained than she thought wholesome . There was something else , also , that had at times been like a cloud upon her spirit , which she had not recognized at first and which she hesitated even now to admit and call by name . This  | was the matter of her husband 's attitudes . Somehow he had never seemed to be affected by the repressions , the walls , the veils , the suffocating traditions which so oppressed her . She thought sometimes that he even looked upon them with equanimity , and that he believed in a certain amount of restraint as salutary . Discipline was very important to Martin . A favorite theme of his was a phrase of St. Paul 's , " bondage in Christ . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although he preached any number of sermons on the subject . " Take my yoke upon you " was another . " Be ye fellow-sufferers " was a third . It was not until they were on the mission field that she learned how large a part these themes played in Martin 's attitudes and philosophy . It had also been something of a shock for her to realize that Martin had accepted the call to the mission field in this spirit , rather than as a challenge to a crusade , as it had been with her . She had never doubted the correctness of Martin 's views ; she had only wished she could understand them better , for the perplexing thing about them was that for all his talk of " submission " and " resignation , " he seemed to enjoy greater freedom than she did , and never seemed to be depressed by the tasks that faced him in his work . Martin , indeed , had been a wall to her , a wall of defense against discouragement , and doubt , and loneliness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be too much a wall , which gave her spirit security , but which also had softened its fiber and enfeebled her courage . She needed courage now ; she needed to regain the urgent , adventurous mood of her youth . . . . At Haverly they got down from the train and changed to a stage-coach for the short distance to South Oaks . Haverly she did not recognize . It had grown up since the railroad came through , and was a busy forwarding point . The road to South  | Oaks also was unfamiliar : a wide macadamized thoroughfare , which for a Sunday morning seemed to be unduly heavy with traffic . It began to dawn on Abigail Carfax , as the stage rumbled into South Oaks , that changes had taken place here also . " Is this Oak Street ? " she inquired of the driver , when he had set her and the children down at the postoffice . " Yes , ma'am , " the driver reassured her . " But . . . where are the oaks ? " Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of trees that had been one of the beauty points of the town . " They cut ' em down four or five years ago , ma'am , when they widened the road . " " But was that necessary ? " " Seems so , ma'am , though they were mighty pretty . But this is the main road to Haverly , and all the freight from the valley goes along here now . " It was evident that the same onward rush of progress that was sweeping over Boston , and flowing out from Boston along all the railway lines , had inundated South Oaks , leaving visible little that was familiar . Abigail Carfax sensed uneasily that her visit to her childhood home would be as disappointing as her meeting with Henry . From the postoffice to the church was but a short walk . Abigail Carfax was surprised to see how small the church had become , which before had been to her little less than a cathedral . The doorway had grown narrower , the windows small , and the spire low and insignificant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the church , but the sanctuary was no more than half full . Abigail Carfax learned later that it was the fashion now , for those who had the means , to drive to Haverly for services , to the new brick church that had been built there . A hymn  | was being sung , and Abigail Carfax took up the hymn book . The hymn was : My Lord , how full of sweet content I pass my years of banishment Where e'er I dwell , I dwell with Thee , In heaven , in earth , or on the sea . Abigail Carfax was unable to sing . Song was not in her heart . Her mood was one of rebellion . She wanted to go outside and cry . The services continued , and finally after a long and dreary sermon came to a close . As they passed out of the church , Abigail Carfax recognized several persons in the congregation whom she remembered from childhood . Some of them glanced in her direction , but failed to see in the woman of thirty , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town so long before . She felt acutely that she no longer belonged here , that everything South Oaks had been to her as a child was gone from her now , and she hoped to escape without observation . Two old ladies , however , were approaching her with a look of recognition in their eyes . " Well , I declare , " one of them exclaimed , " if it is n't Abigail Littlefield . Laws , I never would have recognized ye . " She was a little weazened woman , and she leaned on a black , knotty stick . Her companion was even more weazened , and peered at Abigail Carfax through spectacles , while she cupped her free hand to her ear to hear the better . " Why , Miss Saverton , " exclaimed Abigail Carfax , suddenly pleased ? " and Miss Saverton . " " Ye been gone a right good while , have n't ye ? " the first Miss Saverton asked in her piping voice . " Let 's see . Your name is now ? ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should ' a ' remembered . Ye got married in quite a hurry , as I recollect . I remember , he came here one summer to work , and next thing we knew we were going to your wedding . For a preacher 's daughter , it was quite sudden , we all thought . " " Yes , but love comes suddenly , you know , " smiled Abigail Carfax . " Never did for me , " responded the old lady promptly . " These are our two children , " continued Abigail . " Miss Priscilla and Miss Amantha were next-door neighbors when I was a little girl . " " Yes , we were neighbors , " piped Miss Priscilla Saverton , while Miss Amantha Saverton cupped her ear again and leaned forward on her stick , a benign  --  but not too benign  --  smile on her wrinkled , pursed lips . " And we had to speak to ye right regularly for crossing our yard and sp'iling the grass . But then ye were a child then . Married , I declare . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was ? " " Carfax . " " Carfax . What does Mr. Carfax do for a living ? " " We arc missionaries . " " Missionaries ? Of course . I remember now . Ye 're in Africa , are n't ye ? " " No , Persia . " " Persia . I declare . Where 's Mr. ? Carfax ? " " He 's in Persia . " " I declare . Persia ? And you here ? Now , I do declare . " She gave Abigail Carfax a sharp , scrutinizing glance . " Well , well . . . Well , good-day , Mrs. ? Carfax . It 's been good to see ye again . Good-day , little boy , and to you , little girl . " The pair hobbled off , leaving Abigail Carfax following them with a look of mingled consternation and amusement .  | There was someone else who recognized her , a tall man with angular , sun-browned , and kindly features . " Benjamin ! " Abigail Carfax exclaimed , as she saw him approach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cobbler , Jonathan Bradford , and had sat next to Abigail for several years at school . Abigail had been exceptionally bright in her studies , and Benjamin had looked up to her with a worshipful admiration . The same look was in his eyes now . " South Oaks is still the same with you here , " Abigail Carfax said eagerly . " Yes , I 'm still here , " replied Mr. Bradford , awkwardly apologetic . He hesitated . " I thought some of going to California  --  I never married  --  but , " again he paused awkwardly , " I figured I could do as well here , and so I stayed . " " I am sure you made the wise choice , " Abigail Carfax said sympathetically . " The glamor of a far place too often proves to be no more than the shimmering of the sunlight over a desert . " " Maybe so , " responded Mr. Bradford doubtfully . " Price of leather been going up lately , however , and a lot of trade goes to Haverly now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late . Your children ? " " Oh  --  oh , yes . Jason , this is Mr. Bradford , and Estelle , Mr. Bradford . " " Well , I 'm pleased to see you , Abigail . It 's like old times , seeing you again , " said Mr. Bradford . He seemed to find nothing further to say , and moved away . " Well , good-day ... Abigail . " " Goodbye . " There were a few others , some who remembered her , but could not call her name , others who could call her name but could not for the life of them recall whether it was five years or  | twenty-five that she had been gone . Presently the church was empty , and Abigail Carfax was alone with her children . She went with them to the cemetery , which lay on the rising ground behind . Here , after some search , she found the graves of her parents . At the sight of the limestone slabs , she began to cry . . . . But it was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her loneliness , her feeling of utter desolation . Seeing her mother in tears , Estelle clutched her hand tightly to comfort her , and Abigail Carfax drew her to her bosom ... . IV The children had gone off to school . Abigail Carfax had just waved to them a last goodbye from the none-too-transparent window of their lodging in Channing Street ; they had returned the wave before they turned the corner into Federal ; and now Abigail Carfax was alone to put in the day as best she could . This is what they had left home for ; it was for this that they had traveled so many thousand miles , for this that Martin was staying alone in Salamat without sight of either wife or children ? surely she should not complain . But Abigail Carfax had had no idea it would be so hard . All their lives , until now , she had had the children about her . She had been not only mother to them , but school mistress as well , reading to them , telling them stories , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been broken . Yesterday was the first day of school , and she had gone with them as far as the school gate and had met them in the afternoon . But today Jason had protested that they knew the way and that , besides , the others would think they were afraid to go home by themselves . Yesterday afternoon , and during the evening , Jason and  | Estelle had talked of nothing but what they had learned in school ? " The teacher said this , " and " The teacher said that , " ? as though it were something newly discovered , although much of what the teacher had said was repetition of what they had already learned from their parents . Coming from the teacher gave the facts a new interest and a new authority , and Abigail Carfax realized , if not regretfully none the less poignantly , that she and Martin had ceased to be the fountainhead of wisdom for their children . The shock she experienced was like that one would feel on awakening from an illness and discovering that a limb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it all the harder to bear was to have to bear it alone and without compensating occupation . Had this occurred in Salamat , there would have been Martin to be with , and his work to help with . He was , among other things , translating the New Testament into Sevanli , and Abigail , because of her readiness with languages , had been of great help to him in checking references and working out doubtful renderings . There would have been , also , their little excursions to the bazaars , or to the Garden of Alwan , their favorite beauty spot . And there was also her household , which although under the able management of Baji Marta , her Armenian woman servant , at least took some of her time in superintending . Here , there was nothing to do . She had thought possibly that she might have a place of her own  --  even if she would have to do the housework , it would keep her occupied  --  though , of course , a house as spacious as the parsonage in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a garden so extensive as that of the mission compound , were luxuries she had hardly anticipated in Boston . It was something of a shock to discover what high rentals were asked . Her brother Henry had been right . On her home allowance the most she could afford was board and  | lodging , and after paying for that , there was little left for the small pleasures she had fancied when she thought of living in Boston  --  such as an evening at the Lyceum , or a drive along Western Avenue , or even a visit to Charlestown and the Monument . She could count herself lucky to find the place she did on such reasonable terms  --  not far from a good public school , and in a respectable neighborhood , if not exclusively residential . ... Channing Street had once been fashionable , but now it had a number of shops among its red brick residences , and was gradually disintegrating under the pressure from the North End ... . But in a boarding-house there was nothing to do , no beds to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash  --  how pleasant such duties would seem now  --  and no more than a speck of a garden , with a few hollyhocks , zinnias , and late-summer flowers that were not yet out . Yesterday , after she had returned from taking the children to school , Abigail Carfax had decided to move the furniture around , to see if she could not improve the looks of their rooms . They had two rooms , one a bedroom for Jason , the other for Abigail and Estelle . Neither had much furniture  --  a maplewood bed apiece and chairs to match , a commode , and a hooked rug , badly worn , to cover the floor . The larger room had a short sofa , of horsehair , a picture of George Washington and one of Martha Washington , prints of the Stuart portraits , framed in oval frames , and a round table . It did not take long to move these pieces about , and to discover , in doing so , that they left clean patches on the wall which were better covered , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved them back . She took a walk down to the wharves , a quite respectable thing to do , since everyone walked there ; and after she was tired , she came home . It was still early . She wondered what she should do now , until time to go for the children . She might write an arti-  | cle on missions for the church paper . She had written pieces for it from time to time , but most of them had been severely edited before they were published , and all the pretty phrases of which she had been proud had been taken out , so that she could hardly recognize what was left as her own . The thought occurred to her that she might write an article of different tenor , a travel sketch which would describe the native life without reference to the mission work , which would be suitable for one of the secular journals . Perhaps they would pay her a little for it , something that would help out her allowance . Boston was an important publishing center , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , periodicals , and journals , on all subjects and in all fields of interest . Over fourscore newspapers were published to satisfy the various tastes and moods of the population , and the pennants of their owners , flying above their establishments after the fashion of shipowners , gave the appearance of a regatta to their quarter of the city . Among all these journals , Abigail Carfax thought , was certainly one which would be interested in what she might say . Recalling those with which she was familiar , she remembered The Advocate . This was a well-known publication , of excellent reputation , which sometimes carried articles on missionary interests , as well as occasional travel sketches . It might , she thought , welcome a piece about Persia . The day was still young : Abigail Carfax sat down and wrote the piece . She carefully worked over each word , each sentence , each paragraph , until she thought she had it perfect ; then she copied it out in her neatest hand , bound it together in cardboard , carefully lettered with her name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Persian City " ; and then , since there was still time before going for the children , she took it personally to the office of The Advocate .  | At The Advocate they told her to call in a few days for the editorial decision ... . The children had now been gone an hour of their second day . Abigail Carfax wondered how she would ever live the day out . She could not walk all morning . The thought of remaining in this dingy room appalled her . She could not submit to reading . She wondered if possibly The Advocate people had read her sketch ... There would be no harm , certainly , in calling to ask .... Within the hour Abigail Carfax was standing in the antechamber of the editor 's office , trembling at her temerity , and wishing fearfully that she had not been so impatient . Mr. Shortcross , the editor , had said that he would see her . Mr. Shortcross , it turned out , was as timorous in the presence of Abigail Carfax as she was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a pretty woman , even one so plainly and unbecomingly dressed as Abigail Carfax , made him bashful . " It 's just a little . . . too difficult , if I may say so , Mrs. Carfax , " he said , hemming and hawing , and beaming at her over his spectacles , while he held the manuscript in one hand and stroked his beard with the other . The sheaf of papers trembled in his hand , and he forgot what he was saying . " I . . . am sorry , " he went on , stumbling over his words , and very apologetic . " I do n't think . . . we can use it . " Abigail Carfax was dismayed . Humiliated at the thought of her presumption that she could write something that would interest The Advocate , overcome with disappointment , she looked as though she would burst into tears . " You must realize , Mrs. Carfax , that it has its good qualities , " said Shortcross . " It is . . . simply . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if The Advocate does n't want it , then no one would , " said Abigail Carfax , despondently . " There 's no other . " " Why , of course , there is , " protested Shortcross . " There 's The Courier , and The Lady 's Household Companion , and ... " But Abigail Carfax , flushed and ashamed , had risen to go . " Perhaps you have something else you would like to show me , " suggested Shortcross , " or perhaps you might like to try another . " " There 's nothing else , " said Abigail Carfax , but added , without thinking , " except a novel . " The word " novel " caused Shortcross to open his eyes in surprise . " A novel , really ? " he exclaimed , drawing his chin in and putting out his lips with the approving manner of a father whose child has announced that she has written a poem . " Now , that is splendid . Splendid . " He motioned Abigail Carfax again to be seated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitated in uncertainty . " The Bride of the Viking , " which she had written on shipboard , had been largely an exercise to dispel her loneliness ; she had not thought of publication . It lay now , in the bottom of a trunk , a heap of pages , in confusion , unnumbered and without order ; but it also lay in her heart , and with a native dramatic skill , the same skill which she had used so often in entertaining the children , she began to tell the tale to Shortcross . Such was the dramatic power that flowed through her voice that even as a skeleton the story lived and held Shortcross enchanted , and at her every questioning pause , he would urge her to continue , with little " ah 's " and " mm 's , " and " Pray continue , please . " Shortcross was impressed . To a man to whom writing the single editorial column of his journal was a task that caused him  | to chew his pencil to bits , the creation of a novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he burst into a eulogy of exclamations . " Of course , of course , " Abigail Carfax gasped , overwhelmed . " I call it a novel , but it 's really nothing but a lot of scribbles . I am sorry . " What Shortcross had said only increased her disappointment , for she imagined that as a novel was something which The Advocate could not use in any case , he had been enthusiastic out of kindness . " By no means be sorry , Mrs. Carfax , " Shortcross urged . " I am delighted , simply amazed . It happens that I am acquainted with Mr. Charles Pitcrest , of the publishing house of Pitcrest . You know the firm , no doubt . It is one of the largest in Boston , though ? ahem  --  I do n't recall now any novels they have published . But permit me to give you an introduction to Mr. Pitcrest . He should , I am sure , be glad at the opportunity to consider the work of a new and promising author . Ahem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in resignation . " I would n't bother him . " " One need not stand under a falling wall , ' " she added , quoting a Persian proverb . " Yes , yes , by all means take it to him , " exclaimed Shortcross , and snatching up a pen , he dashed off a note to Pitcrest . " There , there , " he said , going so far in his enthusiasm as to pat his visitor 's hand , beaming at her , " you take the manuscript to Mr. Pitcrest , and I am sure I shall see your name on a folio flyleaf before many months . " Good-day , good-day , " he called cheerily , rubbing his hands , as he ushered Abigail Carfax through the door .  | Chapter Three I THE HOUSE OF PITCREST , to which Abigail Carfax was recommended , was one of the oldest , most conservative , and most respected publishing firms of Boston . It was a large establishment , and completely integrated , carrying on in one six-story building , covering a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to typesetting , stereotyping , printing , and binding the finished work , and employing well over two hundred persons in its various departments . Indicative of its importance and prestige was its location on Cornhill , at what was then the head of Washington Street , where the retail , the financial , and the shipping interests of the city converged . Looking down Washington Street from one of the upper windows of Pitcrest 's , one beheld some of the finest shops of which the city boasted . Another view offered a glimpse of State Street , and the Exchange , with its crowds of beaver- and silk-hatted brokers . From a third window one looked upon Dock Square , Faneuil Hall , and the market district . It was at Pitcrest 's that the affluence of the shopping and financial districts gave way to the north to warehouses for ships ' stores , sailors ' lodging-houses , grocers ' shops , and the like , so that it was a common phrase , found in the guidebooks of the day ? " Washington Street , as far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The firm 's list was conservative and highly select , consisting chiefly of scholarly works , fine editions of the classics , and a good sprinkling of religious treatises and pamphlets , for which New  | England offered a substantial and steady market . In addition , the firm had excellent connections abroad , and it acted as agent for several leading English publishers and issued translations of European works . In this last-named field , because of the suspicion with which foreign writers , especially French , were regarded , as to their morals and taste , the firm 's reputation gave it almost a monopoly , its colophon on a translation being accepted as an imprimatur . Novels were not published by the House of Pitcrest , as they were regarded as an immature form of literature , without dignity , read , with rare exceptions , by none but the ignorant , who would accept information , wisdom , and philosophy only in syrup form . Unaware of all this , Abigail Carfax had come to the House of Pitcrest to present the letter of introduction which Shortcross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her story , " The Bride of the Viking . " As she entered the massive building and heard from the back and above , faintly , the whirr and clatter of printing presses , she felt as though she were being drawn into a vast and incomprehensible web , and she had a sudden desire to withdraw , an urge to retire before it was too late . The feeling left her , however , as she passed beyond and into the reception room off the hall . A boy rose to meet her , asked her business , and on being given the letter from Shortcross , entered with it through another door , while Abigail Carfax sat down to wait . The outer office was a severely ornate chamber , paneled in dark wood , carved in Chinese patterns , like a teakwood chest , in the mode fashionable among conservative and profitable business houses . Through a window , not very large , and heavily curtained , came the sound of movement in Dock Square , mingled with the faint purring of machinery from above , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of masts rising from the waterfront . The boy  --  he was a lad of about sixteen  --  returned from Mr. Pitcrest 's office , asked her to wait , as Mr. Pitcrest had a caller , and then resumed his work . He was reading some proofs , which he meticulously marked with a long red pencil . Every now and then someone would come in , lay a package or a paper on his desk , and a little later someone else would come and take it away . Sometimes he would talk to these people in a low voice , and then , when they had gone , he would resume his work on the proofs . Although his position was that of a reception clerk and office boy , he seemed to have duties of greater importance . Abigail Carfax watched the lad with interest , mingled with uneasiness . He was not good-looking , for his skin was sallow on a bony face , his eyes were sunken under a protruding brow , he was stoop-shouldered , and his hands were large with blunt fingers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shone in his thoughtful , dark eyes , in his high forehead , in his neat dress , and in the excessive maturity of his boyhood . Abigail Carfax felt that she would like to speak to him . He happened to look up at a moment when she had her eyes upon him . She smiled in a timid , friendly way . " How busy everyone is , " she remarked . " Are you publishing something today ? " " We publish every day , " replied the boy . " That is , the presses are always turning out books , the typesetters are always busy setting up the type , and the editors are busy reading the proofs . " He spoke precisely , deliberately , pedantically almost , like one who places great reliance on everything read in books  --  a result of his occupation , no doubt . His voice , however , was pleasantly modulated , and his expression was friendly , if serious .  | " And the authors are busy writing the books , I presume ? " " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them are dead . Now the author of this , for instance , died about 350 years before Christ . " He handed Abigail Carfax a page of the proof on which he was working . It was in Greek , and was a portion of Plato 's " Republic . " " You . . . read this ? " she exclaimed , looking at the boy carefully . It surprised her a little that one of his age , and not in school , should be able to read Greek . She herself had read Greek and Latin at thirteen , but then she had been precisely educated . " Not only do I read it , but I proofread it , " he replied with pride , but with modesty . " One may get the sense by reading , but to proofread , one must be master of all the grammatical and syntactical forms , or an error is apt to slip through . " " Where did you learn Greek ? " Abigail Carfax asked , with interest . " In the composing room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only five years ' schooling , and all the education I have came from the composing room . " Seeing Abigail Carfax 's look of questioning , the boy interjected , " Oh , it 's a very good school for many subjects  --  history , literature , and the like . Mathematics is hard , unless one of the journeymen is willing to help you of evenings . And , of course , languages . For them you need some instruction at first . But then , we publish a good many texts , and when one has set the type for a textbook , he has learned pretty well what the textbook has to say . " It 's the stronger discipline , I guess , " he went on to say . " The teacher may give a black mark for a misspelled word , but when it appears in a book , it 's more than a black mark . The error is  | repeated a thousand fold in the printed book . One has to be very careful . " " Yes , I can imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translating the New Testament into Sevanli  --  that 's the language of a tribe in Persia where I have been living  --  and I know how careful one must be . " " I have read about Persia , " the boy said , his eyes lighting with animation . " Xenophon tells about it . But , of course , it is a much different country now , I suppose . " As Mr. Pitcrest tarried , Abigail Carfax told the boy about the country from which she had come . Presently , however , she asked : " How long have you spent in the composing room ? " " Most of five years . The latter end of the time I spent on the stone as a make-up man , and on the presses , but I preferred the type-case . One has a great deal of time for meditation sitting at a type-case . A short time ago , just after I finished my apprenticeship and was made a journeyman , Mr. Pitcrest brought me in here as clerk . " " Do you like it better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , and in some ways , no . But it does n't pay to have ideas about such things . That 's what I learned from the Greeks . " " Really ? What do they say ? " " I should explain that I am a Stoic , " said the boy proudly . " Not all the Greeks were Stoics , but the wisest of them  --  at least the wisest in my view  --  were Stoics . It is a philosophy that enables one to meet the hard knocks of life . " " How is that ? " Abigail Carfax asked . " Because it teaches submission to Providence , and universal philanthropy . Virtue , or moral strength , is the greatest human  | good . The wise man , ' said Seneca , can not really meet with misfortune . ' " Abigail Carfax regarded the boy with compassion . He should not be thinking of hardships and trials , but of the promises of young manhood , and of the future that lay before him . She noted the marks of hardship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , the stooped shoulders , the look in his face of one who had never played but had spent all of his childhood at work . Yet , for all these signs , he did not appear unhappy , and even laughed as he injected his mood into his discussion ... . " You are a writer of philosophy ? " the boy inquired of Abigail Carfax politely , glancing at the manuscript , in its package , which was resting on her lap . " No , " replied Abigail Carfax , confused . " It 's a novel . " " Oh ! " The tone of the boy 's voice alarmed Abigail Carfax . " You  --  you do n't think they will want it ? " she asked . " I would n't want to disappoint you , ma'am , " he replied , sympathetically , " hut the firm has never handled works of this class . In fact , it publishes very few works of any sort by American authors . " " However , " he added hopefully , " you never can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reads your manuscript . I 'm sure it must be good . " Abigail Carfax arose to go . " Why do n't you wait , ma'am ? " the boy asked . " Perhaps .. . you never can tell . " " I 'm afraid I do n't have your Stoic outlook , " Abigail Carfax remarked , uneasily . " I do n't know that I have it , either , " said the boy . " It sounds very good when you read it , but when it comes to applying it , it seems to lack something . "  | A thought struck him . " Do you , by chance , read French ? " he said quickly . " You seem to be familiar with languages . " Abigail Carfax nodded . " Can you do translating ? " " It would depend on how difficult the work . " " This , for example ? " He picked up a book which had been lying on his desk , a French work entitled " La Vie sans Pareil . " Abigail Carfax took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were still uncut , and read the preface . The work was a collection of philosophical essays , written in simple , direct style . " If you are interested , " the boy suggested , " you might apply to Mr. Pitcrest for translation work . We frequently have need . " " Thank you . " There was a stirring in the inner office . The handle of the door turned , and the door opened part way , while a few gruff words were spoken to someone within . Abigail Carfax saw a thickset man , with heavy features , and jowls that hung in folds above his collar . He had on his hat and cloak , and one hand clutched a leather portfolio and the note from Shortcross , badly crumpled . He stepped into the room and surveyed Abigail Carfax out of half-shut eyes . " I have read Shortcross ' letter , but I am sorry I can do nothing for you , madam , " he grunted . " Shortcross should know by this time that we never publish novels . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if to dismiss his visitor and , seeing the copy of " La Vie sans Pareil " on the table , began to grumble . " Has n't Gerbaud been in yet ? " " He is still laid up , sir . " Abigail Carfax summoned her courage and spoke .  | " I would be glad to do translating , if you like , " she said . Pitcrest turned to her again . " What do you know about languages ? " he asked . Abigail Carfax told him earnestly , rapidly , her qualifications for translating French , and added : " I speak also Persian and Turkish and Armenian and Syriac ? they 're the languages of the peoples in our part of Persia  --  and , I should add , a little Russian , not much , that I learned from a Russian family we knew . " While she talked , Pitcrest 's half-shut eyes opened a little , as he observed her fresh , unspoiled look and contemplated the beauty that lay hidden under her drab , unbecoming dress . When she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Give Mrs. Carfax the work we have been holding for Ger. - baud . We ca n't wait forever for him to be in the mood . " AddressAbigail Carfax , Pitcrest said , " Look it over , make some excerpts in English , and submit them to me with your opinion of the book 's merits . I will let you know then whether we can use your services . " He looked his visitor over again , and added , as if in after " Let 's see this manuscript Shortcross speaks of . Perhaps I can send you to someone who uses that sort of stuff . " He took the manuscript , which Abigail Carfax handed him , glanced at the title page , thumbed through a few pages , and then thrust it into his portfolio . " I 'll look it over , " he said . " Come back in a week . " Hunching his cloak about his shoulders , and thrusting out his lower lip in a moody , pouting way , he went out . Abigail Carfax turned to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is your name ? " " Robert Ware , ma'am . "  | " Well , thank you , Robert , and I have enjoyed talking with you . II Though the House of Pitcrest is now as forgotten as the novels of Abigail Carfax , and the substantial six-story building itself long ago disappeared in the dust of a wrecker , the importance of the firm in its time , and in the career of Abigail Carfax , are such as to require further mention of it and its owner . Publishing was a respected business in Boston . In the commercial hierarchy , the publishing of books had always enjoyed a parity with banking and ship-owning ; among professional people and the intellectual classes it was almost a sanctified occupation , and a publisher whose reputation was good  --  that is , one who published nothing scandalous , sensational , or " naughty " ? enjoyed a place next to the clergy and the Harvard faculty . To be head of such a firm as the House of Pitcrest was , therefore , to occupy a position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might envy . The fact was , however , that Charles Pitcrest took little satisfaction in his position as a leading publisher , and was , indeed , though unaware of it , unhappy in his lot . He had not become a publisher by choice but by inheritance . His grandfather had founded the House of Pitcrest and had brought it to a state of prosperity and reputation . Under his father the business had expanded still further . As Charles had grown up without positive inclinations toward other pursuits , and here was a cultivated vineyard for the asking , it went without question that he should take over the management on his father 's death . His literary tastes , however , did not run to the classics which the House published ; moreover , he had little judgment on the requirements of business management , and he alternated between a complete  | disregard of the firm 's accounts and sudden frenzies of concern over details of management , when he would call for the records , countermand standing orders , and endeavor to curtail expenses by parsimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more colorful career , but at the age of fifty he knew no more what to fasten upon than he had known in his youth . From time to time he was tempted to try out other interests , which he usually did by making speculative investments in new enterprises . If they went well , he was happy and would buy a new carriage or ask his wife if she did not wish to give a party ; if they turned out badly , and they usually did , he would grow cautious again , and demand economies in his publishing business , and then sensing his incapacity , resign the management to his subordinates . When horse-racing and pugilism came into vogue , Pitcrest would now and then make small bets , and if he lost , would grow morose and illtempered . Pitcrest had few friends and no cronies , and forever felt a vague lonesomeness from which he sought to escape by membership in several clubs , or to relieve by attending the theatre or races . He lived , with his wife and eighteen-year-old son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on an elmshaded plot in Mount Vernon Street . He had bought it some years before , when Beacon Hill was becoming the fashionable residential district , and as it was rather expensive , even for an established publisher , he had had to sell some of his note holdings to obtain the funds . This was shortly after he had come into his inheritance , and he had been persuaded that not only was a large house an appropriate dignity , but that he would need one for the entertainment of the literary coterie whom he would attract . This last incentive may have been insinuated by Mrs. Pitcrest , who was fond of entertaining , and regularly issued in-  | vitations to large parties . The maintenance of the house , and the expense of entertainment , with all that Mrs. Pitcrest 's ideas of entertainment demanded , in the form of flowers , catering , servants , and new dresses , was a drain which even a prosperous publishing business could not support unnoticed . Mrs. Pitcrest  --  Amelia Pitcrest  --  was a woman of angular proportions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had acceded to the lust of the flesh long enough to conceive one child , after which , duty discharged , she moved into a separate bedroom , and saw her husband only at breakfast , devoting the rest of the day to the various literary and social organizations in which , by right as the wife of one of Boston 's leading publishers , she took a prominent part . Pitcrest 's relations with his wife were agreeable , correct , and passionless . She had long since ceased to awaken any physical attraction in her husband , and when loneliness combined with desire , Pitcrest was accustomed to make his way toward Pitts Street . Here at the foot of Beacon Hill was a district euphemistically known as the " Chinese quarter . " It had a few Chinese shops , but it had a great many more shuttered , ill-kempt houses , into which at nightfall , sailors , young men from Harvard , and even well-to-do men like Pitcrest , might be seen surreptitiously entering . Charles Pitcrest , junior , was a student at Harvard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week-ends , fortnights , or seldomer . Mrs. Pitcrest was also away frequently , and Pitcrest usually dined at his club , so that the house which they all called home was , except on those occasions when a party was in progress , gloomy , cold , and so empty that it echoed whispers . Pitcrest 's favorite club was the Merchants and Ship-owners , where the news of the day was posted on the bulletin boards as soon as it was received , and where there was always a congregation of men discussing the shipping and mercantile events of the morn-  | ing . As Pitcrest , however , looked upon himself as neither a merchant nor a ship-owner , and in addition had no conversational art , he was generally as lonely here as elsewhere , and his dinners only less dreary than his fireside at home . Not so long before Abigail Carfax 's call at his office , Charles Pitcrest had acquired a crony and at the same time began to enter the web of a larger life . The crony was a certain dun-clad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had recently moved to Boston from New York , to escape the implications of certain transactions in which he had been engaged . Pitcrest had met him at a banquet given to celebrate the opening of the new Fitchburg Railway station . It was a large affair , held in the concourse of the station itself ; Jenny Lind sang , and so great had been the demand for tickets that tables were set in the side halls . Pitcrest had received an invitation as one of Boston 's leading citizens , but not as one sufficiently identified with the railway industry to be seated on the dais . Indeed , his table was at some distance from the dais , and inconveniently behind a pillar , so that he had to crane his neck to see the proceedings . The man sitting opposite Pitcrest at the table had offered to move over and make room , and Pitcrest had by a nod shown his appreciation of the courtesy . The rest of the evening , between the songs of the Swedish Nightingale and the speeches of the various notables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . Bismith had the arts of a courtesan ; he played about Pitcrest , flattered him by asking his opinion of the market and the political state of the Union , and nodded awesomely when the opinion was given , while at the same time he let Pitcrest understand that he also had a certain importance and certain favors to dispense , as by remarking , in comment on Pitcrest 's views , " Yes , that 's what my friend Mr. Budlong says " ? Mr. Bud-  | long being president of the Exchange  --  or " Michigan Central is doing excellently , the management tells me ; in fact , I was able to enhance my capital moderately , last year , by turning my shares at the proper time . " All this had sensibly influenced Pitcrest . The new interest in stocks and bonds , and the railway and industrial promotions that had taken Boston in their grip , like a morbid fascination , had affected Pitcrest , and had enhanced his feeling of isolation in his publishing business , of living alone on an island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was impressed by Bismith 's familiarity with so many aspects of business , and he looked upon his new-found friend with the same relief with which one might . come upon a guide in a jungle . At the close of the banquet , when the hall was filled with the clatter of chairs being shoved back and the mingled sounds of pent-up conversation , Bismith drew an expensive Havana cigar from his pocket and offered it to Pitcrest . The pathetic eagerness with which Pitcrest accepted the courtesy opened the way for an invitation : a glass of port together . Pitcrest , to his own surprise , again accepted . At Bismith 's suggestion , they went to the Merchants Exchange Hotel , at the time one of the most exclusive in the city , patronized by the leading Boston merchants , prosperous traders from the West , and Southern planters . This was the hotel of which " The Bostoniad , " that compendium of advertisements in rhyme by the Honorable James Torrington Spencer Lidstone , said : ' T is here that you may come awhile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the glasses , the conversation continued in the vein established , in which Bismith revealed further his intimate acquaintance with the world of finance and affairs . Not a great  | deal did Pitcrest learn concerning his companion 's own business or associations , about which Bismith was astutely reticent . Bismith showed an increasingly friendly interest in Pitcrest , and intimated , without too much effusion , that Pitcrest appealed to him and that a continuance of the acquaintance might be worth Pitcrest 's while . Bismith mentioned also that he might drop in on Pitcrest to purchase a certain edition of Shakespeare , in calf , as a present to a friend in the South . This was a deluxe edition which the House had recently issued ; it was very expensive and in limited quantity . Pitcrest concluded that Bismith was a " capitalist , " one of the newer millionaires to whom money was nothing . At the close of their meeting , therefore , after Bismith bade him goodnight and departed , Pitcrest drove home with the comfortable feeling of a man who is at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ III On leaving his office , after having thrust Abigail Carfax 's manuscript into his portfolio , Charles Pitcrest had performed an errand or two and then had gone to Bismith 's place of business , where he had an appointment with Bismith . This was in Fulton Court , a narrow , ill-kempt alley in the form of a " T , " back of Commercial Wharf , in which were located a number of warehouses , wholesalers , and dealers in ships ' equipment . At No. io was a sign " TOMPKINS-NAVAL STORES . " Behind the dingy windows of this establishment was a large room cluttered with samples of cordage and canvas , huge glass bottles of turpentine , chests of wax , bales of oakum , bins containing assortments of clew rings , blocks and tackle , and the like . One corner of the room was enclosed by a high wooden railing , and behind this stood a number of tall desks and stools for clerks , a shelf  | for heavy leather-bound ledgers , and a huge iron safe . The whole place smelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the odor of sulphur , which came from the near-by warehouses . By inquiring here for Bismith , a caller would be shown down a dark corridor to a small back room facing on one branch of the alley . Pitcrest by now was as used to these offices as a drunkard is to the slops , but the first time he had come to call , his look had shown such surprise that Bismith had felt compelled to explain . With some emphasis he pointed out that ostentation was neither becoming nor was it good business , since those who made display always paid double for what they bought , and that for these and other reasons he had found it more suitable to make his headquarters with Tompkins , in which firm he had a certain investment . Though this hardly agreed with his personal appearance  --  he was always elegantly dressed , in either a dun- or fawncolored ensemble that matched his complexion and went well with his watery blue eyes  --  his lecture had made an impression on Pitcrest , and had convinced him of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five o'clock when Pitcrest arrived at Fulton Court . A lone clerk in the front office , working under a lamp , unlatched the door , and recognizing him , nodded curtly and admitted him . Pitcrest went back to Bismith 's office . Bismith was alone , reading The Advertiser under a hanging lamp , his feet upon the marred oak table that served him as a desk . At Pitcrest 's entry he put his feet down , laid aside his newspaper , took off his spectacles , and shook hands with his visitor , at the same time motioning him to the only other chair the room contained . " Have you closed the deal ? " Pitcrest asked , seating himself heavily in the chair .  | " On Old Colony Railway ? " Bismith asked , opening the drawer and taking out a paper , with the manner of a man of many interests seeking to refresh his memory . " No . The sugar matter you spoke of . " " Oh , that ? That 's closed . Hornby had to have his answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Pitcrest showed his disappointment . " It sounded like a good proposition , " he said slowly , " but I could n't make up my mind . " " If you want to make money , you have to catch the apples as they drop , " said Bismith , but added consolingly , " I would n't think too much of that . That was small business . I 've bigger fish in the net . How would you like something big , really big , that will make your publishing business look like a pushcart on Salem Street ? " " What is it ? " " Are you really interested ? " " Yes , " said Pitcrest , drawing out the word in such a way that his indecision was obvious . " You should n't say yes , my dear Pitcrest , until you know what it 's all about , until you have all the facts , and have considered them carefully , weighed them , assorted them , and assessed them . Then , you can say yes or no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant , " said Pitcrest slowly , " that if it interests you , why then , it interests me . " Bismith smiled benignly . " Let me give you an analysis of the situation , so that you may see all the facts and considerations upon which judgment must be based , " he said judicially . " The most dangerous thing for an investor is to be carried away by enthusiasm . First , now , what do you make of the news ? " So saying , Bismith spread the copy of The Advertiser before  | him on the table . There , under appropriate headings in small capitals , was displayed , in six columns of fine print , the news of yesterday , gathered by post and telegraph from the four corners of the world , all staidly and compactly written : the account of the troubles in Peshawar , the reception of the French ambassador by the King of Prussia , the visit of the American minister to Balmoral , the Kanzas ( for so Kansas was then spelled ) elections , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston merchants who had sent him a memorial endorsing his stand on the Fugitive Slave Law ( which he ended by a peroration to the Constitution ) , the arrivals and departures of ships , exports and imports , and , in even smaller type , a half column of " Financial News . " " Now , what do you see in all this ? " Bismith asked again , as Pitcrest solemnly stared at the sheet . " I do n't read The Advertiser , " said Pitcrest , as though to apologize for not being familiar with its contents . " I read only The Transcript . " " Transcript , Advertiser , Atlas , Courier  --  they 're all alike ? dull columns of dull chronicles . For all that Boston has more papers than any two cities its size , it has the dullest journalism . Our editors are without imagination . They see nothing but facts , and they see facts as dry skeletons , rather than as the manifestations of a living spirit . Glance at the financial news : " Shares showed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Michigan Central announces the issuance of a new series of notes , ' etc. , etc. , etc . " What does all that mean ? Briefly , here is what is happening . For the past five years railways have been the plaything of the financiers . Because the brokers in Wall Street have played them along , the public has poured millions into railway promotions . More miles of railway were built last year than in all the previous  | history of the Republic . Those are statistics . The country is overbuilt on railways . We have enough railroads laid down to take care of our grandchildren . All the tenderloin is out of the business . We are due for a great fall in the market  --  after , of course , the big interests get out from under . After that , they will begin to buy again , and consolidate these little lines into big lines , and the big lines into bigger , and sell out these new shares to the public at a fat profit . That 's what is behind those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine to know these things which I have learned from intimate experience , " Bismith continued , lowering his voice , persuasively . " Now , if you want real investment opportunities , look into an industry that is at once in its infancy , yet has all the experience of history behind it , an industry that as yet has not been made the plaything of the financial interests , that has no shares quoted , that is still operated by the old family owners , that is today making enormous profits , and that is on the verge of the greatest expansion in its history . " Pitcrest had his head bowed over the paper and was as motionless as a log . " What is this business ? " he asked . " Shipping . Look at those columns of shipping news . Shipping news so long has been the pillar of Boston prosperity that it is no longer news . Now turn to this column  --  Despatch from California . ' What does that say ? Results of reefer washing , " Shipments of dust , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stagecoach . ' Now , put the two things together . " Bismith leaned over and tapped Pitcrest gently on the knee . " Here is the California picture , " he said confidentially . ' Two years ago this January , gold was discovered at Sutter 's Mill . Since then , people have been moving to California by every conceivable method  --  overland by wagon or oxcart , or on foot , and by sea to Panama or around the Horn . Men beg , borrow , or steal to  | get passage money . Within a year Nantucket has lost a fourth of its population . New Bedford alone has sent eight hundred men to California . In two years ' time cities have sprung up on the California Coast where only the lonely Pacific rolled its surf . More gold has been taken out of its streams than Pizarro found stored in all Peru . Here is a mighty army moving  --  like the Greeks marching into Asia , the Mongols into Europe . These United States now embrace a continent . The American people are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and the Pacific . " Bismith was a short man , and in his excitement over the picture he was drawing he was swinging his legs to and fro under his chair . " Now , what does the press make of all this ? Dull paragraphs like the one I have just read . Staid Boston looks on and says , What has this to do with us ? This is simply a flurry , and Boston is still the Hub . ' But two years have gone by . Today , there 's not the frenzy there was last year , but still the gold pours out of California , and still the westward movement continues . Do you see what it means ? We are at the door of a great era , only at the door . Vast opportunities lie ahead . We are becoming a giant . We have power  --  for this gold flowing in an unceasing stream from the hills is power . We shall be rich . There is no dream we dare not dream , no conquest we dare not undertake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let it soar until it disappears in the blinding sun . " In Pitcrest 's eyes appeared a reflection of Bismith 's excitement ; the lids quivered ever so slightly , and beneath , the folds of the skin twitched . " There 's material in the West for many a book , " Bismith remarked , dropping his voice to that of ruminative counsel . " If you would turn your attention away from these European writ-  | ers , and encourage some American author who could express the spirit of American enterprise and daring , you would make a fortune . " Pitcrest was absorbing all this like a blotter taking up ink , in a clouded , unprecise way . " So much for the sweep of the thing , for its broad implications , " continued Bismith . " But more to the point : what does it mean for Boston and the people of Massachusetts , and particularly for you and me ? " Let me tell you . California is a long ways away , and the quickest , the cheapest way there is by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for ships  --  fast ships . People thought the freight boom was over ; it 's just beginning . What is needed is bigger and faster ships . " Bismith paused , seeing the look of comprehension in Pitcrest 's eyes . " A steamship ? " At the mention of a steamship , Bismith laughed lightly . " That is another error of the novice . Because we have steam railroads , everyone jumps to the conclusion  --  steamships . But why ? If a locomotive runs low of fuel , it can stop anywhere while its crew cuts down timber . Ha ! Ha ! Fancy a steamer out of coal in mid-ocean ! Because steamships ply up and down the Hudson and along the coast , and Cunard has done very well with his Liverpool packets , everyone thinks steam has a future . Cold , dispassionate analysis should show that steam can not compete with sail . Wind costs nothing , and is to be found on every sea . But coal is expensive , and not found everywhere . Look how much valuable cargo space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention machinery  --  which is saved on a sailing vessel . With sail , all the machinery is above deck , aloft , and all the hull is available for cargo . One thing is lacking , and that is speed . And  | now that problem is solved , thanks to American inventive genius . What do you say to a sailing ship , a three-master , of twelve hundred tons burden , capable of running down the line at better than twelve knots an hour ? " Pitcrest thought . " No sailing vessel of that size could make such speed . The best afloat ca n't make better than eight , " he announced . " And why can not one be built to make twelve ? " " It would have to carry so much canvas as to be topheavy . It would capsize . " " Why do you say that ? " " It stands to reason . " Bismith smiled indulgently . " There are mightier things than reason , " he said , forgetting or ignoring his earlier disquisition on " dispassionate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the will . I say such a ship can be built . Indeed , I have the plans for such a ship , and it shall be built . " Pitcrest 's eyes opened with incredulity . " No ? " " I say yes . Can you see it now , a tall three-master , cross-rigged , with sails bellying before the wind , running down the line , outsailing all competitors , a white eagle among hawks ! I say , it 's tremendous . " " How will such a ship be built ? " " By daring . By daring to apply clipper principles to a crossrigged three-master , and by daring to build bigger than anyone has built before . Clipper barks have been built  --  the Dauntless ? and why not clipper ships ? I have a designer who says that he can design a ship of over a thousand tons with the same narrow hull , projecting bow and deep cutwater that one finds on brigs and barkentines , and that with these lines he can give the ship the same speed as these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plans and in fact has already shown me the general drawings . " " What will such a ship cost ? " Pitcrest asked , pursing his lips in an attempt to give weight to his expression . " Never mind the cost . What will it earn ? Today , speed is the secret of success . Alen want their business done in a hurry . It now takes four to five months to make the California coast . During that time merchandise is eating its head away in interest , not to say spoilage . A ship that can make the run in a hundred days could cut a third of the time . Its owners could demand a fifty percent greater freight rate . In addition to that , such a vessel would be loaded and half-way on its return voyage by the time its competitor reached port . That 's the mathematics of it . I calculate such a vessel could pay for itself in a single voyage . " " But how much would such a ship cost ? " Pitcrest repeated . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand . " " Seventy-five thousand ! " " Yes . " " I have no such means , " Pitcrest said despondently . Bismith was not the least dismayed . " But you would like to go along ? " he asked gently . Pitcrest considered . " Yes . " " Then leave the rest to me . It will take not more than thirty thousand cash . " Pitcrest looked at him in incomprehension , and Bismith realized , for the first time , with what a lamb he had to deal . " Let me explain , my dear Pitcrest . There are two ways  --  two legitimate ways I mean  --  of getting money . One is by earning it by the sweat of your brow  --  by manual labor , as when a farmer tills and plants and reaps and sells in the market place , or when  | a sailorman sails his vessel successfully over the main and brings his cargo into port . " " I should , " he added with a deferential nod to his companion , " include mental labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a labor which no doubt brings the sweat to your brow . The other method of getting money is to make it . " " Make it ? " " Yes , make it . By the stroke of a pen . Only a banker can do that . It is very simple . You go to your banker and ask for a loan . He looks you over , and decides that you are a good risk . He will take a chance . He takes your note , and gives you his note . That 's all there is to it . With his note you can go into the market and buy . Why that should be I do n't know , except that his notes are beautifully engraved and on pretty paper . But people are willing to take his notes . They trust him , when they do n't trust the bounty of nature , or the good favor of the winds , or the taste of the publisher . His notes circulate like cash . " Now , I have connections . I know a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other forty-five thousand . And thirty and forty-five make seventy-five , and the seventy-five will make us many thousands . It 's as certain as I am living . " " Thirty thousand is a lot of money . I have not that much in cash , " responded Pitcrest doggedly . " But you have assets , my dear fellow , assets . " " But not in cash . " " Again , the banker waves his wand . You can borrow against these assets . " " But you have already proposed that I borrow the forty-five thousand . How , then , can I borrow the first thirty thousand ? " " Ah , I have more than one string to my bow . I know more than one banker . The forty-five thousand which I mentioned will be borrowed on the strength of the enterprise . The banker  | will lend on the security of the vessel being constructed . It will not affect your personal assets in the least . Now , the thirty thousand which you will show the banker as evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain from another banker . He will make the advance against your note , on the security of your publishing business . So , to sum up , you put nothing into the enterprise except your faith in its success , just as I put nothing in but my wits  --  in thinking up the scheme and organizing it . " This last phrase apparently slipped out in Bismith 's enthusiasm . He coughed , and hurried on to repeat the merits of the enterprise , and its marvelous prospects . Pitcrest said nothing , but the flabby skin under his eyes and around his throat twitched in thought , and his eyes lighted with a look of anticipation . " I would like to meet this designer , " he said at last . Bismith beamed , and hopped down from his chair . " We shall see him this very evening . But first let us to Brock 's and have a bite to eat . " Now that his business was moving successfully , Bismith returned to the mood of flattery and adulation with which he had first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and reminded Pitcrest that his was the leading house in Boston , and went on to add : " You have the opportunity to go down in history as one of the leading figures of the era , for your imagination , and your courage in sponsoring new ideas and pioneering in new fields . " Pitcrest ahemmed judicially .  | Chapter Four I THE UNEASY FEELING of being in the midst of a web was still with Abigail Carfax when she left the House of Pitcrest , but its force had considerably diminished . The afternoon was mild , and a sunlit haze lay in the streets of Boston . As she walked along , Abigail Carfax observed people and scenes with a new and more friendly interest than she had hitherto . She held tightly the book which Pitcrest had given her and hurried along , eager to get to work translating it . " Life Without Equal " ? the title was suggestive . She had read enough of the work , while at Pitcrest 's , to see that the author 's purpose was to portray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living without equal for freedom and opportunity , and she wondered whether possibly the author could have had the New World in mind and was suggesting the foundations upon which the social structure of the New World should be laid . It was four o'clock when Abigail Carfax arrived home . A letter had come during her absence ; it was from Dr. Helder , a short note , telling her that he had established practice in Salem Street and giving the address . He had opened a clinic for the poor , he said . It was in the nature of an experiment ; he would not call it a charity , but it would be in the nature of a self-sustaining benevolence . " It is , as you know , the kind of thing I dreamed of doing many years ago , when I took up the study of medicine , and  | which at long last I am finally embarking upon , " he wrote . " A missionary work , I call it , though I feel presumptuous in doing so when I think that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less from the love of God than from the necessity of achieving my peace with Him and saving my immortal soul . It has given me such joy , what I have already done , that I am envious of those like yourself who were brave and devoted enough to enter upon such work in their youth . " Dr. Helder closed his note with expressions of regards , and the hope that before long he would have the opportunity of visiting Mrs. Carfax and the children and renewing the attachment he had formed for them . Abigail Carfax was pleased to receive the letter , and it gave her a sense of contentment to learn that the physician was happily settled , while his obvious admiration for her profession gave her a new satisfaction with her lot . The children came in , home from school , and ready for the afternoon walk which they had begun the custom of taking . " Where shall it be today , darlings ? " Abigail Carfax asked happily . Generally they walked along Broad and India Streets , which were near by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roadstead . There were also the crowds to see , for the wharves were a favorite place of afternoon promenade for the people of Boston . By six o'clock they would be back , for that was the supper hour for children at Mrs. Hutchins ' , and the order was precise . Jason and Estelle ate in a small dining-room reserved for children , of whom there were , at the time , four others . Abigail Carfax had not liked the idea of being separated from them , but there was nothing much she could do about it . From the supper table the children went up to their rooms by the rear door , and  | as the adults were then in the midst of their meal , Abigail Carfax did not see them again until they were ready for bed . The main dining-room , where the adults ate , was a large room with oak wainscotting , and with dingy red wallpaper above , at one side a fireplace fitted with a grate for coal , and above it an oak mantel with a tarnished mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small garden , the other on to the street ; but the windows were leaded and paned with lozenges of colored glass , so that neither garden nor street was visible . The wide door leading into the hallway was similarly paned , and admitted little light . The dining-room accommodated two long tables , each seating sixteen persons . From the center of the ceiling hung a large chandelier that held four oil lamps , each of which was surrounded by an array of glass pendants and ornaments . For supper , the lamps were lighted , and they now cast a yellow scintillation over the room . For all the rather depressing furnishings , in the evening the dining-room was a cozy place , and lively , because of the conversation that went on . The boarding table was a forum for the exchange of views , the imparting of information , the sharpening of wits ; in the course of an evening all the important events and issues of the day would be brought forth , examined , appraised , or laid aside for further discussion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corday at the Atheneum , the future of electrical psychology  --  Professor Cutler was giving a course of lectures at Tremont Temple on this and allied subjects , including somnambulism , trance , pathetism , electro-biology , and mesmerism  --  these were among the subjects over which conversation would range . To a person just returned from foreign lands , who had for years been away from the currents of affairs , all this was very enlightening , and Abigail Carfax had begun to take an interest in what was being said , staying  | at table , after supper , to listen . She was very quiet ; she only listened . She never advanced any views of her own ; but these sessions at the table , listening to the conversation that went on , gradually came to be the bright periods of her day , second only to her after-school walks with the children . Sometimes she felt an urge to speak , stimulated by the liveliness of the discussion , or by the views that were advanced . She had always enjoyed lively conversation , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her father that had first attracted her to him . In Persia , however , there had been little opportunity for such exchanges . Pursuits and interests moved in a narrow arena , and conversation was similarly restricted . Affairs of state belonged to the Shah , and it did no good to talk about them ; events of a more personal interest were governed by kismet , the fate which Allah has written on every man 's forehead ; and discussion of these was equally futile , generally resolving into a wondrous Mashallah I  --  By the Lord ! Conversation was limited , therefore , to such harmless subjects as the season 's rose crop , whether the attar was as fragrant as in previous years ; the comparative qualities of the poetry of Sa'di and Hafiz ; upon the sad fate of Laila and Majnun , whose tragedy Nizami had told nearly a thousand years before ; on the respective merits of Kashan and Kirman rugs ; and the like . This evening , at Mrs. Hutchins ' boarding house , the conversation , after skipping about among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a topic  --  the relative importance of Greek and Roman contributions to modern culture . Thomas Prisson , a plump little bank clerk who kept up with all that was being published in the field of history ( he had just finished Prescott 's " Conquest of Mexico , " and was beginning Parkman 's " Oregon Trail " ) , had been advancing a novel idea .  | " The greatest contribution of the Romans , " he had contended , while helping himself to the crullers from the bowl on the table , ? was not their law , but their commercial practices  --  the corninercial forms , such as contracts , bills of exchange , and the like ? that have been of greatest value to subsequent generations. ? A different view was taken by Hosea Shanley , a divinity student , who was assistant at the church of which the famous Christian Marker was minister . " I hold , " Shanley said , tapping his fingers on the table the way he had seen his instructor do at lectures , to emphasize a point , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually Greek , and particularly the commercial practices of which you speak . These were highly developed when Rome was still an unwalled city . The Roman monetary system was patterned after the Greek  --  but unlike the Greeks the Romans never learned how to manage a monetary system . " He went on to give a learned disquisition on the monetary practices of the Romans  --  a subject on which he was doing some special research for Dr. Marker , who held that Jesus Christ made a scientific error in disclaiming an interest in the coinage of Caesar . It appeared from what he said that the Roman emperors had flagrantly debased the coinage , and that the chaos of the currency was a chief cause of the Great Crisis of the third century . Prisson , to whom money was as sacred as the tabernacle to the ancient Jews , was silent before Shanley 's erudition . But the argument did not end . At this point the gentleman sitting opposite Abigail Carfax spoke up . " Is it not a mistake , " he asked , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not culture something apart from a people , or a time ? Is it not rather a spirit that pervades all eras , and all peoples , somewhat the same way that the atmosphere belongs  | not to us , or to the people of the Atlantic Seaboard , but is an envelope that encloses the globe , forming its own pattern of cloud and rainbow color , sunsets and sunrises , independent of the people whom it enfolds ? " " That is a strange idea , Mr. Sweyton , " commented the divinity student , puckering his eyebrows . Abigail Carfax was interested in what her table companion would say . Like herself , he seldom took part in these discussions . Usually he would sit listening in a detached way , giving attention abstractedly to his food , sometimes throwing out a remark as he had now , smiling as he did so , in a charming , dip , nified manner , but going no further , as though what he had to say was not worth defending , or was so true and obvious that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or very selfassured . Abigail Carfax was interested in him because he was a naval architect and he had remarked to her once , when she had spoken of her journey on the Dauntless , that he had been an assistant to the architect who designed the vessel . He was a person of the manner and presence one associates with an artist or a philosopher , and Abigail Carfax had observed more than once the elegant manner with which he handled his knife and fork : his hands were finely shaped and strong , like those of a surgeon , a painter , a card sharp . In looks , he was fair , with long , patrician features , hair that was pale yellow and sparse , particularly at the forehead , which was high and nobly rounded . His eyes were blue , and his lips , when they parted , revealed a fine set of pearly white teeth . He appeared to be about thirty-five years of age . " I mean this , " he continued , " that as we examine the so-called cultural contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is usually something which they have preserved from an  | earlier civilization , or re-fashioned from a common inheritance . " Roman jurisprudence , as Mr. Shanley has rightly remarked , is only a codification of the customs , conventions , and moral ideas , of their subject peoples . We think of the Parthenon as the sublime expression of Greek genius ; yet all the architectural ideas of Greece can be traced back to Egyptian originals . And if we were permitted to go back into Egyptian beginnings , we should find that this culture was built upon a still older culture . Back and back as far as the eye of history sees , we find this constant unfoldment of a pattern which belongs not to any race or time , or place , but is an underlying pattern seeking its own unfoldment . " " That 's transcendentalism , is n't it ? " asserted Prisson , who knew little about abstract concepts , but was tired of keeping quiet . " Perhaps it is , " said Sweyton non-committally , and went on to develop his thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perishes . To be original is to be condemned to death . It is that which conforms to the basic pattern of all culture that survives , and it survives to the degree that it conforms . There is no greater mistake than to imagine that we , as a people , because we have established ourselves on this new continent , have possessed ourselves thereby of a unique culture , or have removed ourselves from the history of the race , or can pursue a course apart from the stream of universal destiny . " Sweyton paused , in sudden apathy , and began to toy with his fork , as though he had finished speaking . Seeing Abigail Carfax leaning forward , listening eagerly and perplexed , to what he had to say , he smoothed his hair and spoke again . " Can you imagine , " he said , " what Roman law would have been had it taken into account only Italian practice and custom ?  | The Code Justinian survives because it represents the subordination of Roman practice to the custom and procedure of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , We will build a temple the like of which no man or people has ever seen . It will be unique , original , expressive only of the pure Greek intellect and spirit ' ? Can you imagine the result ? Some monstrosity of architecture that would probably have been torn down by the Greeks themselves as an eyesore and abomination . " Sweyton said all this in a thoughtful , philosophical manner , in which , however , a rhapsodic note now and then appeared . When he ended , everyone was silent , until finally Thomas Prisson spoke up . " Fantastic ! " he exclaimed , while he held a cruller midway between plate and mouth . " Why , look at this country . It 's a new world , in every way . We are building a new civilization on this continent , new in every respect . Starting with our political system , for instance , there is nothing like it , there has never been anything like it . " " What you say , Mr. Sweyton , is very plausible , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but it seems to ignore the great creative fact of life . We are made in the image of God , says Scripture . This refers , of course , to the spiritual image . What is the image of God ? The opening sentence of the Bible declares the one , and the principal , aspect of the image . In the beginning God created . ' Yes , created . That is the beginning , that is the end . We , as His children , are all creators . Now , what is the essence of this creative power we possess ? It is to bring forth something new , something different , something unique and original . Otherwise , it is not creative ; it is only mimicry . Therefore , your whole thesis is faulty . " " God creates , " assented Sweyton , " but we procreate . Let the  | earth bring forth every living creature after his kind , I believe the Scripture says in Genesis . What is procreated must conform to the general pattern of the strain or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that does not survive . " And thus I conceive the principal business of life to be that of studying the ultimate pattern , and that of subjecting our arrogant impulses to the larger principle . We create , as you say , but we create only out of what we find in the great pattern . " Upon Abigail Carfax these words produced a sudden and profound reaction , and she felt impelled to speak . " I think you are right , Mr. Sweyton , " she exclaimed , flushed with excitement , embarrassed at her boldness . " We must conform to the pattern , or we perish . And we are constantly being drawn to this pattern for our own salvation . " Those who had been participants in the conversation turned to her in interest . Fenton Sweyton had the look of a sentinel welcoming his relief . " I am glad you have come to my rescue , Mrs. Carfax , " he said , " though I must confess you have carried my idea to lengths of which I had not thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . " " But it is not a new thought , " Abigail Carfax replied , and rushing on impetuously , hardly realizing where her words were carrying her , she continued , " It is simply a realization of an old fact , an urge that is within each of us . We all long for something . We hunger , but we do not know for what . Is not this hunger simply the urge to return to that from which we came , to become again a part of the great Whole from which all life issues , to find again the lost perfection of our unbornness  --  the Paradise from which the first man fell ? " A light seemed to break for the divinity student . " I see , " he burst out . " You mean , madam , that we all feel a  | longing , sometime or other , to return to God ? " " Something like that , " said Abigail Carfax breathlessly . Her eyes were shining with the ardor of one who has discovered something for which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she repeated , and added , " For some , who know their way , it is God . For others  --  those who have been ensnared by the net of falsehood  --  it is truth . For some  --  those who have known the beauty of life  --  it is beauty . And for others , it is love . It may be different for each , but it is the same for each , for are not all these things the manifestations of His spirit in the world ? And eventually , I suppose , we all come to realize the need for the reality behind the manifestation  --  the need of God Himself . " Abigail Carfax paused , and the Irish maid , who had been waiting at the door , seized the occasion to announce to Mr. Sweyton that two gentlemen were waiting upstairs to see him . Sweyton excused himself , but before he left the room he came around to speak to Abigail Carfax . " May I compliment you , madam , on the profundity of your logic , and your powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet , sometime , as at the feet of a Gamaliel , and listen to your further views . Will you pardon my going now ? " Abigail Carfax blushed in her embarrassment , wondering if she had said too much , yet flattered to be so appreciated by one who was obviously a scholar . Later , thinking over what she had said , Abigail Carfax realized that the ideas which she had expressed were not ideas that she had evolved , or had assimilated . What she had spoken were truths she had learned from Martin , to whom they were the breath of life . She had spoken as an oracle speaks , without knowing precisely what she had said ; she had been the unconscious channel of a truth which had passed through her but which was not of her . As she recalled her precise words , she thought of  | them with something of awe and fear . For she recognized , with a sudden paleness , that she was neither prepared nor willing to abide by the truth which she had stated . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a hunger to explore ; rather than a desire to submit , an urge to be free ... . II Fenton Sweyton lived on the fourth and top floor of the house , where a skylight was available for his drafting table . He had two rooms , one of which served as a bed chamber and was sparsely furnished with a French bedstead , in pine , for which there were no curtains ; a wardrobe ; a washstand ; and a round , hooked rug . The other , which served as a workroom , was filled with a confusion of things , the impedimenta of a profession and the souvenirs of Sweyton 's private life . Besides an armchair , a battered secretary , and a bookcase , it contained a sextant , a globe on a stand , rolls of drawing paper in one corner , and a stack of portfolios in another , a plain table , and under the skylight a drafting table with a stool . The walls were covered with ship engravings , and the bookcase was filled principally with works @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sailing Directions " ; but it also contained a number of modern French works , as well as a shelf of classical authors . Among these were Vitruvius ' " Twelve Books of Architecture , " in Latin ; the " Dynamics " of Hero , in Greek ; the " Mechanics " of Aristotle ; Diodorus ' " History " ; and a copy of the " Odyssey . " In a letter rack were several unopened letters , some of them bills , and one or two notes in feminine handwriting . A basket near the drafting table was filled with crumpled sheets of drawing paper , the results of the day 's work , and at the bottom , a dis-  | carded theatre program and a wilted rose . In contrast to the confusion of the room was the neatness of the drafting table . In a groove at the head were a number of drafting pencils , neatly pointed , a draftsman 's pen , and an inkwell ; along one side were compasses , rules , and other drafting instruments ; while occupying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , tacked down and covered with tracing paper . The drafting sheet showed cross-sections of a hull , with specifications , about half of which had been carefully taken off on the tracing paper when the work was laid aside . All in all , the room reflected the tastes and interests of one who was both scholarly and practical , familiar with the philosophy as well as the mechanics of his profession , serious but also a dilettante . Sweyton 's visitors were examining the ship engravings on the walls when Sweyton entered . He recognized one of them as a prospective client , who had been to see him several times . " Oh , how do you do , Mr. Bismith , " he welcomed him . Bismith had turned and was beaming affably . " What a splendid collection you have ! " he exclaimed . " I am always overwhelmed . " He bowed . " Pardon me . Mr. Pitcrest , head of the House of Pitcrest , who is also interested in our little venture . Mr. Pitcrest  --  Mr. Fenton Sweyton . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the history of navigation . We observe that you have illustrations of sailing craft from antiquity to the present . " " Yes , " replied Sweyton , earnestly , shaking hands with his visitors , and then smoothing his hair . " I had the privilege of a classical education before taking up designing , and it has been useful in my profession . Be seated , gentlemen . " " I would have supposed that the world had made such progress  | in shipbuilding that it were a waste of time to study the ancients , " remarked Pitcrest , heavily . Sweyton had turned to the stack of portfolios in the corner . " On the contrary , Mr. Pitcrest , " he replied , speaking in a thoughtful , professional manner , while he proceeded to lay out certain drawings he had made . " The Egyptian shipbuilders had as remarkable achievements as the monument builders , and there is much to be learned from them . " " How very interesting , " exclaimed Bismith . " To what do you refer ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sweyton said , " the tendency , in long vessels , for the ends to drop , which is still a perplexing problem to designers , and one which I do n't believe will be satisfactorily met with our larger vessels until we have learned how to employ iron construction . The Egyptians , as the monuments reveal , used a double mast , set a little apart at the bottom , and lashed together at the top , forming a letter " A. " These masts were set abaft the beam , and were braced fore and aft by stays . The sails were cross-rigged , rather than fore and aft . To keep the vessels from hogging , the ends were braced by a truss that ran from stem to stern over forked posts . This method which they devised is thoroughly practical , and is still used in some shallow-draft vessels . Unfortunately , we have lost the art of its application in vessels of larger design . " " Yes , of course , " said Bismith . " The Egyptian vessels were small and useful only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , their vessels , some of them , were quite d large , and they were seagoing . One fleet went as far as the west coast of Africa . There is , indeed , no sailing vessel afloat today that equals what the Egyptians built . Those built by Queen Hatshepsut to bring down the obelisks from the upper Nile must have been above three hundred feet in length and around seventy  | feet at the beam . The Greeks also , who learned shipbuilding from the Egyptians , had some large vessels . No modern ship yet built equals the largest of the Greek and Roman galleys . The Leontophorus , described by Palmerius , had eight tiers of oars , a hundred in each tier , eight hundred on each side , or sixteen hundred in all . And Plutarch tells of a ship of sixteen banks of oars which Demetrius Poliorcetes , the besieger of Rhodes , built ? but considering how long and how heavy the oars in the upper banks must have been , and what strength it would take to handle them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statement . " But I am afraid I tire you with all this . Ship construction being my profession ? " " Not at all , not at all , " beamed Bismith . " What you say is most interesting . As a result of your researches you have developed some ideas of ship design that are absolutely original , so I understand . " " Not absolutely original , " protested Sweyton , " but a further extension of time-tested principles . " " What I should like to know , Mr. Sweyton , is this , " began Pitcrest in a weighty voice . " In what respects do you think your design represents an improvement over existing designs " In this , Mr. Pitcrest : the ships of my design will sail faster , carry greater cargo , show greater ease of handling , and less yardage of sail per ton of burden , than any vessels now on the seas . " " What do you say , Pitcrest ? " Bismith said , turning to Pitcrest . " For myself , I say we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your design , will you , Mr. Sweyton ? " Sweyton turned to his drawings . " With pleasure , gentlemen , " he said . " Now , here are the drawings and specifications for hull . You will note the length and sweep of the keel . Here , take this cross-section , and you can  | see the lines more particularly . Note that while I attain a graceful line from the cutwater to the stern , I have not lost below deck space nor stability . Here is a line that , with proper sail management , will give you magnificent speed . " Sweyton took down a stack of drawings , and as he talked lie exhibited first one and then another , to illustrate some aspect of his design to which he wished to call attention . He was talking rapidly and enthusiastically , and his speech was filled with technical terms , references to " buoyancy , " " stability , " " weatherliness , " " keelson , " " stemson , " until Pitcrest was in a maze . Finally , Bismith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say . You understand that we have an option on these designs " Yes , sir . " " Nell , I do n't propose to exercise this option , " Bismith announced abruptly . Sweyton paled in disappointment . " You do n't want them ? " he faltered . " There , there , my boy , " soothed Bismith . " Please understand . I do n't want these drawings . But here is what I do want . I commission you now , and Mr. Pitcrest is my witness , to execute for me a set of designs for a ship twice this size . " " Twice this size ! " exclaimed Sweyton , and the words were echoed by Pitcrest . " Yes , twice this size ! It is plain to be seen that you know ship designing . I am not a fool at these things , and I know skill and merit when I see it . " He went over and clapped Sweyton on the back . " I bank on you , " he exclaimed forcefully . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this size , which we will christen the Albatross , and I will take it . Twice this size , at least . " Sweyton was silent .  | " Come , how about it ? " " Mr. Bismith , " said Sweyton , with difficulty , " a ship twice this size involves entirely new principles of construction , new calculations of stress and balance . You ca n't simply inflate the measurements by two , and have a ship twice the size . Proportions are not fixed , except in relation to the whole . Grave questions of seaworthiness would enter . " " Seaworthiness ! Tut , tut ! " responded Bismith , snapping his fingers . " Why , the tubs I have seen putting to sea , and making port , would shame you to mention the subject . It 's a captain 's job to keep his vessel afloat , and they ca n't blame the designer , as they often try to do . You design the ship , and I 'll bank on its staying afloat . You know the problems , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ingenuity , and the imagination . Do n't let the size scare you . " Fenton Sweyton was still trying to get hold of himself . Various calculations were going through his mind , and certain visions as well , for his eyes , narrowed in thought , also sparkled with a light of recklessness and cupidity . " It is agreed , then ? " Bismith persisted , but in the tone of one who is quite confident of success . Sweyton swallowed hard . " Yes , " he said through dry lips . " I think I can do it . Yes , I am sure of it . Give me a little time , and I will submit a design . " " Splendid , splendid , " Bismith exclaimed , putting on his hat and moving toward the door . " I will send you the contract in the morning . Goodbye , Mr. Sweyton . " In the street , feebly illuminated by the gas lamps and by the stars that scintillated in the moonless night , Pitcrest drew his cloak more warmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : it was an evening of June , but a fresh breeze blew from the sea , and he felt a chill . His mind was staggered at the venture ,  | and his spirit quaked with fear . " Well , it 's settled , " remarked Bismith easily . " That lad is a genius , if ever I saw one , and with his designs I shall have no trouble at all in finding all the backers we need . It 's simply tremendous . It 's hard to grasp what it will mean  --  in profits . I take it you are committed . " Pitcrest swallowed hard . " I  --  I think so , " he faltered . " I  --  must think about it . I 'll let you know first thing in the morning . " " Splendid . Splendid , " said Bismith , with all the confidence in the world . " You will come along . You ca n't afford to miss the opportunity . But I will have to have your commitment tomorrow . III Amelia Pitcrest was up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was standing in the center of the drawingroom , her hard on her chin , surveying the furnishings , and going over in her mind the changes she wanted the decorators to make on the morrow , for the reception she was giving . As Pitcrest entered , she gave him a nod , that was both a welcome and a warning not to break the thread of her thought ; he paused on the threshold waiting the moment , while he himself went on thinking about his own problems . " Should I invest in this venture ? " Pitcrest was thinking . " Should I turn it down ? " Charles Pitcrest had reached his home in a state of mixed feelings . He was unable to make up his mind . The various pieces of logic that he needed to fill out his pattern were like cumbrous furniture in the chambers of thought ; he fumbled to arrange them without success . On the one hand was the profit that should , if all went well , run into millions . He had heard of one  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of the vessel and netted fifty thousand additional . But , of course , there was more competition now , and a great deal depended on how clever the captain was in picking up freight and negotiating rates . Much more , he thought , depended upon how good a seaman the captain was . A tremor of horror came over him at the thought of a ship , in which he had invested all his reserves , and for which he had mortgaged his business , going down in a storm , on its first voyage ; and the hair at the back of his neck ruffled . Amelia Pitcrest was counting off something on her fingers ? the number of guests probably  --  and was completely absorbed . Pitcrest wondered how much money the party would cost . This was a proper subject for concern , for his deposits in the Shawmut Savings Bank had been dwindling in recent years ; if , however , there was need for economy , Pitcrest would enforce it at the office . He doted on parties , especially large ones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pitcrest wondered who was coming . If his firm were one like Ticknor and Fields , he might be feting some literary celebrity ; but his authors , unfortunately , were all dead , or else they were clergymen and other dull people . Perhaps , he thought , he should adopt Bismith 's suggestion and add some popular story writer to his list . Bismith , he admitted , had good judgment . No , he thought , he must keep his business to its traditional lines . He could invest in this ship venture , and if it turned out well , everything would be his . Ahead was money , and position ? maybe he could run for Congress , or for the governorship  --  or even the United States Senate . . . . " Charles , " said Amelia Pitcrest bitter-sweetly , " just stand over there , will you ? I am trying to decide where to have Miss Burton stand when she sings . " Pitcrest obediently moved to the place indicated .  | " Miss Burton was simply charmed at the idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I showed her the guest list . But I had to make arrangements with her manager . She said all such things were in his hands . " " I hope it wo n't cost too much , " protested Pitcrest , while inwardly he was pleased at the thought of having Miss Burton . He had heard her at the Athen rum : what had charmed him was not her voice , but her portly , voluptuous figure , and round , sensuous face . All during the concert he had been thinking certain lewd thoughts of her , until his neck had grown quite warm and uncomfortable . On the way home he had ventured the suggestion that she might be engaged to sing at the reception Amelia Pitcrest was planning , and Amelia had seized upon the idea . Now , while Amelia was speaking , he saw Miss Burton standing beside her , while Amelia made the introduction . The contrast was all against Amelia , who was lean , sharp-featured , with piercing brown eyes well sunk in her head and divided by a nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not enough to bankrupt us , " said Mrs. Pitcrest , tartly , in reply to Pitcrest 's protest , " and it should pay dividends over and over . I sometimes wonder if you realize how much of a help I have been to you in your career , by maintaining our social position . There is no house in Boston to which people would give more for an invitation than to this . " " Damn it all , " exclaimed Pitcrest with sudden irritation . " It 's all give and no take , I say . People like to come here , but I do n't see them returning the invitation . " " If they do n't , " responded Amelia Pitcrest sweetly , " it 's because of your boorishness . I have plenty of invitations . " " Yes , you are good , good , good , " Pitcrest fumed . He did not dare go too far with his wife . Amelia Pitcrest , indeed , promptly stopped him .  | " I think , dear , perhaps you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones . " You are tired . I can do better alone . " Pitcrest strode out and clopped up the stairs to his room . He was tired , but he was not sleepy , and now he was irritated . While preparing for bed , he recalled the manuscript that was in his satchel . He had brought it along with him , for some reason he could not recall now ; but it had not been to read it . In fact , at the time Abigail Carfax had given it to him , the only reason he had accepted it was that she was a pretty woman , and she would call again . He thought , now , that he might look into it . He clumped down to the hall closet , fished out the manuscript , noting as he did so that Amelia was still engaged in her cogitation , and returned to his bedroom . Undressing , he made ready for bed , drew back the coverlets , and turned out all the lights except that of the lamp at his bedside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ globe , of wine-colored glass , and a huge shade , of the same shape and color , the effect of which was to cast a dull rosy radiance over the room . Piling the pillows behind his back , Pitcrest put on his spectacles and took up the manuscript . " The Bride of the Viking . " The title caught Pitcrest 's eyes , and for a moment he simply looked at the words , written in a large , round , firm hand . Then , slowly , he turned the page , and came to Chapter One . This began as follows : " In the haven of Tornavik , on the forbidding coasts of Norway , dwelt one Ruud , a Viking , a young man , tall and fair , like Sem his father , who had in days gone by sailed in stout ships upon the farthermost seas . " Pitcrest was struck by the coincidence : he had this day been talking of ships and shipbuilding , and here was a book that  | dealt with ships and sailing . His curiosity was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marvelous power of expression : her swift-paced words drew her readers on as Apollo 's steeds must have swept along the chariot of the sun  --  in blinding magnificence , ever mounting upward , to the zenith of desire and aspiration . In this quality of swiftness , of surge , of impetuous power , " The Bride of the Viking " is unexcelled among Abigail Carfax 's works , and no better evidence of the fact is found than in the way it carried Charles Pitcrest along , from curiosity , to fascination , to enthrallment , until he had completely forgotten his irritation with Amelia and the worries about investment . The flame in the lamp , after some hours , began to flicker . Pitcrest arose and trimmed the wick , poured himself a glass of brandy from the decanter , drew his dressing-gown the more closely around him , against the chill of the night , and settled himself to read on . The language had cast a spell over him : at the same time that it had quieted his vague worries , it had collected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sent them as golden darts winging into the night . Pitcrest could not recall when he had read anything that had so captivated him . There was nothing like it in the brooding , tragic , and pessimistic works of the European writers which he published ; here was something fresh , optimistic , vital , aspiring , intense , like the very spirit of the New World . It imparted to him an elan of the spirit , a physical refreshment even ; the clock in the hall had struck two , but he seemed unaware of the hour ; he hurried on , from adventure to adventure , while his own strength seemed to expand , strong to wield the weighty battle-axe of the Viking , strong to breast the tempestuous seas that swept over the vessel , strong to climb the rocky heights where the Bride lay in thrall .... Pitcrest found  | himself unable to put down the work until he had finished it . It was past four when , with a sigh , he turned the final page , lay back in his bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of literature is to experience a rebirth of the spirit . Something of greatness was present in Abigail Carfax 's writing . Its effect upon Charles Pitcrest was tremendous . The effect was to purge his spirit . He felt like a new man , with thoughts resolved , with purpose clear . When he laid aside his dressing gown and turned to bed , he had resolved upon a matter for the day : he would get in touch with Bismith and tell him that he was prepared to go along with him in the building of a clipper ship ... . An aqueous gray , herald of morning , was at the window , and a fresh breeze stirred in the room . Pitcrest felt a healthy relaxation of the body , and a contentment of the mind . " Perhaps , " he thought , as he dozed off , " perhaps I should consider a new policy for the House of Pitcrest , say , publish a novel or two . . . I will ask Bismith today what he thinks .... " IV After much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to publish " The Bride of the Viking . " He never trusted his own judgment , and notwithstanding the fascination which the work had exercised over him , he had turned it over to his readers for their opinion . They were a cold-blooded group , who looked upon anything subsequent to john Milton as modern , and as a barbarism any usage not authorized by King James . Their model of poetry was the sonnet ; a drama was incomplete that did not have five acts ; as for the novel , it was an amorphous form of literature , or hermaphroditic  --  either a degenerate form of the drama , in which the author , too lazy to meet the disci-  | pline of the stage , allows himself to interpolate , to explain , and to justify matters which properly are the burden of the characters and the action ; or a degenerate form of essay , in which the author , equally incapable of stating an abstract thesis , must instance , and analogize , and bring forth puppets to parable his meaning . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unknown author , their collective eyebrows lifted , and Pitcrest was frightened at his temerity , but as they were paid on a fee basis , and needed employment , having long ago given their collective approval of the " Anabasis , " " Dr. Faustus , " and the " Inferno , " they accepted the commission . To Pitcrest 's dismay , his readers submitted a qualified approval of " The Bride of the Viking . " The period was classic  --  that is , of a time prior to the Crusades ; the theme was elevating ; and the style had a purity and power reminiscent of the King James version . On the other hand , the readers found the action undignifiedly swift , and the structure unformed and awkward in places , but evidently they did not consider these as unforgivable faults , for they concluded their report ambiguously . They said the novel had undoubted appeal , and therefore great possibilities of sale , but they also reminded Mr. Pitcrest that " many worthy works J must be omitted from the list if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The decision was , therefore , again in Pitcrest 's lap . Pitcrest , teetering in his convictions as to the importance of traditions , already considering himself a ship owner as well as publisher , as a result of his decision to go along with Bismith , consulted his new-found companion and mentor as to his policy . Bismith had clear ideas on the subject , and had already expressed them . " Modernize your business , " he said . " Get some new authors , American authors , authors that reflect this new age in which we live . "  | The more Pitcrest considered this advice , the more sensible it seemed . He adopted it , wrote Abigail Carfax a note advising her that the House of Pitcrest had concluded to publish " The Bride of the Viking . " .. . This decision , though it broke with the traditions of the House , was a small matter to Pitcrest among the large affairs that were on his mind ; but with Abigail Carfax it represented an extraordinary event in her life . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The note had reached her toward the end of the month , at a moment when she was counting over the last of her monthly allowance , pencil in hand , trying to figure how much was left for this and how much for that . Jason brought up the letter ; she took it and opened it at once , more because it was a diversion from her concern than from any sense of expectancy . She read it rapidly , and what struck her first was the reference to the method of payment . Pitcrest had not said how much he would pay  --  it was to be a percentage of sales , it seemed  --  but obviously it meant that some of her financial worries were relieved . She could get away from boarding-house life , which , for all its small amenities , was no place in which to rear her children . She could take a small house of her own , and she could give the children a few of the comforts which they had been denied since coming to Boston ... . The thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . The young man , Robert Ware , had reminded her that the House published no contemporary fiction ; if this were so , it meant that she had been extraordinarily honored . She was , she began to realize , an author ! This was a momentous thing . All her life she had stood in awe of authorship . Books had been storehouses for her , storehouses filled with wonders , with strange scenes and adventurous happenings , and their authors were the necromancers who uttered the Open Sesame to  | their treasures . Now , she was an author , one of those who were privileged to pronounce the word . Suddenly she went cold ; her hands dropped into her lap nervelessly ; she experienced a numbness like that which follows a delivery , the same momentary deadness to sensation that had followed the birth of Jason , and of Estelle . The feeling on those occasions had passed when they brought the baby to her , and she saw the squirming little body , so red and immaculate , and had been followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . This feeling would pass also , but not so quickly . It would be accompanied by uneasiness , and strain , as she thought of how she would adjust herself to this new fact . For on those occasions she had given birth to a new life , but on this it was as though she were experiencing birth , a birth into a new world and a new realm of experience ... . Writing , she had discovered while on the Dauntless , was a fascinating occupation . She had found that she could spend hours at it without tiring  --  in conjuring up images , and incidents , and scenes , and fashioning words and phrases that would give them life . It had been like an elixir to her spirit to take up a smooth white sheet of paper and to watch small black marks appear on it , like sprouts upon a ploughed field , and to see them grow , to spring up as warriors , ladies , turreted castles , and all the paraphernalia of a drama ... . She must write another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , as she was returning from Pitcrest 's , a month ago . Seeing the masts rising above the buildings along the waterfront , thinking of the ships gathered in Boston harbor from the distant parts of the earth , had put a story into her mind , the story of a seafarer who had crossed many degrees of latitude , and through strange adventures , to eventual fortune and peace . It was a story that moved with the spirit of high adventure , of  | indomitable enthusiasm , and of self-assurance , the spirit of one who has never known defeat and who has reduced every obstacle . The scheme of the story had since died in her thoughts , smothered by the annoyances and worries she had been facing , but now it rose to her mind again , in fresher and more magnificent panoply , and with it the title ? " Degrees of Latitude " ? the adventurous story of a gentleman of fortune of the sixteenth century who would embody all those virtues of courage , and aspiration , and love of freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she thought , begin upon it at once ... .  | Chapter Five I IN THE WALL of the compound of the American College at Salamat is an old street gate of iron-studded timbers , now no longer used , but preserved as a memento of the beginnings of the missionary enterprise in Salamat . Over this gate is a solid , beamed gate-house , also preserved for its historical associations . It was in the long upper room of this gate-house that Martin Carfax founded his House of Prayer when he came to Salamat to preach the Christian gospel , and it was through the old gate below , that the " inquirers " passed who subsequently became the first Christian converts in Salamat . These two reminders of the past are preserved almost as shrines . Once a year there is a solemn procession of the church through the gate  --  a service reminiscent , on a modest scale , of the Jubilee entrance of the Pope into Saint Peter 's  --  while during Lent the ordination class at the College holds its daily communion service in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectangular chamber , whitewashed , with little niches in the wall used to hold tiny vases of flowers , and is furnished only with a carpet and a Mohammedan lectern  --  just as it was in Martin Carfax 's time . The carpet is a replacement , but the lectern is the original used by the missionary . It is a cross-shaped stand , of finely lacquered wood , two branches of which form the supports , while the opened Book rests in the angle formed by the other two . In reading the Scrip-  | tures , Martin Carfax would kneel behind the lectern , Persian fashion , his shoes removed and his feet tucked under him . He had a vibrant and richly modulated voice , and the Persians , who are noted for their melodious voices and who pride themselves on their mastery of the art of recitation , always went away pleased by his reading , if they were not always moved by what he read . If , however , his listeners were not persuaded by what he read , Martin Carfax used no other arts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and relied solely upon the Scriptures , which he read to them in Henry Martyn 's translation into the Persian , understood by all his listeners , if it was not the native tongue of all . His services in the House of Prayer consisted simply of this reading of the Scriptures , followed by a few minutes of silent prayer . Those whom the Spirit moved might come to him later and talk to him and ask him to explain this or that passage , but he would never , of his own accord , seek out listeners for his views . It was Martin Carfax 's faith that there was power in the Word and that this power was greater than any sermonizing power of his , and he did not believe in encroaching upon " these precious minutes , " as he called them , when the Voice of God was speaking , or in presuming to interpret the Lord to His children . This attitude of humility toward his gifts had always been difficult for Abigail Carfax to understand . Her introduction to Martin had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a matter of theology . He was a young theological student then , who had come to South Oaks for the summer to work for his uncle , and he had called on Abigail 's father as a matter of courtesy to the pastor of the church . Mr. Littlefield , who accounted himself as something of a scholar , on learning that young Carfax was reading for orders , had immediately begun  | to discuss the doctrine of predestination , on which he held decided views . It had been the young man 's vigorous defense of a contrary view that had aroused Abigail 's curiosity and interest . Later , on the mission field , when Martin began to grow more diffident about his ideas , she could not understand this change in attitude , and when , in starting his House of Prayer , he announced that he was giving up preaching , she was perplexed . " But you are an apostle to these people , Martin , " she had protested once , " and you should be a flaming brand in their midst . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , " but I feel that a little candle burning in a dark room is the better metaphor . " " When I read the Scriptures to the congregation , " he added , thoughtfully , " I am reminded of the Persian proverb  --  you know how it goes  --  What is a candle to the sun , or the highest minaret before Demavend ? ' " Abigail was inclined at times to think that Martin was allowing himself to be submerged and repressed too much by the environment of the country . She felt he should be more self-assertive and vigorous in combating the evils which were on every hand , and , in particular , the deadening customs of the country . After her visit to the haremlik of Farman-i-Dowleh she had become vehemently indignant at the seclusion of women , and thought that , for an example to them of the freedom which Western women enjoyed and of the emancipation which they might achieve by courage , she should discard the short veil which European women wore as a concession to their customs . Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be molested , that the men would insult me ? " she had inquired . " Not that , " Martin answered . " You have too much dignity for that . It 's just ? "  | Again he seemed to be reluctant to take a positive position . " Yes ? " Abigail persisted . " It 's just that I do n't think it our business to set customs for them , " he said finally . Abigail showed amazement . " But when the customs are so horrible ? " she asked . " That raises a question , on both sides of which a great deal may be said , " replied Martin slowly , earnestly . " I have great respect for the customs of a people , however repugnant they may be to me personally . A custom represents the instinctive effort of a society to discipline itself to a path . Where there are no customs there is no restraint , and where there is no restraint there is anarchy . A custom represents a spiritual groping or aspiration , and conformity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until a higher discipline is achieved , I would be reluctant to interfere with a custom . " Abigail had felt abashed , and , often , as she thought about it later , a little resentful . She considered that Martin perhaps did not understand the depth of the yearning for freedom and liberty which these Persian women must feel , and with which she sympathized , and that he was inclined to take a typical masculine viewpoint , which he cloaked by a profession of spiritual humility . This might have become a conviction with her , as with the passing years she began to feel more and more in a personal way the bondage which pertains not only to womankind but to those who have put themselves under subjection to a task , but for the fact that Martin was so consistently humble , and the further fact that it gave him a surprising strength . The Scripture readings in the House of Prayer brought many inquirers to Martin 's door , and in answer to their questions he would freely expound the Gospel meaning , as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned men came to envy him  | for his powers of statement , his ability to confute them with a word , and were amazed that one who , in all things so humble , so submissive in spirit , could breathe such fires of courage into the nostrils of his listeners . These learned men , unfortunately , had reduced spiritual experience to a question of logic , and they could not understand a man like Martin , to whom religion was not a mystifying something that enmeshes men 's thoughts , like cobwebs , but a mysterious something that holds men 's souls , like bands of iron . Once a mullah challenged Martin Carfax on a mystery of the Christian faith , hoping to entangle him in a dilemma . It was on the question of the Sacrament of the Eucharist , a conception as repugnant to Moslems as to the Jews , interdicted by the Mosaic Code from the tasting of blood . The mullah 's attack occurred at the entrance to the Potters ' Market , a broad esplanade , the principal shopping quarter of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to watch the discomfiture of the firenghi . Moreover , he chose a time shortly before the Ten Days of Moharram , the festival of fanaticism , when the pious , gowned in white , with shaven heads , and bearing naked swords , march through the streets in great processions , mutilating themselves in mourning for the Imam Ali  --  an appropriate season to bait a Christian . The mullah  --  Rashid Seyyid was his name , and he was a leading ecclesiastic of Salamat  --  accosted Martin Carfax , as he was coming out of the bazaar , standing before him so that Martin , blinded from the light of the sun after the dusk of the bazaar , almost collided with him . He was a tall man , a Persian of the finest breed , with swarthy complexion , aquiline nose , and lean , intelligent face . He stood before Martin clad in a rich gabardine bound at the waist with a green sash , the mark of a seyyid , a descendant of the Prophet ; on his head was a huge white turban , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group of his fol-  | lowers , acolytes of the mosque , students , and recipients of the mosque 's alms , waiting for what answer the firenghi would make . " You are an expounder of your faith , " Rashid Seyyid said , inclining his head with pronounced courtesy , " and a man full , no doubt , of wisdom concerning its doctrines and its mysteries . " " You have come , " he continued , with rising inflection , " to expound your faith among our people , and to lead them away from the One God , and the True Prophet . We listen with patience , and with respect , until we grow confounded , and our heart cries out in bewilderment . " A tone of polite defiance had crept into his voice , and now he paused , and his eyes swept the circle of onlookers that awaited expectantly the denouement of the affair . Martin was waiting patiently . " I have a question , " exclaimed the mullah . " Answer me this ! " And then he stated his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abattoir , of the most offensive to Moslem ears , in a manner to arouse the scorn and spite of his adherents . When he had finished , Martin waited for a moment , and then , looking at the mullah with great earnestness and humility , he replied : " I am told that fish taken from the Tanga Chai " ( this was the name of the stream that flowed down from the mountains through the city of Salamat ) " taste better when caught above the Shah Abbas bridge than when caught below . Why this should be I know not  --  it is a mystery . But I have seen hungry men crying for alms in your streets to whom a fish from the Tanga Chai , caught either above or below the bridge , would taste like those drawn from the River of Paradise , more luscious than fruit from the Sacred Tree . To such men , there is no mystery , nor do  | they desire to fathom it should such exist . They hunger , and they yearn for food . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of righteousness , and the meat of grace , and thirst for eternal life , and forgiveness of their sin , that weighs them down like fagots on the shoulder of a porter . And to such as hunger and thirst , Jesus Christ offers His body broken for the sake of many , and His blood , shed for the remission of sins , and to them , whether they fathom the mystery or not , there is refreshment , and illuminating sunlight , and joy , and peace , and a vision of Paradise . " Another day , Mullah Rashid , and I shall be glad to discuss these matters with you more fully . But your festival draws nigh , and you are , no doubt , much occupied , and I should not detain you . Command our departure . " Martin bowed low in salutation ; the mullah , confounded by the missionary 's courage , bowed likewise , and Martin departed in quiet . Abigail Carfax was with her husband at the time , and upon her the occurrence made a deep impression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group , their evil intent written in their gleaming , hatred-expelling eyes ; when she saw how easily the arrow was turned aside , she felt a thrill , and was thankful to be the wife of a man who could show such courage , such mastery of himself , and of circumstance ; she had the sensation , as she described it in one of her letters home , of being " one of a group of first-century disciples , walking the unfriendly streets of Ephesus , led by an elder who had walked and talked with the Master . " Since returning to America , however , and particularly during these latter weeks , the feeling of perplexity regarding her husband 's attitude had again begun to disturb Abigail Carfax , and she discovered , with a sense of dismay , that doubts as to its  | validity were rising within her . She had come to accept Martin 's views , but they had never become inherent with her , and if at times in Persia , when Martin was near , they had seemed a little distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when he was so far away . Martin , it seemed , believed in bondage , while Abigail 's heart cried out for freedom , and if she had freely accepted the bondage of love she did not accept so freely the bondage of faith . It was the bondage of the faith which had begun to irk Abigail Carfax recently , and gall her with the sense of physical and spiritual separation from her husband , and the source of her doubts and perplexities was the unsatisfying character of the church associations which she had formed on her return to Boston . II On settling down in Boston , Abigail Carfax had , as a matter of course , united with the nearest congregation of her denomination . It was an unfortunate selection , for the church was one in which the sap of vitality had long since ceased to flow . It had its complement of auxiliaries and societies , all of them functioning , and to all appearances prosperously , but they were like millstones grinding without wheat . They met , considered their budgets , heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then adjourned , to debate and gossip in the antechamber . A good deal of this decadence was due to the minister , Matthew Eliot , who doted on sermons and made them longer but never shorter , and in consequence never had time for pastoral visitations or personal work . After squirming about under one or two of Mr. Eliot 's sermons , Abigail Carfax was tempted to try elsewhere , but she knew what Martin would say . He would  | laughingly tell her to accept it as a visitation of the Lord and be patient . There could be worse things , of course , than long-winded sermons . Abigail Carfax was inclined to think one of them was an officious minister 's wife . Since Mr. Eliot spent most of his time preparing his sermons , the management of the church fell largely to Mrs. Eliot . She was well fitted for pastoral responsibility . She had an exuberant disposition and executive inclinations , and she was fond of giving functions for the numerous groups of the congregation . She was in her sixties , portly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absoluteness of her conventional standards . She presided over the society of the congregation with the authority of a khanum in a haremlik . Unfortunately for Abigail Carfax , she held the view that female missionaries were in the same category as nuns and should seclude themselves in reticent behavior and modest attire . The parsonage occupied by the Eliots was blessed with a beautiful lawn , and Mrs. Eliot had installed a croquet set for the use of various young people 's groups of the congregation . It was a form of recreation that was not new , but one that was coming into vogue as an entertaining and respectable game for those who otherwise avoided sports as works of the devil . In due course Jason and Estelle received an invitation to a party for children of their age which Mrs. Eliot was giving , in which a feature of the entertainment would be croquet . Abigail Carfax was delighted that the children were to have this opportunity for a new recreation and to form associations and friendships in the environment in which their life would hereafter move . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some reason , Jason showed reluctance to go . " There will be other boys and girls there  --  boys and girls you  | will be with for several years  --  and I am sure you will have a good time , " his mother persuaded , " and you will find croquet to be a very interesting game , too  --  somewhat like the polo which the governor 's horsemen played on the maidan . You do n't ride horses , of course , and there are little wickets through which you drive the ball . A boy with a keen eye and strong arms , like yours , should do very well at the game . " " And perhaps you can tell the others about some of the Persian games you know , " she added encouragingly . " They would be interested in your experiences , I am sure . " It developed that Jason was embarrassed because of his clothes . Some of the boys , it seemed , had made fun of them . " Oh , why did n't you tell me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown tomorrow and get you a new suit . " Jason showed pleasure , but he said : " No , mother , I do n't need a new suit . Besides , it will cost money . " " Let 's not worry about that , " said Abigail Carfax cheerfully . " Have n't I sold a book ? And we should be able to get you some clothes if you need them . " Abigail Carfax 's complacency about money was more apparent than real . She had taken a house on the strength of the news that " The Bride of the Viking " was to be published , only to discover that some time would elapse before she would receive any payment for the work . In his letter to Abigail Carfax , Pitcrest had merely stated his " intention " of publishing the story . This formal language had sounded better than it meant . The contract was to come later , and compensation still later . Instead of paying an outright sum for the manuscript , Pitcrest had taken the precaution to insert in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of payment of so much a copy , as and when the books were sold . This was a detail which Abigail Carfax had ignored in her delight at the news . The next day , however , she took Jason to Washington Street , and in Carson and Scott 's she allowed him to make a selection . She thought then of Estelle , at home , who had said nothing about her needs . It would not do not to get her something also . There were some beautiful frocks on display  --  or so they seemed to Abigail Carfax , who had in the years of her absence lost whatever taste she had in dress  --  and as they were of Estelle 's size , she purchased one . When Abigail Carfax called for the children at the close of the party , Mrs. Eliot drew her aside and spoke to her . " What lovely children you have  --  your daughter especially , " she said , in a tone that intimated she had some reservations to make . " How naive and charming Estelle is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of her husband 's flock , Mrs. Eliot considered it her obligation to interest herself in their morals , manners , and welfare . Abigail Carfax sensed the nuance in Mrs. Eliot 's voice . " She is not dressed suitably ? " she asked quickly . Her brown eyes had begun to flash , and the color to mount her ivory throat . " You have been gone so long , my dear , " Mrs. Eliot explained , " that you find it hard to realize what changes in customs have occurred , or what demands these new customs make upon those who love the Lord and His ways . " " Why , I bought the dress only yesterday , " protested Abigail Carfax hotly . " When everyone is going in for gaudiness and display , I think it ill becomes us , as exponents of a spiritual life , to follow in their  | train , even at a discreet distance , " Mrs. Eliot replied , oracularly . " With each trying to outdo the other in swathing herself with yards of ribbon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ostentation of their elders , and load themselves down with frills and fringes , our duty , I should say , is to challenge such display by the very severity of our dress . Rather than to use a yard of lace when the fashion demands ten , we should use none at all . We gain nothing for the Kingdom by refusing to sacrifice to the idol if , at the same time , we eat the idol 's meat . People say , Ah , you would worship , had you the means : " Abigail Carfax controlled herself and thanked Mrs. Eliot for the good-will that prompted the counsel ; but at home she went into a cold fury . Why should Mrs. Eliot lecture her about clothes ? Who was she , with her expensive gray broadcloth , to talk about modesty ? She , Abigail Carfax , had not had a new dress since she had come home . She knew that she looked outlandish in her antiquated frocks , for she had seen too many people looking at her not to know , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her that only the spirit mattered . But a pious fraud , like Mrs. Eliot , could stand and tell her to her face that she was worldly-minded and fastidious ! She stood before a mirror and looked at herself , at the shabby brown gabardine , cut in a mode that was at least ten years old , and needing mending here and there . But underneath this gabardine was no fat paunch like that under Mrs. Eliot 's gray broadcloth . No , and no flabby double chin hanging upon the ruffle at the throat . A fair , firm neck , and above that a well-formed head and face . . . . In sudden bitterness and anger , Abigail Carfax tore her dress at the throat and pulled it off , until it lay in a circular heap at her feet , and she stood in her muslin camisole and petticoat , gazing at it in stupefaction at her own violence ... .  | III Abigail Carfax 's decision to take a house of her own , and her choice of house , proved to be errors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ undergoing . Aside from the constant pressure which it put upon her to find the rent money  --  which persisted up until " The Bride of the Viking " was published ? the house itself had disadvantages which affected her peace of mind , if she did not consciously recognize the fact . The house was furnished with such an ill-assorted variety of objects as would drive anyone but their collector to distraction . The owner had had a moderately well filled purse and an unbridled fancy , and his only check had been the limited capacity of the rooms . In the small parlor was an Empire sofa , with elaborately curving arm rests , upholstered in a fabric that clashed violently with the wallpaper ; two wing chairs ; a round mahogany table , loaded with knick-knacks ; a tall secretary ; a commode ; and an urn stand . The urn which the stand once supported had been broken at some time in the past , and in its place was a large mollusk shell , an article of decoration very popular at the time , and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures on the walls , lamps on the mantel , heavy draperies at the windows , and whatever else would give an air of opulence and stuffiness to the room . When she had first looked at the house , Abigail Carfax had been taken by all this display , so much in contrast to the bareness and simplicity to which she had been accustomed in Persia , both in her own house and those of the Persians , that it gave her a new sense of freedom and dominion . Her tastes in such things were somewhat deficient , and she had imagined that all this was in the authentic spirit of the mode . Later , the sight of it began to affect her with an indefinable irritation , and she could not , or  | would not , recognize the cause . The house lay in Chester Street , a short street that ended , north of Tremont , in the marshes of Back Bay . It long ago disappeared as a separate identity and is today a section of a principal artery of modern Boston , lined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic . At the time , however , it was a new section on the outskirts of the city , built up by real estate promoters on filled-in Back Bay land , with houses which uniformly were of two stories , small , of flimsy construction , and of a design considered modern for the period . As the street was steadily being extended by filling in the marsh , the neighborhood was noisy from morning to night with the sounds of new construction , and of drays and carts passing in the street . It was among these surroundings that Abigail Carfax wrote her second novel , " Degrees of Latitude . " With mounting annoyances  --  money worries , the tyranny of convention , the drabness and noise of Chester Street  --  added to mounting loneliness , she found it harder and harder to sustain the mood in which she had started the book . In the effort to insulate herself from her surroundings , she began the habit of working in a darkened room . Shortly after breakfast she would retire to her bedroom , a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darker by closing the blinds and drawing the curtains , and there she would work until noon . Not the least of the disagreeable features of Chester Street were the marsh odors that pervaded it when the wind was offshore . These odors , being compounded of the smell of fish , seaweed , salt , and possibly a little sulphur , were not considered unhealthful  --  some of the older residents asserted positively they were salubrious , and spoke of them as the Swiss speak of the air from the higher Alps  --  but to one accustomed to the dry uplands of Persia , they were far from agreeable . It was not long after-  | ward that Estelle developed a cough , which Abigail Carfax attributed to these " swamp airs , " though no doubt the change to the lower altitude of Boston was equally a factor . As Estelle 's cough persisted , Abigail Carfax concluded to consult Dr. Helder . His place in Salem Street was not accessible by tram , and so they walked . The district , she discovered , was even more drab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the immigrants , who filled the alleys with their dirty children , their windows with dirty linen , and their doorways with quarreling women . The street sweepers , always so busy in Washington and Tremont , never seemed to come here , and in the gutters rubbish , fruit skins , and carriage leavings accumulated . . . . At Dr. Helder 's door , however , things were better , an air of cleanliness prevailed , and two or three fashionable carriages stood at the curb . Dr. Helder 's quarters , also , were those of a more prosperous district  --  commodious , if plain , and well provided with furniture , journals , and medical equipment ... . While they waited , Dr. Helder passed through the room with a patient , and , seeing them , nodded and smiled . Abigail Carfax noted the zestfulness of his stride and the new expression in his face , a look of returning youthfulness , of new contentment and alertness . When , a little later , they were shown into his consulting-room , he arose with extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his face wreathed with smiles . Abigail Carfax congratulated the physician on his success in so quickly establishing himself in his work . " Thank you , thank you , " replied Dr. Helder , speaking in English . " But it is not my skill , I must confess , but my German . Many of my patients are from central Europe ; their command of English is as faulty as my own  --  but I speak better now , do n't you think ? ? but I get along very well with them in German . And so they come to me. "  | " But not with all of them , " he added with a twinkle . " The Irish  --  ah , begorra and bejabbers , but they are a lot . " He said this last in an excellent imitation of an Irish brogue . " They speak English worse than I , and how they bellow because I can not understand them . " " I am glad to learn , Dr. Helder , that like the rest of us you are sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then more seriously spoke of the cause of her visit . After some questions regarding the symptoms , Dr. Helder proceeded to an examination of Estelle . At the conclusion he patted the child 's shoulder affectionately and said : " We have a precious jewel , Mrs. Carfax , and we must watch over her carefully . " He went on to say , in a professional way , " I am glad you brought Estelle in . These coughs can turn into something serious . However , at the moment the prescription is nothing more than rest and plenty of fresh air and sunlight , and a little medicine for which I shall write out an order . I shall want to see Estelle again if she is not completely well within , say , a fortnight . " Estelle looked up at him gratefully and happily . " Have you been studying hard ? " Dr. Helder asked her . " We entered the term late , sir , and we had to if we caught up , " the child replied . " Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a book until school opens . " Seeing the look of disappointment on Estelle 's face , he added , understandingly , " That is , not more than once a day , and then to read not more than twenty-five pages . " " Oh , thank you , Dr. Helder . There are so many interesting things which we have missed all this time , that I am glad you will let me read a little . " " But on condition that you stay outdoors the rest of the time . " " I promise . "  | " You are a very good patient , Estelle , " Dr. Helder added , " and for that I have something for you  --  something I have been wanting to send you . On the table in my study-room you will find a portfolio . It contains several etchings . You may have the one of your choice . Good ? " " Oh , thank you ! " exclaimed Estelle . " Thank you . " She picked up her hat and hurried out . Dr. Helder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , wrote a prescription , then turned to Abigail Carfax . As he looked into her face , his smile dissolved into an expression of puzzlement . " I think I should give you the same advice that I have just given Estelle , " he said with professional gravity , as he handed her the prescription . " You seem pale yourself , as though you wanted sunlight . Paleness is , I realize , a mark of beauty among this generation , but with you it is not necessary . " " I have been writing another story , " explained Abigail Carfax , " and perhaps I am a little tired . " " Is this work so important ? " Dr. Helder asked . " No , " confessed Abigail Carfax , nervously plucking at the fringe of her bertha . " I ca n't say that it is important . It simply is necessary . It keeps my mind off other things . " Dr. Helder was understanding . He fumbled about in his secretary , as though searching for something , then ahemmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes . " The word burst forth bitterly . " I understand , " said the physician slowly . " And that is something for which I have no medicine . I can only share your feeling . " Abigail Carfax was staring at the floor .  | " Why not a little visit to Nahant to see the yacht races , or a drive to Brookline ? " Dr. Helder suggested . " It would do your spirits good , and is excellent for the complexion . " Abigail Carfax smiled wryly . " A drive to Brookline , when I have n't enough for carriage hire here ? " " I 'm sorry , " Dr. Helder said , confused ; and then , recovering himself , exclaimed lightly : " So there are money difficulties also ? " " Some . None to worry about . But prices of things are very high  --  higher than I had imagined . " " Money is like a blanket , " consoled the physician easily . " It need not be so thick , or rich , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears . One may as well freeze to death as have cold feet . " Abigail Carfax laughed . " You have good , sensible philosophy , " she said . " Better than a philosophy , I have a program , " exclaimed the physician , standing up . " As you can see , your good wishes for me when we parted have been granted . I am prospering more than I need . Under the circumstances would it not be approriate for me to make a thank offering to the Church ? " " Not necessarily , " replied Abigail Carfax . " You express your gratitude in your work . " " But I think so . And what would be more appropriate than to make it for a purpose  --  a small gift toward the support of three of the Church 's wards ? " " Please , " Dr. Helder exclaimed , when Abigail Carfax attempted to protest . " I know how difficult are the problems of getting settled . And I know how doubly difficult they can be when there are two lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | Abigail Carfax smiled wanly . " You are very kind , Dr. Helder , and I am grateful , " she said . " But it would not do . I should be able to manage with little , and to content myself . It is a test of character to which I should be equal . " " And you have the character and capacity , " exclaimed Dr. Helder admiringly . " Still , there is nothing to ruin one 's sleep and unfit one for the day like cold toes . And it takes so very little more blanket to cover them . And besides , there are plenty of sheep bleating to be sheared . Take my wool , ' they say . " " I understand your kind spirit , Dr. Helder , " Abigail Carfax said , smiling at the physician 's ludicrous similes , " and I am deeply appreciative . " She arose to go . " Bear with me a moment , " Dr. Helder added , grimly ; and as Abigail Carfax waited , he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that as the body can not exist without the flow of blood , and that as the blood is sterile without air , so none of us can survive alone , but all of us are dependent on each other . Do not try to stand too much alone , or rely too much on your own strength . " Abigail Carfax could stand no more of this talk . She turned to the physician , indignantly . " You do well to give me such advice , Dr. Helder , " she replied with vehemence . " You , who have always been a free spirit , doing as you pleased , to remind me of my dependence . What do you know of restraints and bonds ? " An expression of pain appeared in Dr. Helder 's face . Abigail Carfax was suddenly contrite . " Forgive me , " she exclaimed impulsively , putting her hand in the physician 's . " I have been very rude , and I appreciate your kindly interest . "  | Dr. Helder smiled , and then averted his face . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collection of etchings spread before her . " Have you selected the one you like ? " the physician asked in a cheery manner . " Yes , " replied the child delightedly , and added , " but since it is the prettiest , I think you should keep it . " " Not at all , not at all . Besides , this is my favorite " ? picking up another ? " and since it is , I am going to give it to you also . Oh , I shall see it , for I am coming to see you  --  now that you are under my care . " He laid it with the other , rolled the two together , and tucked them under Estelle 's arm . " Goodbye , Estelle . Goodbye , Mrs. Carfax , " he called as they withdrew . On the way home Estelle talked eagerly and excitedly of the adventure , of Dr. Helder , and his kindnesses . Abigail Carfax hardly heard her . She was in a mood of deep dissatisfaction with herself . Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own inadequacy  --  her inability to enjoy a friendship and a loyalty freely offered , or to give a measure in return . All this distemper of the soul she hung on her gnawing loneliness . She felt her dependence upon Martin , and for the first time since the day they had exchanged the promises of love she found in this dependence a source of resentment ... . That evening Abigail Carfax retired early , allowing the children to put themselves to bed . She wanted to write her husband a long letter , pour out to him her grievances and her longing . But when she took up pen to write , she could not put the words on paper . The feeling of resentment toward him beclouded her thoughts , and choked her confessional ... .  | IV The most active auxiliary of Matthew Eliot 's church , and the one in which Abigail Carfax had interested herself , was the Ladies ' Missionary Society . It was well organized under the leadership of a Mrs. Colquit , wife of a plumbing contractor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably of three parts : the business session , given over to budgets , resolutions , committee reports , and debate ; the program proper , consisting of a paper on some missionary subject prepared by one of the members , followed by a mild discussion , and a musical rendition by someone with musical gifts or aspirations ; and , finally , refreshments . The main parts of the program were the business session and the refreshments . The raising of money for missionary work fell , as so often happens , to the missionary society , and ways and means always made for a great deal of discussion , advancement of plans , counter-proposals , and argument . The hearing of resolutions also took a considerable amount of time , as well as the reports of the various committees  --  the committees on refreshments , on program , on nominations , on finance , on visitations to sister auxiliaries , and the like . By the time all this was concluded , everyone was hungry or restless , eager for the refreshment period , and the papers on missionary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartbreaking research on the part of those giving them , had to be read hurriedly , and to the accompaniment of restive glances , nods , and chair-shifting . During the refreshment period , restraint was loosened , the business and the paper were forgotten , and the room was filled with conversation on every subject of domestic or personal interest . Abigail Carfax had , at first , attended the meetings of the Society with interest and enthusiasm , feeling that here was where  | she would fit in and could make a contribution to the group . Moreover , she thought it useful to hear about the mission work in other lands than Persia , as something which would be of interest to Martin . She was quite sympathetic over the business transactions , recalling as they did the struggles of her father in the financial management of his charge , and reminding her of the source of her own support . The refreshment and social period , however , was something which soon became onerous to her , for she had few domestic interests in common with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of husbands were under discussion , as was frequently the case , her sense of her own separation and loneliness was so acute that often she excused herself and went home . In other ways , the orbit of life with the ladies of the Society was strange to Abigail Carfax . She had lived so long abroad , in an isolated environment in which she and Martin had been compelled to establish their own conventions , habits , and interests , divorced entirely from what they had previously known , that it was an almost impossible gulf to cross to identify herself with the interests and associations of these new companions . They had their own circle of acquaintances , their own neighborhood affairs , their own domestic concerns , and while they made a sincere effort to bridge the abyss , it was too wide and too deep to be spanned in a moment . The distressing fact which Abigail Carfax had discovered was that in the society of the church her position was anomalous . It was neither that of a married woman living with her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the restrictions imposed by marriage and spinsterhood , and enjoyed the freedom of neither status . Among spinsters she was a married woman ; and in the various mixed gatherings of husbands and wives she was an odd number . Whatever kindly efforts might be made  | to set her at ease , the fact remained , and the mere sight of other women enjoying the companionship of their husbands was such a forcible reminder of her own separation as to be unbearable . Beyond this , Abigail Carfax suffered another handicap in her relations with the ladies of the Society : her own independence of manner and of outlook . Thirteen years of living in the isolation of the mission field , with little contact with others of her own race and kind , had developed in her a point of view strange to women reared and living among their kind and in the midst of familiar associations . The manners and conventions of the New World had not been forgotten on the mission field , but they had become like a garment which , once laid aside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was much too much her own to be accepted without brow-lifting , particularly as her F facility for expression gave whatever she said an unusual vigor and clarity . The first time Abigail Carfax found herself isolated was during a discussion of the mission budget , and how to meet it . The group was pathetically eager to increase its contribution , and Abigail Carfax thought it her duty as a representative of the mission field to give her opinion . She rose and obtained the floor . " I am sure that whatever we can send will suffice , " she said in an earnest but timid way . " Indeed , I have often heard my husband say that too liberal a purse tends to place the native groups in a position of moral servitude when they should be vigorously striking root for themselves . If the Society can not send all the money it would like , it can send its prayers , which are equally needed , and are equally efficacious . " The remarks produced consternation . Among the group were many whose chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were disheartened ; others , whose chief resource was their means , were bewildered ; and still others , who looked upon  | money as the universal touchstone , regarded Abigail Carfax as presumptuous or ignorant . A few understood what she was trying to say and were grateful . On another occasion  --  this was shortly after her tiff with Mrs. Eliot , and she was wearing a new dress she had bought to replace the one she had torn  --  one of the members of the Society , during a discussion of missions in Moslem countries , referred to the natives as " heathens and idolators . " Abigail Carfax stood up . " Mohammedans are neither heathens nor idolators , " she said warmly . " They worship one God , and their creed forbids the worship of images , whether of Him or of man or beast . " From the looks she got , it was plain that several thought she had spoken out of turn . Undeterred , she went on , " Mohammedans , moreover , are a deeply religious people : they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and though their standards are not always so high as the Christian , they are enlightened , artistic , and civilized . " There was a silence , and then from the midst a quavering voice piped up : " Then why , for land 's sake , " it asked , " are we raising money and sending missionaries out there , if they be not heathen ? " Abigail Carfax flushed with confusion . She did not know what to say and sought for words . Out of the mist of recollections an answer came . " They need the prayers and love of Christians , " she said coldly , " because there is sin in the world , and their own faith offers them no release from its bondage except by the hopeless , impossible road of personal perfection . It is Faith without Grace . " The Society seemed to be satisfied with the explanation , but Abigail Carfax was not . What she had said , she knew , was not an expression of her own concept , but simply a phrase which she  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had never quite understood its meaning , and , indeed , the more she thought about it , the more it seemed to her that both faiths , the Moslem and the Christian , preached the same destiny , that of supine resignation to a higher will . The Moslems had their kismet , to which man could only submit , and the Christian had his yoke , until she had often wondered if the very idea of freedom was not a phantasm of the mind , and desire for it a sin . However , it had always seemed clear to Martin , who could talk about submission and freedom as though they were synonymous and , indeed , seemed to enjoy the greatest sense of freedom , and so she had never thought very deeply about it until now . But recently it seemed that she saw nothing about her but restrictions  --  imposed by customs and conventions and circumstance  --  that held her in a confinement as strict as that of any haremlik . Abigail Carfax returned from this meeting of the missionary society , thinking unjust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bitter self-reproaches for her inability to master her circumstances . As she was crossing crowded Tremont Street , Fenton Sweyton caught sight of her and hurried to meet her . " How happy I am to see you , " he exclaimed breathlessly , removing his hat in a deep arc , and replacing it . " And how well you look ! Our Boston climate agrees with you . " Abigail Carfax smiled happily at the recognition . " And allow me to be among the first to compliment you , " Sweyton rushed on . " It is splendid . " " Yes ? " responded Abigail Carfax puzzled , and wondered if he were possibly referring to her new dress . " On the novel . I could not lay it down until I had finished it . The chapter where Ruud goes over the hill , leaving his followers behind , while he visits the little monastery  --  that was moving ? "  | " Oh , you have read the book ? " asked Abigail Carfax in consternation . " Why , it has not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , " interjected Sweyton . " But when I read the announcement , I could not wait . It was imperative that I read it  --  to learn your  --  what you had to say . And so I inveigled the manuscript overnight  --  you know I am doing work for your publisher , and he seemed quite willing to do the favor . " Abigail Carfax was overwhelmed by such interest and enthusiasm . " Do n't try to explain it , " said Sweyton , reading her thoughts . " You are a person with a magnificent future , whom I should be proud to know . Besides , you have helped me tremendously . " " In what way ? " asked Abigail Carfax , bewildered . " Oh , in many ways . By your calm , and your reserve , under which such volcanic restlessness lies . And your enthusiasm when you speak ; by your soaring spirit . . . . You know I have had difficulties  --  I should not say hardships  --  but difficulties . I have been afraid of myself  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my imagination , afraid to dare , afraid to realize my own capacities . You have something in your outlook and in your philosophy that is challenging . It makes one want to dream and build ... if you know what I mean . I saw it all so clearly in " The Bride of the Viking " ? in the scope of your tale , in the audacity of its movement , in the freedom and independence and heroism of your characters . It is wonderful . " Sweyton could not resist talking about the book , and went on to tell all the various things he liked about it , until Abigail Carfax , in sheer self-defense , had to halt him . " How are all our friends at Mrs. Hutchins ' ? " she asked . " They are all well , and they all miss you , " said Sweyton , " but you know that I am leaving ? " " No . Really ? "  | " Yes , " went on Sweyton eagerly . " You know Bismith and Pitcrest have bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do others . I have more work than I can handle . I am moving soon to better quarters . " It was apparent that the architect was prospering  --  evident in the elegant dress he affected , and the gold-headed cane he carried . " By the way , " he exclaimed suddenly , " Mrs. Hutchins is giving me a special supper party this Saturday evening . It 's to celebrate my departure , or the fact that I am paid up with her  --  I do n't know which . " He laughed . " In any case , I am her senior boarder , and it 's in my honor . How happy I would be if you would attend ! " He was looking at Abigail Carfax hopefully . " I think it would be very nice  --  I would love to come , " she responded . " And everyone will be so glad to see you again , " Svveyton said . " It will be more a reunion for you than a farewell party for me . " " Then in that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing . " I will not stand in your light . " " Of course not . It 's settled . I shall call for you in a carriage at six . " They parted , and Abigail Carfax went on home . It was only then that she remembered , with dismay , that she had accepted Sweyton 's invitation to call for her . She realized now , thinking it over , that it would be inappropriate for her to accept , that indeed she could not do so without committing an indiscretion . Again it was borne to her that she was not a free spirit . Much as she would have enjoyed renewing her associations at Mrs. Hutchins ' , she realized that she could not arrive with Sweyton without arousing comment , and that in her position comment would be adverse both to her and to Martin . Reluctantly , she wrote the architect a brief note , regretting her  | necessity to decline the invitation , but wishing him all prosperity and happiness , and hoping that possibly their paths might cross again ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within Abigail Carfax and showed its head at last , one Sunday morning , when she refused to take herself to church . It was not an out-and-out rebellion ; it was simply that she could not bear to listen to any more of the Reverend Matthew Eliot 's long , tedious sermons . Possibly Abigail Carfax 's relations with Mrs. Eliot had something to do with it ; Abigail Carfax did not mind being mothered by Mrs. Eliot , but she still resented the remarks upon the way she dressed her children . She was not prepared for an open break  --  her sense of duty to her church was too strong for that  --  and her defiance at first went only to staying home the one Sunday , on the excuse of not feeling well . Jason and Estelle went on to Sunday School . After they had gone , conscience began to prick Abigail Carfax , and she thought that she should not stay home on a Sunday morning . Perhaps , she thought , she might excuse herself if she attended some other church . While she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard a great deal of the famous Dr. Christian Marker ; and Hosea Shanley , who was assistant at Dr. Marker 's church , had more than once invited her to attend . Abigail Carfax had been curious to hear Dr. Marker preach , whose fame reached well beyond Boston , but she had hitherto hesitated to go , considering it somewhat heretical to do so . The church was one of so-called liberal tendencies , and by the older persuasions , of which her own denomination was among the strictest , it was frowned upon for its approach to truth . It was a sect that interpreted the Scrip-  | tures in a rational rather than mystical sense , held to nothing which did not accord with logic , and accepted only those truths in religion which were confirmed by science . Abigail Carfax mounted the steps and entered the church with some trepidation . Prayer was in progress , and she had to wait in the vestibule until the glass doors to the auditorium were opened . The moment allowed her to collect her courage . Surely , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How had Martin obtained listeners to his reading of the Scriptures except that they had been moved to seek new truth ? Still , if attendance were to damn her as a heretic , she had much company , for the church was crowded , and more were collecting in the vestibule . Those who came were well dressed and intelligent-looking : Dr. Marker 's church was popular among the intellectual and professional classes of Boston , and it was attended by many of the faculty and students of Harvard College . The architecture of the auditorium , which was visible through the glass doors , was in spirit with the tenets  --  formal , severe , and devoid of any element of beauty or comfort which might lure the attention of the worshiper . It was a nearly square structure , furnished throughout  --  pews , pulpit , railings , and walls  --  in stained oak . The walls were paneled in large lozenges , and the windows , high and narrow , were filled with lozenges of colored glass . A gallery extended straight across the back of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the platform stood the pulpit  --  large , square , and without ornamentation . Behind the pulpit , and separated from it by a low , curtained railing , sat the choir , in two rows of stiff , high-backed chairs . Behind the choir was the organ , its pipes arranged in symmetrical order of ascent and descent . Finally , the auditorium itself was precisely divided by two aisles . It was all very ordered , very geometrical , very precise , very  | logical , and , Abigail Carfax thought , very cold . For a moment , as her look took all this in , she wanted to withdraw , but a fascination held her , and at that moment the prayer ended , the glass doors swung open , and an usher in a frock coat , with a carnation in the lapel , was showing her to a pew . The congregation was standing to sing . Abigail Carfax picked up a hymn book , but her neighbor , an old gentleman of distinguished manner , dressed in fine broadcloth , handed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer to share with her , however , but took up another for himself . The hymn was one with which Abigail Carfax was unfamiliar ? " O Light of Wisdom , 0 Dawn of Peace " ? and made her think , somehow , of a Greek paean to Holy Wisdom , and of the great church of that name , in Constantinople , now a Mohammedan mosque . Dr. Marker stood behind the pulpit , singing vociferously . He was a large man , of powerful physique , thick , almost sensual features , and a great shock of stiff , iron-gray hair  --  in every way a contrast to the spindle-legged Matthew Eliot , or to the intellectuality with which the name of Marker was associated . Following the hymn , he read the responsive reading , in a voice that was deep , powerful , and at times harsh . After the Gospel reading , the offertory , and another hymn , the congregation settled itself for the sermon , which was always the main event of Dr. Marker 's services . The text this morning was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , as foreshadowed by the hymn , dealt with light " Light is a substance of the utmost delicacy , of the greatest agility , and of remarkable speed , so that it may be called a fairy , like Ariel , or Puck . " Abigail Carfax was pleased with the choice of theme , though she wondered why Dr. Marker had not chosen his text from the Bible , in which there are so many mystical allusions to light . It  | made her think of the sunlit Persian landscape , particularly at the moment of sunrise when the sun , resplendent as a diademed king , enters the darkened palace chamber of the earth . Dr. Marker began his sermon in an entertaining manner by giving his listeners a short essay on the physical qualities of light . In such presentations he was superb , for he had an ability that many a professor envied , of presenting abstract scientific concepts in understandable fashion ; on this account his sermons attracted a great many people who were more interested in the scientific marvels of the day than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the idea of light being a " substance , " which the authority he cited had called it , and closed this part of his remarks by a little peroration . " What ethereal substance is this ! " he exclaimed . " From the sun to the earth it speeds with tremendous velocity , with the swiftness of lightning , and yet so lightly , so softly , that it falls upon the cheek of a sleeping babe without awakening it ; upon a rose petal without causing it to stir . " The imagery was captivating , and had won her neighbor 's approval , as Abigail Carfax saw by his emphatic nodding . For herself she felt an exhilaration as she listened , a sense of contentment , a sense of having found a pool from whose flowing spring she could take refreshment . Dr. Marker had a way of speaking as though he were addressing each listener individually ; Abigail Carfax felt that his eyes were upon her , intently , and that he was moulding his message to fit her particular needs . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept certain ideas that were new to her , ideas that at another time would have been repulsive , but that now drew her on with a peculiar magnetism , as though she were following a light into a pit .... The most shocking thing about Dr. Marker was the familiarity  | with which he dealt with deity , and the simplicity to which he reduced the mysteries of faith . The Founder of Christianity Dr. Marker treated as a great teacher , but apparently as no more . The miracles associated with His life-story were of doubtful authenticity , and so far as they could not be explained as scientific phenomena  --  as exhibitions of mesmerism , electro-biology , and the like  --  they were frankly to be discarded . The traditional Church was the product of a group of Roman organizers , and dogma was the result of Greek hair-splitting logic . In a sense , the whole ideology of Christianity was but an outgrowth and refinement of Stoic mysticism , although , of course , a great deal was due , though how much was not yet clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Jesus . Abigail Carfax had the morbid satisfaction , as she listened to all this , which a small boy might have in shouting in an empty schoolroom , the sensation , no doubt , which Alaric experienced when he broke in upon the Roman Senate , and with which young professors of physics announce their agnosticism to their classes . It was apparent , however , that Dr. Marker was not without his positive convictions , and that he had gained an inspiration from Scripture . What he saw in Christianity  --  how it got there he did not say ? was a new emphasis upon the importance of the individual . This accorded with the modern scientific view , and with the tenet of Dr. Marker 's sect , that the individual was not only important in the scheme of things , but was indeed the scheme of things , the summation of all existence . " Here is the answer to the great mystery , " he announced loudly , coming to the resolution of his logic and the development of his thesis . " Here is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divine meet . For , says Jesus , the Kingdom of  | Heaven is within you . And , says science , there is nothing in the earth which is not subject to the wisdom of man . And truly again , says the Teacher , ye are the light of the world . " " The modern Christian is a man free from narrowness and bigotry , " Dr. Marker continued . " He refuses to accept the past blindly , and he submits to no arbitrary authority , be it ecclesiastical or political . He seeks truth . That is his sole desire . No doctrine is sacred to him ; no theory too sacrosanct for him to investigate . Everything must be tested in the crucible of human reason . All progress is due to him , and he must take the role not of a humble creature of God , but as a co-worker with God , His equal in working out the great Scheme of the Universe . " Dr. Marker went on , even more vigorously , to attack the orthodox viewpoint . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus . It was wholly a product of Greek thought  --  one of the chief exponents of which was the Apostle Paul  --  and of a Greek tradition that was servile , debasing , and wholly at odds with our modern viewpoint . We of this scientific age can no longer follow Paul , when he exclaims , like a Greek slave , 0 wretched man that I am ! Who shall deliver me from the body of this death ? ' " Such an attitude is utterly contrary to the true doctrine of Christ , who looked upon man as the child of God , a divine spirit , possessed of all the attributes of Godhead . Yet the Church , through the ages , has followed Paul , and has dwelt upon man 's original sin , and man 's sinful nature , and his need for a redeemer , rather than upon man 's original virtue , and godliness , and power . And it is this emphasis upon man 's depravity rather than man 's goodness that marks the difference between ecclesiasticism and science , between stagnation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Dr. Marker cried , in a ringing , challenging voice , as he concluded his discourse . " Let us have cour-  | age to expurgate , as false and misleading , such phrases as those of Paul 's when he says , I live ; yet not I , but Christ liveth in me . ' Let us be like the Light . Let us be as free as the sunlight , which knows no bondage . " The sermon ended , a closing hymn was sung , and the benediction uttered . As Abigail Carfax issued from the church into the sunlight , she walked with an easy step , and a revived sparkle in her eyes . The meaning of Dr. Marker 's sermon was still somewhat confused , but the main idea stood out , and it gave her a new confidence in herself . Here was a doctrine that seemed to explain the busy , hurried world in which she lived , that promised to resolve the dilemmas with which she was faced , and to satisfy her needs ... . A number of beggars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end , in the hope of alms from the congregation , and along the street was a row of fine equipages , those of the parishioners . A landau drawn by a magnificent pair of matched bays drove up , and a footman descended to await his employer . This , Abigail Carfax noticed , was the old gentleman in whose pew she had sat . As he came up , a beggar , white-haired like the gentleman himself , approached and held out a grimy cap . The old gentleman , however , entered his carriage without noticing him ... .  | Chapter Six I THE FIRST PERSON to see " The Bride of the Viking " in print , aside from the printer 's devil who pulled the proofs , was Robert Ware . Reading proof was a task for which he had been prepared by years of discipline over the type case and the composing stone , and it was generally agreed at Pitcrest 's that no one in the establishment was more meticulous in this work than Robert Ware . When the galley proofs were laid on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clerk , and without giving them a glance , handed them to him for correction . Robert Ware was philosophical by nature , and the nature of his work fostered his contemplative tendencies . While proofreading demands the attention of the objective faculties , it gives a compensatory freedom to the subjective , and Robert Ware ordinarily could carry on a philosophical inquiry with himself in the midst of the work . The chief object of these inquiries was that of fitting into a logical and philosophical pattern the confusing and contradictory events which life was continually presenting to the eye . So far he had had little success , but this was to be expected , since so many greater philosophers had never succeeded . After the typographical errors in the proof were marked and corrected , another proof was drawn , this one for the author to correct or emend . When it was ready , and packaged , Robert Ware was sent to deliver it . Had " The Bride of the Viking " been  | a philosophical work , he might have read it with more attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The author he remembered well from the day she had come in so timidly with her manuscript , and he wondered how she had been faring . Abigail Carfax was not in when Robert arrived at the house in Chester Street , and as he had instructions to obtain a receipt , he sat down in the parlor to wait . With nothing to do but wait , he fell into speculation , a habit not unique with him , but one which young men of sixteen are known frequently to indulge . His eyes , meantime , ranged the room unconsciously seeking something upon which to speculate . In the course of their wandering they fell upon the sea shell on the urn stand . It was a fine specimen of peacock volute , from Florida , beautifully marked in purple apd tan , with tiny speckles of gold in the purple . For a young man who had lived all his days upon land , and that land prescribed by Boston harbor , who had never traveled so far as Nahant , and who spent most of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea shell was a provocative subject for the imagination . Robert thought of the living mollusk , occupying its house of pearl , and his imagination , fed by the books he had read , parted the curtains of the past and furnished and peopled the scene . He saw the creature at the bottom of a sunlit lagoon , among the translucent waters , and fantastic creatures of the deep  --  fish with golden scales , and green sea dragons and yellow-bellied sharks ? while from the sea floor rose strange ferns and flowering plants , waving as in a breeze , and at their base lay gold and silver scattered from a broken pirate 's chest . Robert saw floating upon the surface of this lagoon strange craft flying strange colors , and dark-skinned boys paddling about in canoes , and on the shore , crowds gathered to gaze at the strange vessels . He saw the mollusk gathered in a basket , and  | set a-journeying to distant lands , and much more which would take many words to describe ... . At this point Robert Ware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he too would like to be traveling upon strange seas , in strange vessels , and beholding the strange sights of the world . The mollusk , a thing without sense or power of reason , and certainly with no appreciation of the beauty of the upper world , had gone traveling many miles and many days , while he went only to and from the office and on errands as Pitcrest might send him . While Robert Ware was thus absorbed in the contemplative serenities of Stoicism , Estelle Carfax entered the room . She was embarrassed at seeing the stranger , and started to retreat . " Oh , excuse me , " she said politely . Robert too was embarrassed , partly at having been so preoccupied with his thoughts as not to observe the girl 's entrance , but more from a sense of inadequacy to the occasion . Estelle was something more than a child ; while she still had all the innocence and spontaneity of childhood , she was now in her twelfth year and approaching the promises of maturity . In her appearance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown hair was carefully brushed and done into braids ; the plain gray everyday dress she wore was becoming to her girlish freshness ; her eyes had a responsive sparkle ; and her cheeks , though normally quite pale , at that moment were flushed from confusion . Robert and Estelle stood in awkward silence for a moment , and then Robert found his tongue . " I am waiting for Mrs. Carfax , " he explained . " Yes  --  my mother , " nodded Estelle , eagerly , pridefully . " Oh ! " Robert exclaimed , and hurried on to say , " I am from her publisher , and I have a package for her . " " The book ! Oh , Mother will be delighted . She has been ex-  | pecting it . She will be back shortly . Please make yourself comfortable . " " Thank you . " " It must be fascinating to work in a publishing house , " said Estelle , lingering in the room , her eyes sparkling , but her voice grave and polite . Robert was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , dwelt in another world from that of fancy and instruction and childhood play that was her own . He told her about the House of Pitcrest , about Mrs. Carfax 's book , and the work he had done on it , and went on from there to tell something about himself and his duties . As Robert Ware told about his life as a printer , Estelle listened with fascinated interest , but when he mentioned that he had lost his father at the age of six , and his mother at the age of nine , she saw what his life must have been , and her heart went out in sympathy for him . There was the sound of steps at the door . Mrs. Carfax was coming . Robert rose , and said to Estelle : " I have enjoyed talking to you . I hope I may have another opportunity . " Estelle blushed . " Oh , I 'd love to talk with you again , " she said , embarrassedly . Abigail Carfax entered the house . Under her arm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought from the postoffice . She started upstairs , but turned when Estelle called to her , and entered the room . II Robert had not seen Abigail Carfax since the day she had come into Pitcrest 's office timidly bearing her manuscript under her arm . He was struck by the change that had come over her in the  | interval . About her was the same freshness and vitality that was like a radiance in the stuffy parlor , the same friendly , appealing expression , the same grace of carriage ; but there was something else , something which Robert could not quite define : a tenseness , an excitement mingled with fatigue , but , more than that , a manner of detachment , of preoccupation and bewilderment . Estelle ran to greet her mother , and flung herself into Abigail Carfax 's arms . " How are you , my darling ? " Abigail Carfax asked , embracing her . " And the cough ? Dr. Helder will be here again soon . " " It 's better , thank you , Mother , " Estelle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hugging her in delight . " I spent all afternoon in the sun . " She disengaged herself , and grew dignified . " This young gentleman is here to see you  --  Mr. Ware . " She pronounced the name carefully , respectfully . Abigail Carfax glanced at the young man , and then smiled in recognition . " Oh , yes , I remember Mr. Ware from Pitcrest 's . How are you ? I remember that you are quite interested in philosophy , and amazed me with your knowledge of the classics . " " I have brought the page proofs , ma'am , " said Robert , pleased at the good name he had received in Estelle 's presence . " Mr. Pitcrest hoped you could have them corrected by the first of the week . " " The proofs ! " Abigail Carfax started with excitement , while her eyes began to glow . Laying the packet of letters from her husband on the table , she seized the package . " Oh , by all means , I shall have them ready , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Fetch me the scissors , darling , " she asked Estelle , while she laid aside her hat and cloak and smoothed her hair .  | The scissors were fetched , the package was opened . There , spread before her , was the title page of her book , in large and beautiful type , with many ornamentations : THE BRIDE OF THE VIKING by ABIGAIL CARFAX For a moment Abigail Carfax sat spellbound , staring at the title , and then , like a child before an array of presents on Christmas morning , she began to thumb through the pages , devouring them with her eyes . " It 's beautiful , " she exclaimed , half to herself . " It 's wonderful . " She looked up . " Where 's Jason ? " she asked . " He has n't come in yet , Mother . " " Where did he go ? " " He was going for a walk along the wharves , he said . " " He should n't go so far . The Common is closer and is much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see the ships . " " Yes , yes , they are a sight . Well , I suppose he will be coming shortly . Supper is almost ready ? " She glanced at the clock , which showed the hour at six . Jason came in . " Well , son , we have just been speaking of you , " exclaimed Abigail Carfax happily . " Have you had a good time ? Come and give mother a kiss . " Jason dutifully approached and kissed his mother . Abigail Carfax arose . " Come , we must get ready for supper , and then I have news  | for you . We have letters from your father . We shall read them at table . " Estelle was looking wistfully at Robert , who was standing with his cap in hand . Abigail Carfax added , " And Mr. Ware will join us ? " Robert blushed , and hesitated . " Yes , yes , do , " exclaimed Abigail Carfax . " I think it would be very nice , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , Abigail Carfax opened the packet of letters . " Where shall we begin ? " she asked gaily . " About what would you like most to hear ? " " How are Shireen and G'mish ? " asked Estelle . These were two Persian cats of the household . " Are they still fat , and well ? Oh , I hope so . " " There should be news about them , " responded Abigail Carfax , and began examining the letters . " Yes , here it is , addressed to my big girl , Estelle . ' I shall let you read it . " " You read it , Mother , please do . " While the children began their supper , Abigail Carfax spread the letter before her . " You will be glad to know , my little star , " Martin 's letter opened , " that Shireen and G'mish are now the proud parents of four little kittens . Two are quite black , with white paws ; one is all silver , like G'mish ; and one  --  poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very careful , to keep clean  --  is all white . Ahmed has the whole family with him at the gate-house , and I go by every day to see how they are . Hassan , " ? this was one of Ahmed 's children ? " wants one so badly , and so with your permission I am allowing him to have one . He promises to take very good care of it . " " Oh , I am so glad , " burst out Estelle . " Hassan is such a nice  | boy . Do you know , Mr. Ware , there are no cats like our Persian cats . They are so very beautiful . " " Everything from Persia must be beautiful , " said Robert , sighing . " Do n't you like America ? " Jason rebuked his sister . " Of course . I love America , " protested Estelle . " But I love Persia , too . Do n't you , Mother ? " " Very much . " " And besides , Father 's there . Is Father well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , he appears to be quite well , and busy besides . " She continued reading the letter . It was a long letter , and told a great many things that had been happening since the last writing  --  the new baby in Ahmed 's family ( which now numbered eleven ) , how the garden was growing , Martin 's last trip to Ardash , where they used to go on picnics , and the like . He closed with a hug and kiss for each of his children . At the conclusion of the letter silence fell upon the room . After a while , Estelle , her eyes large and solemn , remarked : " I miss Daddy so much , Mother . " " So do we all , dearest . " Tears appeared in Abigail Carfax 's eyes . She did not give them time to collect , but exclaimed rapidly : " But we have things to do here , just as Father has at home , and we must be brave and happy . You must go to school and learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that my book can be published . We will send a copy to Father . Wo n't he be delighted ! It is going to be a very beautiful book . " " But you are writing another book , " Jason reminded his mother . Jason , for all his self-absorption , was not unaware of what was going on about him . " Is it about Persia ? " Abigail Carfax showed momentary confusion .  | " No , it is about happenings in England , over two centuries ago . " " I should think you would write about Persia . " " One can not always talk about the things nearest the heart , Jason . " While the table was being cleared , Abigail Carfax took occasion to run through the other letters rapidly . " Is Father still translating the New Testament ? " Estelle asked . " Yes , he has many other duties to take his time , but he has finished the Gospels , and now he has the Epistles and Revelations to do . " " Has he had any more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thank God , no . But all has not been peaceful . " " Father is a brave man , " said Jason , seriously . " I would like to do brave things as he has . " " Some day you will , Jason , " said his mother . " But now you must study and prepare yourself . No great task is carried through without preparation , without great self-discipline . " " But everyone must think about what he wishes to do . " " I 'm always dreaming about things , " said Estelle . " One sees such beautiful things in dreams . " " What do you see in your dreams , dearest ? " asked her mother . " They are not exactly dreams , they are memories . I like to remember how in spring the almond trees whitened with blossoms , and I like to remember the funny sounds that came over the walls early in the morning , while I lay awake wondering whether it was time to get up . What do you dream of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said : " I dream of sailing far away to a land where the hills are made of gold , and diamonds are scattered like sand  --  like those which Sinbad saw . "  | " You would get hungry in such a country , " protested Estelle . " Remember what happened to Midas . " Jason shrugged his shoulders . " I just want to see what is on the other side of the world . " " But we are on the other side of the world now . " " There are many places I have not seen , that I would like to see , " said Jason stubbornly . " Father went to a strange land . I would like to go to a strange land . " " Your father did not go to a strange land merely to see strange sights , but because he felt it was his duty to go , " interposed his mother . " Would you like to return to Persia ? " " I do n't think we shall ever return to Persia , " Jason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peculiar to the lad , had appeared in Jason 's face , a hardness about his dark eyes , barely discernible , and belied by the softness of the lips . " Why do you say that ? " she asked . " I do n't know , " he said . " I just think it . " " Please do n't say things like that , " exclaimed his mother , disturbed , though not quite understanding why . " But you are writing books , " he argued , " and they are not about Persia . " Abigail Carfax was confused . " But I have told you why , " she exclaimed in distraction . Jason pursued his point . " There is always a reason , Mother . " " What ships did you see at the wharves ? " Estelle asked her brother . Jason blushed . " I took the ferry to East Boston to see the Albatross building , " he said , a trifle defiantly , fearing his mother might rebuke him for having gone so far . But Abigail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of Martin 's letters . " That is the ship Mr. Sweyton designed , which Allen and Wilson are building for Mr. Bismith , is it not ? " Robert asked . " Yes , do you know about it ? " responded Jason eagerly . " I have known Mr. Sweyton for a long time , " said Robert . " When I was a small boy , he boarded with my mother . " " It is to be a huge vessel , " continued Jason . " It is over two hundred feet long and forty wide , and will displace fifteen hundred tons . " He went on with a complete description of the vessel . " Goodness , " exclaimed Robert in amazement . " How do you know so much about the ship ? " " Mr. Sweyton told me . He was there , and showed me over the deck . We knew Mr. Sweyton at Mrs. Hutchins ' boarding-house . " " I hear that she will be very fast , " said Robert . " Sweyton says that she will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the run to San Francisco in ninety-seven days , " explained Jason , whose knowledge of ships and shipbuilding seemed inexhaustible . " People say she carries too much sail , and will capsize , but Sweyton only laughs at them . He says if we understand the principles of pressures , there is no limit to the size or speed of a ship . " " He says that when this is finished , he is going to build another that will be even bigger , " Jason added . Estelle listened politely . Abigail Carfax was giving her attention to Martin 's letters , turning the pages rapidly to glean their contents . Ellen had brought in the dessert , a large platter of blanc mange , a treat of which the children were very fond . Suddenly Abigail Carfax turned , with a look of distress in her face . " Will you excuse me , children  --  and Mr. Ware ? If Mr. Pitcrest wishes the proofs so soon , I will have much to do . Estelle , will  | you serve ? And will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will excuse me , I am sure . Please come and see us again . " But Mother , blanc mange is so delicious , " coaxed Estelle . Abigail Carfax smiled wanly . " I know , my darling . . . . Goodnight , Mr. Ware . " She rose from the table , gathered up the letters and the proofs of her book , and went out . III For some time Jason and Estelle had been growing aware of their mother 's preoccupation , and they vaguely realized that this meant for them a new relationship with life , but what this new relationship would be they did not yet perceive . It was becoming a frequent practice of their mother to ask to be excused from the supper table , and to retire to her room , where she would work late into the night . During the day , also , she spent a great deal of time closeted in her bedroom , with the blinds drawn , and a lamp lit , while the children dutifully awaited her appearance to talk with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Formerly , it had been otherwise . " The Bride of the Viking " had been written on shipboard , in the cramped quarters of the cabin , under a shielded lamp that illuminated little more than the tablet on her lap , while the children lay asleep beside her in their bunks . Until recently , also , Abigail Carfax had followed her invariable practice of seeing the children to bed , helping them with their baths , and laying out their clothes for the morrow . Now , pleading the necessity of quiet in which to sublimate her thoughts , she had taken to withdrawing early , and allowing the children to put themselves to bed. ? Jason , of course , had long  | been protesting that he was too grown to have his mother lay out his nightgown. ? Now , when they were ready for bed , they would tiptoe into their mother 's room , and kiss her goodnight , while she would pat their heads a moment , abstractedly , and return the kiss , and then they would steal away , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was the same the day the proofs were delivered . Abigail Carfax made the proofs an especial excuse for retiring . Leaving Jason and Estelle to talk with their new acquaintance , she hurried to her room , lighted the oil lamp , and closed the door . She saw that the blinds were drawn , her pencils sharpened , and then , all prepared , she sat down at the little gate-legged table that served her as a desk , and took up a sheaf of the proofs . She turned over the title page , the table of contents , and came to Chapter One . She began to read : " In the haven of Tornavik , on the forbidding coasts of Norway , dwelt ... " Abigail Carfax read on through the first paragraph , and then paused for a moment in thought , repeating each word slowly to herself , to taste its sound , to feel its sonority , and to allow the images which the words evoked to arise before her  --  to each word an image , and for each image @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and anyone who works with words assumes a great responsibility . To paraphrase the Bible , one might say that he who masters a word is greater than he who takes a city . Words are molecules of thought , bursting with the atomic energy of the spirit . Unleash the power of a single word  --  like jihad or irredenta  --  and one has something which armies can not withstand . Words are microcosms of history . In the single word " cart , " one may trace the migrations of the Aryans and the major differences between Persian and  | Egyptian culture . Words are also revelations of the soul . To know what a word signifies to another is to know his past , his present , and his prospects . Words are also the cupbearers of memory and imagination . When Abigail Carfax was writing the words beginning , " In the haven of Tornavik , " they were the crystallization of certain images in her mind , images that had been evoked by the sight of the Aegean Sea , but affected by her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they evoked other images . Tornavik was no longer Tornavik , but Salamat ; the hills were those of the Sevanli range ; and the sea was not the sea , but the desert , the Persian lut . Ruud was not a Viking adventurer , but a missionary , Martin , her husband . For Martin was a Viking in spirit , a man who had ventured into unknown lands , led by a great desire and a great purpose . Abigail Carfax was surprised to discover how much of herself and her own past she had put into " The Bride of the Viking . " To read what she had written awakened in her again poignant memories , and spread before her , as on a stage , the scenes of her life with Martin . Certain of these scenes became especially vivid : the rides they used to take , out from the city , of early morning , while the governor 's trumpeters , from the top of the gate , were sounding their salute to the rising sun . They would ride out across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave , advancing toward the dawn , which capped the distant mountains with a silver rim . Abigail Carfax recalled the clear , sparkling air , which enlivened their mounts , so that they could scarce be restrained and would cavort about in fettle . Martin on a horse was like a centaur . They would ride to the little oasis of Ardash , watered by a stream from the hills , and they would halt at the Garden of Alwan , where the water gushed forth as it had done in the days of Khosrau , then for the delight of maidens , but now  | to turn a creaking water mill . Here they would dismount , and tether the horses , while they would bask in the sunlight and listen to the water rippling among the rocks , until they were refreshed and would return home . Martin allowed himself few recreations . He was forever occupied , in his quiet , silent way , about the work of the Lord . These rides to Ardash were in keeping with his spirit , for they talked little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magpie chattering from the mill roof and the thrush among the willow trees around the pool , to the incessant swirl of the water in the mill race , and the whisper of the breeze among the tree branches ; and they sought to hear in these sounds the voice of God speaking to them . Or they watched the splendor of the morning , as the sun rose and burnished the plain with gold , snared the city in a net of light , and glinted from the turrets of the governor 's palace , from the turquoise domes of the mosques ... . The grandfather clock chimed in the parlor downstairs , and Abigail Carfax awoke with a start from her reverie . She chided herself for the great deal of precious time that she had allowed to slip by in dreaming . She shook herself , smoothed her parted hair , patted the heavy coil at her neck , settled herself again , and began to read . Abigail Carfax read several pages rapidly , and they seemed to be correct . Then she noticed a transposition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had not read the preceding pages at all carefully . She thumbed back through them , and to her annoyance discovered on the very first page another correction  --  a " the " that should have been an " an . " " I 'm afraid I 'm a very poor proof reader , " she chided herself . She began again , forcing her attention to the page , this time reading very carefully , and discovered a slip of grammar made in the writing , which she corrected . It seemed to go better now .  | She finished the first chapter , and went on to the next , and then found her thoughts reverting to Martin ... . Abigail Carfax arose , went to the children 's rooms , saw that they were getting ready for bed , kissed them goodnight , and returned to her work . She scolded herself . " I have just put the children to bed , and now , Martin dear , I am afraid I must ask you also to leave me alone for a little while . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see Martin looking at her sorrowfully , and saying : " I have worked at my translation for ten years , and never found it necessary to put you out of my thoughts . " Martin , of course , would never actually say such a thing . He had never rebuked his wife . Abigail Carfax remembered how hour after hour he would sit at his desk , struggling with dictionary and lexicon to master the meaning of a Greek phrase , but that he had never found it necessary to complain of the children 's noise , or Abigail 's speaking to him , or the interruptions of visitors , or the other occurrences that might be construed as annoyances . " Oh , how I love him , " Abigail Carfax thought , and a quiver of ecstasy ran over her . She experienced a desperate longing to return to her husband , again to be at his side , resting by the pool of Ardash , riding with him across the sunlit plains , sitting opposite him in the living-room of their Persian home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation , while she mended the children 's clothes . She could see him now , lifting his head in thought : his brown eyes would fall on her , and he would smile to her in his peaceful , embracing way , and then sometimes  --  as though he had a sudden impulse  --  he would rise from his chair , and come over to her and put his arms about her and kiss her .  | Kiss her . . Martin 's kisses were something sacred with him . However fierce they might be at times , however passionate , his kisses were to him always a new seal of their union , a re-covenanting of their souls , an act sanctified by God for divine purposes , working God 's will through the needs and passions of men ... . Abigail Carfax laid her work aside and stood up , going over to the window , where she looked out into the night . From not far away , on Tremont Street , came a great rumbling of wheels and the striking of iron-shod hooves on the pavement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrows , all loaded high with merchandise , all bound for the wharves . Everything was in great haste , and confusion , for six great vessels were loading , and haste was necessary to catch wind and tide . This had been going on all afternoon and evening , but Abigail Carfax had hardly been aware of it . Now , it aroused in her a great discontent . She felt futile and powerless . At that moment , she wanted to feel Martin 's arms about her , to feel him drawing her to him , and holding her fast in his embrace . Suddenly , Abigail Carfax threw herself upon the bed and began to cry , and bitter tears filled her mouth , and stained the coverlet ... . The noise of the drays ceased , and the sounds of traffic died away . . . . It was late . After a while Abigail Carfax drew herself up , wiped her tearstained eyes with her handkerchief , and looked around her . Under the lamp , where she had laid it , was the sheaf of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went to the table , settled herself , and began to work .  | Chapter Seven I THE BRILLIANT ACHIEVEMENTS of Abigail Carfax as a novelist were not the product solely of inspiration . Though she was never consciously aware of it , disciplined effort had gone into her work , and a large measure of the credit for this is due to Mirza Sa'ud , the Moslem scribe who instructed her in the Persian language . Abigail Carfax had learned languages , as she had learned everything she knew , without great effort , but also without a profundity of understanding , or precision of application . ' When she and Martin began the study of Persian , their first year on the mission field , she started in the same way-and would have so continued , no doubt , but for the persistence of her tutor . It was Mirza Sa'ud who , by giving her an appreciation of the beauties of his tongue , led her interest , fostered her attention , and established in her the habits of precision in use without which mastery of language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discover new beauties and new meanings in her own language . The power which Abigail Carfax displayed over her artistic material ? the skill with which she colored an emotion or shaded a meaning , or set a mood against its relief  --  were due to the attitudes and habits inculcated by Mirza Sa'ud . For uncounted years , Mirza Sa'ud had been the unofficial escort into the Persian language for all Europeans who came to Salamat . He had learned English as a boy , while serving a British colonel in Bombay . At the same time he had learned Urdu , Bengali , and one or two other Indian tongues . Later , in the Caucasus ,  | he had learned Russian , Armenian , and Turkish . For his linguistic accomplishments and his extensive travels ( as well as for the payment of a large gratuity to the appropriate official ) he had received a firman , or official decree , conferring upon him the title " Madan-i-Ulm , " or " The Citadel of Knowledge . " Having acquired this distinction , Mirza Sa'ud imposed upon himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw it as his duty to impart not only an exact knowledge of the language , but also a comprehensive understanding of the literature , the arts , the history , and the traditions of the country . For all his classical severity , Mirza Sa'ud had one personal conceit , which accorded well with his general concepts . This was his pride in his punctuality , which he maintained by means of a cheap Swiss watch that hung ostentatiously about his neck . The remarkable fact , of course , was not that Mirza Sa'ud marked the passage of time by a watch , but that he marked its passage at all , for in all other respects he was an Oriental of Orientals . Mirza Sa'ud always began his instruction with the phrases of a Persian greeting , the ritual of which is so much more precise , involved , and obligatory than the English . " Salaam aleikum , sahib va memsahib " ( Peace be with you , master and mistress ) , he would greet Martin and Abigail Carfax on his arrival , rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost several of his front teeth , so that this itself represented quite an accomplishment . His pupils would reply , with all the resonance at their com-mand : " Aleikum-es-salaam . " ( Peace return to you . ) Whereupon Mirza Sa'ud , bowing into his gabardine , while his hands were clasped and hidden respectfully in his sleeves , would inquire :  | " Ahwali shareef ? " ( How is your noble health ? ) The reply to this was : " Alhamdulillah . " ( Praise God . ) Abigail Carfax had asked , one day , why all this rigmarole was necessary . Mirza Sa'ud looked shocked , and his eyes rolled , and then , recalling that Mrs. Carfax was a newcomer , he explained : " It is an ancient custom , khanum , and we honor our heritage by giving it obedience . " " But why subject ourselves to something that has no value , Mirza Sa'ud ? " Again the tutor rolled his eyes , before he explained : " Noble khanum , when people meet it is like the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may blend and unite like the atmosphere , or they may quarrel like beasts until they fall bloody and insensible to the ground . Persons should therefore be approached with dignity , until their attributes are discovered . The custom allows the spirit time in which to quiet itself , to prepare itself for the shock or delight of meeting . " Mirza Sa'ud accounted himself a poet among his other accomplishments , which meant that he was a lover of gardens , and his pupils accordingly were instructed well in the names and attributes of flowers . " The narcissus is a lovely flower , " Martin had remarked one day , in Persian , forming the syllables precisely . He was startled to hear Mirza Sa'ud respond , in a burst of poetry : " It is the moon of flowers , and the hyacinth is the evening star of love . The poppy is the second star of evening , the fiery-eyed Mercury . But the narcissus , the hyacinth , and the poppy fade when the rose , the morning sun , darts his glances into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nightingale lingers to sing before the dawn , and the wind makes music in the branches . "  | Martin had been captivated by the speech , and had asked Mirza Sa'ud to repeat it , which he did , with dignity scarce concealing his delight , while Martin repeated it after him , memorizing . Later , whenever they strolled in their garden together , Martin was apt to chuckle , and bring forth this passage , which he would declare to be the spirit of Persia  --  poetry leaping from the lips like water from a fountain . Mirza Sa'ud was fond of recounting Persian tales and folklore , and his favorites were those from the " Mantiq at-Tair , " or " Parliament of Birds " of Farid ad-din Attar , the Sufi mystic poet of the twelfth century . The Sufis , whose name is derived from a Persian word of Greek origin , meaning " to know , " were concerned with the search for the ultimate in knowledge ; and Farid ad-din Attar 's composition is an allegorical portrayal of the longing of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself as somewhat of a Sufi , or so he explained his rapturous devotion to flowers , poetry , and philosophy . The " Parliament of Birds " tells of the assembly of the birds in a certain grove , their deliberations , their determination to find the mysterious Simurgh bird , embodiment of their ideals , and their quest . Under the leadership of the crested hoopoo , they set forth , but each evening while they rested , they would beguile themselves with stories ? " like the Canterbury pilgrims , " Mirza Sa'ud explained . One of the stories which were recounted was that of " The Moths and the Flame . " The moths , in conclave , were debating the meaning of the taper that burned in the castle courtyard . A messenger was sent to examine the flame and bring back his findings . A moth flew forth , circled the court , flew back and gave his report ; but he could say no more than that it was a light , and his views were dismissed . Another was sent ; this passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flame . He returned with  | singed wing , and with certain secrets which he revealed . But his report was likewise dismissed as unworthy . There flew a third ( Mirza Sa'ud would continue ) drunken with love 's desire , Folded his wings completely in the Fire , Holding them all the while amidst the Flame , Till , lost in Joy , he One with It became . He grasped the Fire outright from top to toe , His body like the Fire , one single glow . The Chief exclaimed  --  who saw afar , amaze , His color , Substance , all in One , i ' the Blaze ? " That Moth alone , who thus within It burned , " The Mystery knows  --  but ne'er to tell returned . " " And so it is , khanum , " Mirza Sa'ud would moralize , withdrawing a hand from the folds of the gabardine and lifting a finger pontifically , " one does not know the meaning of life until one is dead , pure joy until one is resigned to sorrow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self and self-desire . " Mirza Sa'ud died the winter following Abigail Carfax 's return to America . Martin told the circumstances in one of his letters : The old man had gone out , during a light snow , to give a lesson . Age and the chill combined to strike him down ; he was found by a wall , squatting in Persian fashion , his feet tucked under him , covered with a dust of snow . His gabardine was cloaked about him as when he sat respectfully before his pupils ; his head was sunk upon his chest , as though he were in contemplation  --  as no doubt he was  --  thinking of moonlit courtyards , and roses in spring , and the verses of the Persian poets . . . . Abigail Carfax had been engaged , at the time , in writing a new novel , her " Keeper of the Dungeon " ; the news so greatly disturbed her that she could not return to her work for several  | days . It saddened her to think of Mirza Sa'ud 's being gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was gone , but that he still lived . The toothless , pedantic tutor had become a tradition in Salamat ; he had freely poured himself out upon his days , and his spirit was mingled with the dust of his city . The thought struck Abigail Carfax : upon what was she pouring out herself ? II " The Bride of the Viking " was published . The imprint of the House of Pitcrest gave it a respectful reception in the trade , and people bought it because of the Pitcrest reputation . Readers found , however , that the book had merit of its own ; the story swept them on with its impetuosity ; it seemed to embody the daring , Viking spirit of the times . Overnight it was a success , a tremendous success : copies of it filled all the bookshops from Cornhill to Dover Street ; Ticknor 's Old Corner gave it a whole window , displacing even the leading works of the house of Ticknor and Field . While the reviewers were inclined to criticize the literary style , which they characterized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abrupt , " or " irregular , " they admitted that Abigail Carfax revealed an " enthusiasm for adventure , " a " challenging , audacious spirit , " and they one and all agreed that in her work the new author had somehow caught the restless , dynamic spirit of the era . The success of the work took Boston by surprise ; if Abigail Carfax was not immediately acclaimed as a literary sensation , it was only because Boston , as the literary metropolis of the New World , had too many gods already . Emerson , Lowell , Longfellow , Melville , Hawthorne , Holmes , Bancroft , were the fixed stars that dominated the literary firmament of the day . Pitcrest was overwhelmed . He had never experienced such a  | demand for one of his books . His presses ran day and night , while Pitcrest himself was busy counting his profits , which ran into the thousands , and dreamed of building new vessels for the California trade . Two things awakened his remorse : he had committed himself to pay the author on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a firm contract for her future work . Mrs. Pitcrest was caught completely unawares . She had already laid out her social calendar , and it had not taken account of a new author . She was not slow , however , to see her opportunity , and immediately set to work to arrange a reception . Amelia Pitcrest felt that at last here was a unique opportunity for the display of her social talents , and she spared no effort that would make the affair a success . The reception given for Mrs. Carfax was , as the phrase goes , an occasion in the annals of Boston society . Accounts of it were given , with greater or less detail , in all the journals that devoted space to social events , and even in a number that confined themselves to " politics , commerce and finance . " Abigail Carfax proved to be as interesting as the book ; the event was a brilliant success , and established her in social position . This may have been due in part to the freshness of her personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of timidity and reserve with passion and unexpectedness . Some credit also was due to Mrs. Pitcrest for her shrewd management of her protegee . Foremost of all , Mrs. Pitcrest had tactfully made Abigail Carfax aware of the need for appropriate dress , and finding her willing to be led , had selected for her a suitable gown . It was of red velvet , bouffant , decollete , as was the mode , but modest enough to harmonize with the modesty of the wearer ; it set off strikingly the flush of her temples , her lustrous dark eyes , and her mahogany hair . When the guests had all arrived , and  | Abigail Carfax was free to leave the reception dais , Mrs. Pitcrest gave her the proper instructions for mingling among the company . " I will give you a start , my child , " she said in a whisper , " but then you must make your own way . Do n't let anyone frighten you , and if they begin to pry you with questions , ignore them . " Mrs. Pitcrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society as a bos'n knows the ropes of his rigging . " Thank you , " smiled Abigail Carfax in reply . " I shall try to make my way . " " Remember that you 're an author , and you do n't have to know who is president , or governor of Massachusetts , or the price of tar . " " I understand . " They moved into the drawing-room , which from the doorway appeared to be filled with nothing but a mass of fluffy fabrics ? billows of tulle and gauze and taffeta and lace  --  in the midst of which floated china arms and heads , and tall , black figures like scarecrows in the midst of waving wheat . A great deal of conversation was in progress , and everything was animated . Abigail Carfax had prepared herself for the occasion , but now as she looked upon the company her conscience pricked her . The thought occurred : what would Martin say of so much extravagance and display ? At this moment , no doubt , he was pleading with the officials to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for never a winter passed but many died , not so much from shortage of the harvests , but because of the hoarding by the wealthy for a better price . How many hungry and naked had Abigail Carfax herself cared for at the mission gate , and how many had she been forced to turn away because her hand was empty ! And here She resolutely put the thought aside . It would be , she told her-  | self , unchristian to condemn these people for their display , and she had no right to condemn ... . The company in the room deferentially ignored Mrs. Pitcrest and Mrs. Carfax , allowing them to select whom they would for meeting , and went on with their conversation . The conversation , snatches of which Abigail Carfax heard , was of the market and railway shares , and the new fashions , and the wonders of science , especially the latest marvel of all , the telegraph . She was surprised , however , to hear one person speaking loudly in condemnation of the telegraph . He was a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fierce , glowering eyes . " We have made it an abomination already , " he was saying in a husky , cracked voice , that was nevertheless full of passion and vehemence . " The merchant no longer visits the market , and acquaints himself with its actual state ; he sits like a spider in his counting-house , and pulls the threads of his web . No longer is he required , for his profit , to provide a service , or add a value to the goods ; by means of the telegraph he takes advantage of differences in the markets , buying and selling simultaneously , in widely separated places , and gaining his profit with no other investment than the telegraph charges . Gold flows along the telegraph line , as wealth flows by rail , moving ever to the center , piling up , and compounding avarice with interest , while the nation decays . " There was more , but Abigail Carfax 's attention was taken by a young man , of somewhat girlish manner , who had come up to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompted Mrs. Pitcrest , in a distant way . " Mr. Harris Potter 's son , who is making a wonderful record at school , so I am told . Am I not right , Mr. Potter ? " Potter , Junior , who was the son of a prominent Boston advo-  | cate , frequently took the privilege of appearing in his father 's place , particularly at functions where literary or artistic celebrities were to be present , but otherwise he was a modest and estimable young man , a student at Harvard , genuinely interested in the " higher life " and tolerant of those who were not equally inclined . He accepted Mrs. Pitcrest 's remark as a compliment , and blushed . " I have been so interested in meeting you , Mrs. Carfax , " he began . " To write such a work as The Bride of the Viking ' must have taken a tremendous lot of research in medieval history . That is what astounds me about writing  --  the enormous amount of reading and research one must do in preparation . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not disappoint the young man by telling him that her story had been written during a single voyage , and out of no material but her imagination . Without requiring a reply , however , the young man continued , " I wonder what you think of Guido Cavalcanti . Professor Cragstone says he had a great influence on Dante , but personally I do n't think so , for his mood is quite different from Dante 's . Although he is at times mystical and philosophical , his mood is wholly lyrical , while Dante is all thought and intellect . " " I am afraid I am not acquainted with Cavalcanti , " replied Abigail Carfax . " Who is he ? " Mr. Potter regarded her with mild surprise . " Why , Cavalcanti is the father of Italian lyric poetry , " he replied , " and one of the greatest Italian geniuses of the thirteenth century , though very little is known of him today . " He went on to tell about the literary influences of the Italian Renaissance  --  matter that he had evidently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused , Abigail Carfax said modestly :  | " I am afraid that the only poets of that period I have read are Persian . " " Really ! " exclaimed the student . " Were there Persian poets at this period ? " " Farid ad-din Attar , Jalal ad-din Rumi , Shaikh Sa'di , all belong to this period , " replied Abigail Carfax , " though one must go back to the tenth century for the greatest name of all in Persian poetry  --  Firdausi . " If the young man 's respect for Mrs. Carfax had been slightly lowered by her ignorance of Italian literature , it revived on seeing her acquaintance with Persian . " Firdausi , " he exclaimed , " I have heard of him . Professor Cragstone has spoken of him as perhaps the greatest epic poet the world has ever known . His Shah Nameh ' ? that is it , is n't it ? ? he says , runs to sixty thousand couplets . That 's extraordinary . Whose translation do you use ? " " The Shah Nameh ' has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Persian . " Mr. Potter was in a state of awe at this information . He recovered , however , enough to ask : " Please tell me more about Firdausi . I have always been interested in epic poetry . . . . I have sometimes thought of having a try at it myself . " While this conversation had been going on , Mrs. Pitcrest had fluttered away , to see how the rest of her company was getting along . The student stood looking at Mrs. Carfax like a stagestruck girl at a reigning actress , waiting for her to speak . One or two others had drawn near , attracted by the conversation , and eager to hear how a famous authoress expressed herself . But Abigail Carfax could only smile faintly . The conversation was unbearable to her . Standing here , in the midst of this sea of silk and lace , faced by so many curious strangers , she was over-  | come by a sense of loneliness . The mention of Firdausi , and Persia , invaded her with such a flood of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had to lean against a chair for support . She saw Martin beside her , in their sparsely furnished sitting-room , the sunlight pouring in through a window , and before them , squatting on the floor , his heels tucked under him , his gabardine spread in a circle about him , their language tutor , Mirza Sa'ud , droning his toothless sibilants , going over the declensions and conjugations while Martin and Abigail phrased the Persian words after him . And then words formed in her mind , and lines from the words , and a verse from the " Shah Nameh " ? a verse which Martin had been fond of reciting , particularly at breakfast , after coming over and kissing his wife  --  the words of the Princess Rudabeh , yearning for her beloved , which go in English thus : When hearts are enchained ' t is vain to upbraid . Neither Caesar nor Sultan I wish to behold , Nor the monarch of Persia with jewels and gold ; All , all 1 despise , save the choice of my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Martin , however , would change the personal pronoun in the last line to the feminine gender , a change which , in Persian , violated the rhythm slightly , though Martin ignored that . Abigail Carfax drew her hand across her forehead to drive out the memories before they overwhelmed her . . . . III A gentleman touched Abigail Carfax lightly at the elbow . " May I ask for your company at the collation ? Mrs. Pitcrest has intimated that I might have that honor . "  | " Mr. Sweyton ! " exclaimed Abigail Carfax delightedly . She had not seen the architect since their meeting on Tremont Street , during the summer , and to encounter him now gave her a sense of relief and comradeship . " There must be no moralizing in company , " Fenton Sweyton said , as he took plates from the hands of the colored butler in knee breeches , " and so let us go into Mr. Pitcrest 's office , where we are not likely to be disturbed , for I must moralize , or I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of punch , will you ? I know you do n't indulge , but I feel the need of it . " Sweyton 's manner was buoyant , giddy almost ; his face was flushed , and there was a look of excitement in his eyes that Abigail Carfax had never observed before . He led the way into Pitcrest 's office , or study , a room with which he was evidently familiar . It lay in the wing of the house adjoining the carriage court , and could be reached either by passing through the secondfloor drawing-room , or by way of the middle staircase . It was not apart from the open quarters of the house , but only those guests entered who were invited there by Pitcrest himself . Abigail Carfax , however , did not know this . The room was not a large one , and was distinguished chiefly by the gilt girandole over the fireplace and the huge iron safe set into the wall opposite . It was furnished with a massive mahogany desk , two or three armchairs , and a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , took the cup of punch from his own plate , and gravely held it before Abigail Carfax . " To a reunion of comrades in sin , " he toasted . Abigail Carfax looked at him bewildered . " Were we such sinners to live at Mrs. Hutchins ' ? " she asked , in attempted lightness . " We are sinners to have left . Sinners to have forsaken the refuge of poverty for the world of success . This world wants no  | morality  --  only achievement . Not , how good you are , but what you can do . " " For one at a reunion , you seem quite disconsolate , " chided Abigail Carfax . " Why are you so harsh with the world ? " She felt very contented at the moment , away from the company in the drawing-room , and with someone who , if of short acquaintance , at least knew her when she was still obscure . " Because it has given me sail for my mast , but no ballast for my hold , " Sweyton exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boston in this year of our Lord 1851 ? People are rich and growing richer . Only let us build a finer railway station , they say , or a bigger clipper ship , a more magnificent hotel . Let us drain the sea and back up the waters of the rivers . What need have we of morals when we have machines ? Is there human injustice ? Tush , the poorest of us live better than our fathers . Why should there be complaint ? Are Negroes in slavery ? Not a word about it . It will hurt our cotton market . Is there vice in Pitts Street ? Well , let them keep north of Cambridge Street , and we wo n't bother them . By all means , you must be intellectual , you must have seen Miss Davenport as Juliet , you must have read the most recent volume of Bancroft , you must know what Holmes 's latest quip is . But you dare not have feelings . You dare not . " Sweyton had risen and was gesticulating with the cup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glance , and recalling it , put it to his lips and drank half its contents . Abigail Carfax suddenly felt sorry for him . She guessed that he had been drinking earlier , and she suggested that he eat something . " Yes , yes , of course , " he said , absently , and began to sample the boar's-head jelly . In a moment , however , he set the plate down and turned to Abigail Carfax . " No , no , Mrs. Carfax , " he exclaimed . " I did n't ask you here to  | eat , but to talk . We must talk with each other , for we are both geniuses that are on the verge of being swallowed by the demons . They want our souls . Pitcrest is one of them . He will take your beautiful soul and bend it to his needs , just as he and Bismith are taking my not-so-beautiful soul and bending it to their needs . Why do we succumb ? Because we are vain , we are led astray , we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrogance , and now he cries out in envy of Almighty God , for the lost glory , and seeks to rob the Almighty of His children , because of his envy of the lost radiance . " " How is your ship coming along ? " Abigail Carfax asked , in an effort to draw his thoughts into other channels . " Oh , splendid , splendid , " Sweyton exclaimed , his eyes sparkling . " Only it is not a ship , but the ships . After the launching of the Albatross , they commissioned two more , for which I am the supervising architect . They will be down the ways shortly , and then two more . Each one is bigger and faster than its predecessor . Some day I shall design  --  and they will build  --  a ship so big , so fast , that men can not believe it , that the very boards of it will groan from pride , that the swallows will envy it , that the sea will burn with its passing , and that God Himself can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall go insane . " " Oh , oh , you must not talk so , " protested Abigail Carfax , alarmed . " You must not talk so . " " And why not ? " asked Sweyton . He picked up his cup and looked in it , and seeing that it was empty , set it down disconsolately . His lips pouted in thought , while his eyes were downcast . " Your situation is the same as mine , and mine the same as Pitcrest 's , and as Mrs. Pitcrest 's . They pity Webster , who is growing senile and is still ambitious , still looking vainly toward the presidency , which he will never attain . But we are all the same . We are all consumed by ambition . We are on the wing , and we have  | no resting-place , and we shall fly and fly until we are exhausted , and then we shall sink into the pit which , for all our beating wings , we can not cross . We are birds in flight ; what we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aim only to soar higher and higher . " Arrogance , arrogance , arrogance . We pride ourselves on our achievements , but everywhere rottenness and corruption . The world is in moral convulsion ; great issues of right and wrong clamor for solution ; in a few years , if they are not solved , our nation will be in the throes of bloody conflict . It is already upon us in Kansas , and will be upon us here in Boston . But instead , we talk about clipper ships , and railroads , and stock markets , and the price of commodities , and the new granite block on Hanover Street , and draining the sea from Back Bay  --  God , what arrogance , to drain the sea when there is a continent of land behind us . " Abigail Carfax could not understand this tirade on the part of Sweyton , whom she had always known to be so intellectually calm , so mannerly , so scholarly in his attitudes . It was the drink , she was positive . She was at loss as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in to announce that Miss Burton was going to sing , and they went below ... . The party moved on , and came to its conclusion . For a long time that night , Abigail Carfax lay in bed thinking of the party , and of the bewildering things she had heard and seen . As she lay in her bed and looked up into the darkness , there seemed to her to have been an unreality about it all , as though everyone had been seized by a kind of madness . Everyone , she remembered , seemed to talk at random , about whatever idea struck him at the moment , whether it interested anyone else or not . It was as though each one there had suddenly awakened from a long sleep , and , bedazzled by the world in which he found him-  | self , had started babbling of his discovery . So must the troops and camp followers of Alexander have babbled , Abigail Carfax thought , when they entered Persepolis and gazed upon the spoil that lay before them , and their thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... . The reception had been very exciting , Abigail Carfax confessed to herself . She had never experienced anything like it in her life . But more than the excitement , which frightened her just a little , was the elation and sense of freedom she felt . Her thoughts were keyed to a pitch , and they ranged the world on wings of light . She seemed to float over the cities and plains of the continents and to see the lamps twinkling in innumerable hamlets , and from the masts of ships at sea ; as a voyager of the skies she beheld the moonlight glistening upon the snowy mountain tops , gleaming upon the desert sands and reflected from the restless globe that spun beneath her ; and while she gazed she felt a great compassion for these creatures of the earth , a oneness with them , as an unseen companion at a million firesides , as though , were she gently to remove the roof from any one of the houses and peer within , she would know what to expect , and how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sudden pang of desire to join these creatures of the earth , to be one with them , a companion to their joys , a sharer of their sorrows . " I must tell about people , " she said to herself . " I must dedicate myself to telling about people , so that people may understand each other , and love each other . I must tell them about the beautiful things of life , about courage , and faith , and charity , and ? devotion . " Her thoughts paused in their racing , for the word " devotion " touched her like a cold rod upon her back . She thought of Martin , going about his work , patiently instructing his inquirers ,  | working evenings over his translation of the New Testament , going out to visit the poor and the sick , being in all ways a devout and humble apostle of Christ in an unfriendly land . " We must each be devoted in our own way , " Abigail Carfax counseled herself . " If God has given me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not lay it away in a napkin . I must continue on the course that has been pointed out to me . I must have the courage to do what is required . If it means that I must live alone , then I must have the courage to do so . " " Yes , " she thought , " I must have strength to live alone . That is the secret of true greatness  --  the courage and the will to soar on ones own pinions . Yet while Abigail Carfax was so reasoning with herself , there appeared to her the image of Martin , pale of face , dark eyes glowing with the concentration of study . He was bending over the native-fashioned table of walnut , his papers scattered about him . And it seemed that he looked up from his work , and saw her standing beside him , her hand upon his shoulder , as she had so often laid it , and a smile came into his pale face , and he laid aside his pen and rose to take her into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pillow , while she sought to choke back the tears , and the yearning cry : " Oh , Martin , Martin . "  | Chapter Eight I " THE BRIDE OF THE VIKING " had been published in October . This work was followed , shortly after the first of the year , by " Degrees of Latitude , " which attained almost equal acclaim , and early in the summer by the " Keeper of the Dungeon . " The success of the last confirmed Abigail Carfax as an author of distinction ; in a literary firmament already dazzling with its galaxies of suns , stars , and satellites , she shone with unique and matchless luster , and Boston gave her its accolade . Abigail Carfax was received and dined and feted : reception followed reception , dinner party upon dinner party , and aside from such affairs she was in demand to speak before the innumerable literary circles and clubs with which the city abounded . Abigail Carfax now had the means of providing the children with their every necessity . Furthermore , as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had less and less time for them , she attempted to compensate them for the loss by satisfying their smallest wants . She was always ordering them something new for their wardrobe , some new book she thought might interest them , or a new game , or a basket of fruit or a box of confections . In August she had found time to take them to the yacht races at Nahant , which Jason had expressed an interest in seeing , and she had promised them , if her engagements allowed , to take them to New York for the Christmas holidays . Some of Abigail Carfax 's earnings went in remittances to  | Martin , for his work , despite Martin 's protests and his wellunderstood distrust of money , and other sums went for her own purposes . As for herself , however , despite her much going about among the wealthy and fashionable , Abigail Carfax 's tastes remained undeveloped . She never wore jewelry , and her dress , though rich and elegant , and generally in excellent taste , was the selection of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear whatever she found at hand in her wardrobe , with sometimes incongruous effect . For some time Abigail Carfax had regarded their location in Chester Street as too low and too infested with marsh airs for Estelle 's health , and had planned to move as soon as she should find something more suitable . During her visit to Nahant , a gentleman was introduced to her who mentioned a property that seemed to be just the thing ; shortly after her return , she went to see it , and as it pleased her she bought it . The house had belonged to a Mr. Latham , a silk merchant , recently deceased , and it was being sold to close the estate . It lay in Dorchester Heights , in South Boston , some distance out , beyond where Dorchester Street meets Broadway , and not far from the House of Industry . Its situation on a hilltop , near the shore ( this was before the shore had been advanced into the bay by successive fills ) , offered both salubrious breezes and a splendid view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The house was large , though not an " establishment , " and was luxuriously furnished in a somewhat somber style . It was constructed of stone below and of brown shingle above , and its lines suggested a medieval castle in miniature . The entrance was through a large round tower , which was set at one corner as though added as an afterthought of the builder . The tower room was bare and gloomy , for the only light came from two casement windows , heavily leaded , and empty save for a suit of  | armor standing on a pedestal. ? Abigail Carfax had been attracted by this piece of armor when she was shown the house . Later , she had the piece removed to the hall outside her rooms , where it gave her the illusion of a guard standing by her door . Beyond the tower room was a large reception-room , carpeted with a Chinese rug , and furnished with numerous pieces of Chinese origin and influence  --  some magnificent sea chests of teakwood , a massive table and several chairs of Chippendale in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a huge fireplace with a canopy that reached to the ceiling . This room likewise was gloomy , for the windows were high and narrow and admitted but little light . Abigail Carfax at first had had no intention of buying the house , in view of her expectation of returning to Persia , but , as the gentleman with whom she dealt explained , there were advantages for the children in having a home of their own and not simply a leased place : these advantages were both social and emotional . Moreover , it appeared to be a great bargain , since the executors were anxious to sell , and the gentleman had assured Abigail Carfax that when she decided to she could dispose of it easily , or if not , that it was certainly a valuable inheritance for her children . The house having been bought , conscience reproached Abigail Carfax for her extravagance . Despite suggestions that it could be made a show place by redecoration , she forebore , contenting herself with its somber atmosphere , and even coming to like it . Indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as her study . It was a large withdrawing room on the second floor , fitted with heavy furniture of mahogany and ebony , a wall covering of dark red silk damask , and heavy draperies over curtains at the windows . As if to escape even the little sunlight that entered , the desk which she used was set in the darkest corner  | of the room , and two tall candelabra , one on each side of the desk , provided illumination . The habit of doing her literary work in a darkened room had become fixed with Abigail Carfax , and she seemed to find in seclusion a relief from her restlessness , and the atmosphere in which to set in motion the creatures of her imagination . " The Bride of the Viking " still continued popular , despite the interest in Abigail Carfax 's subsequent work , and in October , on the anniversary of its publication , a dramatized version was produced at the Atheneum with the distinguished actress Julia Lane as the bride Sigrid , supported by Edward Godfrey as the Viking Ruud . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cast and the lavishness of the staging , combined to make the event an outstanding attraction . The tickets for the opening night were sold out weeks in advance , and the occasion was one over which society made a great deal , with dinner parties preceding and supper parties following . After the opening of her play , a mood came over Abigail Carfax . For a day or so , she went about in a nervous elation , and talked gaily with the children about their youthful interests , and went shopping and brought home a carriage-load of packages for them , some wisely selected , some not . Then almost immediately afterward , a lethargy fell upon her , and she seemed to have become wearied with the round of social and literary events that took her time . She began to cancel all engagements that she could without giving offense , and took to her room , spending whole days there , writing and tearing up , writing and pasting together , working until late in the night , and appearing only for meals or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found it difficult to reconcile themselves to such preoccupation , but they recognized that their mother 's life no  | doubt had its necessities apart from them , and they accommodated themselves to this new order as best they could . One afternoon , as Abigail Carfax came downstairs for a cup of tea , she found Robert Ware waiting to see her . He was talking to Estelle , the two sitting with great reserve opposite each other across the wide fireplace in the drawing-room , but discussing some question of Greek philosophy in the animated earnestness characteristic of their age . Robert often had occasion to see Mrs. Carfax on matters of business for his employer , and he more often made such occasion . Abigail Carfax realized the purpose behind these visits , and understandingly permitted Robert to have a few minutes with Estelle each time he came . The two young people arose when Abigail Carfax descended the stairs , and Robert came to speak with her . " I have a letter for you , Mrs. Carfax , " he said . " I could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delivered it to us in person for you , I thought it might be urgent . " " And so you waited , without telling me , until I should be coming down , " chided Abigail Carfax smiling . " Robert thought you might be busy on a scene , and did not wish to disturb you , " explained Estelle , coming to the young man 's aid . " The truth is , that I am in the midst of a scene , dear , and very perplexed , " said Abigail Carfax sighing a little wanly , and taking the letter from Robert 's hand . " Have you told Ellen we will have tea ? " " Yes , Mother , it is ready when you wish it . " " Then , darling , will you ring ? " As Estelle went to the cord , Abigail Carfax seated herself tiredly in a damask armchair . She was dressed negligently in an afternoon frock of quilted yellow satin , on which several spots of ink showed . Robert marked the air of preoccupation , border- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letter , and turned it over and over before she finally opened it . She read the message , and her brow contracted in a frown . Turning finally to Robert and Estelle , she remarked : " There is an Arab proverb that goes , Hajra men yidd ' .. . From the hand of a friend a stone becomes an apple , ' but in this case it is a hard saying . I am deeply indebted to Mr. Shortcross , through whose kind introduction I obtained a publisher . But do you know what he asks ? " The young people waited respectfully . " Mr. Shortcross wants me to do an essay for The Advocate ? on any subject of my choosing , " Abigail Carfax announced . " But why not ? " Robert protested . " It is n't like a novel , of course , but The Advocate is widely read , and it should n't take you long . " " Mr. Shortcross thinks to offer me an apple , but he gives me a stone . I can not write essays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one at that . " " Mother ! " " Yes , a poor novelist , a novelist of mood , and romance , and adventure , but with never an idea . And the essence of an essay is an idea . " " But you have many ideas , Mrs. Carfax , " protested Robert again . " Ideas , but not an idea . Not a dominating theme , a message . I have written out of loneliness , or longing , but never with a message to give to people . " Abigail Carfax had risen and was walking to and fro , hands clasped , talking to Robert and Estelle as though they were not a young man and an adolescent girl , but two grave scholars whose judgment she courted . " I am a novelist , Robert , " she went on urgently , " a novelist of  | distinction , if I may say so . Do you know what was said to me not so long ago , by the French consul ? He compared me to Balzac . That I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not his intellectual perception and shrewdness , or the vastness of his concept . I am a woman , and emotional . " " I must have an idea , " she went on . " I must break the shell of my intellectual coma , and find a new world . " Ellen brought in the tea tray , and Abigail Carfax resumed her seat . As she poured the tea , she fell into an apathy of thought , hardly speaking for some minutes , while Robert and Estelle sat in silence . Presently she asked Robert : " Have you read Balzac ? " " No , ma'am , I have not , " confessed the young man . " I am still reading Greek literature . " " But some day you hope to get as far along as modern French , " laughed Estelle , teasing . The young man blushed . " I have read some of Sir Walter Scott 's works , " he protested . " Scott can not compare with Balzac , " remarked Abigail Carfax , " despite the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's younger days . Balzac is undoubtedly the greatest master of the novel that form of literature has known . " She began to talk about the French master , to whose works and life she had evidently been giving some attention of late , concluding by saying : " For exquisiteness of detail in description , for the penetration of his characterizations , and above all for the brilliance of his intellectual concepts , Balzac is unsurpassed . " Abigail Carfax arose , as Jason came in . " You will excuse me , Robert , wo n't you , " she said . " I must return to my work . Tell Mr. Shortcross that I will let him know later about the article . "  | When his mother had gone , Jason went to a chair near the window , where he sat moodily gazing through its murky panes . " Why does mother have to sit day after day in that dark old room , with the curtains drawn , scribbling , scribbling , scribbling ? " he grumbled . " I really do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do . I wish she did n't have to write . " Jason arose in irritation , and started to leave the room . " I have no patience with writers , anyway , " he said . " What are you going to be when you grow up ? " Robert called him back . Jason turned . The question awakened in him the realization of his own approaching manhood , when he would be free to choose his life , and live as his desires led him . He thrust a hand into his pocket , thoughtfully , and partly closed his eyes as though fixing them on something . " When I am grown , " he said slowly , deliberately , and with a satisfaction he made no attempt to conceal , " I shall go to sea . " II Robert Ware was in a mood of restlessness when he left the Carfaxes ' , and instead of going home , he walked toward the Custom House . The Custom House at night had become a frequent resort of the boy . He liked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doric columns , its splendid dome  --  this was before a later generation buried the dome under a tower of masonry and steel , leaving only the Doric columns as a reminder of the original lines of the structure  --  and imagine himself an ancient Greek wandering among the glories of the Acropolis . By daylight , the Custom House was a prosaic place of business , with its plaza filled with carts and drays , its porches and  | halls with brokers , shipmasters , clerks , and runners  --  everyone hurrying about in the greatest confusion , and with an air of the greatest importance , as though all Boston hung breathless on their coming , as all London waited for news of Waterloo . At such times Robert Ware avoided it , if he could , for he preferred quiet places , places where he could sit and think . At night the Custom House wore a different air  --  a cloak of romance , and the nostalgic atmosphere of the ancient past . The fluted columns that supported the porticoes , though they were made of granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marble ; the dome was majestic ; the whole mass , founded on a Greek cross , was impressive . At night it was usually quiet , unless ships at the wharves were lading , and the only sounds were those of loose canvas beating against the shrouds , the groaning of stay lines , the lapping of water against the wharves , the rumble of an occasional cart , and sometimes the pigeons , that roosted along the cornices and mouldings . Robert liked to sit on the steps of the Custom House , and in the shadow of one of the Doric columns cast his thoughts into the classic antiquity in which his reading had immersed his spirit . He liked to think he was listening to a speech of Demosthenes , or to the arguments of Pericles ; to the tales of Xenophon 's soldiers , returned from the Persian wars . Below , there at the wharf , he would see , in his mind , a trireme galley ; in his imagination he would board it , and sail to foreign lands , past Scylla and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the golden shores of Colchis , sail past the Sirens , and nod at the cave of Calypso . Robert , dreaming in the shadow of the column , would wonder what those distant lands were like , what Pompey found in Asia Minor , and Caesar in Gaul , and Alexander in the land of Persia . This evening , however , Robert did not go wool-gathering . He  | was concerned , as concerned as a young man can be , about a fundamental problem of human relationships . Out of a deepening affection for Estelle , and a boyish admiration for her mother , was growing a sense of responsibility for their wellbeing and happiness . This evening he realized , quite sharply , that the household wanted something to make it whole , and that because of this want a deterioration was in progress . Robert did not comprehend what it all meant ; he was incapable of comprehending the violence of the forces that were at work ; he was young , and he had been too absorbed in resolving his own attitudes to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom truth was the important thing , and he was tenacious in its search . The discovery , now , of the existence of a disorder in the Carfax household , while it awakened his sympathy , at the same time aroused a new and disturbing philosophical inquiry . Robert realized that he had little consolation , advice , or assistance to offer in the situation , and the fact was like the ground shaking under him : he lost all selfassurance and peace of mind . He racked his mind to recall what Aurelius or Epictetus had said that he might apply , but he could remember nothing . Either he had read these philosophers with too narrow an interest , with only his own problems in mind , or possibly  --  and this was the disturbing thought  --  they did not contain the answer to the problem that baffled him now . As Robert entered State Street , he observed at Jennings , Cresson and Company , where his friend Prisson worked , that one of the windows was lighted . The building was substantial , of granite construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near the roof of the porch , over the entrance , was a small window , almost concealed under the porch , and it was at this window that the light showed . As Robert passed , the light went out , and before he had gone  | many steps the door at the side , on the alley , which the employees used , opened softly and closed , and a short , plump figure appeared , barely visible in the shadow . It was Prisson . " Tom , " Robert called . Prisson looked up with the manner of one taken by surprise . " Oh , it 's you , Bob ! " he exclaimed , and crossed over . " I have been working late on some accounts , " Prisson said , feeling called upon to explain his presence at his firm 's office at that hour of a Sunday . He went on to add , pridefully , " I carry a key now , you know . " " That means a lot of responsibility , " said Robert admiringly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not only industrious , but I 'm smart , " Prisson continued . " I saved the firm twelve thousand dollars last week by reading the fine print on a certificate which no one else had bothered to read . But what are you doing out at this hour of the night ? " " I was just going down to the Custom House for a while . It 's pleasant there of evenings . " " So you still have your head steeped in Greece and Rome , " exclaimed Prisson in friendly impatience . They had come under a gas street-lamp , and Robert could see his friend more plainly ? the puffiness around the eyes , from close study of figures ; the eyes themselves , cold and appraising ; and the figure , clad in excellent broadcloth , portly for a young man . The whole appearance was that of a person whose intellect and will have been sharpened to a purpose , and whose purpose is well on the way to realization ; in all , an air of keenness mingled with assurance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Prisson added , " but not for fellows like us . I have discovered that much for myself . God , how much money I spent buying history books . But Greek and Latin will never make you a living . " " I should be growing out of it , " said Robert , apologetically ,  | and then smiling , " but I guess I am getting too old to break my ways . " " Old ! " exclaimed Prisson , humorlessly , intensely serious , as he was about everything . " You are only at the beginning of life . You have your future ahead of you . Now is the time to make your plans and to put them into execution . " With Frisson , every activity was weighed with solemn judgment . In making investments , of course , the heights of judgment were required : to invest incautiously was to sin against the Holy Ghost ; no matter how much money a man had , he could not afford to lose a penny in the market . But even lesser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the choice of a scarf was of moment to Prisson . Now that he came more in contact with the clientele , he was concerned that his dress  --  of which the scarf , because it showed above the counter , was of main importance  --  be rich , subdued , and of immaculate taste . As an effect of all this , Prisson was beginning to assume an air of majesty and judgment vaguely resembling that which Michelangelo gave to the face of Moses . " What plans do you think I should have ? " Robert asked in all seriousness . " Every man of character should have a family , " said Prisson pontifically . " There is nothing like family responsibilities to bring out all that is best in a man . One should therefore begin to plan for marriage . Marriage requires a house ; and a house , money . One 's first consideration , therefore , is an investment plan , one that will yield a steady and gradually increasing income that will provide for the steadily increasing demands of the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Robert , smiling , " that the first thing would be to start looking for a wife . " " If you have money , you can always find a wife , " retorted  | Prisson , without the slightest intention of being cynical . " Well , go on . " " One should begin laying the foundation of the family future while one is young , " continued Prisson . " Look at this firm , for instance . " He pointed to the brass sign riveted to the granite wall of the building : ROWLAND LACY , SHIPMASTER . " There is no richer man in Boston , I guess , than Captain Lacy . How did he make his way ? By whaling . He became a boatsman , and then harpooner , and with his share of the oil bought a little tub of his own . He dared to take it into the Antarctic , fought out a hurricane , came back loaded to the gunwales , and now he owns a fleet of whalers . He has established a fortune that will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Lacy 's greatgrandchildren will be hoarding pictures of the old man  --  the way people now hoard Revere silver  --  as the founder of their fortunes . " In this , of course , Prisson 's prophecy was in error , for the firm of Lacy went into bankruptcy in the Panic of 1857 . " Now is the time to lay the foundations , " continued Prisson . " I study the market , and my judgment has been vindicated more than once . Why , even old Mr. Wegdon himself now and then stops me , and says , ' Prisson , what do you think of the market for railway shares today ? ' Railway shares  --  that 's my specialty . In ten years , Bob Ware , you 'll find me in a house on Beacon Hill , with a brougham and a coachman in livery . " " In fact , if you must know , " he added , confidentially , coming close and speaking in a low voice into his companion 's ear , " that 's what I was doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Robert politely . " I was going over my accounts , and my companies . These are big days , Robert . America is growing , and here 's a chance to grow with it . Would you like to know of an investment that  | will yield you twenty percent the first year , and from thirty to fifty percent in each succeeding year ? Do you know of anything that will yield you a return like that ? " " But I have no money for ventures , " protested Robert . " Of course you have n't , " affirmed Prisson , " but if you have imagination , and will , and decision , they 're as good as money . How do you suppose I do it ? " " I could n't guess . " " I have a job with a reputable firm , the same as you . It is an asset , it is good collateral . One may borrow against one 's salary , and buy ten shares . These in turn provide the security upon which to borrow and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessor of twenty-five or more . " " But , " asked Robert anxiously , " is n't there a great deal of risk connected with such an operation ? " Prisson laughed . " My dear boy , " he said , " it is plain to be seen that you know little about finance . How do you suppose great fortunes are made if not by courage and skill ? " " And perhaps by the aid of a little luck ? " added Robert . " I am content with what luck serves me , " returned Prisson with satisfaction . " I am making a good return on my money . I am growing rich  --  in a modest way . " He coughed , as though he had gone too far . Robert looked at him closely ; in the moonlight Prisson 's face seemed bloated , and his eyes like those of a frog peering out from among the ferns on a bank . " It hardly seems good business to go so heavily into debt , " Robert commented . " It 's excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way money is made . Your old man , Pitcrest , has learned the secret . He is mortgaged to the hilt . Everybody goes into debt . "  | " What 's this about Pitcrest ? " Robert asked quickly . Prisson hesitated , for he had revealed a business confidence . " Well , " he said finally , " there 's no harm in your knowing , since you 're my friend , but keep it between ourselves . He mortgaged his publishing business to go into shipbuilding with Bismith . " " Really ? " exclaimed Robert anxiously . " Are you sure ? " " Certain . My firm was the mortgage broker . " Robert said nothing , but paused . They had come to Broad Street , and just ahead was the Custom House . " What is this investment of yours ? " Robert asked . " Red River Valley Plantations , " said Prisson eagerly . " It operates large cotton fields in Georgia . If you are interested , I 'll send you a prospectus . The shares are small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to see you in . You will make some money . " " No , I would n't be interested . " " No ? " " It operates with slave labor ? " " Naturally . " " When you realize , as you will , that this twenty percent comes from the sweat of slaves , " said Robert solemnly , " you will not be satisfied with this investment . It is a sin . " " What is a sin ? " asked Prisson impatiently . " This business is backed by some of the most reputable houses in the Street . " He looked about him , as though he were about to turn off , then added : " Think it over , and I will talk to you again . It is a sin also to go through life missing one 's opportunities , failing to realize one 's capacities , failing to develop our natural resources , and our personal resources as well . " " You might think about that , Bob , " he added . " We are work- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as the Greeks and Romans did . " After they parted , Robert went on toward the Custom House . He was disturbed . It was late , but he was not sleepy , and the moon , now well overhead , cast an aqueous pallor over the roofs and upon the granite walls , and upon the cobbled streets . The wharves were deserted . An air of calm lay over the quarter , like the calm that must have lain over the bay long before the white man , bursting with vitality , ambition , and imagination , had come to its shores and begun to build a city there . Robert sat down on the steps of the Custom House to think . Though everything about him was asleep , and quiet , within his breast was a great tumult , a storm of questions , a conflict of ideas ....  | Chapter Nine I CHARLES PITCREST HAD asked his wife , with a purpose in mind , to give an especial invitation to Mrs. Carfax . Amelia Pitcrest , at first mildly surprised , recognized the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were required . She had a capacity for negotiation  --  where the arts of cajolery , imperiousness , insinuation , and flattery were involved  --  and at times she was indispensable to her husband . Responding sweetly , if triumphantly , she took matters in hand at once , and extended an invitation to Abigail Carfax to go driving . The invitation was accepted , and it was arranged that the Pitcrests would drive out to Dorchester Heights for their guest at three o'clock the following Sunday afternoon . Charles Pitcrest 's purpose was to provide a favorable opportunity for him to broach a matter of business . Finances and business arrangements were unfamiliar matters to Abigail Carfax ; the mention of them was enough to throw her into alarm , and she would begin to tremble as though she had done something wrong . In this , however , Abigail Carfax need not have been alarmed . Though Pitcrest had found himself , much to his dismay , committed to pay her far greater sums in royalties than he had dreamed of  --  how often he had regretted not proposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be satisfied with her success : the House of Pitcrest , thanks to Abigail Carfax , was on the way to new fortune . But receipts beget expense , and profits  | beget investment . Money is like the dancing sprites of steam ; it must be constantly in motion ; it is power expended and collected , collected and expended ; the moment it ceases its restless flux , and only collects , it ceases to be money , but a substance of no more value than stagnant water . Charles Pitcrest had been led , by his business association with Bismith , to make large commitments in their shipping ventures . The revenues from " The Bride of the Viking " would have been more than sufficient to extinguish the mortgage he had placed upon his publishing business , but the prospects of the shipping business were so bright that the more attractive course had been to extend these operations by further investment , allowing the increased revenues to discharge the mortgage and return the added funds invested . Two more ships , of larger tonnage than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their construction the revenues of the book were disbursed as rapidly as they came in . Charles Pitcrest had not committed himself so far without certain qualms . He experienced a sinking of the heart every time he thought of the money he was investing , and the fact that it was all committed to the mercy of the waves . More than once , at night , he had awakened from troubled dreams , in a cold sweat , with the image of disaster before his eyes , while out of the silence and darkness of his bedroom there fell upon his ears the roar of rushing waters , breaking over the forecastle , slithering along the decks in foamy spume , and the sound of wind shrieking in storm , and canvas cracking like cannon shot , and before his eyes there would appear the vision of a ship sinking  --  sliding stern first under a mountainous wave , the great sea snapping the masts , and carrying the canvas aloft like a wind-tossed handkerchief . If that ship were his ship  --  the thought simply filled him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a violent  | tremor , that he would have to rise and walk about the room to quiet his nerves . Other things there were to give Pitcrest pause . He and Bismith lunched together several times a week , to talk over the progress of their affairs , and usually they went to Brock 's or the Exchange Coffee House . It was here that one fell in with the company of merchants and brokers , and the conversation was full of the great events that were taking place , of the California trade , of the rising market for wares , of the new construction that was going on , of enterprises and prices and rates of return . . . . It was all very exhilarating ; the streets of Boston seemed as spacious as those of London and Paris , and Charles Pitcrest had become a part of its active and absorbing life . But the moment he left this stimulating atmosphere , and Bismith 's genial self-assurance , Pitcrest 's fears would be aroused about the very things that an hour before had seemed so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the very confidence which everyone expressed in the new prosperity . Pitcrest knew , though he tried to disbelieve it , that such things can not last , that eventually the turn would come , when there would be a panic or a crisis . Such crises had occurred more than once in his memory : in 1814 , when he was a mere boy , too young to know what was happening , aware only of a great tenseness in his father 's face ; again in 1825 , though this one was less severe ; and in 1837 , following the collapse of the state bank boom . The last mentioned had gone hard with the House of Pitcrest , caught with many accounts owing it which proved to be worthless , and Pitcrest had wondered more than once whether there would be any business for him to inherit . This was when his father , though growing old , still had control ; he died the following year , largely from the strain of worry . Against the possibility of financial disaster , Pitcrest had one  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pen held in the hand of Mrs. Carfax . So long as she continued to write such books as " The Bride of the Viking " and " The Keeper of the Dungeon , " and so long as they continued to evoke an equal public response , he could realize his visions without jeopardizing his security . But here was a flaw , the gnawing doubt . Would Mrs. Carfax continue to write : how much longer could he count on this stream of words and profits ? Whenever he had discreetly mentioned the subject , Mrs. Carfax had always given him to understand that she would be in America three years only . If that was the case , his time was limited . Should Mrs. Carfax return to Persia , there would seem no reason for her to cease writing . It should be possible for her to write , and for Pitcrest to publish , even though the distance that separated them would be eight thousand miles ; but Pitcrest shrewdly reasoned that once she returned to her husband , Mrs. Carfax would never write again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  on the fact that prior to leaving her husband she had never written a novel . Though he was no expert on the workings of the mind , he suspected that literature , such as Mrs. Carfax produced , came from an unquiet spirit ; that once Mrs. Carfax was at peace with herself , the product would cease . It was necessary , in Pitcrest 's view , that he fortify himself against the contingency . To this end he had drawn up a contract , and he now was looking for a favorable moment in which to get Mrs. Carfax 's signature . The contract had several clauses to Pitcrest 's interest , but the chief at the moment was the agreement , on Mrs. Carfax 's part , to deliver the manuscripts of six novels . Six had seemed to him a reasonable number , considering the rate at which Mrs. Carfax had been producing .  | It was a day of late October ; the trees , in rich autumn foliage only a short time before , had been disrobed by a driving rain , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were collected in desolate heaps along the walls and in the gutters , and pools of leaf-stained water lay in depressions in the street . The air was still warm , but with the dying warmth of a new corpse . The Pitcrests came in a large landau , drawn by a pair of fine grays which Pitcrest had recently purchased . Both the ladies wore broad crinolines , which demanded a deal of skill on the part of the wearers in entering a carriage and in seating themselves ; when Amelia Pitcrest and Abigail Carfax were settled in their places , the flounces so completely concealed Pitcrest 's lower parts as to give the impression of a humpty-dumpty floating on a sea of silk and velvet . Mrs. Pitcrest expressed delight that Mrs. Carfax had joined them . " You should get out into the sunshine and air oftener , " she said sweetly . " You spend too much time over your desk , and while Charles  --  and your public  --  look for many more works from your gifted pen , I , for one , must take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty which is no less notable than your books . " Abigail Carfax smiled faintly , and thanked her for her solicitude . She was in a mood of preoccupation . For some reason Martin had been in her thoughts all day , so insistently that she had barely been able to write . Conversation continued to flow , however , with Amelia Pitcrest supporting the burden  --  of which she was well capable  --  and ran through all the subjects of current interest that were exciting , droll , amusing , or edifying , and were not in the least controversial . Pitcrest gave the coachman the directions . They crossed the
