THE HOPE CHEST A Story JEAN STAFFORD M ISS BELLAMY was old and cold and she lay quaking under an eiderdown which her mother had given her when she was a girl of seventeen . It had been for her hope chest . Though damask table cloths and Irish linen tea-napkins , Florentine bureau runners and China silk blanket covers , point-lace doilies and hemstitched hand towels had gone into that long carved cherry chest ( her father had brought it all the way from Sicily and presenting it to her , had said , " Nothing is too good for my Rhoda girl " ) , she had never married . The chest now stood at the foot of her bed . and the maid put the tea-napkins on her breakfast tray . It was just before Belle knocked on her door in the gray dawn of winter with the tray that Miss Bellamy quaked so much , as if nothing on earth could ever warm her up again . This unkind light made her remember how old she was and how , in a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how hard she tried , she could never be pleasant to a servant , black or white , a failing for which her father had once rebuked her , declaring that she behaved like a parvenu . He had scolded her thus when he finally had to admit to himself the fact that she would never marry . There had not , in the history of Richmond society , been a greater fiasco than Rhoda Bellamy 's debut . It had , indeed , been a miscarriage so sensational that she had forced her parents to move westward , like pioneers , into Tennessee where her mother soon had died and where she and her father dwelt together in their angry disappointment . Well , Papa , the laugh 's on you . Here I am , thirty-five years old and in the eighteen years since I came out , I have had no beau but my dear Papa . No , I will not go to the opera . No , I do not want to join you in a glass of claret . I shall return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I turn a page for giving me so expensive a copy of Cranford . This was the Christmas morning of her eighty-second year and she steadfastly held her eyes closed , resisting the daylight . She had been like that as a child , she had loved sleep better than eating or playing . She was not sure whether she had had a dream just now or whether there was something she had meant to remember or to think about that was troubling her aged mind like a rat in a wall . At last , vexed and murmuring , she opened her eyes and what did she see hanging upon the wall ( very probably staining the hand-blocked French paper with a design of pastoral sweethearts ) but a scraggly Christmas wreath to which had been wired three pine-cones , one gilded , one silvered , one painted scarlet . At first she was half out of her mind with exasperation and she reached out her liver-spotted hand for her stick to rap tyrannically for Belle . How dared she desecrate this , of all rooms , which as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any way ! But memory stayed her hand : it all came back . ? r STERDAY , when she was sitting on the ounge in the drawing room , making spills out of last year 's Christmas wrappings and sipping hot milk , she heard a timid knocking at the door . She had no intention of answering it , although Belle had gone out to shop and the colored girl had gone home . But she said to herself , " Who is it ? Who arc they that they ca n't knock out loud like a Christian ? If they want something , why do n't they try the doorknob ? They 'll find it locked , but if they had any gumption , they 'd try . " She slowly made a spill . It went on , this gentle , disheartened knocking . Was it a squirrel , she wandered , playing with a nut somewhere ? If there is a destructive squirrel in my house , I shall give Belle her walking papers at once . She did not find the creatures cunning as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other rodent and the tail , so greatly admired in some quarters , was by no means a disguise that could not be seen through : essentially they were rats . Perhaps it was not a squirrel but was a loose branch blowing in the wind : I shall speak severely to Homer . If he calls himself my yard-man , he can attend to these details . Perhaps it was a dog of the neighborhood , foolishly thumping his tail against the door . People should keep their dogs at home , tied up if necessary . If they are not kept at home , they come rummaging in my refuse containers and defiling my lawn and littering the garden with things I do not like to know exist . Aloud in the long drawing room , she said , knowing that she smiled cleverly in her lean lips and in her small eyes , " If you want to come in , knock loud enough so that I shall hear you . Call out your name , confound you . Do you think I receive just anyone ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buttons down the front of her challis guimpe . Outraged , she threw the spill she was making into the tire and then she hobbled to the door , saying under her breath , " Whoever you are , I will frighten the living daylights out of you . If you arc an animal , I will beat you with my stick ; if you are a human being , I will scare you out of ten years ' growth . I will say the worst thing you have ever had said to you in your life . " In the winter she had a green baize door and a storm door sandwiching the regular door to keep out any possible draft . She pulled open the green baize one and unlocked the wooden one with a long iron key and she opened it the merest bit , pushing it with the silver ferrule of her blackthorn stick . Through the glass of the storm door , she saw a child standing there in the snow , holding a spruce wreath in his hands . He had come across the lawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks of the clean , unmarked snow when he could much more easily have walked in Belle 's footprints . He opened the storm door without asking leave and he said , " Will you buy this ? " She prided herself on never having been tricked by anyone . She investigated first and bought afterward . She , Rhoda Bellamy , would be the last to be taken in by a child , and she did not , of course , answer his question . Shc pushed the door open a little farther and said , " Who are you ? What is your name ? " His teeth , she saw , were short and crooked and a nasty yellow color . She supposed he came from one of those indigent families who clustered together , squalidly and odoriferously , on the banks of the Cumberland . He was not decently shy and he spoke up immediately : " My name is Ernest Leonard McCammon . Will you buy this wreath ? " The spinster said , " Well , Ernest Leonard , you may wipe your feet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not promising to buy your wreath . We 'll see about that later on . " ( The sycamores before Miss Bellamy 's windows creaked in the cold : Where is my breakfast ? Where is Belle ? Why did I invite Ernest Leonard AlcCammon to cross my threshold in his snowy galoshes , puddling the Tabri , ; - , Father bought half price in Belgrade ? She creaked , too , like a tree , and a feather from the eiderdown walked on her ear like a summer fly . ) The child stood before her , small and ambitious , bundled to his ears in a blue plaid mackintosh which was patched with leather at the elbows . He wore blue jeans and in his mittenless hands , he ' carried now , besides the wreath , the purple stocking cap he had taken off before he came through the door . He bore a faint , un-pleasant smell of mud . I will eat you , little boy , because once upon a time I , too , had pink cheeks and a fair skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . E RNEST LEONARD MCCAMPION looked at the Adam hail chair , looked at the portrait of Mr. Bellamy , looked at the priceless Florentine coffer , looked at the luster pitchers in which stood cattails ten years old ; she had had a man come out from Nashville one year to oil the books and at the same time , had had him shellac the cattails , although he protested a little , declaring that this was not in his line . No workman ever got anywhere protesting with her . She had simply said , " I do n't know what you 're talking about , sir . My father picked these cattails by the Jordan . " This did not happen to be true as her father had been dead for twenty years and she had gathered them herself in her own meadow beside the local river . The rag-tag-and-bobtail boy looked at her father 's treasures as if he had seen such things every day of his life . Do you know who I am , you smelly scrap ? Does the name Bellamy tntan anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bellamy tobacco fortune ? ( How the wind was blowing ! Where was Belle ? Where was her breakfast ? Where was her stick ? Where was her wrapper ? Why did no one come to wish her a merry Christmas ? ) He said , " Miss Bellamy , will you buy my wreath ? " " What do you want for it , McCammon ? " " A quarter . " " A quarter ! Twenty-five cents for a bit of evergreen you more than likely stole off one of my trees ! " His pink cheeks paled under her shrewd gaze and his blue eyes clouded . " I never stole ' um off your tree , Miss Bellamy . I went to the woods , I did , and I got ' urn there off nobody 's tree . " She said , not giving in , " Perhaps so , perhaps not . All the same , a quarter is too much . " " But I painted the pine-cones , Miss Bellamy ! I had to buy the gold and the silver . Daddy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this Daddy ? " " The chimney-cleaner . We are the ones with the mule . Maybe you have seen ourhouse with the mule in the yard ? My daddy 's name is Robert John McCammon . " I will blow your brains out with the bellows Father brought from Dresden . 1 will lay your slender little body on Cousin Anne 's andirons that came from the Trianon , and burn you up like a paper spill . " Come , come , Ernest Leonard , " she said , " I do n't care what your daddy 's middle name is and I have certainly not seen your mule . I will give you fifteen cents for your wreath . " " No , ma'am , " he said . " If you do n't buy it , some other lady will . " " Some other lady ? What do you mean , McCaminon ? " " Well , Mrs. Wagner would buy it or Mrs. Saunders or Mrs. Hugh Morris , I reckon . Anyways , somebody . " " I will give you fifteen cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No ma'am . That would spoil it . " She fixed him with a severe aristocratic eye , determined now to resolve this impasse to her own liking and not to his . Shc said slowly , " If I decided to buy your wreath and paid you the absurd king 's ransom of twenty-five cents , would you do a favor for me ? " " Yes , Miss Bellamy . " ( Belle ! Belle ! Where is my breakfast ? Come before I die of loneliness . Come before the sycamores break at the top and crush the roof over my head ! ) " Do you promise , Ernest Leonard ? " " I promise , Miss Bellamy , " he said and moved a step away from her . She took a twenty-five cent piece out of the purse she carried strapped to her belt and , bending down , took the wreath which she placed on the coffer . Now Ernest Leonard clutched the stocking cap in both hands . His aplomb had left him ; she could tell that he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss , Master McCammon , " she said and , leaning heavily upon her stick , stooped toward that small face with pursed lips , coral-colored . They touched her bone-dry cheek and then the boy was gone , and through the door he had left open in his headlong flight , there came a blast of cold December . But for a moment she did not move and stared at a clot of snow upon the rug . I told you , Ernest Leonard , to wipe your feet carefully on my Welcome mat . Belle 's big country feet were on the stairs . Miss Bellamy trembled for her knock . Wait a minute , Belle , I have not yet thought out what I am going to say to you . Had she left any stray spruce needles on the coffer ? Had any fallen as she climbed the stairs , breathless with recollection ? Belle was at the door . She knocked and entered with the tray . " Explain that monstrosity , " said Miss Bellamy , pointing to the Christmas wreath she had hung last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa dear . Oh , how cunning of you to hang up mistletoe ! What girl in the world would want more than a beau like you ? Can I have my presents now ? It 's one past midnight , Papa ! Oh , Papa , darling , you have given me a brass fender for my fireplace ! Oh , Papa , a medallioned sewing drum ! An emerald ring ! A purple velvet peignoir ! I wish you a very merry Christmas , Papa . " Do n't pretend you know nothing about it , my good woman . Why did you do it , Belle ? Have you no respect for other people 's property ? Do you think I can have my bedroom repapered every week or so merely for the sake of your vulgar whims ? " Kind , stupid Belle shook out the napkin and she said , as she sprinkled a little salt on the lightly boiled egg , " I 'm sorry , Miss Rhoda , that I never seem to do what 's right . I thought you 'd like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " You goose ! You namby-pamby ! I hung it there myself ! " The maid , unruffled , smiled and said , " Merry Christmas , Miss Rhoda . " When she had gone , the spinster closed her eyes against Ernest Leonard 's painted pine-cones , but she nursed her hurt like a baby at a milkless breast , with tearless eyes .
