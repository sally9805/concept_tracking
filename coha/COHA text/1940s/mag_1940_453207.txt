gonoN pictures are the most modern 111 example of American Bigness . Here is a creative business , whose mushroom growth coincides with the era of mergers , trusts , and the worship of all things big . It tells the story of a long line of creative inventors , of search for monopoly powers by entrepreneurs , pursuit of Bigness , deplorable confusion , and stupendous loss by stockholders . From the days of Daguerre ( 1830 ) forward , men had been trying to develop ' motion ' pictures . A famous argument among California turfmen in 1872 helped along that development . Leland Stanford , one-time Governor of California , railroad owner and philanthropist , was also a breeder of blue-ribbon winners . He contended that at certain times a horse in full gallop took all four feet off the ground at once . Other stable owners scoffed at Stanford 's notion , so he wagered $25,000 with James IL Keene and Frederick MacCrellish that he was right . He hired Edward Muybridge , a Britisher who had the carriage trade in photography in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots that a horse really did , at full speed , have all feet off the turf . Muybridge , after trying for many months , failed literally to click . Stanford then turned to John D. Isaacs , graduate of the University of Virginia , class of ' 750able engineer and advanced amateur photographer . Isaacs solved the problem first in the laboratory and then applied his findings by building a chronophotographic apparatus . By means of quickly succeeding exposures of twelve cameras electrically controlled , he recorded a horse in motion , vindicating Stanford 's view . In 1887 , Thomas Alva Edison , who had completed his phonograph , was seized with the desire to complement its capacities by adding recorded sight to recorded sound . He examined the Isaacs method , along with others , and cast them all aside ; then hit upon the idea of feeding picture images into the camera via a belt or tape . His first experimental films were too fragile for use . However , in 1889 George Eastman , seeking a film material that could be employed in the roller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had a flexible nitro-cellulose base . Edison got hold of a sample of this and it solved his problem , since the Eastman film was strong enough to be wound back and forth many times , retaining its surface images . On October 6 , 1889 , the first model of the Edison Kinetoscope , progenitor of today 's elaborate projector machines , was shown to the world at West Orange , New Jersey . It was a small black box into which one spectator at a time could peer at a running film magnified by a lens illumined from behind by an electric bulb . The film itself was about an inch wide , fifty feet long , and was run off at the rate of forty-eight images a second . Edison 's first efforts to project pictures on a screen were not especially sa tisfac- deleted material would enable them to sit tight and let the funds roll in . All they had to do was make the movies , rent them at the largest possible prices , and rake in the profits . From January 1909 forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were replacing nickels , as in the preceding decade nickels had replaced pennies as admission prices , while more and more ticket windows were opening up . The single reel was at this time the standard unit of the silver screen . It was either a complete story , showing a cowboy rescuing a maiden from Indians , or a custard-pie comedy , or it might be in two parts , half scenic , half dramatic . Exhibitors who presented an hour 's show used four or five reels ; those who gave a two-hour performance needed eight or ten reels or more . Since the program was changed daily , the exhibitors required on the average thirty to sixty reels a week . This meant that each member of the Big Ten must produce from three to six reels every seven days . To do so , of course , the manufacturer had to have a competent studio staff and a reliable labor force . Since the ten big companies included in the amalgamation had such requisites , they were not worried by the prospect of competition . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have managed an output of two or three reels a week , but all of them put together could not fill the demands of exhibitors . Meanwhile , as independents kept appearing and as distributors or wholesalers were getting an upper hand in the business by means of their ability to influence , if not to dictate , the price paid to producers and the rental charged exhibitors , the trust determined to banish these middlemen , Om film exchanges . The Motion Picture Patents Company therefore decided to freeze out the independents by creating a distributing agency of its own . The new combine was called the General Film Company . Each of the ten manufacturers was allotted one tenth of the stock and granted equal representation on the board of directors . General Film thereupon purchased sixty of the leading wholesalers , or film exchanges , and proposed to make war on all others . General Film next sought to classify each exhibitor and force him to pay the same price as others in his group . There would be neither haggling nor bargaining . The trust had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would pay $100 to $125 per week on a sliding scale based on size and location , and the little hole-in-the-wall on the side street would pay $15 . The top-class contingent was to have first-release dates ? an important point , because film patrons attended first showings with great fervor . Furthermore , at this stage , the newer the film , the clearer the imago on the screen . No theatre was to use projection apparatus or reels made by any manufacturer outside the confines of General Film 's sacred precincts . Each exhibitor , as manifest of his intention to abide by this ruling , was to be licensed by General Film to the tune of two dollars a week per license . This fee , first of its kind in American business history , was a shakedown of terrific proportions . General Film auditors during the first weeks of this ' come across or no pictures ' edict had to use clothesbaskets in their offices to receive the two-dollar bills and money orders that poured in from all over the United States . By 1911 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; General Film 's take was $1,250,000 per annum ? all this , be it noted , exclusive of film rentals . But this two dollars a week kick-in ' aroused theatre owners , who regarded it as the very symbol of an oppressive monopoly . Capitalizing on this resentment of exhibitors against the General Film Company , independent producers took new courage and began turning out reels as fast as they could . Significantly , the commercial risk at this time was n't very great . For the five years ( 19091914 ) during which General Film was filing hundreds of lawsuits against independents , and sending thugs into their plants to wreck their cameras , and call . big upon federal marshals to confiscate ' illegal ' equipment , the top cost of a big two-reeler was a thousand dollars . Plots were simple to the point of childishness ; actors , directors , and writers still thought that $75 a week was big money ; a few standard props , which , with a little ingenuity , could be used over and over again , provided the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movies had grown to an estimated twenty million per annum . There was no accurate count available until 1918 , when the United States Government began collecting a tax on every ticket sold . The boys at the head of General Film had built their enterprise to conform with the best thinking on mass-production methods . They believed that the public wanted standard merchandise , of dependable quality , and retailed at a dime top . They had , they believed , included all the sane , reliable companies in their trust . Hence quantity , a large volume at set costs , a constant flow of uniform product , were to General Film the criteria of successful operation . Studios thus turned out film of 1000 feet per reel , and all prices were fixed on this footage system , regardless of the subject , the actors , or whatever . General Film steadily charged ten cents per foot for everything produced by its ten affiliates . Since rentals paid by exhibitors were definitely fixed , there was very little leeway or elasticity in studio costs , for producers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between expenditures and earnings . While all the vagaries human , climatic , and chemical  --  entered into the cost of movie making and rendered standardization difficult , General Film 's ten usually averaged out by keeping their costs down to about $750 per reel . They had to do this or endanger their profits . Their rivals , however , the independents , could take chances . They could dicker with exhibitors , and if an independent had a particularly popular picture he could often persuade exhibitors to pay him a price above the normal ; if some of his stuff was n't so good , he could cut his prices , make bargains . Moreover , since the independents had almost all been former exhibitors , they were on their toes to sense changing taste in audience reaction , while the big boys were too far removed , too enthusiastic over their factory-like clockwork methods , to bother with changing tastes . There was the arrogance of distance from the place of operation , too . The heads of General Film , for example , felt too secure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910-1911 , the consumers were tiring of the same product , wanted something more startling , more elaborate , and more dramatic . This was absurd . Motion pictures , the tycoons said , were the poor man 's entertainment , and what poor man was discriminating ? Furthermore , better films would cost more ; tworeelers were very expensive , three-reelers were extravagant . The poor would n't pay more nickels or dimes , so what was the use of seeking to alter cinema fare ? The profits were rolling in , and the independents were being gradually tangled in lawsuits that handicapped them at every turn . But one independent , Carl Laemmle , head of Imp ( forerunner of Universal ) , had noticed that the ' : Little Biograph Girl , ' Mary Pickford , was being talked about by patrons of theatres . Biograph , of course , was one of the strongest of the ten firms in General Film . Laemmle hired Mary away from Biograph by the simple expedient of doubling her salary , and began to advertise her , starting the first big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independents followed his lead with celerity and abandon . At the same time , i he independents first saw and profited from the possibilities of the more-than-one-reeler . The trust , with its whole modus operandi based on inflexible pay envelopes and standard footage prices , was damming back cinema progress , but meanwhile prospering mightily . It chased independents ? constantly under threats of prosecution for patent infringements ? from New York and Chicago to San Francisco and finally to Los Angeles . This last community was chosen by the pioneers among the independents not only because of exceptional photographic climate , but also because it was so close to the Mexican border that they could escape the writ-armed minions of the General Film Company by picking up their cameras , their casts , their props , and their hats , ? if they had the time , ? and diving into a haven where United States process servers could n't reach them . II Despite its lack of ability to adjust to the times , the trust and its ten components continued to thrive for some years . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vitagraph Company , was organized in 1897 with $500 in cash and an office for which it was paying $10 a month rent . Its original assets , acquired by one means and another , could n't have topped $2000 . In 1912 , its gross income was about $0,000,000 , and its net profits available for dividends , after liberal salaries to top executives , were in excess of $1,000,000 . And this was typical of the other nine members of General Film Company . It was argued by General Film 's radical W. W. Hodkinson , who had started as telegraph operator in Utah and had advanced to the management of General Film 's important San Francisco exchange office , that the public of 1911-1912 was ready for better entertainment . He said that ten cents as an admission charge was merely a step in the right direction ; that the day would come when people would pay twenty-five cents through the wickets of the nation 's playhouses . Hewas hooted down at meetings of General Film 's Board . He pleaded , in vain . He faced a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bigness . The daily program change , he contended , impaired a really good picture 's chief asset , the word-of-mouth advertising of satisfied patrons . When friends of the pleased patron arrived at the theatre , anxious to see the praised film , it had moved on to parts unknown . A sale was therefore lost . Hodkinson said that , from his experience on the premises of his own exhibition houses , he was certain that the public would keep a really interesting picture on the screen for two or three days in succession , perhaps a week or more . His logic could be summarized as follows : If the public were given superior pictures , it would pay higher prices ; exhibitors , out of their enlarged profits , could construct better theatres and pay higher rentals to producers ; out of such increased revenues the producers would be able to spend more for pictures , making them better in every respect ; and a policy of this kind would enable the industry to achieve genuine advances . His associates on General Film thought him a lunatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About this same time Adolph Zukor was hanging out in the reception room of General Film , vainly trying to interview the big shots and impress them with the necessity of going into production of feature films with four or five reels each . This was Zukor 's great idea ; he was obsessed with it . He could n't convince General Film , however . The trust had taken a single flyer into a four-reel feature when David W. Griffith had turned out for Biograph Judith of Bethulie . It was really a splendid piece of work ; audiences were enthusiastic . But under General Film 's system of a flat price for everything and everybody , the standardization of bigness built on mass production , Judith , costing four times as much , did n't gross any more than any deleted material Hence , in self-defense , such exhibitors as Thomas L. Tally of Los Angeles organized the First National Exhibitors Circuit with the underlying purpose of banding together the twenty-five or thirty chief theatre owners in the country , who , among them , had about a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distribute , and exhibit their own pictures . First National , set up in April 1917 , quickly became a threat to the very person who had forced it into existence . Zukor realized that he was in danger of being hoist with his own petard ; for , as First National began to lure big-name stars from Paramount and other studios , it seemed that it would n't be long before the First National 's components , owning as they did the country 's key places of exhibition , would be forcing him aside . First National exhibitors , most legally , could quietly supplant Zukor pictures with their own , especially since they were busy getting their hands on such top drawing cards as Charlie Chaplin . Para-mount 's profits would then be very much endangered . Zukor began to view the situation with alarm . ' The evil of producing and exhibiting coalitions , ' he lamented in Variety in 1918 , ' is one of the gravest perils that have ever confronted the motion-picture industry . For some time past this condition has been developing and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It has been permitted to develop this far because no one individual , either producer or exhibitor , has dared face the facts himself and compel other producers and exhibitors to face them with him . . . . We should all realize that the most effective way to develop the industry to its largest capacity is to maintain a broad open field of endeavor in its every branch . ' Behind these crocodile tears Zukor was already scheming to profit from control of retail outlets , and in the spring of 1919 he acquired the Rialto and Rivoli in New York City and the Grauman Million Dollar Theatre and the Rialto in Los Angeles . After three months of experimenting with these theatres , Zukor decided that he could lick First National by building first-run houses in principal cities throughout the United States . His first step in this direction was to hire Walter W. Irwin , a lawyer adept in avoiding possible Sherman Law contingencies . Irwin later testified before a Federal Trade Commission hearing in 1927 that he had ' suggested to Zukor that Paramount could destroy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the First National cities and build , or threaten to build , the finest and largest theatre in the city . . . . In any event , it would not be necessary for Zukor to build more than a few theatres to frighten First National members . ' Meantime Zukor had impressed A. G. Connick , vice president of the American International Corporation , a Kuhn , Loeb and Company affiliate , with the possibilities of building theatre chains and tying the production , distribution , and exhibition branches of the industry into a big profit knot . In a report to Kuhn , Loeb and Company , Connick said : ' From an examination of such theatre records as are available , and assuming that the sum required to amortize the building will not exceed 2 per cent of its cost , and that the amount of the ground rent per annum does not exceed thirty dollars per seat , and with prices of admission ranging ( 1918-1919 ) upward to sixty cents , a preliminary guess has been made that a theatre with 8100 seats will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the usual first-run rental charge in their district for the use of the films . That the 25 per cent is conservative is indicated by the fact that the Grauman Theatre of Los Angeles is now earning profits of 100 per cent a year ; the Stillman in Cleveland at the rate of over 100 per cent . ' The bankers thought the water fine . In the fall of 1919 they and associated bankers sold a $10,000,000 issue of preferred stock of Famous Players-Lasky Corporation , listing both preferred and common on the stock exchange . Investors gobbled the issue ; Zukor had the coin required to expand into the field of exhibition . His swinging of this support was at the time unique . Previously he had himself epitomized the industry 's general practice of growth via the ploughing back of profits into the business . Zukor 's entrance into Wall Street thus began a new era in cinema financing . Within a few years , shares of Loew 's , Inc. , Fox , Path &; and others were also being listed , while Samuel Goldwyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Fox was being supported by John F. Dryden and a group of the Prudential Life Insurance Company . ' On July 22 , 1919 , ' declares the report of the FTC in 1927 , ' respondents Zukor , Lasky and Famous Players-Lasky Corporation had become , long had been , and still were the dominant power in the moving-picture industry .. . ' On July n , 1919 , the Board of Directors of Famous Players-Lasky Corporation . . . to modify its distribution policy and to intimidate and coerce exhibitors into leasing its films adopted a progressive and increasing policy of building , buying , owning or otherwise controlling theatres . . . . ' The Zukor outfit adopted the fixed method of leasing ... its films under a system known in the trade as " block booking . " It still maintains this unfair distribution policy . It offers to lease . . . blocks of films as such , the exhibitor taking all or none offered . If an exhibitor declines to take all , the block is successively offered to competitors until a sale is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , was simply to coerce the exhibitor into ' surrendering his free choice ' and ' thereby denying to him the opportunity or privilege of leasing and exhibiting other films of higher qualities . . . . The purpose and . . . effect of such distribution policy is to lessen competition in the motion-picture industry , and tending to exclude from the market and the industry small independent producers and distributors . ? ? and denying to exhibitors freedom of choice in leasing films . ' Like oil , chain stores , and other businesses , Big Movies strove for reduction of fair and free competition . That Zukor , in seeking to gain a supreme position in moviedom by stressing theatre control , either by ownership or by threats , was on the ' right track ' was accepted by many other operators . Zukor was not alone in this program . He was only the leader . Most of the major producer-distributors emulated his example . III If we accept the statement that 1890 marked the beginning of all things in motion-picture commerce , the cinema 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was worth around $150,000,000 . It entered 1931 with $300,000,000 in assets and a 1930 profit of $18,000,000 . In 1932 , it was bankrupt , with its Publix theatres and its Paramount producing unit alike in a state of complete chaos . Zukor had invested $50,000,000 of his personal fortune in Paramount , but he did n't know where . His company had become too big for him . He could n't tell where his money was , what it was being used for , actually , but he knew that it was there . ' In 1934 , Elihu Root , Jr . ( says Fortune Magazine for March 1937 ) etated as counsel to the trustees of the bankrupt Paramount Publix Corporation : ' A railroad receivership is child 's play compared to this vast multiheaded company which could have lost its business overnight to its competitors if mishandled . ' ' Fifty-three different law firms , ' FOrtune continues , ' banks , protective committees , and experts yammered and bled for two and a half years over the sick giant and its 500 subsidiaries . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rodgers and Hart , Jerome Kern ; and all one hundred and eleven of Harry Lauder 's Scotch burrings . Yet the Warner Putsch for complete dominion of ASCAP had not yet ended . Said the New York Herald Tribune of May 14 , 1938 : ' Warner Brothers . . . has strengthened its commanding position in the music and music-publishing field through the acquisition from North American Company of certain subsidiaries , information filed with the SEC yesterday reveals . ' In time , Warners purchased First National Pictures , and then sallied forth in other directions to acquire Brunswick Radio Corporation and only recently the Muzak Corporation , which operates a wired radio-transmission service . Genius of a sort Jack Warner seems to have , but the history of his empire is not a finished chapter . It is doubtful if he or any other human being can long keep on an even keel as mammoth an enterprise as Warner Brothers Pictures . The mere list of the Warner subsidiaries is staggering . It includes some thirty-seven wholly owned companies , sixteen others that are at least 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warner products abroad . The line covers everything from films and real estate to sheet music and cellulose , television and radio . It has assets of about $180,000,000 . Its working capital in 1937 was over $5,000,000 ; yet it was less than half that amount in 1932 , when oven the Warners must have had temporary qualms and possible secret wishes that they had n't grown so very , very big . Eighteen thousand people are directly employed by this corporation . That 's not many people as industry goes nowadays , but this is a custom-made-toorder business . Warner Brothers are in many ways the wisest of the movie magnates . No outside banker sits on their board of directors . Ironically enough , the directors of Warners are really engaged in the enter- tainment business , and are not primarily interested in stocks , bonds , discounts and refundings . Moreover , the drive of Jack Warner has permitted the elimination of internal company committees . In Warner Brothers , action is direct , without little groups pondering as a committee on the purchase of a story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for speed of decision and absence of red tape , In order to maintain some semblance of action , all vital decisions rest in one man . That may make money for a while . It may make big money . But it is still doubtful if any movie concern of such proportions is a sound , durable economic structure . The Warner Brothers financial jungle is by no means unique . Hollywood is cluttered up today with half a dozen other equally fantastic combinations , and it is a temptation to explore all of them , for , excepting only a few of our fancier utility holding companies , there is probably no industry in the country which affords a richer field for the study of bigness run riot . Most of the companies are overgrown and have interests sprawled over the map from New York to Los Angeles and from Canada to Texas , not to mention their European ramifications ; most of them are involved in enterprises that have little or nothing to do with the production or distribution of film . Good pictures are made in Hollywood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not because of it . If Schenck , Kent , and Jack Warner ? just to mention a few ? could escape from the myriad corporate problems with which they spend nearly all of their time hopelessly struggling , and concentrate on making a dozen pictures each , they would turn out a better and cheaper product . Others could adequately distribute their pictures , others exhibit them . Present concentration from retail box office to cameras has led inevitably to mismanagement and extravagance . Goldwyn , Hanger , and Disney stand as representatives of small , well-coordinated organizations ? the maximum which a single individual can adequately handle . Universal , as an example , shows what happens when creators like Pasternak are in control rather than when groups of exhibitors man the studios . Loew 's , number-two Titan in the industry , has assets of $142,544,024 . Its seventy-odd subsidiaries , foreign and domestic , control , among other things , the M-G-M studios , 157 theatres , a music-publishing house for which it paid $450,000 , radio station WHN in New York , and a vaudeville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes conflicting interests , the lost motion is so enormous it is a miracle that any films are produced at all . M-G-M buys vast quantities of stories that are never produced . On its shelves lie literally millions of dollars ' worth of unused material , some bought ready-made , some written to order by M-G-M 's own staff . All companies the size of M-G-M pay tens of thousands of dollars for a play , only to discover that after it has been filmed the only material used was the title . They buy and leave on their shelves costly properties such as D Ca n't Happen Here , and The Forty Days of Musa Dagh . Such incidents occur daily on all the big lots . M-G-M has no monopoly in this type of wastage . Even movie magnates , running their companies while flitting on airplanes between Hollywood and New York , where the main offices are located , have yet to devise a method of decentralization and delegation which will reduce such errors . No wonder the overhead of the motion-picture industry runs up to such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giant companies is too similar to be worth dwelling on , and their organizations are too complex to be unscrambled here . RKO , a super-holding company and a banker 's dream , is alone worth a book . It started out in 1929 with aconsolidation of theatre chains , branched into production , vaudeville , and news reels , then went through a fabulously complicated bankruptcy and reorganization , and finally wound up in the lap of the Radio Corporation of America . RCA was already so badly tangled up in its own myriad affairs that it had never managed to pay a dividend on its common stock , but this did not deter it from taking over a movie company the size of RKO . It was not until the fall of 1985 that RCA decided it probably had more of RKO than it needed , and proceeded to sell half of its holdings to Lehman Brothers , Atlas , and a few others for $5,000,000 cash , with an option on the balance . Oddly enough , Lehman Brothers are also represented on the board of Paramount , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep in the affairs of two supposedly desperate rivals . And so bankers in New York City continue to produce movies . These bankers seldom get to Hollywood , and I would wager a dinner with any fair screen star that the Wall Street directors of RKO ? men who direct ? do not go to see even 25 per cent of the pictures that RKO turns out each year . But they can tell in a jiffy what is wrong with the output by looking at statistics , dollars and cents of box-office receipts . At times they may see that something is wrong , but I defy even these wizards to correct the errors without seeing the studios , viewing the pictures , in fact spending time in informing themselves about the business itself ? a luxury which Big Men ca n't afford . IV With a weekly attendance of eighty-eight million men , women , and children , this industry is in a sense a bread-and-butter business . The public demand should have made it foolproof . But the banker control has produced waste dramatized in the salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point about these salaries ' being excessive in themselves . There no scientific method of appraising Thal .. berg great contribution to the wealth of M-G-M . But surely compensation in such sums , irrespective of the dividends on these individuals ' stock holdings , must inevitably negate their outbursts against the top star salaries . Moreover , it sets the pace for the companies ' extravagance , waste , and disregard for even a semblance of business thrift . And on the other side of the medallion we find that , out of 15,822 actors , I3,209 earned on an average only $8.48 per week during 1938 . The industry is encumbered with confusion , intrigue , and that form of business madness which always accompanies excessive size . Sensitive not to morals but only to criticism of its morality on the screen , it retains Will Hays as a sort of bishop of Hollywood to give a pretense of toadying to any small group of vocal censors . Integrity of author , director , or actor can seldom survive . The product is built on the dishonest thesis that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no grays . To it , the penalty of sinning is perforce and always suffering . What it lacks in simple honesty it attempts to conceal behind elaborate sets and extravagant productions . The most severe concrete indictment of the affairs of Hollywood is to be found in the pronouncements of the Screen Directors Guild . In July 1938 that body of movie creators lashed out at the ' complicated and expensive system of supervision . ' It charged : ? That studio ' overhead , ' a great part of it wasteful , swallows 40 per cent of the cost of Hollywood picture making ; That duplication , uncertainty , mixed signals , immeasurably increase the remaining 80 per cent actually spent in production ; That ten years ago nearly twice as many pictures were made with one eighth , on the average , the number of producers , supervisors , associates , special assistants , and so forth , currently employed ; That millions of dollars have been invested in screen stories that will never see a lens , and that directors have not been asked to examine this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' situations , stunts , and scenes ' impossible to film , or monstrously costly , whereas directors if consulted could suggest various alternatives ; That executives by the gross are unqu lifted , inexperienced , lacking in creative abili owing their posts to nepotism , and offer ' g ' a virtual proscription against originality and freshness in pictures ' ; That there should be a ' closer unity ' between the ' real producer and the direetot , ' especially men who have been on the lots and locations and know their way around , instead of banker-picked emissaries who clutter up payrolls ; And finally that the entire industry needs ' not just a suggestion but a housecleaning . ' Only the government can save the industry from its consistent circle of ruin . Segregation of production from exhibition may bring these giants down to earthly , human dimensions .

Without the power over theatres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on their toes , eager , competitive , aware of their own affairs . Even stockholders may find corporations in the movie field worthy of investment , not as a wild gamble , but as an essential part of the leisure diet of an eager public . In our lifetime wo can see in this one industry the urges , the greed , the sledgehammer use of power , the substitution of power for ingenuity , that appear in the case history of practically every Big unit in American life .
