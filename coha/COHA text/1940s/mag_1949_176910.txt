In the U.S. , an estimated 1,250,000 people ( about 95% of them men ) suffer from gout . It can be an embarrassing ailment , because most people-including many doctors-have long associated gout with high living and heavy drinking. * Eighteenth Century British Surgeon John Hunter , who had gout himself , said bluntly that " most people who have had the gout severely have deserved it . " Physiologist Erasmus Darwin , who drank little except cowslip wine , announced flatly in 1794 : " I have seen no person afflicted with gout who has not drank freely of fermented liquor . . . " <P> From these , long-accepted opinions many modern physicians dissent . Manhattan Allergist Joseph Harkavy of Mt . Sinai Hospital goes a step farther .

He thinks he has found one of the answers in pollen from grass and trees in the spring , from ragweed in the fall . Pollen , he says , can be the trigger that sets off a series of reactions that wind up as a pain in the big toe ; it may be pollen by itself , or in combination with certain foods , plain or fancy , to which certain people are sensitive . <P> The Harkavy theory has worked out in three cases so far . Two men and a woman who had attacks of gout in the spring or fall were found to be sensitive to pollens , as well as to certain foods . Harkavy brought on attacks by injecting the pollens . When they were immunized against the pollens , and avoided the troubling foods , two of the patients were free of gout . The classical remedy-colchicine-gives relief from pain .
