txt The John Lovejoy Elliott Houses JOSEPHA F. DAVIES . Letters to The Times The John Lovejoy Elliott Houses To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In reading of the housing project achieved by the City Administration and the City Housing Authority , as announced recently , many will be reminded of the man who worked a lifetime to better the living conditions in Chelsea and elsewhere . Dr. John Lovejoy Elliott lived among the people in Chelsea for forty-seven years and gave his untiring wholehearted efforts to help his neighbors in every area of life . That his name is given to this project is fitting , for years ago he planted the idea and ' thereafter consistently promoted many of the steps leading up to the time when the first sixteen tenants could move into the new houses . Hudson Guild Neighborhood House , which Dr. Elliott established in 1895 , is now charged with the community work for the tenants of the John Lovejoy Elliott Houses . Let us hope that this work will be carried on in the spirit of this man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor of the city : " New York 's Good Neighbor Number One . " JOSEPHA F. DAVIES . New York , Jan. 4 , 1947.
