Pious , kindly , baggy Marvel Mills Logan , late Senator from Kentucky , was a man who would n't harm a flea . A peace-loving , Sunday-school-going ex-judge , he had shaggy grey locks and a nose of such W. C. Fieldsian proportions that he was once described as " looking like a rhinoceros crashing through a grass hut . " * <P> In January 1939 , with no apparent hell-raising intent , good Mr. Logan introduced an eighth version of his old bill to set up uniform standards of procedure for quasi-judicial Federal agencies . He had long felt that bureaucracy 's big ears needed pinning back . Franklin Roosevelt , acting on similar motives , set up a committee in February 1939. under Law Expert Dean Acheson , to study the same problem . The Brookings Institution pondered ; bar associations brooded . <P> Guileless Senator Logan died , but his fleabite , the Logan-Walter bill , remained to threaten the New Deal with gangrene . Anti-New Dealers saw in the bill a weapon with which to assassinate such agencies as the Securities Exchange Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division . With them were plenty of other men who were honestly outraged by the New Deal 's bureaucratic stupidities and abuses . <P> The Bar Association of New York City upheld the principle of the bill but condemned its wording as " so rigid , so needlessly interfering , as to bring about a widespread crippling of the administrative process . " Brookings dittoed the opinion . Everyone agreed that the measure opened up visions of an endless field day for lawyers . It passed the House twice : 1 ) 282-to-97 , 2 ) 176-to-51 ; the Senate once : 27-to-25 . <P> Last week Franklin Roosevelt vetoed the Logan-Walter bill in scorching words . Reasons : it would hamper national defense , flood the courts with unnecessary litigation , subject all administrative action to control of the judiciary , produce only delay , chaos , paralysis . He concluded : " Today , in sustaining American ideals of justice , an ounce of action is worth more than a pound of argument . " <P> Mr. Roosevelt 's ounce was followed by a pound from Attorney General Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson argued that the imposing of uniform procedure on all agencies would act " as if we should average the sizes of all men 's feet and then buy shoes of only that one size for the Army . " Under the bill , any citizen substantially affected and displeased by a ruling " has everything to gain and nothing to lose " by suing in the D. C. Court of Appeals . If he loses , he may wait until the rule is again involved and sue in some other court . A series of individuals might sue again &; again over the same rule . An epidemic in Federal territory could not be quarantined , forest fires on the public domain might not be fought , without public hearings and advance notice ; and endless quagmires of litigation could follow .
