When Army 's classy backfield combination of Doc Blanchard and Junior Davis turned up on TIME 'S cover three weeks ago , it was only the second time in four years that TIME had put an athlete on its cover . Except for baseball 's Mel Ott ( July 2 , 1945 ) , no sports figure-for obvious reasons - had made the cover since two months before Pearl Harbor . Some sportsmen , who are among the most superstitious of mortals , considered this a good thing for all concerned . <P> " Red " Blaik , the Army coach , was one of them . Before the Notre Dame game , Blaik told TIME 'S Sport Editor : " Frankly , the thing I 'm really worried about is the TIME cover jinx . " <P> Blaik was referring to the fact that some sports figures have had a disturbing tendency to lose their form promptly after their appearance on TIME 'S cover . They got there because they were champions , or near champions , and because they were just about to compete in some big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was very little hullabaloo about it . But those who lost made big news - and helped nourish the legend of the TIME " jinx . " Some examples : <P> Johnny Goodman ( June 6 , 1938 ) , an 8-to-1 favorite to win the British Amateur Golf Championship in June 1938 , never reached the quarter finals . Fortnight later , in the Walker Cup matches , Goodman lost both his matches and the U.S. lost the Walker Cup for the first time since the trophy was put up in 1922 . <P> Colonel Edward Riley Bradley ( May 7 , 1934 ) , who had won the Kentucky Derby four times up to 1934 . His horse Bazaar was one of the 1934 favorites , finished out of the money . Colonel Bradley did not win another Derby . <P> Cavalcade ( Aug. 20 , 1934 ) , 1934 's Derby winner , who had won al most every important race for three-year-olds up to Aug. 1 ( opening of the Saratoga season ) and was touted as another Man o ' War , tripped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME 'S cameraman . By the time the cover appeared on the newsstands , Cavalcade had been scratched from the Travers . He never won another race . <P> Primo Camera ( Oct. 5 , 1931 ) , lost his heavyweight fight with Jack Sharkey at Ebbets Field OH Oct. 12 and his chance at the world 's championship . <P> Tom Harmon ( Nov. 6 , 1939 ) , Michigan 's All-America back , whose team was overwhelmingly favored to beat mediocre Illinois the following week , made only one touchdown in one of the season 's biggest upsets . Score : Illinois 16 ; Michigan 7 . <P> Joe Di Magglo ( July 13 , 1936 ) , then a spectacular rookie , played with the American League All-Stars the week his cover appeared , made no hits in five times up , fumbled two ground balls . Score : National League 4 ; American League 3 . <P> These unfortunate , though timely , lapses from form may , or may not , constitute a " jinx . " They are exceptions to the scores of sports figures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Joe Louis , Jack Dempsey , Helen Wills , " Red " Grange , " Bobby " Jones , Mickey Cochrane , Yachtsman Harold Stirling ( " Mike " ) Vanderbilt , Bullfighter Juan Belmonte ) . It is worth noting , however , that TIME took no chances with its first sports cover : Horseman Stephan ( " Laddie " ) Sanford ( March 31 , 1923 ) . His horse ( Sergeant Murphy ) had already won the Grand National before the cover appeared .
