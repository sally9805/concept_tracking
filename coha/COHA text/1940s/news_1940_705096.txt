txt When President Roosevelt on July 1 last sent a message to Congress demanding a - steeply graduated " excess profits tax . applying to both individuals and corporations , he did not , as is generally believed , set a precedent . The principal of excess profits taxation for national defense , or for " preparedness " as it was then popularly called , was eatabfished in March , 1917 , the month before the United States entered the World War . At that time Congress enacted a measure taxing , mildly according to later standards , increased profits of corporations . However , this measure was never effective as after our entrance into the war it was replaced by another and more drastic measure . For years our statute books have contained a so-called excess profits tax provision . This , however , was merely a penalty tax designed to prevent avoidance of the declared capital levy . This tax is continued , under a changed name , in the present bill just signed by the President .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
