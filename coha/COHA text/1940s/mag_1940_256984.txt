City of unorthodox booms is Shanghai , a paradise of moneychangers and middlemen . Throughout Depression I Shanghai built itself the tallest buildings outside the Americas , tripled land values on its river-washed Bund ( the International Settlement 's downtown ) in seven years . Last year , its suburbs full of Japanese soldiers , Shanghai started another and less healthy boom , still booming . Factories , upcountry traders , panicky Chinese moved into the International Settlement for safety . Since no passport control blocks entry to the Settlement , refugees from all the world 's political hotspots fled there-Czechs , Poles , German and Austrian Jews . Country View Apartments , aptly named when built before the Japanese invasion , now look on rows of smoking chimneys . The Chinese dollar , worth 30 American cents in 1937 , has declined to 7 ; rents and prices have correspondingly soared . <P> Beneficiaries of the boom are 1 ) the foreign sections ' 62,000 foreigners in general , whose pounds , francs and dollars have gained purchasing power ; 2 ) 4,000 Americans in particular , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When War began the big Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corp. , British-controlled , stopped work on a new branch office building . But last week the National City Bank of New York , its one Shanghai branch overflowing with customers , was preparing to open another in the 14-story Cathay Mansions Building . At the Shanghai Club 's enormous bar ( Noel Coward , squinting down it , once said it showed the curvature of the earth ) hard-drinking Shanghailanders tell each other that " This is an American year . " <P> Their chief fear is that it may become a Japanese year . Leaving their rifles outside the International Settlement , the Japanese have long been seeking to control Shanghai 's trade by votes . The Shanghai Municipal Council , a true plutocracy , is elected by qualified ratepayers to represent business interests ; Japanese businessmen have therefore been moving in , already control more than a third of the ratepayers ' votes , may control more by election time in April . Should they unseat the British-American bloc now in command , the wobbly Chinese dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( $25,000,000 ) loans , might lose exchange value faster still .
