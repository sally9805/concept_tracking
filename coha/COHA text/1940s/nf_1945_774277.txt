txt  | of the bridge to the other . Such conditions afforded a real test of the designer 's foresight in providing the various features that assured enduring stability . The bridge continued in service for thirty-five years , carrying the heaviest kind of street traffic , tram cars , steam rollers , and eight-horse teams pulling heavy trucks loaded with iron and machinery . The multiple-span arrangement , although quite satisfactory for an aqueduct with its loading constant or uniform in all spans , is under a disadvantage in a suspension bridge carrying variable loading . Despite the system of inclined stays which Roebling had installed , a loaded span sometimes deflected as much as two feet , with a corresponding smaller rise of the adjoining spans . Not only the designer but the profession generally profited by this experience . Notwithstanding its one technical defect , necessitated by the financial limitations and excusable in the state of the art at that time , the bridge was an object of admiration for its graceful lines and pleasing proportions and for its strength under progressively increasing loads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to meet new traffic requirements , the historic structure was taken down and replaced by a new bridge . 11 While he was building the Monongahela bridge , Roebling received a letter from his old friend Edward H. Gill , who had been his superior on his first engineering job in America and who was now located in the young and growing city of Louisville in Kentucky . " I have just time to inform you , " he wrote , " that the city authorities are about commencing waterworks for the purpose of supplying this place with water , and will be in want of a competent engineer to take charge of the work . . . There are no engineers about here that know anything about it . You might come down and we could make plans , estimates &; c. for the work , and if you wished you could get charge of it . Please write me by return mail . . . . This is a fine city . . . . " Although Roebling was glad to know that his former chief thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was strenuously occupied with plans and activities in his own  | chosen field and would not allow himself to be diverted by a glimpse of different pastures . His life plan afforded no time for waterworks ; all of his strength and energy must go to his ruling passion , suspension bridges . Following his successful completion of the first suspension aqueduct , the fame of this new type of construction spread , and soon the designer 's services were in demand for other canal crossings where similar problems were involved . A transportation project with a fascinating history embracing a century of epochal commercial development of the state of New York was the Delaware and Hudson Canal . The initiative for this enterprise was largely supplied by the powers of observation , the foresight , energy , and persistence of William Wurts , a businessman of Philadelphia . Without being a professional geologist , or even a hunter or trapper , he was fond of taking long tramps and excursions through the valleys and along the streams of northeastern Pennsylvania , sleeping in the forest wherever night overtook him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunter or on the trout which he lured from the cool streams of the Lackawaxen and the Lackawanna . As early as 1812 , while on one of these excursions , he was attracted by the shining black stones which he noticed cropping out of the ground here and there . His interest aroused , and believing they had value , week by week and month after month he followed and examined the outcroppings , noting and mapping their location , until he had traced the outlines of the great northern and eastern anthracite coal fields of Pennsylvania . On his return he carried specimens to Philadelphia ; submitting them to his brothers , Charles and Maurice , he finally induced them to go back with him and look over the ground . By repeated trials they became convinced of the value of the strange new rock as fuel . Then began the heartbreaking struggle to convince others and to establish the black mineral as a marketable commodity . The three brothers labored under desperate obstacles ? often defeated , but never giving up . The frail rafts on which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the rapids against projecting rocks and were sunk ; and when they finally succeeded in bringing a ton or two to Philadelphia , their hard-won cargo was spurned as being of little or no value . But  | land was then also of little value in the almost inaccessible wilderness where the deposits of coal were found . With faith and courage , the brothers made extensive purchases of tracts at prices ranging from fifty cents to three dollars per acre ? coal lands whose value later rose a thousandfold . The incalculable value of this discovery is indicated by the fact that the entire anthracite area of Pennsylvania is limited to about five hundred square miles ; and from this area , commencing with the first shipment of 365 tons of Lehigh coal in 182o , more than as many million tons have since been mined and shipped . After more than ten years of adverse fortune and staggering difficulties the day of success began to dawn upon the efforts of the Wurts brothers . In 1822 the General Assembly of Pennsylvania passed an act " to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clear and improve the channel , to establish dams , locks , or canals , or to complete a system of slack-water navigation , and to establish tolls ; and the Legislature of New York State then passed an act incorporating the projectors as the " Delaware and Hudson Canal Company . " The preamble of this charter recited the desirability of introducing " stone " coal to New York State , the existence of extensive beds of this coal owned by Maurice Wurts , and the petition of certain citizens of New York for water communication between the Hudson and Delaware rivers . In the spring of 1823 Maurice and William Wurts secured the services of Judge Benjamin Wright , chief engineer of the Erie Canal , and instructed him " to have a proper survey or running level carried over the country from tidewater of the Hudson River , at the mouth of the Walkill , up the valley of the Rondout , and thence over the Delaware River , and thence up the same to the confluence of the Lackawaxen , and thence up the Lackawaxen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " On the basis of the ensuing surveys and estimates , a total of $1,5oo,000 had to be raised by the investors , to cover the construction of the canals with their locks , inclined planes , and aqueducts . Thus the project of " Wurts ' crazy ditch " was initiated . In 1825 construction was commenced , and four years later the Lackawaxen section was opened for navigation , with 7,000 tons of coal passing through it the first year . Despite financial difficulties , successive extensions and improvements were made during the years that fol-  | lowed , increasing the volume of commerce until the project became a most successful venture , yielding , after 1850 , profits that were described as " enormous , " ranging from 10 to 24 per cent of the capital that had been courageously invested . It is interesting to note that for many years , from 1833 on , all locks on the canal were closed on the Sabbath . In the period around 1846 the Delaware and Hudson Canal was transporting hundreds of thousands of tons of anthracite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company authorized the enlargement of their canals and locks for boats of 12o tons , those previously in use measuring only 30 or 50 tons . With these improvements , the canal ? which was the only line of transportation between the Lackawanna coal fields and the Hudson River ? was increased to a capacity adequate to handle the future business of two millions of tons a year . There was a bottleneck , however , at points where canal and river crossed and their traffic mixed . At the mouth of the Lackawaxen , the Delaware River was crowded with floating craft . At the same time that the anthracite-laden canalboats were attempting to move across the river , the lumbermen of the upper Delaware were running hundreds of pine and hemlock rafts down the stream past Lackawaxen . The canal people had a dam at the spot to form a pool , so that their boats could be floated from the Pennsylvania to the New York side in still water . But , with the rafts running , there was turmoil , damage , loss , and litigation on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the river and on the canal , and he was acquainted with the baffling problem at Lackawaxen . " Build the canal above the water , " he said . The Delaware and Hudson engineers looked over his drawings for a four-span bridge , with three river piers . Mr. Lord , the company 's engineer , went to Pittsburgh to examine Roebling 's suspension aqueduct over the Allegheny , and he then advised his company to adopt the same plan . The location of the canal was modified to suit the proposed new method of crossing the rivers , and the span-builder was told to go ahead . Two aqueducts were authorized , one over the Delaware River at Lackawaxen , the other over the Lackawaxen River , two miles above its mouth . Roebling went ahead and completed his plans . In the fall and winter of 1848 he was building the Delaware aqueduct , stringing  | two 812-inch cables over the saddles on top of the masonry piers . From these cables ? using wire rope hangers for the first time ? the canal " trunk " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Near the end of the year the suspended aqueduct was finished and was ready for the opening of navigation in the spring . Distinguished engineers from many parts of the country were on hand the day the water was let in and the first boat sent through . Crowds lined the banks below and cheered at the unusual sight ? a canalboat moving smoothly across from bank to bank , high above the river , high above their heads ! The cables and the piers sustained their heavy burden safely , and the Delaware and Hudson officials were happy with the solution of their problem . There was one complaint at first . Although the aqueduct piers were about 134 feet apart , they made the rafting channel in the river a hazard . The steersmen were " put to it " to get their unwieldy " doubles " between the piers without damaging the sides of the rafts . But soon the rivermen began to take pride in their newly acquired skill ? when they got through without " scratching , " they bragged of their accomplishment. 12 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lackawaxen River , a similar but shorter structure , with only two spans . In each of these new works he followed the same general design and methods of erection he had already developed , except for such progressive improvements as experience taught him . Pleased with the progress on their first two aqueducts , and even before these structures were completed , the canal officials commissioned Roebling to design and build two more suspension crossings ? this time in New York State . The bridgebuilder wrote home : " I have contracted with the Company for two more aqueducts , one over the Rondout River ; the other over the Neversink River , of 17o-foot span , requiring cables of 912-inch diameter , large enough for the support of a suspension bridge over the Niagara River , at the site in contemplation below the Falls , of 750 feet span . "  | In April , 1849 , Roebling commence the construction of the High Falls aqueduct over the Rondo , near its junction with the Hudson . And a few months later , he started work concurrently on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a single span suspended from two 912-inch cables , of 3,024 wires each ? the largest cables that anyone had thus far constructed . These two aqueducts were completed in the fall and winter of 1850 . The canal aqueducts built by Roebling were essentially permanent works , as only the woodwork of the flume would require occasional renewal . For seventy years the Delaware and Hudson Canal served its farsighted purpose . But , like all other intermediate steps of human advance , the canal and its works finally yielded to the inevitable march of progress . On November 5 , 1898 , canalboat " Number 1107 " was loaded and cleared , and this was the last boat carrying the company 's anthracite to pass over the canal . Soon thereafter the entire bed of the canal , the locks , and other works were sold for a nominal sum to private parties , to be occupied by railway lines and for other uses . Following the discontinuance of the canal , the suspension aqueduct over the Delaware River at Lackawaxen , although fifty years old at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a highway toll bridge , the bed of the aqueduct serving as the roadway for the viaduct . The ancient structure , built a century ago for other duty , is still in use , carrying modern automobile and motor-truck traffic . The other structures of the old Delaware and Hudson Canal were taken down for salvage . Here and there an undemolished lock wall , aqueduct abutment , old anchorage and cable , or a section of the abandoned canal prism are the only physical vestiges of that famous waterway of a bygone age . In 1921 some samples of the wire were taken out of the old cables left in the abandoned ruins of the High Falls aqueduct . Laboratory tests showed a tensile strength even higher than the original strength reported by Roebling . The wires were of wrought iron , and although they were ungalvanized , they showed no material corrosion after their seventy-two years of service and exposure .  | In the years following 185o , when canal transportation occupied a prominent and important place in the nation 's life , these suspension aqueducts attracted universal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the engineers of his day . And thus Roebling realized his ambition ? he had become a builder of suspension bridges . Six of them he had built in six years , five carrying canal aqueducts and one carrying highway traffic . In these projects he had found the opportunity for which he had been hungering , a chance to try out the new ideas that had been crowding in his mind during the preceding impatient years . And all of those ideas had proved successful ? as had also the structures to which they were applied . Six suspension structures successfully completed ! No other bridgebuilder of the time could point to such a record . The erstwhile immigrant and farmer had become the world 's foremost exponent of a new art of bridge construction . But the pioneer was still impatiently seeking new worlds to conquer . The thought that the cable-suspension system might appropriately be used for railroad bridges had become a fixed idea in his mind . It was obvious that a suspension aqueduct was nothing but a suspension bridge carrying an enormous load . If his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a canal flume , they could equally well carry the weight of trains and locomotives . This conception was the seed of John Roebling 's next great achievement .  | A LONELY BOYHOOD WHILE the father was strenuously and ambitiously engaged WHILE in launching his professional career ? working on canal construction and railroad surveys , inventing and manufacturing wire rope and securing its adoption , and building his first suspension spans for aqueducts and highway traffic ? the son was quietly growing from infancy to boyhood in the secluded and primitive environment of the pioneer village of Saxonburg . And during these formative and impressionable years the boy saw little of his father , for the latter 's engineering engagements and undertakings necessitated extended absences from home . In this simple community Washington Roebling spent the first twelve years of his life . Through these early years the youngster , with the seriousness of an oldest child , was keenly registering the scene about him , with its dominant theme of struggle and toil , of poverty and deprivation . Conveniences were few , and comforts unknown . Lonely years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a sensitive childhood . For the boy it was Spartan training that left its lasting influence on his personality and his character . In the air of Saxonburg there seemed to be some magic potency , conducing to longevity . The two infant children left by Carl Roebling when he died in the summer of 1837 lived to be nonagenarians ; and the first-born son of John Roebling , despite years of suffering in middle life from the crippling affliction of caisson disease , survived to attain the ripe old age of eighty-nine . What an autobiography he could have written ! For he had the material , vividly stored in his memory , covering nine decades of dramatic history and personal heroism ; and he had a gift for honest , colorful narrative , for suggesting a picture of life in a few words , while revealing the stamp of his own strongly marked personality in his telling of the story . Despite his 107  | advancing years , his memory of persons and events was of unusual clarity . His style was pointed and pithy . Through his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his speech , and he wrote as he talked . To the same heroic endurance of bodily suffering may be attributed some of the personal characteristics reflected in his writings : a certain caustic humor , a philosophical acceptance of life , an intolerance of sham and pretense , an unrestrained candor of statement , a shrewdness of judgment and insight , and an appreciation of true human values . Unfortunately , however , Colonel Roebling never wrote an autobiography , but the few writings he left are illuminating . One of these is his paper on the Early History of Saxonburg , written in 1924 , when he had reached the age of eighty-seven . This narrative of his boyhood reminiscences was prepared at the request of the Butler County Historical Society , and was read at a public meeting held in the Memorial Church at Saxonburg . As the Colonel , because of his physical disability , could not come to Saxonburg , his monograph was read by proxy . The audience , which filled the church auditorium , included many of the descendants of the original settlers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the selection of Butler County as the site for the colony , the Colonel described the layout of the pioneer settlement : " Next in order came the laying out of a village . . . so that each man had a little farm to himself as is the custom in Germany . . . . As late as 1845 a black bear walked down Main Street ? he got away . . . . The two Roebling brothers kept the two largest reservations for themselves . The first house was built at the highest point and was occupied by the two brothers until they married . The house still stands . . . . For the time being my father had given up engineering and passed as a farmer ? that did not last long . " The Colonel then described his father 's campaign to build up the infant settlement for which he had secured an option on seven thousand acres of land : " The main object of the Roebling immigration had to be tackled now ? namely the sale of lots to future settlers , who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too small for an American farmer . At any rate this location was not : fiery desirable ? the winters were very cold . . . . The direct rod to Pittsburgh was atrocious , especially in winter time . Many a time have I made that trip ? one winter my toes were frozen . . . . My father would have made a good advertising agent . He wrote at least a hundred letters to friends in and about Muhlhausen , extolling the virtues of the place ? its fine climate ? the freedom from restraint ? the certainty of employment , etc . Many accepted and came . " Referring to the death of his uncle Carl , the Colonel wrote : " This somewhat upset my father 's arrangements , but he had already abandoned farming , finding that his temper was too impatient for the slow plodding work of a farm . My mother was much better at it . Many side issues were tried to help along , A dye house was built but given up . Some from the Hartz in Germany raised canaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work in Pittsburgh and come home to Saxonburg . " When John Roebling 's venture in the breeding of canaries had proved musically unproductive and financially unprofitable , he wisely , though regretfully , transferred the canaries to his father-in-law , Herting , a delightful old German whose little farm at Saxonburg was a colorful wilderness of flowers and fruits and vegetables , and whose dogs and cats and birds were the most licensed members of his household . Herting made canary breeding pay , though , truth to tell , he cared little whether it paid or not so long as the birds sang to him and filled his home with their music . And for him they warbled and trilled from morning till night . In the atmosphere of quaint charm and warm affection of his grandparents ' home Washington Roebling spent much of his early life . That it was just a crude blockhouse and a tiny farm too small to yield a subsistence made little difference in its homelike cheer ; the fragrant garden , the singing birds , the fascinating keepsakes that filled the house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and heart-warming love left an impression on the growing boy and supplied his childhood years with the warmth and sunshine they needed . In this household two proud grandparents and two doting aunts welcomed the wistful child with tender smiles and loving  | embraces , and his lonesome mother rejoined the happy family circle during her husband 's long absences on engineering work . Not driving ambition for great achievement but peaceful gladness and kindly affection filled this simple home . In his reminiscences , written some eighty years later , Washington Roebling referred to his father at times as " Mr. Roebling , " but to the poor , struggling erstwhile tailor , Herting , he always applied the more intimately reverent name of " Grandfather . " Another home in which the boy found eager welcome and affection was that of their friend and neighbor , Ferdinand Baehr . These good people , heartbroken and heart-hungry after the loss of their boy , sought to fill the void by opening their arms to the son of their closest friend . All of this left its impression on the youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " was Ferdinand Baehr , from Muhlhausen , expert mechanic and wool carder , and wellto-do , who had sacrificed his home to strive for unknown benefits abroad . He built a larger house than ours and painted it pink . On the way over to this country his only son died of seasickness . The mother never got over the shock . As a makeshift , to hide his grief , Baehr took great interest in me as a boy . I was his daily visitor . He had brought over fine books , beautifully illustrated , and many knickknacks interesting to a child . He established some carding machines adjoining the house , driven by a white horse ; bought wool in quantities and was well-to-do . ( In those days there were no stocks or bonds to invest in . ) His wife 's brother Eisenhardt was his manager . Eisenhardt had been in the battle of Waterloo , member of a Nassau regiment which held Hugomont against the attacks of the French . The French bullets rattled like hail against the big oaken doors which were never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me while sitting on the wool sacks . When I called for the twentieth rehearsal , he lay dead on a sack . " Baehr died about 1844 , leaving the house to a friend on condition that he would take care of the wife after his death . She lived for twenty-five years after that . His greatest lament was that he should die without having seen a steam engine . "  | Washington Roebling did not know his father as a farmer , for the unhappy agricultural venture was given up for engineering when the boy was born . This early work in the state service , taking John Roebling away from his home , is summarized in a few lines in his son 's monograph , concluding with its memorable climax : " While making these surveys he became acquainted with the workings of the Portage Railroad with its many inclined planes , transporting section boats over the mountain . In this connection it occurred to him that he could replace the heavy hempen haulage cables by a much lighter and stronger wire rope . This marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only place in his entire narrative where the Colonel used an exclamation point . The making of the first wire ropes was the most exciting and dramatic experience of his boyhood memories . It not only brought his father home , sometimes for weeks at a stretch , but it also enabled the child to see his father in action ; and the boy , as his years permitted , was given a chance to feel that he was participating in an achievement . At eighty-seven he still recalled the thrill of the fouryear-old lad when his father was authorized to make the first wire rope for the portage railway . John Roebling recognized that the financial returns from engineering work proper were precarious and limited ; he therefore recommended , as an ideal combination for the technically trained man , an active interest in some other enterprise for profit , permitting pursuit of his chosen profession for inner satisfaction and a sense of fulfillment . This practical philosophy ? its truth and its wisdom ? was remembered through life by the son : " My father always held it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poorest professions in regard to pay ) should always , when possible , interest himself in a manufacturing proposition . The rope business being established , his ambition prompted him to greater efforts . " Except for the few succinct and impersonal summaries of his father 's engineering accomplishments during the Saxonburg years , the Colonel 's memoir was devoted to delightful intimate glimpses of the life and the personalities of the little community  | as seen through the eyes of the boy and as vividly recalled by the unfaded memory of a remarkable old age . " Being the Roebling boy ' he wrote , I had the entree to all houses , to wonder over the many heirlooms the people had brought over ? curious old clocks , old Bibles and books , quaint pictures , novel utensils of copper , brass or china , long German pipes . My grandfather Herting had a wooden traveling box with covered top , inside of which a picture of the battle of Navarino was glued , showing the burning of the Turkish fleet ? that was a treat . A similar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Another home that fascinated the child was that of Bernigau , the cabinetmaker : " Bernigau made all the coffins ? also wonderful furniture and fancy articles for which the Pittsburgh demand was great . He had no small children . His very particular wife always made me take off my shoes before I could enter her house . " 4 When Washington Roebling was six years old , there walked into his life ? and into the life of Saxonburg ? the most fascinating personality of his boyhood memories , a stranger named Julius Riedel . " One day in 1843 , a new character appeared on our front steps ? a short stout man , with a rifle and shotgun slung over his back ? a carpet bag in one hand and leading a hunting dog ? Rolla by name ? by the other . A huge pair of spectacles adorned his face . He had walked up from Freeport , was exhausted and done up . My father took him in and practically took care of him for the rest of his long life . Julius @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was hard to place him , so he was made a sort of tutor for me , teaching the three R 's in German . Later on he established a small German school and married my mother 's sister , raising ultimately a family of six who all drifted to Trenton in course of time . Riedel was the son of a Lithuanian Baron with a large family . This Baron was a cousin of Field Marshal Blucher . At the time when Napoleon escaped from Elba and entered on his fatal Waterloo campaign , Julius was sixteen . The father asked the Marshal to let Julius ride along with him , to which assent was given ? so Julius came  | to be near Waterloo , within sound of guns if not in the thick of the fight , and also entered Paris with the Allies , where he remained a wh , ' e before returning home and commencing life over again , which was hard , as he had a splendid German education but no profession to make a living . Riedel 's early experiences made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1844 there was a vacancy in the church ? no preacher . It occurred to my father that Riedel could fill it , so he was installed at once . He was gifted with a good delivery , a wonderful sympathetic voice that moved the hearers to tears . The church was crowded to capacity ? young couples yearned for his services ? even the deathbed anticipated his consoling funeral orations . His sermons were taken from Heinrich Zschokkes ' Hours of Devotion ' in seven volumes , which were better than he could write . No one , however , knew the catastrophe that was impending . One day a delegation arrived from the Lutheran Synod in Pittsburgh , and demanded his removal on the ground that he was no preacher , not the graduate of a Theological Seminary ? had no license to preach ; that the marriages that he had performed were illegal , and must be performed over again ; likewise the baptisms ; but the dead could remain in their graves . The congregation was in dismay ? finally gave in and bade a silent farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . After some time a place was found for him as teacher in Columbus , Ohio . When he departed with his family , I was dumped into the same wagon and dropped at Pittsburgh to live with a German teacher named Henne . " Humor and pathos are blended in this account of Riedel 's election to fill the village pulpit and his subsequent disqualification by the preachers ' union . Affectionate admiration for the itinerant teacher and incredulous indignation at his dismissal retained their vividness after a lapse of eight decades . The story of Uncle Riedel was briefly concluded : " The stay in Columbus did not last long . After some small terms of employment with my father , Riedel moved his family into our old house when we all departed for Trenton . He died in Saxonburg in 1891 at the advanced age of 91 . He had filled a large horizon in my early youth . At all times he was a strict adherent  | to German etiquette . No one could enter his room without taking off his hat and making a profound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told the story and paid his tribute : " He had filled a large horizon in my early youth . " Thus Washington Roebling 's education began at the age of six , when he was put under the tutelage of Julius Riedel , the newly arrived immigrant who so strangely walked into their lives . Successively tutor , schoolteacher , and preacher in the small community that was spellbound by his charm and his talents , this impoverished son of a Lithuanian baron and cousin of Field Marshal Blucher married Leonora , a younger daughter of " tailor " Herting , and thus became brother-in-law to John Roebling . Thereafter their families and their interests were strongly linked . The Riedels had a son , Edmund , who later became superintendent of the main rope shop in the Roebling works at Trenton , where he lived to the age of eighty . The two cousins , Edmund Riedel and Washington Roebling , looked a good deal alike , showing that the Colonel favored the maternal rather than the paternal side of the house . When his beloved tutor lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ livelihood , the seven-year-old boy started his schooling at Pittsburgh , the nearest large town . This was a tender age to start boarding-school life away from home ; and the difficulties and hardships of the occasional all-day wagon journey between Saxonburg and Pittsburgh ? twentysix long miles , rough hilly roads , rain and mud and snow and ice , hunger and cold , frostbitten face and frozen toes ? were remembered throughout his life . In pleasant weather it was an adventure ; but in the raw winds of winter it was an ordeal , mitigated only by the anticipation of the home fireside and Christmas tree awaiting the midnight arrival : " My trips from Saxonburg to Pittsburgh , where I had been sent to school at too early an age , by way of Freeport and the Canal , or in a wagon belonging to the cabinet maker Bernigau ? who always kept a store and drove to town at intervals , exchanging country products for city wares ? were a great pleasure in summer time . Starting before sunrise , the first stop was at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the cups one could drink . When half-way out , near Deer Creek , we took dinner at Mrs. Staly 's ? arriving late in the afternoon . The  | time was passed in making German verses and poetry . The Pittsburgh rendezvous for Saxonburg teamsters was always at Madam Dubail 's on 8th Street , an Alsatian who kept an excellent Inn with ample yard room for teams and horses . This good woman ofter reinforced my starving pouch with delicious tidbits . " The return trip , especially in the winter time , was something dreadful ? uphill all the way , snow or mud axle deep . A short cut by way of Lawrenceville was often frustrated because the ferryman refused to come over for us . Then we had to turn back , adding six miles to the length of the trip . The road through Sharpsburg was a bed of mud , churned up by the many iron wagons . The hill at Deer Creek was so steep that the load had to be transferred . Finally Saxonburg was reached late at night ? all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the recompense for all this distress . " 5 The Colonel 's memoir gives a cross section of the population of Saxonburg and an impressionistic picture of the life of the community . All of the settlers were Lutherans , except " one poor Irishman ? Mularky . " How this solitary son of Erin came to be in the settlement , or what he was doing there , remains a mystery . Other glimpses of the Saxonburg scene are given : " The people who arrived in style were the Helmbolds ? had driven in a coach and four all the way from the East . Their farm , just east of ours , was the largest and best . The coach was not used very long . . . . " As a rule the Saxonburgers had large families ? a great help to our early settlers . It was an orderly town ? no murders or arrests . . . . " The people were strict Lutherans , but not strict Sabbatarians , so that Sunday afternoons were devoted to reasonable enjoyment . . . . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belles lettres , history , and smatterings of law ; and their wives knew how to cook and practice economy . " The primitive community had its social life . The Colonel , from his lingering recollections , sketched the collective recrea-  | tions and the limited pleasures of those early days . Social gatherings in the homes , picnics , and dances were the principal forms of entertainment . " Lager beer had not yet arrived ; ale was not to the German taste ; wine was too dear ; hence Monongahela rye whiskey became the staff of life . " No party was complete without music . " Bernigau played the violin ; Wickenhagen the violoncello ; Neher the cornet ; Roebling the flute and clavier . " Amateur theatricals were staged in Aderhold 's tavern . And the most memorable outdoor festival of the year was the three-day rifle-shooting contest . " At an early day , Aderhold , who kept the hotel and baked bread , instituted an annual festival for sharp-shooters , lasting three days , attended by great crowds . I believe they are still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He died while pushing some dough into his oven . My uncle Riedel made a poem on the sad event , which is preserved . " Guided by the Colonel 's jotted reminiscences , we can follow the lonely youngster in some of his ramblings to the places that fascinated him in the pioneer village . Up on Thorn Creek was the old swimming hole , where Saxonburg 's miller ? Bauer , from Bielefeld in Westphalia ? had built a gristmill with a huge wheel driven by water from a dam in the creek . Everyone carried his grain there to be ground . The dam was washed away several times , and patiently rebuilt . The cool millpond , shaded by maples and willows , was a delightful spot , especially alluring on hot summer days . The youngsters of the village gathered here to fish and swim . Right on Main Street was the smithy ? always fascinating to a small boy . It occupied the larger part of Stuebgen 's house . Through the open doorway one could see the flames leaping in the forge as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying from the glowing metal under the ringing blows of the hammer . On the lower end of Main Street was Aderhold 's establishment ? the town 's hotel , bakery , ballroom and theater . The place was a Mecca for Pittsburghers seeking rustic amusement . From the house there was a fine view of Thorn Creek Valley . Aderhold , who came from Bleicherode in the Harz , was a leader in the social life of the community . Washington Roebling re-p  | called him sympathetically . " A beloved man . . . . He lost a child on an Ohio steamboat . . . . He died baking bread . " A mile out on the Pittsburgh road was the farm belonging to Horn , one of the most prominent men in the settlement . The ground vs high and was known as " Horn 's Heights . " Here young Rbling would come to enjoy the panoramic view of the village and to watch the man and his sons at their work , fot Horn was kept busy with orders for the products of his skill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the kitchen utensils for the settlement . Tinware was but little used in those days . He was also a sheet-iron worker and could not begin to fill his orders . " It was a pleasure to see him work . His sons helped . Such men were the backbone of the community . " Across the road from Horn 's was Knoch 's blacksmith shop , where the father and son could be seen in their leather aprons , working at anvil and forge on odd jobs of horseshoeing and other ironwork for the community . This was also one of the homes with an enchanting list of old things to please a boy . Young Knoch subsequently married Washington 's cousin , Amelia , daughter of Carl Roebling ; at a very ripe old age they were still living " across the road from Horn 's . " Down on Water Street was the cabin of Mayerstedt , a weaver , who was in poor health . This friendly weaver had " two remarkable pictures : of Ithuriel and his spear , and another Archangel , which were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as their homes and their lives , fascinated the observant youngster and were sympathetically recalled by him after the passing of fourscore years . In his paper on the early years of Saxonburg , the Colonel included a list of over sixty families making up the settlement in his boyhood , with thumbnail sketches of their lives and personalities . There was Lamb , the butcher . " A jovial , genial citizen ? our best butcher , who came to the homes Christmas time to butcher the pigs , stuff the sausages and have a little party afterwards . He was also a First Aid man and vaccinated me . A staff to lean on in misfortune . " And there was Neher , the carpenter , who had been Bernigau 's  | assistant in coffin building and cabinetmaking , and who then married the widow and succeeded to the business . " Expert on the cornet , especially on moonlight nights . " Then there was Gosewisch , who was an artist and painter , the only one in Saxonburg . " Made a specialty of designs on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paradise ? much admired . Moved after a while to where people could afford to pay for artistic work . " A drawing made by Gosewisch in 1835 ? a view of Saxonburg from Horn 's Heights , the only existing picture of the pioneer settlement when it consisted of but twelve cabins and blockhouses ? was discovered in Germany in 1921 and was purchased by Colonel Roebling . Young Washington found a special attraction at the home of the Gerstners . He was fascinated by the beauty of the eldest daughter , four years older than himself . Gerstner farmed a little , and worked for the Roebling family much of the time . His wife was a sister of Lamb , the jovial butcher . The Ladies ' Library Club of Saxonburg met at this home , with Julius Riedel presiding . Miss Gerstner was sixteen when the twelveyear-old Washington left Saxonburg for Trenton . The Colonel wrote in his reminiscences : " A most delightful family , where I spent much time . . . . The oldest daughter married Kleber of the Pittsburgh piano firm . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her beauty until she died ? in 1913 ? at the age of 80 . " The sturdy old vine-covered house in Saxonburg which John Roebling built more than a century ago for his wife and children is today owned by the Klebers ? descendants of the Gerstner daughter whose charm Colonel Roebling admired through a lifetime . After Riedel 's debacle the village had a Lutheran pastor , Clement , who came from Gotha , not far from Miihlhausen . The Colonel remembered him : " A most amiable man , from whom I took a few lessons , receiving a lump of sugar for good behavior each time . " Bollert was the village shoemaker , who made semiannual rounds to the various homes " to repair shoes beyond repair , " as the Colonel put it . " He always carried a glass globe filled with water to temper the candle light falling on his work . " One of the early settlers was Tolly , who came from Leipzig in Saxony . He was a first-class coppersmith , making a specialty  | of copper steam pipes for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home to Saxonburg once a year to be with his family . The small blockhouse he built , being located at bile foot of the hill , was swamped in heavy rains . He also owned some acres out on the Pittsburgh road , which no one wanted to farm . " I knew the family , " Colonel Roebling wrote . " The boys were just boys , but the last boy and girl rejoiced in the names of Theokar and Sheradina . " Besides Bauer the miller , there was another Bauer , not related . " He was a cable-maker employed by John A. Roebling to lay cable wire for aqueducts , " wrote the bridgebuilder 's son . " While working on the High Falls Aqueduct in New York , he was drowned bathing in the Rondout . " Schwietering , who " had horses and wagons , " was one of the teamsters who hauled wire for Roebling from New Brighton and Pittsburgh to Saxonburg and then hauled the finished wire rope to the canal at Freeport . In Washington 's memory this teamster was associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter who became the leading lady of a circus troupe . " One of the most poignant lines in Colonel Roebling 's Early History is his reference to one of the poorer farmers , named Ohl : " Became old and tired of living , like some others in Saxonburg . " Several of the farmers in the colony were quite prosperous . As a rule they were the ones who had come to Saxonburg with ample means to make a good start . The Helmbolds , " a fine family , " had a big farm adjoining John Roebling 's on the east . They farmed on a large scale , with excellent herds of cattle and sheep . " Were among the first families ? had brought over a piano on which my father often played , " Washington added in his reminiscences . The Colonel , recalling the boyhood glamour and thrill of the early days of the pioneer settlement , wistfully expressed regret for the passing scene : " As the years went by , cultivation improved ? woods were cleared , so that the whole expanse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high ground ? but the old charm of woodland is also passing . . . . Strangers who visited the place as a matter of curiosity were disappointed ? they found it a quiet little country village . The glamour of former days had vanished . . . . I have been back  | twice , for a day or two , once in 1858 and later in 1868 . Such subsequent visits only interfere with the glamour of earlier impressions . During their pioneering years in Saxonburg , six children were born to John and Johanna Roebling . The second , a daughter , died in infancy . Washington Roebling had to help look after a brother , Ferdinand , five years younger than himself , and three sisters ? three , seven , and ten years younger . This was enough of a family to fill the little cabin and to tax the strength of the " poor , overworked mother . " After the family moved to Trenton , three more sons were born . In his reference to Dr. Koch , " Saxonburg 's only homeopathic doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pulled out my best sound back tooth . I miss it yet . " And , in the same association of ideas , he added : " Homeopathy and my father 's hydropathy were the vogue in Saxonburg . " To John Roebling cold water was the lustral liquid par excellence , the grand catholicon for all ailments . To all his friends he preached the virtues of his cold-water cures , and to those of his own household he copiously and freely administered the treatment whenever they complained of not feeling well ; though , in all fairness , we must record the fact that when guilty himself of being ill , he took his own medicine . Every book ever published on hydropathy , he bought and studied ; and he applied its teachings according to his own notions , not with the tentative , cautious doses of a physician , but in the large , generous , voluminous proportions of an engineer . As was quite natural ? for after all , what was hydropathy but a branch of hydraulics ? 7 In the Colonel 's reminiscences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find is missing . On the illuminating subject of life in the Roebling home , on the significant question of the relations between father and son , the record is strangely silent . Is there a trace of disappointment , a tinge of bitterness , in the memories of old age looking back through the years to the period of childhood ? The boy grown to man 's estate understandingly forgives the early physical hardships and deprivations chargeable to poverty and to circumstances ; but when the  | more precious things that belong to the natural heritage of childhood are missed , life somehow can never make amends . Cot . erning a father 's companionship ? sharing confidences , recounting adventures , joining in play and in laughter , wandering hand in hand through the woods , going together on camping , fishing , or hunting trips ? concerning all those joyous , priceless memories that a boy normally cherishes through life , Washington Roebling 's reminiscences are silent . In view of the otherwise lucid and precise memory of details exhibited in his 1924 chronicle it is strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place . The Colonel gives the wrong date for his father 's birthday . Forgetfulness is said to be a revealing clue to suppressed emotions or subconscious inhibitions . We remember the birthdays of those we love . John Roebling had known little of visible love and affection when he was a child , and the austerity of his boyhood scene supplied the stern pattern of his life as a parent . His own ascent had been rough and back-breaking ; hence , untaught in the gentler and wiser precepts of Froebel , he adhered to the Hegelian dictum that children must be trained in the hard way . They must not be coddled , they must not be pampered ; they must be driven , they must be " broken in . " Poverty and ambition had been the twin spurs goading him to an effort that had won him the race . Proudly conscious of his own accomplishment under strain and sacrifice he insisted upon the same hard curriculum for his sons . As tenderness and warmth had been denied him or had been crowded out of his life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home he ruled . Following the German tradition , the father was lord of his household . To this was added the natural egotism of the selfmade man ? the man who had overcome obstacles by his own struggles and powers until he had won success and the homage of his fellows . His knowledge , like his professional achievements , had been hard won . In the fields of science and technology and other concrete branches of learning he knew what he knew . But when , yielding to a common human failing , he carried the same pride of knowledge , the same conviction of infallibility , to other domains of thought , he needed his parental authority to bolster his oracular pronouncements and to silence any timid questions of his listeners . He loved to argue , but an argument  | with a member of his family rapidly became a one-sided harangue . Any ventured differences of opinion would be crushed with loud and angry parental authority . A sermon or an address once heard , Roebling could recall for years afterward almost verbatim ; and this he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and children as a constrained but respectful audience . The fact that they did not understand what he was talking about mattered not at all . He would talk at them by the hour , while the poor victims would struggle to keep their eyes open , blinking in the illumination of his monologue like young owls in the unaccustomed sunshine . The laws of the Roebling household were Draconian , and any infraction was followed by prompt and unsparing retribution . The switch , kept for terror rather than for use , or the mother 's slipper , tearfully and apologetically applied on graceless youth , may be recalled in later years as a memory , half whimsical and wholly forgiving . But in the Roebling home the birch rod meant business ! Too often it was applied by the father in anger ? and such punishments are hard to accept and equally hard to forgive .  | SO LITTLE TIME JOHN ROEBLING worked feverishly , as though realizing that he had so much to accomplish and so little time in which to accomplish it . The master builder treasured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His culminating work was a race against death . How and where he found time to do all that he did , to attend professional meetings and scientific conventions , write voluminously for technical journals , practice the flute and piano , study metaphysics and put forth his conclusions in lengthy manuscripts , invent machinery and equipment and make his own drawings and models for the Patent Office , survey canals and build portage railways , create and develop a new industry , design aqueducts and bridges and himself superintend their construction ? how he achieved all this in his limited lifetime bewilders the imagination . Every hour of his day was scheduled , every minute of his time was jealously guarded . Each night , before retiring , his notebooks and his daily journal had to be written up in the minutest detail , if it took till morning . His rule was to cancel a conference if the man with whom he had an appointment was five minutes late in arriving . On one occasion , during the Civil War , General Fremont sent for him and kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Roebling sent in a card on which he had hurriedly penciled these words : " Sir , I am happy to do any work you want . But waiting in idleness is a luxury I never permit myself . " It was this driving sense of fleeting time , of the irreplaceable pricelessness of every minute , that enabled Roebling to do the work of ten men ? to compress the accomplishments of many lifetimes into one . With tireless energy , deep into the night , he calculated , he made plans , he wrote . With uncomprehending amazement Roebling 's neighbors saw the restless man energetically active from early morning to 123  | midnight hours as , with a self-imposed sense of duty , he seemed to begrudge himself each speeding second . They asked : If we are mortal , then why the strain ? And if we are immortal , then why the haste ? Perhaps , unconsciously , Roebling had the answer : Because man is mortal , he must strive to the uttermost if , through his work , he would gain immortality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1844 and 185o , the bridgebuilder found time to prepare papers on engineering and economic subjects and to deliver some of these before learned societies and civic organizations . Railroads , transatlantic cables , power transmission , and other developments of future progress received his prophetic analysis . A century ago the further expanding growth of the nation was awaiting the development of means of transportation . There were a few farseeing men who sensed all this , who realized the impelling need and the unlimited potentialities of the great railroad systems that were to be . And one of these men directing the gaze of his fellowmen to the opportunities of the future ? was John Roebling . Although he had been working for most of the preceding ten years on the construction and improvement of canals and their mountain and river crossings , he had the perception and the vision to realize that the real future of American transportation was in the development of its rail system . At that time the era of railroads was just dawning and only small lines here and there were in actual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pittsburgh Board of Trade on the courageous though timely subject of " The Great Central Railroad from Philadelphia to St. Louis . " The dissertation , running to twelve thousand words , must have cost Roebling many days and nights to write . To his audience the subject was one of vital interest . The complete paper was promptly published in a special edition of the American Railroad Journal , together with a companion article , by the same author , entitled " Location of the Central Railroad through Pennsylvania . " The masthead of the periodical featured the sensational contribution in large type .  | The principal theme was Roebling 's plea for the building of a railroad through Pennsylvania . He showed why such a transportation line was necessary for the future development of the state , and especially for the city of Philadelphia if it was to preserve its share of commerce in competition with New York , Boston , and Baltimore ; and he outlined the engineering problems involved , estimated the cost of the project , and showed how the entire undertaking would be economically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We may now project works with unerring certitude in advance of population and traffic , " he declared . " In place of railroads growing out of commerce and wealth , the former are now creating the latter . Like a magic wand , railroads open the slumbering resources of the nation . " The engineer proceeded to develop his theme in detail . He pointed out that canals could not supply the growing needs of transportation , especially as they could not be operated during the winter months . After citing what the other eastern centers were doing to advance their trade with the West , he foresaw that the city of Philadelphia and the state of Pennsylvania would be left far behind in capturing western commerce unless a forward policy were adopted . This meant constructing a system of railroads to tap the fertile valley of the Ohio River and , passing through the states of Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois , to gain access to the Mississippi at St. Louis . He then laid down the key principles which should guide the new railroad development ? principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roebling propounded them : No two roads shall be made when one can accomplish the business . The whole country shall be divided into railway systems , with main trunks forming direct communications between the most important commercial towns , and lateral branches extending through the adjacent country , also connecting with the main trunk lines . The main lines shall be so located as to interfere as little as possible with each other . The main part of the travel should be accommodated by passing through the principal centers of population . The freight business should be attracted from the country itself by  | branch lines and intersecting improvements which will discharge directly and save transshipment and commission . The character of the roads as to lines , grades and superstructure should be adapted to the magnitude of the trade ; this trade should be estimated with a due respect to the future advance of population , opening of new resources and greater expansion of business generally . In consequence of the increased facilities of transportation offered , the expense of construction may be increased in proportion as the annual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with due allowance for the increase of business which may reasonably be expected in consequence of the greater perfection and capacity of the road . In this analysis Roebling anticipated , by half a century , the modern science of railroad economics . In conclusion he wrote : " If we proceed in the location of the Great Central according to these principles and secure a connection with the West , before it can be done by our rivals , we shall be certain of success . This pioneer paper was stimulating and prophetic . Seven years after it was published , the Pennsylvania Railroad Company completed and opened for service its line from Harrisburg to Pittsburgh , following in part the route Roebling had surveyed fifteen years before ; and three years later the railroad gained control of the entire route across the state . Subsequently , as Roebling forecast , the line was extended through Ohio , Indiana , and Illinois to reach the Mississippi at St. Louis . Today the Pennsylvania Railroad System , representing an investment of over $3,000,000,000 , has eleven thousand miles of line and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companion paper , dealing with the choice of routes to be selected and the engineering problems to be solved in the construction of the proposed line , Roebling concluded with a prophecy that revealed his grasp of the situation and his remarkable vision in predicting the successful career of the Pennsylvania Railroad even before that railroad was born : " In conclusion , I may yet remark that the completion of the railroad will , like a great national event , form one of the most remarkable epochs in the history of Pennsylvania . . . . The Great Central ' railroad is destined to become the future highway of an immense traffic , not ephemeral in its nature , but  | most stable and permanent . It will vastly contribute to the wealth of Pennsylvania , and will place the future prosperity of Pittsburgh and Philadelphia upon a basis which can not be shaken . " Sixteen years before , John Roebling was a poor immigrant , entering an unfamiliar mode of life in an alien land . Now , in thought , in language , in vision , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Muhlhausen , the son of a placid , unambitious tobacconist in faraway Thuringia , had become a voice " as one speaking with authority " ? a spokesman for the spirit of America . 3 Throughout his life , the bridgebuilder showed far-seeing perception of future developments . He was a pathfinder and prophet of progress . One of the developments which he ardently preached was transoceanic communication . In an article published in the New York Journal of Commerce in 185o , he set forth his conviction that a transatlantic cable was a highly necessary and perfectly feasible project . He presented ample reasons for his opinion and furnished a detailed scheme of the method to be used in constructing the multiple insulated cable and in transporting and laying the submarine line . No plan he wrote which proposes to suspend a line above the bottom of the ocean , which contemplates stations in the ocean , and which relies on floats and buoys , can , on account of the very frailty of these provisions , seriously claim our attention . . . . My plan proposes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at New York or Boston , or vicinities , say the eastern end of Long Island , and terminating at Land 's End , the most western point of England , or at Bristol or vicinity . . . . The machinery on board the steamer , which plies off the rope , is to be so constructed that the speed of the latter will be under perfect control . It is also important to provide means for recovering the rope in any depth , if by any unforeseen accident it should break while descending . . . . In conclusion , I would suggest to memorialize Congress , praying for a survey of one or more lines between New York and Great Britain , to take soundings at regular intervals , so as to obtain a correct profile of the bottom of the Atlantic .  | In this article Roebling was a pioneer in forecasting transoceanic communication . It was not until four years later that Cyrus W. Field became actively interested in the idea , beginning a struggle which lasted twelve years before success was finally attained in establishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reasoning in matters within his technical range was always clear , simple , and explicit , and sustained by facts . He took nothing for granted . His arguments were drawn from his store of scientific knowledge , with a mathematical accuracy and fitness that carried with them a conviction of truth . He was impatient at ignorant or biased obstruction of his projects , but always courted a discussion by those who brought sound theoretical or practical grounds for opposing his views . The bridgebuilder 's only recreation , aside from his music , was his indulgence in philosophical studies , a manifestation of the lasting influence of his teacher Hegel upon his intellectual life . His son , many years later , recalled a manuscript volume of " a thousand written pages , " bearing the imposing Hegelian title " Roebling 's Theory of the Universe . " Anything of this description must have been evolved during the long and tedious winters of the pioneer farming years , when enforced idleness and unhappy restlessness drove the scholar to find an outlet for his pent-up mental energies . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locate this metaphysical tome . Instead , a much briefer paper has been discovered ? compact , systematic , and in beautiful script ? the only extant example of John Roebling 's excursions into philosophy . Bearing the more modest title , " A Metaphysical Essay on the Nature of Matter and of Spirit , " and neatly filling some ten pages ? not " a thousand pages " ? this essay is far from being formidable and repelling . In this manuscript , which dates from Roebling 's Saxonburg years , we see a mathematical mind seeking to apply the methods of scientific reasoning to the spiritual intangibles of life and , unconsciously , reaching above cold , logical processes to arrive at a satisfying creed . Step by step he formulated his questions and developed an answer to each , starting rigorously with the  | elementary and the known and ending with the infinite and the unknowable : " What is matter or body ? . . . What is Soul or Spirit ? . . . The properties of Spirit are then : Infinity and omnipresence , penetrating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . A Spirit can not be born , can not grow , can not decay , can not die . . . . There is but One ? all powerful , all present , all wise and intelligent , pervading the whole universe . This One is independent of space and time , therefore has existed and will exist forever . . . . There is no chance . All is law and premeditated design , all is system and order . . . . There is one great book of Revelation ? the book of Nature . . . . The properties of our mind , its power of reasoning , comparing , imagining , willing ? aye , its free will ? are effects produced by the influence of a spiritual agency . . . . This agency is everywhere , pervading the universe , ready to act upon a mental organism wherever it presents itself , as gravitation acts upon all ponderable matter . . . . Our reasoning faculties are inspired by the Great Spirit of the Universe . . . . As far as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals ; but we are all influenced by the same Spirit . . . . Our individuality will therefore cease with our existence . . . . The arrangement of the whole universe is evidently calculated for progressive although slow improvement . The eventual destiny of rational creatures on this globe is the enjoyment of unlimited collective happiness . Collective happiness however is not always possible without partial suffering . . . . As far as our mental and moral faculties are in our own power , we are free agents and responsible for our thoughts and actions . Every sentiment of our mind forms a note in the music of creation and will , either as a dissonance or consonance , depress or swell the harmony of the whole . Our thoughts act like pulsations upon the mental ocean ; once produced , their effects will be perpetuated . . . . No effect can be destroyed or lost in the Universe . " This youthful essay illustrates the man 's lifelong pattern of seeking to reduce every problem to logical reasoning . Through this mental excursion outside the realm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific thinking and his religious searching so as to arrive at a simple all-embracing philosophy , a concept of individual life in harmony with an  | eternal , creative , universal Spirit . Nothing startling , nothing mystifyingly profound . But in the resulting creed the pioneer found satisfaction , for it answered the questions of his youth by harmonizing his analytical reasoning and his spiritual perception . 5 In his later years , after he had found his lifework and in it had found absorbing satisfaction , John Roebling no longer needed to seek an outlet for his intellectual restlessness in metaphysical speculation . Essays on " a Theory of the Universe " or on " the Nature of Matter and of Spirit " became things of the past ; they belonged to a time and a world that he had left far behind him . In that forsaken past there had once been an old man named Hegel who had talked of abstractions and unrealities . In the new life and its strenuous activity all of that speculative philosophy of a bygone age seemed remote and meaningless . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wanted to find his mental refreshment in clearer and more succinct form ? something closer to real life . And he found it in Emerson . This wise and luminous thinker , whose philosophy had an understandable and practical side , was a man after Roebling 's heart . The truths that the master builder had evolved out of his own experience and wisdom he found again in the writings of this favorite philosopher . " Whoso would be a man , must be a nonconformist . " This urge to be true to his own spirit and to his own code , despite the risk of being misunderstood , John Roebling manifested even before military demigods . The preciousness of time and the sacredness of unremitting labor had become his dominant rules of life . For these also be found confirmation in Emerson . And with what delight did he read Emerson 's essay on Nature ! The engineer-philosopher found that his own thoughts stood nearer to those of the contemporary sage of Concord than to those of the German Hegel . The wisdom of Emerson rang clearer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man is revealed in his portrait . There was something striking in John Roebling 's appearance , which the uninitiated might at first interpret as unfriendliness , but which in reality was only the outward aspect of a constant and intense inner concentration . Under the high forehead and deep under the shaggy brows lay his overshadowed gray eyes , eyes that rested on people and on things , firm and clear , earnest and penetrating . The strongly carved features , the firmly set lips , the rather haggard face with the cheeks somewhat sunken , the erect carriage of the tall man ? all these betokened a strong personality and an inflexible power of determination . Always engrossed in his plans and his work , he was sparing of speech . When he did relax in conversation , he reversed the initial outward impression of taciturnity , for he spoke frankly and cheerfully , with a fresh and wholesome humor , giving himself naturally and without reserve . Those were the moments when he took a vacation from his duty-driven , task-burdened self . Normally , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother , who had given her strength for her son but who stood dry-eyed as she bravely sent him off to his destiny .  | THE INDUSTRIALIST THE YOUNG and thriving industry which John Roebling had started in his little backwoods community in western Pennsylvania had outgrown the limitations of its birthplace and needed to find a new location for future expansion . As orders for wire rope kept coming in from portage railways , canal companies , and shipowners , the volume of business soon strained the capacity of the little hand-worked shop and ropewalk in Saxonburg , and orders were lost because early deliveries were impossible . Difficulties of transportation imposed an additional handicap . For five months each winter the canals were closed and no shipments could be made . For greater accessibility to the growing eastern market , and to reduce haulage and shipping costs , a new site had to be found for the infant industry . Roebling realized this . Saxonburg , remote and secluded , was not the place in which to expand his growing enterprise or even to preserve the lead which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal . The suitability of Trenton for the proposed wire-rope factory had been suggested to Roebling by Peter Cooper . In 1830 Cooper had built the " Tom Thumb , " the first locomotive in America , and fifteen years later he decided to go into the business of rolling railroad rails . He had selected Trenton for his own manufacturing ventures ; and in 1847 , together with his nephew , Abram S. Hewitt afterward mayor of New York he organized the Trenton Iron Company . Peter Cooper 's encouragement was not entirely disinterested , as he had a shrewd eye open to the possibility of securing profitable relations with the new venture . Knowing that Roebling had been accustomed to purchase his supplies of iron wire from wire mills , the Trenton Iron Company naturally assumed that he would continue to do so , and therefore that , as local manufacturers , they would enjoy a large share of his  | orders . But their hopes were destined to be unfulfilled , for no sooner was Roebling 's little mill established in Trenton than he began immediate preparations to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underrated the Saxonburg pioneer 's business sagacity and foresight ; their credulity would have been staggered if anyone had suggested to them in those days that Mr. Roebling 's insignificant venture was destined in the ensuing years to grow to such mammoth proportions as ultimately to eclipse their own plant , not only in the manufacture of wire but also in total volume of business . Trenton was then a small town that showed little promise of future growth ; but its potentialities and advantages as a manufacturing site were soon apparent to Roebling . Eastern location , transportation facilities by both rail and water , availability of skilled labor , and proximity of related industries ? all these pointed to Trenton as an ideal site for the new enterprise . In August , 1848 , upon reaching his decision , Roebling purchased twenty-five acres of land in what was then open country , about one mile from the center of the city of Trenton . The price was $3,000 . The ground was undeveloped farmland with no buildings on it . Skirting one side of the property were the Delaware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affording convenient shipping facilities . 2 Preparations were promptly made for the erection of a mill , a ropewalk , and a house for the family . Roebling was unable to remain in Trenton to supervise these building operations , as he had to attend to his engineering engagements on the construction of the suspension aqueducts of the Delaware and Hudson Canal , besides needing to wind up his affairs , including the sale of his house and land , in Saxonburg . He therefore put one of his most trusted assistants , Charles Swan , in charge of the construction work in Trenton . Although leaving the supervision to Swan , Roebling himself remained architect , engineer , inventor , designer , and draftsman of the work . He personally planned and designed every building of his new wire mills and shops , and he invented and designed nearly every piece of machinery that went into them . And how  | well the founder planned and wrought is attested by the fact that machines he designed and built are still in use in the Roebling plant today after nearly a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and constructed , in the early days of his rope making , are still turning out rope , and good rope . During the winter and spring of 1848-49 , the work of preparation of the ground and the building of the Trenton plant proceeded rapidly under Swan 's capable supervision . The bridgebuilder kept in constant touch with his factotum by correspondence . Writing from Saxonburg in February , Roebling gave instructions and advice about a well which was being dug at the new site and with which Swan was having trouble , owing to the appearance of quicksand and consequent caving in . Writing again in March , he commended Swan 's action in halting a proposed encroachment upon his land by the projected opening of a new highway . In April he wrote from Two River , Pike County , Pennsylvania , where he was then building the Lackawaxen aqueduct , to express his regret that some trees , which Swan had planted , had not been watered and consequently might not grow , and incidentally remarking that in the course of another week he would be going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He warned Swan against employing a certain Jonathan Rhule , if he should appear in Trenton , as he was an " Ellet 's man " ? referring to the rival bridgebuilder . " I do not want , " Roebling wrote , " any news carried between myself and Mr. Ellet. ? Ellet has promised Rhule work for no other reason but because I discharged him . " l From High Falls he wrote in June , warning his superintendent that in laying brick in mortar he must not forget to have the bricks well wetted or saturated with water . In July he urged Swan to push the building of the house and also the other work , " so that we can commence making ropes on the first of September . " He said that he expected his family to leave Saxonburg for Trenton in September , and he authorized Swan , if there should be a public auction in Trenton or near it , to buy some used furniture " if good yet , and cheap , for one or two rooms . " In August he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awaiting him , " all of them very urgent " ? and " to hurry up our works as fast as it can be done . . . . We must commence making rope before the first of October . I have promised to ship  | a rope 3000 feet long for Charleston , S. C. , on the first of October . " Early in September he asked Swan , on his next trip to Philadelphia , to look at some good stoves for cooking as well as common use . " I must , " Roebling wrote , " get a cooking stove , and one for the lower room , before my family arrives . " At last the Roebling family was to enjoy the new luxury of an American stove . The letters followed one another almost daily . Writing from High Falls , Roebling introduced a new German machinist , and incidentally mentioned the initial work on the Neversink aqueduct . " The bearer is Ernest Ermelling , the machinist , who is to work with you . You will find him an intelligent , willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work the Engine , so that he can attend to it while you are engaged at other work . My principal object is to put him at the Wire drawing . . . . To morrow I have to go up to the Neversink to lay the second Anchorage . I expect to start for Trenton this day week . " Later in the same month he transmitted two letters for Ermelling , methodically charging him for the postage paid . " Enclosed I send you two letters for Ernest Ermelling , one from Germany . Charge him 34 cs. of Postage . " Writing next from the Astor House , on lower Broadway in New York , Roebling stressed the need of securing some good men experienced in wire drawing , and he counseled Swan , if any such skilled workers should appear , to " do as if you know all about wire . " He stated that he himself had made arrangements in New York to engage " German wire-drawers , in case any should arrive here , also one or two German machinists , who frequently arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Trenton we must keep them , put them to the rope business and teach them wire drawing . Such hands will learn easily and are satisfied with common wages , say , 85 cents a day . " A few days later , he sent a letter from High Falls introducing a mechanic , one Carl Lange , who he judged would be a good hand at rope making . " Lange has been getting 85 cent wages here , which I will continue to the fifteenth of October , then reduce to 75 cents for the winter . " What a heart-constricting revelation of the penury of the times ! To Roebling and to his contemporaries , this was ordinary  | business shrewdness or necessity . Fortunately the times have changed and , with them , our concepts and standards of industrial relations . John Roebling was investing every dollar he had , and probably all that he could borrow , to build his plant and to establish an industry ; during the initial period of struggle and trial he had to make ends meet , or else all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying with them the hopes of those who depended upon him . He was also reacting to the scarring and hardening influences of his earlier experiences ? his childhood scene , when all of life was dominated by a fevered passion for thrift , when penny pinching was identified with a drive toward a grimly resolved goal ; and his pioneer farming years , when desperate effort and the utmost economy were the necessary twin conditions for survival . The man 's life had been warped , and he had not yet found the larger pattern . Continuing his letter , Roebling warned Swan not to permit Lange to smoke during work . " He is an inveterate smoker , and I believe he was the cause of a fire which broke out in my shanty yesterday but was fortunately discovered in time . I have now strictly prohibited smoking upstairs amongst bedding , where there is danger , and I want you to insist on it and carry out the same rule at Trenton , without exception . I would much rather discharge a good man than lose a building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit smoking upstairs or quit work . Do never depart from this rule . Last winter we had a most dreadful accident in this neighborhood , when a large shanty burned down and three men lost their lives , the whole caused by smoking amongst bedding . " The new wire and rope mill at Trenton was of wood construction , with sleeping quarters for the workmen in the upper story or attic . Roebling , the son of a tobacconist and raised in a home always filled with the fragrance of tobacco , was not himself a smoker ; he would not divert any of his precious moments of time or periods of concentration to the relaxing pleasures in which more normal human beings indulge ; and his lifelong passion for safety far outweighed any sympathetic understanding ? if he had any ? of the craving for the nerve-soothing solace of a pipe or even a Pittsburgh stogie . On his memorable voyage on the zlugust Eduard to America in 1831 , a set of rules he  | drafted to govern the conduct and the treatment of the steerage passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strikes fire , or has a light in the steerage , will have his pipes , tobacco , or lighting apparatus thrown overboard immediately , and besides , such a passenger will be condemned to bread and water . " 3 Mrs. Roebling with her five children , ranging in age from twelve to two , and only some ten weeks before the birth of another child , bravely made the eastward trip across Pennsylvania and New Jersey in six days , traveling by canal and railroad . They had never seen a train before . The father , tied down to his engineering projects in the East , could not spare the time to escort his family on this difficult journey to their new home . Grandfather Herting and the mechanics Kunze and son accompanied the family on their pilgrimage to Trenton . A few years after the pioneer wire-rope manufacturer sold his home and all of his lands in Saxonburg , oil and gas were discovered under the property , yielding unexpected wealth to the new owners . In a reminiscent letter written by Colonel Roebling a few months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange twist of fate ? the fortune which the family unknowingly had in its grasp and blindly let go . " So it goes in this word , " was his resigned comment . In his Early History of Saxonburg , the Colonel also told of the blow suffered by the little community in the loss of the wirerope industry , and of the subsequent compensation of fate : " To say that the removal of the Roebling interests from Saxonburg proved a death-blow to the village is very near the truth . Forunately the discovery of oil in the neighborhood , a few years later , tempered the force . But by that time Mr. Roebling had sold all his lands . . . . On the same meadow where rope was made , a gas well was struck . . . . Just south of Thorn Creek notable wells were struck and enriched their owners . . . . In our house we employed a man of all work named Conrad Seibert . He had acquired a small holding there ? when oil was struck he made a fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Under our house is a vein of coal , untouched , because there is so much coal in the neighborhood easier to get at . "  | When the pioneer founder of the settlement , in his enthusiastic promotion letters written in 1831 enumerating the advantages of the site , included the potential mineral wealth of the locality , he was writing more prophetically than he knew . But fate decreed that this buried wealth should remain undiscovered until he himself had abandoned the site to his fellow colonists , to seek his own fortune elsewhere . With the construction work speeded under Roebling 's driving energy , his wire-rope works at Trenton were ready to start partial operation early in October , 1849 . Not until then was it generally known that the new plant would do its own wire drawing . A month later the Trenton State Gazette reported further progress : Mr. Roebling will soon commence the manufacture of a rope about 3600 feet long , which , when finished , will weigh six tons . It is ordered by a South Carolina railroad , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Georgia . . . . Mr. Roebling 's railway , on which the machinery is about 4000 feet long , is now completed . This machinery is so perfect that every strand of wire rope will bear its due proportions of the whole strain . A steam engine of twelve horsepower drives all the machinery . We could not give our readers an intelligent description of the machinery if we should try . 4 In the new home in Trenton , one evening in December , Roebling 's seventh child and third son , Charles Gustavus , was born . Thus destiny brought into the world , in the same place and at the same time , an industry of potential greatness and the future genius of its development and fruition . As the firstborn son was to give his health and his strength to carry his father 's dream span to completion , so this younger son was to give his brains and his energy to carry the industry forward after the father 's death , to expand and perfect the wire and rope-making project beyond the dreams of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life , and there he died . After an engineering education , he devoted himself to the engineering and manufacturing end of the business ; became President of the company ; built the near-by industrial town of Roebling to accommodate expanding production needs ; built a  | new wire mill , a new rolling mill , and a new wire-rope factory ; erected a wire-cloth factory and a large rod mill ; started the manufacture of copper wire and insulated wire ; played an important part in the design of the equipment and the procedure for moving " Cleopatra 's Needle " from Egypt to its site in Central Park , New York , in 188o ; built the Oil City suspension bridge and the cables for the Williamsburg Bridge ; served as a member of the New Jersey legislature ; and , after losing his son ? Washington Augustus Roebling , 3rd ? in the Titanic disaster in 1912 , died six years later , the wealthiest of the three brothers . Transcending even his ability , vision , and industry were his impulsive generosity and shy but warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved younger brother , Colonel Washington Roebling wrote to a sympathetic friend and neighbor , Mrs. Stockton , in 1918 : " One winter evening , on December 9 , 1849 , I was sitting next a room where a woman was in labor ; presently I heard the faint cry of a new-born child . Last Saturday I heard the last sigh of that same child . When I think back on the great work , the vast accomplishments and undertakings achieved between those two sighs , it surpasses my understanding . May he rest in that peace of which he saw so little during his lifetime . " 5 In the installation and adjustment of the machinery the founder personally took a leading and active part . Around Christmas time he suffered a painful accident , with more serious consequences narrowly averted . While testing some of the new machinery , his hand was accidentally caught in one of the ascending pulleys . He was suddenly drawn upward some six or eight feet , when one of the workmen fortunately saw him and stopped the machinery . Roebling fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand and bruising of his arm . This unfortunate accident left a permanent injury ; the pioneer 's left hand was maimed , ending his ability to play the flute and the piano . During the years that followed , as the bridgebuilder was compelled to be away from home for months at a time , he depended upon Swan to take care of all his interests in his  | absence , not only as superintendent of the mill but also as trusted confidential representative , with full authority to attend to all matters ? manufacturing , commercial , and personal ? subject only to Roebling 's direct orders . The latter , during his extended absences from Trenton , wrote to his aide almost daily , giving him the most minute instructions relative to the running of the mill , the handling of the business , and the interests of the family ; and the faithful agent was required in turn to keep his employer informed as to all transactions and occurrences . Moreover , while the father was away , Swan stood in loco parentis to the children ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and devotion ; and even after they were grown , they corresponded with him when they themselves were away , making him their confidant . And thus , for the next twenty years , Charles Swan played an important part in the Roebling affairs . He was one of those loyal , trustworthy , patient souls , wholeheartedly devoted to the interests of his employer and willing and anxious to subordinate himself to the wishes of his chief . The position was a difficult one , and only a person of the rarest qualities could have filled it ; for Roebling was no easy man to get along with , and always demanded an unqualified and unquestioning obedience to his orders ? any slip , variation , or infraction was visited with his hot and instant displeasure . The letters , numbering several hundred , written by John Roebling to Swan during the years from 1899 to 1869 were devoted almost exclusively to the work at the wire mill and told little or nothing as to his own doings . Rarely were there any allusions to personal and family matters ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , and what he was to refrain from doing . In these letters , the master builder drew sketches for new machinery he wanted to have installed , and he gave exact measurements and specifications and the places where the equipment or parts could be obtained . He described new processes he wanted to have tried out , and he gave detailed instructions and precise formulas for them . He cautioned Swan about extending credits to certain customers , and directed him as to lawsuits . From those files of letters , the whole business of the wire mill , for nearly twenty years , can be recon-  | structed , except for the short periods , marked by gaps in the correspondence , when the bridgebuilder was at home . Keeping a close control of his accounts , Roebling carried his ledger and cashbook with him on his travels and entered debits and credits , instructing Swan which bills to pay and which to hold up . He enclosed checks to be deposited to his account His mail was forwarded to him with daily letters from Swan , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business affairs and with everything of importance at home . All this he did , in minute detail , while engaged in the active and exacting work of building aqueducts and bridges . His energy knew no bounds , his industry never flagged . He read the current technical and scientific journals and made notes of new ideas , inventions , and processes ; these he preserved for future reference . Every night , methodically and systematically , he wrote up his diary ? of conferences , activities , events , instructions given , and personal expenses . With a peculiar passion for meticulous equity , he kept a careful record and account , in his private ledger , of the sums expended for his children ? every dollar spent for their support , for their doctor bills , for their schooling , and every nickel advanced to them for their personal expenditures ; and then he wrote in his will that the full and exact amount charged against each child during his lifetime was to be deducted from that child 's equal share of the final inheritance . Roebling did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to read English , and he was too busy for nonessential correspondence . When he wanted her to know something of special interest in one of his business letters , he would add a line , " Please read this to Mrs. R. " In the hundreds of letters he wrote to Swan , there were rarely any passages disclosing the personal and human side of the bridgebuilder . Never in a single instance was the lighter element present ? no humor , no description , no anecdotes ? all was business , nothing but business . The man was so engrossed in his immediate tasks that he had neither the time nor the inclination for anything else . The questing youth who wrote the sensitive diary of his ocean voyage in 1831 ? with eyes and mind and heart open to all things of human , esthetic , and imaginative appeal ? had since then allowed all those refreshing branches of  | his personality to become atrophied in order that every ounce of his vital energy might be concentrated in the main trunk of a relentless and unsparing ambition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from place to place in his professional career , he must have had many unique experiences and he must have met many interesting people . But no inkling of those things cropped out in his letters . Like a runner in a heart-straining championship race , he had no time to look to left or right , but directed every nerve , thought , and sinew toward the goal . He was as a man possessed . He had become self-contained , self-centered , self-driving ? with no interests apart from his work . 6 Roebling was at home most of the time during the year 1850 . His growing family was now established in the house built for them by Swan , and the little factory was in full working order with ample demands for its products . The planner and builder had just completed the third and fourth of his aqueducts for the Delaware and Hudson Canal , and was actively filling in his time while waiting for his next bridge-engineering engagement . Roebling was not resting . He was thinking and planning and figuring for the next span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important than any he had previously constructed : the proposed Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge . In his spare time he took part in other intellectual activities . An item in the local newspaper reported his participation in a public discussion on geology : At a meeting of the Trenton Philosophical Society held on Thursday evening , the question was discussed , " Is there sufficient reason for believing that the earth was formerly in a fused state ? " Mr. Roebling took part . He alluded to various phenomena of geological formation , which seem to prove the fusion theory , such as the crystalline structure of the primary rocks everywhere , which led to some further remarks . It was at this time also that Roebling developed and published his proposal for building a transoceanic cable . Two days after its publication an announcement of the article appeared in the Trenton State Gazette :  | John A. Roebling , Esq. , proprietor of the Wire Rope Factory , has furnished the journal of Commerce with a long and ingenious article on a transatlantic telegraph . Mr. Roebling has had much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the manufacture of wire ropes . He considers the construction of a line across the Atlantic entirely practicable , on which he thinks very large dividends may be expected . Many things which seem preposterous have proved not only practicable , but eminently important and valuable . During this period also , Roebling found time to develop some useful new inventions , supplementing earlier inventions on which he had secured three patents in 1842 and 1843 . Between 1846 and 1867 , he patented his design of anchorages for suspension bridges , his apparatus for spinning cables for suspension bridges , a " closing head " for a stranding machine for making the strands for wire rope , the idea of using wire rope for transmitting power , a new marine type of boiler , structural girders made up of steel and wood in combination , a passenger car constructed entirely of iron , and two improvements in " rail chairs " for supporting and protecting rail joints in railroad track . The inventor 's vision of new and useful services to which wire rope could be effectively applied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he proposed to transmit power over a distance of 3,500 feet by means of wire rope running over large sheaves , many people shook their heads and said that his enthusiasm had outstripped his practicality . He proceeded to demonstrate the feasibility of his idea by installing such a transmission at his Trenton plant , using a wire rope 7,000 feet in length to operate a ropewalk ; the success of this installation , economical and efficient , had a far-reaching influence . Soon after his patent was granted , wire rope transmissions became widely adopted for the delivery of power over long distances . Until superseded by the development of electrical power transmission a generation later , the wire-rope system of transmitting power offered unique advantages . Combining his capacities of invention , engineering , and promotion ? functions which after his death were divided among his three sons ? Roebling prepared an illustrated article on this interesting application of wire rope , featuring its possibilities and supplying  | the technical information required . In his introductory summary , he wrote : " The use of a round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheave , in place of a flat belt running on a flat-faced pulley , constitutes the transmission of power by wire ropes . The distance to which this can be applied ranges from about 6o feet up to about three miles . . . . In point of economy it costs one-fifteenth of an equivalent amount of belting and one twenty-fifth of shafting . " The Seventh United States Census , that of 185o , was the first to include a survey of the industries of the country , and we thus have available the government record of the Roebling business during the first year of its operation . The report gives the names and ages of the members of the family , together with ten Roebling employees who were also included as members of the one household , making up a total of eighteen , all of whom , with the exception of the six Roebling children , appear to have been born in Germany . The total investment in the wire-rope plant , including land , buildings , and machinery , was recorded as $20,000 . The motive power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The employees were listed as twenty males , no females ; and the monthly cost of labor was $500 . The raw materials used in the year , including fuel , were 300 tons of iron , valued at $353000 , and 40o tons of coal , valued at $I , 2oo . The annual product comprised 250 tons of wire rope , valued at $4o,000 , and other finished articles valued at $1,000 . These figures indicate that , during the first year of adjustment and initial operation , the new plant showed no profit ? no return on the investment and no compensation for the creative and directive energy of the founder . The raw material was disproportionately expensive , the breaking-in of the men and of the machinery consumed time and money , and the volume of work was small for the size of the plant . But great things grow from small beginnings . That cash was scarce and sorely needed is revealed by Roebling 's correspondence from Trenton in 185o . In May he wrote to William H. Campbell , Superintendent of the Allegheny and Portage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appropriation Bill has been passed , I expect you will soon be enabled to pay off the old scores which Mr. Power left unsettled . Two sets of Ropes are not paid yet , viz : 61oo ft. delivered in May  | 1849 on Plane No. 6 , 3494 ft. delivered in Aug. 1849 on No. 1 , . . . $5o68.91 . " And after several more letters covering additional shipments of wire rope , he wrote again in October : " I am greatly in want of money and should be glad to hear from you that you can settle one of my bills . " A week later he wrote : " It is certainly wrong that I should be kept out of money , which is justly due , for so long a time . " And the following week he wrote again : " I am anxious to receive your draft , being much in want of funds . " The winter of 1851 ? 52 was unusually severe , bringing suffering to the poor of Trenton . When an appeal for charitable relief was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The collector of the relief fund immediately published a grateful acknowledgment in the Star Gazette : " Mr. Editor : ? Permit me to acknowledge through your columns the receipt of ten dollars from John A. Roebling , Esq. ? the first fruits of the appeal made last evening for the poor of Trenton . May many more such gifts be sent in . Before the ashes on the hearth-stone of poverty have grown cold , or the tears on the cheek of suffering have had time to dry . ' " A number of his Saxonburg neighbors followed Roebling to Trenton to find employment in his plant . Toward his fellow countrymen ? in fact toward all his employees ? he always maintained a loyal helpfulness and a warm personal interest . Even in his early lean years , he provided shelter for the homeless and work for the jobless . And as he prospered , his faithful workers prospered with him . 7 From its modest beginning in 1849 , when the first wire-rope mill at Trenton succeeded the primitive ropewalk at Saxonburg , the Roebling industry has grown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mills , shops , furnaces , laboratories , and buildings would fill pages , and a list of the different items manufactured ? in different forms , uses , and applications of wire and wire rope ? would fill a good-sized catalogue . The products of the Roebling plant have found applications beyond the imagination of men at the time the industry was founded . From a hairpin to a harbor-defense net , from a delicate hair-  | spring in a watch to the powerful cables and suspenders of the Golden Gate Bridge , the range of products and their uses is staggering . In 185o , the first year of operation , twenty men were employed and the annual output was $40,000 . Twenty years later , at the death of the founder , one hundred men were employed and the product of the plant approximated $250,000 annually . In the next forty years , when the three sons carried forward the business their father had started , the industry ' continued to expand until it had eight thousand employees and the output ran far into the millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spread its buildings not only over the surrounding acres , but across what were then neighboring farm lands , until , forced to expand by the pyramiding demand for its product but constrained by the soaring land values that had grown up around it ? and of which it had in no small measure been the creator ? the enterprise had to go pioneering again . In 1905 it moved ten miles down the Delaware to establish a newer and larger nucleus in a new town which it created to its own needs and ideals . John Roebling , upon his arrival in America , planned and founded the little village of Saxonburg in Pennsylvania . Seventy years later , his sons , carrying on the tradition , planned and built the model town of Roebling in New Jersey . A sandy tract , unattractive and unproductive , was transformed into a beautiful residential community . Where tangled weeds and bushes grew , today a charming park overlooks the Delaware River , and fine shade trees line well-paved residential streets . The town has been well planned , with attractive parks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children attend the large and spacious red-brick school . A national bank , theater , post office , and hospital have been provided , as well as a police department , a well-equipped fire department , and many business houses , fine churches , and community clubhouses . The company officials take pride in their model town and in administering it in a manner to perpetuate the ideals of the founders . John Roebling 's wire mill has grown into the world 's largest plant for manufacturing wire and cables . When the pioneer established his shop at Trenton , his first product was made by hand in the old ropewalk way . Today the  | ground where he did it is covered with buildings full of speeding machinery that has little rest ? devices that stand in long rows , eating up the strand that unwinds from whirling bobbins , and steadily turning off the completed rope , which passes to " spools , " large or small , in proportion to its weight and size . The machines for the smaller sizes of wire rope are strung out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the making of the largest ropes each giant machine has a room to itself and is installed on its own special foundation of steel and concrete . When the mechanism is at work , it somehow suggests the solar rotations . The flying bobbins have a triple motion . On the ends of the radial arms on which they are mounted they travel in a whirling circle around the central column ; but , at the same time , each whirling bobbin is unwinding as the strand pays out , and also turns completely end for end , at predetermined intervals . There is something mysterious and fascinating in the spectacle of these flying reels of steel , or copper , whizzing around and round " like indefatigable moths around a big steel candle , or a dervish round his own spinal column on a spot of ground the size of a dinner plate , " and in the sight of the emerging rope , hard , shining , round , packed around its core of hemp or steel , noiselessly gathering all this strength and energy into itself for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 8 It is difficult for us to realize how much we are indebted to the invention and development of wire rope . Much of our material progress during recent decades must be credited to the ramifying applications of the family industry that grew from the master builder 's original vision . There are the millions of speeding elevators . The modern skyscraper , even the office building or apartment house of moderate height , was made possible by wire rope . John Roebling made the first elevator rope in 1862 . Today millions are in use all over the world . There is logging in the forests of the Northwest , where the giant trunks , seven , eight , or nine feet in diameter , are slung on cableways , whisked up the sides of mountains , hoisted into the  | air and deposited on flatcars , to be run down to the river on steep inclines , again operated by steel ropes of great size and strength . There is quarrying , where wire rope is used in quantity for guying the giant derricks , and for hoisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then again to carry the huge blocks on high aerial cableways over long distances to be loaded . There is underground haulage in tunnel and mine , for which five distinct types of rope are used , enabling the engineer to make light of grades , even with staggering loads ; and there are the hoisting ropes going down the vertical shafts to the onethousand- , or fifteen-hundred- , or two-thousand-foot levels of the subterranean workings , to bring up the cages loaded with men or with precious ore , with everything depending on the strength and safety of the steel rope . There are the oil fields , where , in the mad search for petroleum to supply the world 's shortage , miles of wire rope are used , some of it an inch thick or over , to carry the drills , or the casing and sand lines . There is shipping ? the battleship and the merchantman and the liner ; the yacht , the river boat , and the tug all strung with wire rope from stem to stern , and some of them from truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towing lines which have their own plan and formula . There is dredging , for which tough wire rope has supplanted the old cumbrous chain . There is hardly an important harbor in the world where these stout ropes of steel are not busy clearing pathways and anchorages for marine commerce . The list does not end . There are inclines and funicular railways , in the mountains of America and in foreign countries , enabling young and old to get views from towering peaks which otherwise would have been accessible only to the hardy mountain climber . There are high cableways with which engineers have been able to run cars and trucks and giant buckets on an aerial roadbed of wire over impassable canyons and gorges and morasses , to make fills for railways and other construction , and to place millions of tons of concrete for gigantic dams . There are tramways and traction systems and cable railways and trolleys . And there is the litter of hoisting slings , all over creation , to lift anything from a casting or a crate of cargo to a  | locomotive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work of any kind there is a load to lift , and the light but powerful wire rope makes the most convenient sling to lift it . There are records in the Roebling offices that tell interesting tales of special constructions ; and pictures of enormous spools of wire rope , thousands of feet long and in big diameters , running from spool to spool and ? since one spool is an ample carload ? running from one flatcar to another when loaded for shipment . Such were the huge street-railway cables made by the Roeblings for Australia , for Kansas City , for Chicago and New York . There is an amusing story of the New York street-railway engineer who insisted that the cable be made in one section , 33,000 feet in length , but who changed his mind about the beauty of it when he got the goods and saw the elephantine spools of packed metal caving in the manholes in the city streets on their way to the point of installation . A gigantic rope machine was built in the Roebling plant to twist this mammoth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two fires in one week ; the second destroyed a large factory building and caused damage estimated at $1,000,000 . These fires were believed to be of incendiary origin . They followed a published threat by Dr. Constantin Dumba , former ambassador from Austria-Hungary , that American plants would be crippled . Two months before these fires he brazenly declared , in a published statement : " We can disorganize and hold up , if not entirely prevent , the manufacture of munitions in America . " The Roeblings were producing wire and wire rope for the Allies , and were therefore on the German list of plants to be destroyed . Immediately after the disastrous fire , a foreign-language newspaper , the Brooklyn Freie-Presse , carried the boasting headline : RENDERED HARMLESS ? Factory Building of Roebling Company Reduced to Ashes ? Was Used to Produce Wire for the Allies . And then , as soon as America entered the war in 1917 , the Roeblings and their ten thousand employees accepted the challenge . They threw every ounce of effort into the struggle . They  | undertook task after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critical importance in the final victory . The first big call was for submarine nets , to protect fleet bases and harbors . The Roeblings supplied to the Navy , for this purpose , some three million feet of steel rope . And it was not ordinary rope that was required in this service , for the German submarines had developed a method of slashing through the earlier and lighter nets . For the new type of barrier , the wire rope ranged up to an inch and a half in required thickness . Moreover , the task was not merely a matter of shipping giant reels of rope . Almost all of it had to be cut into specified lengths , and special attachments had to be made and fitted for each length , for these barriers were designed in separate sections to be linked together . And the Army Ordnance Bureau , for its barrier nettings , used another million feet of wire rope , which was shipped to various coast forts . Then the Quartermaster 's Department called for seven million feet of steel rope and the manufacture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fitting one of the " thimble splices " is ordinarily half an hour 's work , the Roebling plant , employing new men previously unskilled , was turning out ten thousand pairs of traces a day at the peak of production on this order . The national government also demanded wire rope for its logging , shipping , mining , and oil-drilling operations . The Spruce Production Board took over eight million feet of steel rope , the Emergency Fleet more than twelve million feet , and the Fuel Administration drew on the rope manufacturers at the rate of thousands of tons a month . And all the time the privately owned mines and mills and ordnance plants , and the manufacturers of locomotives and cranes and derricks and freighters , kept demanding ? and getting ? continually increasing supplies of wire rope to carry on their war-driven work . The total figures were staggering . But the climax , the call that drew upon all the reserve resources of the wire-rope makers and kept the machines running and the men working and the arc lights burning in the mills for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet of steel rope , and a half-million attached fittings , for the " North Sea Mine Barrage " ? the desperately conceived  | measure that put an end to the menace of the German submarines . The whole amazing episode of the North Sea Mine Barrage which , with its seventy thousand bottled TNT volcanoes , made that historic body of water a graveyard for German hopes , was hidden from general knowledge . The full story will never be told . While the armies in all the theaters of the war swayed back and forth in the struggle , few people knew that the fate of the world hung virtually by a wire rope . Not until the " moving finger " had written failure across the German plans was any whisper allowed to escape regarding the heroic work that had been done in bottling up the U-boats and making the submarine warfare ineffective . The Germans had pinned their hopes on the U-boat campaign . Wire rope defeated them . The actual toll may never be known . The Germans admitted twenty-three U-boats lost there , and other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the defeat of the submarine campaign ? a defeat which the North Sea Mine Barrage had forced the enemy to accept . The swiftness with which the barrage project was executed , the short time allowed for fulfilling of unheard-of demands , the highly specialized equipment and processes that had to be devised and employed in the manufacture ? all have become part of the extraordinary story of wire rope . In January , 1918 , the emergency order was received at Trenton . By May i it was made and shipped ? without a flaw , without a single delay ? millions and millions of feet of galvanized rope of the specified lengths and sizes ? all of the extra-special quality desired for this work and subject to the most exhaustive tests ? to equip and anchor a hundred thousand mines . It was a feverish task , done at a feverish speed , but with outstanding perfection . In three months the Roebling works turned out twenty-seven million feet of this superquality steel rope . In addition the Roebling force prepared and attached a halfmillion sockets and hooks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ besides supplying all of the four-legged lifting slings used in handling the mines . In the spring of 1918 the Yankee mine-layers were sowing the troubled waters between Norway and the Orkneys with three-  | hundred-pound cases of death and destruction , at the rate of one every twelve seconds ; and twelve hundred feet of fine wire rope went out of sight with every mine . Each mine-laying excursion carried and buried six million feet of steel rope . Following this stupendous assignment , the Roeblings furnished fifteen million feet more of powerful steel rope for the " Adriatic Sea Mine Barrage . " This was an even more ambitious project , since it dealt with a depth of three thousand instead of nine hundred feet . The material was furnished and the barrage was all ready to be laid when it was rendered unnecessary by the German capitulation . When the fighting stopped , there was a perfectly good mine barrage in the North Sea that had to be taken up and put out of commission . This called for six hundred thousand feet more of wire rope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine was canceled without a mishap , and there are now more than eighty million feet of highest grade wire rope reposing at the bottom of the North Sea . But it had done its work , destroying no less than seventeen German submarines in the first week , and more in the succeeding weeks , until this one baffling menace was eliminated and victory for the Allies was assured . In 1931 , when the historical society in Muhlhausen proposed an official celebration in honor of Roebling on the one-hundredth anniversary of that memorable day ? May 11 , 1831 ? when the town 's most famous son bade farewell to his neighbors and departed for America , the city fathers vetoed the proposal on the ground that wire-rope nets manufactured by the Roebling plant at Trenton had captured and destroyed twenty German submarines in the First World War . In the same vein , a strangely conceded tribute to Roebling was expressed by a German biographer , Dr. Wilhelm Auener , who wrote in 1931 : " To us it appears tragic fate that this emigrant 's cleavage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roebling the Fatherland not only lost an engineering genius and a great industrialist ; but that which he created has worked damagingly against Germany in that war materials in enormous quantities  | have been produced in the works which Johann August Roebling founded . " Men may fight and destroy for a time , but they can build forever . It is in the constructive arts , in the peacetime progress of humanity , that the products of the new industry created by the inventive genius of the Saxonburg pioneer find their highest and most enduring usefulness .  | SPANNING NIAGARA IN ALL the world no place could have been found where the building of a suspension bridge would present a more spectacular accomplishment than over the Niagara gorge , with the Falls thundering a little way upstream and the waters lashing and fuming underneath . No other setting could have provided such a dramatic and impressive background for a slender span symbolizing the genius and courage of man defying the gigantic , furious forces of nature . And to plan such a span ? seemingly a frail web in contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the enormous loads of locomotives and freight trains was an unprecedented , breath-taking temerity of the human spirit . The idea of carrying railroad trains over that thundering turmoil of waters on a high and tenuous framework of wire and wood stunned the imagination , and the proposal evoked a storm of protest from nearly all the foremost engineers of the time . But Roebling was a practical man as well c.s a stubborn one . His one passion in life was to prove his convictions . After all , he was dealing with rock and wire , and he knew what they would do . He built the bridge ? thereby disposing of preconceived timidities and establishing an epochmaking new precedent . With that achievement he became one of the world 's immortals . One of the first promoters of the idea of a railroad span across the Niagara gorge was Major Charles B. Stuart , a civil engineer prominent in military and political circles . In 1848 he became the first State Engineer and Surveyor of the state of New York and later he served as Engineer-in-Chief of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technical books on naval subjects ; and in 187i ? when he had attained the rank of general ? he published his valuable volume , Lives and Works of Civil Engineers of zimerica , which includes the first published  | biography of John A. Roebling . But , at the time of this story , he had not yet met the bridgebuilder . In 1845 , while engaged in locating the Great Western Railway of Canada and what later became the Rochester and Niagara Falls branch of the New York Central Railroad , Major Stuart was struck by the possibility of connecting the two lines by a suspension bridge over the Niagara River , between the Falls and the " Whirlpool , " where the chasm was about eight hundred feet wide and over two hundred feet deep . As the project was a novel and bold undertaking and generally believed to be impracticable , and as the Major was not himself a bridge engineer , he addressed a circular letter to a number of the leading engineers of America and Europe , asking their opinion of the proposal . Various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , others expressing grave doubts of its practicability and safety at any cost . Of all those canvassed , only four engineers thought the project feasible : Charles Ellet , John A. Roebling , Samuel Keefer , and Edward W. Serrell . And it is a remarkable coincidence that each of these engineers later actually constructed a suspension bridge over the Niagara River , thus justifying their early faith . Here begins the drama of four men accepting the challenge of Niagara . Four men say they can do the job . Each man in turn wins the opportunity , and each , in his own fashion , tackles the task . The story of the varying adventures of these four aspirants for the honor of spanning Niagara ? the way each of them won his big chance and what each man did with the opportunity after he had it ? has become part of the epic of bridgebuilding. 2 The reply to Major Stuart 's inquiry from Ellet characteristically recorded that brilliant engineer 's ready assurance and prompt interest : " A bridge may be built across the Niagara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be entirely secure and in all respects fitted for railroad uses . It will be safe for the passage of locomotives and freight trains , and adapted for any purpose for which it is likely to be applied . But to be successful it must be judiciously designed , and properly put together ; there are no safer bridges than those on the suspension principle if built  | understandingly , and none more dangerous if constructed with an imperfect knowledge of the principles of their equilibrium . " Ellet did not realize the prophetic content of his reply . John Roebling had also answered eagerly and enthusiastically . An inner awareness of his powers told him that he was the man for this job , and the throbbing call of his ambition told him that this job was the indispensable next stride in his career . In agitated suspense he awaited a reply . Receiving no acknowledgment from the promoter and eager for further information , the bridgebuilder wrote again to Major Stuart at Rochester and , after waiting three more weeks for an answer , he wrote to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . Minor promptly responded : " I am glad to learn that you are moving in the matter of the Niagara Bridge and advise you to be active ? as Mr. E. is indefatigable in whatever he undertakes . You will do well to make yourself known in Rochester and at the Falls , not only through the press , but also personally . . . . Mr. E. may have got the start of you by offering to take $20,000 of Stock in the Bridge , as I have heard . . . . When Major Stuart comes here , I will have a confab with him and ascertain how the land lays . " Shortly thereafter , Roebling received a belated reply from Major Stuart : " Your letter reached here at a time when I was dangerously ill , and I am just able now to answer it . . . . A company is ready to build the bridge and are now making the necessary applications to the two governments . . . . Chs . Ellet Jr. , of Philadelphia , will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early part of next fall . . . . I hope to visit Pittsburgh this winter to see your bridges and also make your personal acquaintance . As an Engineer , I have long known your reputation , but I believe I have never had the pleasure of meeting you . . . . Excuse my miserable scrawl , as my hand trembles from weakness too much to allow of very intelligible writing . " The Major 's excuse that he had been " dangerously ill " was a transparent attempt to cover a more embarrassing reason for his long delay in responding to Roebling 's communications . Throughout the body of the letter the writing was firm , and not until the last sentence was the hand of the writer reminded to " tremble from weakness . " As the worried and anxious corre-  | spondent in Pittsburgh had surmised , his rival Ellet had already enlisted the aid and support of Major Stuart . This was later revealed , for just about the time that Roebling was vainly waiting for an answer from the Major , the following news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Charles Ellet , Jr. , an engineer of Philadelphia , has recently in company with Major C. B. Stuart , of Rochester , inspected the localities in the vicinity of Niagara Falls , with a view of ascertaining the practicability of a suspension bridge across Niagara river . . . . The cost of a hanging bridge at that point , of sufficient strength to sustain the weight of a railroad train , is estimated by Mr. Ellet at $2oo,000 . He offers to construct such a bridge for that sum , and to subscribe $20,000 to its stock . Roebling , still uncertain as to the status of the project , wrote again to Minor and Stuart . Hastily writing and posting at midnight of Sunday ? " that no time may be lost " ? Minor replied : " I am expecting Major Stuart here daily and I will then get at the whole matter . . . . You may rest assured that action , action , is necessary to have any chance for a fair fight . . . . You must not let your modesty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff ? is the order of the day , and if you do not puff , others will ; and you might as well be out of the world and out of fashion . . . . Ellet is pushing for immediate action . You see he likes to enter the field alone ? but we shall see . . . . I said to Stuart that I had a desire to write my name , in connection with his and below it of course , on the eternal rocks of Niagara ! ? a little soft soap ' is sometimes useful ; and now I desire you to tell me about the price you can do it for ? leaving a good margin . . . . Unless Ellet has got a long start we will give him a pull . " This letter included a quickly drawn pen sketch of the cross section of the Niagara gorge , with an indicated suspension span swung between two towers above the " more than perpendicular " cliffs . To find current expressions like " confab " and " soft soap " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice that " Puff ? puff ? is the order of the day " is seemingly of timeless application . All this time Roebling was almost frantic with anxiety . Unable to leave his work on the ' Monongahela Bridge , which was  | then nearing completion , he accepted Minor 's offer to make a trip to Rochester and Niagara on his behalf . He sent the editor $5o for traveling expenses , and wrote him four letters in four weeks , before he received an acknowledgment , in which Minor stated that he had not yet been able to get away from New York . During this period someone was busy supplying publicity stories to the press , in which Ellet 's name was repeatedly coupled with the spectacular enterprise of bridging Niagara . A typical article , printed in the Rochester American and other newspapers , briefly mentioned Telford 's famous chain bridge in Wales , and Seguin 's wire-cable bridge in France , and then described at length Ellet 's suspension bridge over the Schuylkill at Philadelphia . In support of the feasibility of the proposed Niagara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an engineer so competent and justly celebrated as Mr. Ellet. " 3 Some time in 1846 a corporation was chartered by the legislature of New York and by the provincial parliament of Ontario to construct an international bridge over the Niagara River , at or near the Falls . After repeated efforts during the ensuing months , enough subscriptions to the capital stock were finally secured to warrant the commencement of the work , and early in 1847 plans and estimates were invited . Roebling promptly responded , addressing his communication to Major Charles B. Stuart , Commissioner of the Niagara Bridge Company . This letter of the pioneer master builder has become a cornerstone in bridge engineering progress . It was the brave , deliberate , and confident declaration of a man who knew whereof he spoke , and who was only asking for a chance to prove his unshakable convictions : I have bestowed some time upon this subject , and have matured plans and working details . Although the question of applying the principle of suspension to railroad bridges has been disposed of in the negative by Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridge over the Menai , on the Chester and Holyhead Railway , I am bold enough to say that this celebrated Engineer has not at all succeeded in the solution of this problem . . . . It can not be  | questioned that wire cables , when well made , offer the safest and most economical means for the support of heavy weights . Any span within fifteen hundred feet can be made perfectly safe for the support of railroad trains . . . . The greater the weight to be supported , the stronger the cables must be , and as this is a matter of unerring calculation , there need be no difficulty on the score of strength . The only question which presents itself is : Can a suspension bridge be made stiff enough , as not to yield and bend under the weight of a railroad train when unequally distributed over it ; and can the great vibrations which result from the rapid motion of such trains and which prove so destructive to common bridges , be avoided and counteracted ? I answer this question in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ properly constructed , will be found hereafter the most durable and economical for railroad bridges . . . . There is not one good suspension bridge in Great Britain , nor will they ever succeed as long as they remain attached to their chains and present mode of construction . . . . The locality of the Niagara Bridge offers the very best opportunity for the application of a system of stays , which will insure all the stiffness requisite for the passage of railroad trains at a rapid rate . The plan I have devised for the structure will convince you that the rigidity will be ample . To demonstrate his confidence in the design he proposed , in his estimate of cost , and in the success of the enterprise , Roebling offered to construct the bridge on the principles he had outlined , with one railroad track , two roadway lanes for common travel , and two footwalks , for the sum of $18o,000 ; to subscribe $20,000 to the capital stock ; and to give security for the complete success of the work in all its parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any cost , he named a figure which he knew Ellet could not meet . In a letter to Roebling , Minor had confided , " I am quite inclined to believe that Stuart and E. have an understanding and mutual interest in the offer of $220,000 . " A month later Ellet submitted his proposal to Major Stuart , confirming his prior quotation of $220,000 , but offering to build a lighter and narrower bridge ? with the railway track and horse-drawn vehicles sharing the same roadway space ? for $190,000 . " When I made my estimate , " he wrote , " I had in view a work of the first order , and as I do not wish to be in any way connected with one of lower grade , I can not offer to reduce my proposition . But I will now repeat , that a secure , substantial and beautiful edifice ? a noble work of art , which  | will form a safe and sufficient connection between the great Canadian and the New York railways , and stand firm for ages , may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . With my best wishes for the success of the enterprise in all its magnificence. . . . " 4 For this , the first span to be erected over the Niagara gorge , Ellet was the successful competitor . In November , 1847 , the directors of the American and the Canadian Niagara Bridge companies made a contract with him for the construction of a combined railway and carriage bridge over the Niagara River , two miles below the Falls , for the sum of $190,000 . The bridge was to be completed by May 1 , 1849 . Ellet was high-strung and impulsive . He stopped at nothing to gain his end . His physical courage was already a legend . Above all , he was a born showman , with a brilliant flair for the spectacular . For the building of a suspension bridge , one of the primary operations is somehow to get a line or wire across the stream . The turbulent whirlpool rapids at the site made a direct crossing of the Niagara impossible . Ellet was ready to start construction early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the theatrical , the bridgebuilder enlisted the youngsters of the vicinity by offering a prize of five dollars to the first boy who would fly a kite across to the opposite bank . After many attempts through the day one youngster proudly accomplished the feat and received his reward . The successful lad 's name was Homan Walsh ; eighty years later , when he was an old man residing at Lincoln , Nebraska , his most precious memory was this exploit of his boyhood his part in starting the construction of the first span across Niagara . By means of the kitestring larger cords , and then hemp ropes , small at first but increasing in size , were drawn across , until the first small wire cable , which Ellet had prepared on shore , was pulled across and suspended over the gorge . Ever alert to the advertising value of the spectacular , Ellet promptly had himself hauled across in the first basket ride over the Niagara . On March 13 he wrote to Major Stuart :  | " Dear Sir , ? I raised my first little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada and New York . To-day ( Monday ) I tightened it up , and suspended below it an iron basket which I had caused to be prepared for the purpose , and which is attached by pulleys playing along the top of the cable . In this little machine I crossed over to Canada , exchanged salutations with our friends there , and returned again , all in fifteen minutes . The wind was high and the weather cold , but yet the trip was a very interesting one to me ? perched up as I was two hundred and forty feet above the Rapids , and viewing from the centre of the river one of the sublimest prospects which nature has prepared on this globe of ours . My little machine did not work as smoothly as I wished , but in the course of this week I will have it so adjusted that anybody may cross in safety . " Ellet thus achieved the distinction of being the first person who ever crossed the chasm alive . Following his sensational trip , others paid for the privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the suspended basket . A quartercentury later , the famous iron basket was still hanging under the railroad track near the American end of Roebling 's bridge , as a historic curiosity for sightseers . The engineer-contractor proceeded with the erection of a light suspension span , 712 feet wide , hung on wooden towers , to be used as a service bridge for transporting men and materials across the gorge . So intoxicated was Ellet with pride in his Niagara footbridge that , when it was nearly finished , he mounted his horse and rode across the swaying span , at a height of 24o feet above the rapids and before any side railings had been set up . Women fainted and strong men gasped at the sight of horse and rider moving along the swinging hair line high above the foaming whirlpool . Not until twelve years later was this daring feat surpassed ? when Blondin , the famous tightrope walker , crossed the same gorge by walking on a wire rope , pushing a wheelbarrow and carrying another man on his back . For ten months after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used as a public footbridge , and the tolls received during this time amounted to nearly $g000 , a handsome rate of return on a total cost of $30,000 . A difference soon arose between the contractor and the directors concerning the application of the tolls taken on the erection footbridge ; the ensuing  | dispute and litigation were ended by a compromise , by which Ellet relinquished his contract , and on December 27 , his connection with the work ended . With some strengthening during the first year the airy temporary structure accommodated ordinary light carriage travel , which crossed the swaying span in its single lane . With a blaze of advance publicity Ellet had started out to build a railroad suspension bridge across Niagara . When he quit the work , he had built little more than a footbridge . He had enjoyed his brief hour of glory ? of spectacular showmanship , of pyrotechnic flourish . He had the shrewd salesmanship to land the job , but he lacked the steadfastness of purpose , the singleness of ambition , to stick to the task and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great achievement in his grasp , and he threw it away for some petty immediate profit or pique . 5 The logical inheritor of this challenging opportunity to build a span that would command the attention of the world was John A. Roebling . He had been the first to proclaim the possibility of building suspension bridges to carry railroad loading and , from his pondering on the subject and from his experimental work on other spans , he had more to contribute to a real solution of the problem than any other engineer of the time . In his excited eagerness , he had submitted a proposal that was even more attractive than Ellet 's . Now the officials of the Niagara Bridge companies were sorry that they had not dealt with Roebling in the first instance . For two years the project lay dormant before the officials were stirred to renewed activity . From Saxonburg , from Lackawaxen , from Trenton , from High Falls , and from New York , the eager builder of suspension spans kept in touch with the proposition , and in his spare hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great bridge he was hungering to build . Finally the negotiations were concluded , his plans were accepted , and the thrilling opportunity was his . Freed from Ellet 's price-cutting competition , Roebling undertook the work on a new basis : a fixed salary for his engineering and supervision , the owners paying for all labor and materials .  | Thus the engineering function was properly separated from the contracting , and a more substantial construction was thereby made possible . With his string of four suspension aqueducts for the Delaware and Hudson Canal completed , and with his new wire-rope works at Trenton brought to a stage of smooth operation under a trusted superintendent , the master builder was now ready to give his undivided personal attention and energy to the building of the Niagara span . Inspired by the challenge of the task , he concentrated upon it all of the genius and engineering skill with which he was endowed . John Roebling was a man entirely different in character and temperament from his rival . It was the difference between the profound and the superficial , between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dazzling fireworks display , quickly burning itself out . Roebling 's nature was that of the ponderous granite , on which he laid the masterworks of his career . He was a slower man to rouse to any undertaking . But , once convinced that he was on the right track , his tenacity overcame all obstacles . Bridge engineers abroad regarded Roebling 's undertaking as one of amazing daring , for to them suspension construction was associated with undulating and disastrous frailty . A pioneer advocate and builder of suspension structures in England was Sir Samuel Brown ; but a whole string of his chain bridges had failed ? at Berwick , at Brighton , at Montrose , and at Durham . In 1831 the Broughton Bridge in Lancashire County , a chain bridge only two years old , crashed under a body of marching troops . And , in 185o , a wire bridge at Angers , France , collapsed under a similar load . In the face of this record , how could any sane engineer seriously propose a suspension span , made of wire and wood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trains ? It is difficult nowadays to realize the incredulity which Roebling 's proposal aroused . Engineers the world over said it could not be done . The foremost bridgebuilder in England , Robert Stephenson , of Britannia Bridge fame , who had adopted the clumsy and expensive tubular construction for his largest projects because he was convinced that a suspension bridge could not be built to carry railroad loading , said , in a letter to  | Roebling : " If your bridge succeeds , then mine have been magnificent blunders . " But the Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge proved to be a magnificent success . 6 In 1851 Roebling began his construction operations on the Niagara bridge , and for four years the work continued without interruption , even during the bitter cold of the Canadian winters . The pioneer was primarily an engineer , not a contractor , and his engineering included both planning and execution . His own eye must examine every portion of the structure as it was put together ; every step of the erection was planned by him , and closely supervised by him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . He was not an imitator , nor a duplicator ; all his great structures were essentially unique , each planned to meet the special features of the location , and each introducing new improvements in the art and new contributions to engineering progress . In contrast with Ellet 's spectacular exploits and thrills , the building of the great Niagara span by Roebling proceeded without fanfare or flourish . There were no dramatic incidents , no exciting experiences to relate . Once the man had gained the chance for which he had fought , the sole drama was in the courageous tackling of the task and in the final victory . The construction of the great span was not treated as an opportunity to display physical prowess ; the exposures of the job were taken as a matter of course . The big test , the real adventure , was that of the mind and of the spirit . Through the changing seasons , for four years , Roebling gave his concentrated attention to the building of the span , rarely leaving the site of the work for visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters to his superintendent at Trenton continued in a constant stream . He ordered various materials for the bridge to be made up by Swan , and instructed him as to the conduct of business affairs at home . Nothing in the business was too petty to escape Roebling 's attention . The bulk of the letters related to details of machinery installations at the Trenton plant , orders for wire rope , credit and collections , and other routine instructions , with only an occasional brief  | reference indicating the progress of the bridge . In July , 1852 , he wrote from Suspension Bridge , N. Y. ? the name given to the new town springing up at the American end of the span ? " Mrs. Roebling wishes me to come home . This I can not . " There had been additions to Roebling 's household . Following the death of her husband Carl Meissner , and finally keeping the hopeful promise she had made twenty years earlier , the bridgebuilder 's sister Amalia , always devotedly attached to her brother " August , " came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmly welcomed and cheerfully taken into the already crowded Roebling home at Trenton . The oldest of the six sons , Fritz Meissner , became a useful representative of the bridgebuilder on some of his enterprises . In January , 1853 , Roebling wrote from Danville , Kentucky , where he had just secured the contract to build another railroad suspension bridge ? this one over the Kentucky River , on the projected line of the Lexington and Southern Kentucky Railroad : " Today I have concluded my Contract for the building of the Kentucky Bridge ; you may therefore prepare for a heavy business as regards Wire drawing . . . . I will leave here tomorrow but shall remain several days at Lexington and Cincinnati ; from there I go to the Falls where I expect to stay about one week only , then I will go to New York by way of Worcester to examine Washburn 's wire mill . In New York I will examine C. M. Erickson 's Engine . I will be in Trenton about the middle of Febry . . . . Please read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the whole family . " In the summer of 1853 a financial depression hit the country : stocks went down , collections became difficult , construction projects were suspended , and orders were canceled . The works at Trenton felt the pinch when payment was suspended for wire ropes made for the Morris Canal inclines . In August , Roebling wrote from Pittsburgh : " Should my Credit at the Bank fall short , then open with Mrs. Roebling my safe and the iron box with the small brass key , and take out of the morocco pocket book my Certificate of Stock of $5000 of the Pennsylvania R.R. Co. and deposit it in Bank if necessary . " Back at Suspension Bridge , he wrote in October : " The progress of the Ky . Bridge is a little doubtful on account of money matters . Several lines have stopped , thousands of men  | are thrown out of employment in Ohio and wages reduced from 1.25 to 8o cs. p. day . Laborers will be very plenty next winter , and I also think Iron will be a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I shall know soon . " The gorge to be crossed by the proposed Kentucky River bridge was both wider and deeper than that at Niagara . Under Roebling 's supervision , simultaneously with the progress of the Niagara bridge , the anchorages for the Kentucky span were laid and the stone towers erected , and most of the cable wire and other material for the superstructure were delivered at the site , when suddenly the finances of the railroad company collapsed and the work was indefinitely suspended . The bridgebuilder had invested heavily in this project , as it was to be the longest span in the world and would eclipse even his Niagara crossing . For years the massive stone towers rising above the deep gorge of the Kentucky River stood like monuments in the wilderness , places of pilgrimage from the neighboring settlements . Finally , in 1876 , a high railroad viaduct ? the first cantilever bridge in America ? was built at this crossing , utilizing the towers which Roebling had built in 1854. 7 In December , 1853 , the fascinating but exacting work of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridgebuilder was unable to visit his home and family for the holidays . On December 29 he wrote : " I should like to be at home just now , but must wait , until a whole operation of strand making is gone through . My machinery here works very well and hands are getting practised ; the whole operation is very interesting and creates much interest . " The next day he wrote again , " We are in spite of the cold &; stormy weather getting along so rapidly , that I believe the two first Strands will be completed in three days and that by end of next week the two next Strands will be commenced . " One of the strangest letters ever written ? affording a tragic revelation of a man so intensely absorbed in his work that he has almost forgotten his family and his home ? was addressed to Swan from Niagara Falls on January 6 , 1854 : " Your letters of the 2nd and 3rd came to hand . You say in your last , that  | Mrs. Roebling &; the child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having been informed at all of the delivery of Mrs. R. Or what do you mean ? Please answer by return of mail . " I myself was a little doubtful about the sufficiency of a 3 inch Shaft ? must try it now . . . . You may also enclose copies of Mr. Cower 's or other important letters ; let Washington copy . . . . If possible try that flat bar of Habricht 's and enclose your report care of Fritz Meissner . " John A. Roebling , master builder , was so engrossed in his work that he was surprised to learn of a recent addition to his family ! On January I , his fourth son , Edmund , had been born ? and the absent-minded father learned of it later only from a casual reference in a business letter from his factory superintendent . 8 On May 17 , 1854 , a news flash by telegraph announced a great suspension-bridge catastrophe . Ellet 's bridge over the Ohio at Wheeling had collapsed ! In a letter to Swan on May 20 Roebling , busily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon receipt of this news : " A telegraphic dispatch from Wheeling states that the Wheeling Suspension bridge broke down on the 17th ; the particulars I have not learned . This bridge was not safe against heavy storms . " On the 18th we had a very severe squall here , which I feared would break down the old footbridge , but it stood the whirl well . I am anxious however to secure the new floor well by Stays . I have no rope on hand to do it with . I can get along with 2000 ft. ; but as soon as practicable , send on more . " On May 21 the news was confirmed . Roebling wrote : " The destruction of the Wheeling Bridge is a fact . . . . I wrote to you to send me 2000 ft. more of rope 7 x 7 No. 9 , 3 lbs . pr . ft. , for Stays . Do not neglect this . I must have this rope very soon to render the new floor safe . If possible send more as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire , for this rope , you have on hand ; if it is a little larger , does not matter . " In 1847 a company had been formed to build a toll span over the Ohio River at Wheeling . Ellet and Roebling , both described in the local press as " young engineers of ability , " submitted  | bids for the construction of the bridge . Ellet advocated a single , long span of 1,010 feet from bank to bank ; and Roebling , in view of the narrow width of the structure , urged a central span not to exceed 600 feet , flanked by side spans and stiffened by inclined stays . The decision was left to the local board of directors , a group of businessmen who knew little or nothing about bridge design . A vote was taken , with the result that Ellet 's plan was approved and he was given the job . The span was light and narrow for its length , carrying only a seventeen-foot wagon way and a 312-foot sidewalk . Most important of all , the span @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wheeling Suspension Bridge ? his greatest work and , at the time , the longest span in the world . Five years later , that proud record-breaking structure was destroyed by the wind . Technical publications recorded the disaster merely as another bridge wrecked by a storm , and the lesson was lost to the profession . We find the complete story of the disaster , however , in an eyewitness account by a reporter , printed the following day in the Wheeling Intelligencer and reprinted four days later in the New York Times ? it took four days then for a news story to reach New York . A remarkable anticipatory parallel to the 1940 Tacoma Narrows bridge catastrophe is revealed by the following excerpts from the original newspaper account : With feelings of unutterable sorrow , we announce that the noble and world-renowned structure , the Wheeling Suspension Bridge , has been swept from its strongholds by a terrific storm , and now lies a mass of ruins . Yesterday morning thousands beheld this stupendous structure , a mighty pathway spanning the beautiful waters of the Ohio , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the enterprise of our citizens . Now , nothing remains of it but the dismantled towers looming above the sorrowful wreck that lies beneath them . About 3 o'clock yesterday we walked toward the Suspension Bridge and went upon it , as we have frequently done , enjoying the cool breeze and the undulating motion of the bridge . . . . We had been off the flooring only two minutes , and were on Main street when we saw persons running toward the river bank ; we followed just in time to see the whole structure heaving and dashing with tremendous force . For a few moments we watched it with breathless anxiety , lunging  | like a ship in a storm ; at one time it rose to nearly the height of the tower , then fell , and twisted and writhed , and was dashed almost bottom upward . At last there seemed to be a determined twist along the entire span , about one half of the flooring being nearly reversed , and down went the immense structure from its dizzy height to the stream below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mechanical solution of the unexpected fall of this stupendous structure , we must await further developments . We witnessed the terrific scene . The great body of the flooring and the suspenders , forming something like a basket swung between the towers , was swayed to and fro like the motion of a pendulum . Each vibration giving it increased momentum , the cables , which sustained the whole structure , were unable to resist a force operating on them in so many different directions , and were literally twisted and wrenched from their fastenings . . . . We believe the enterprise and public spirit of our citizens will repair the loss as speedily as any community could possibly do . It is a source of gratulation that no lives were lost by the disaster . The newspaper man who wrote the foregoing dramatic account unknowingly summarized the crux of the aerodynamic phenomenon he had observed when he used the significant phrase : " Each vibration giving it increased momentum . " And when he stated that the mechanical solution of the failure " must await further developments , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridgebuilders were not thinking in terms of aerodynamics , and the profession had to wait nearly a hundred years for the further developments that finally gave them an understanding and mastery of the problem . The only engineer of the time who grasped the full significance of the Wheeling bridge disaster was John Roebling . With intuitive genius , a century ahead of his time , he realized the need of bracing and stiffening suspension spans against cumulative undulations that may be started by the action of the wind . From his very first bridge , the Monongahela , he provided his spans with ample stiffening and with inclined stays . These were incorporated from the start , in 185o , in his design for the Niagara bridge ; and immediately upon receipt of word of the Wheeling failure , Roebling rushed an order to Trenton for additional wire rope to supplement his system of bracing on the Niagara span by adding inclined stays below the floor of the  | bridge to resist wind uplift . The Wheeling catastrophe ended Ellet 's spectacular but brief bridgebuilding career , but it gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It confirmed the practical soundness of his original and prophetic thinking on the subject of the security and stability of suspension bridges . During the disastrous gale in 1854 the Wheeling span had overturned , the south group of cables was wrenched and broken , and the whole structure , except the north cables , was blown into the Ohio ? a wrecked and twisted mass of wire and timber . Six years later the bridge was rebuilt by Roebling , at a cost of $42,000 . Since then the Wheeling bridge , in its stronger reincarnation , has been performing valiant service . During the Civil War the newly rebuilt span was used extensively for the movement of troops . Half a century later the bridge was used for truck transport trains during the First World War , and then again , three decades later , in the Second World War . Today , eighty-five years after its reconstruction by Roebling , it is a heavily traversed bridge , often loaded with autos and trucks from end to end . It is now the oldest existing suspension bridge in America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches and covered timber bridges , it is the oldest existing span of any type in the New World . 9 In June , 1854 , the cables and suspenders for the Niagara span had been erected and Roebling recorded the start of work on hanging the roadway beams , high above the whirling rapids : " We commenced suspending beams last Saturday &; will finish today ? all done in three days . I have the satisfaction of seeing my Suspenders come out perfectly correct , so much so , that it will be hardly necessary to touch a Screw . " Elated at the successful completion of the most critical phases of the construction , the builder , in a letter two days later , told how well all of the parts were going together as the erection entered its final stages : " My Bridge is the admiration of everybody ; the directors are delighted . The woodwork goes together in the best manner . The suspenders require scarcely any adjustment at all . "  | While construction of the bridge was proceeding in July , an epidemic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading plague , especially virulent in the narrow flats on both banks of the Niagara River , found many victims among the bridge workers . Patients went into a collapse immediately after being attacked , and many succumbed within a few hours . Over sixty persons ? men , women , and children ? died during the first week . A panic seized the inhabitants . The doctors were helpless , few nurses could be found , and many of the stricken unfortunates were abandoned in terror and left to their fate . The medical science of the time seemed powerless to stop the raging epidemic or to help the victims . All forms of treatment were tried , from allopathy to homeopathy , but all alike failed . Roebling did his best to minister to the bridge employees . Since conventional medical treatment had proved futile , he tried his own favorite remedy for all ills , hydropathy . He was a great admirer and personal friend of Priessnitz , the leading German specialist on the subject ? fully believing in his theory . When the plague was at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subjected to hydropathic treatment , but they all died before night . He persisted , and in the succeeding days he was rewarded with some apparent cures ? two of his patients somehow recovered . Roebling offered two stout Germans $200 to go and set fire to a house in which the plague had broken out in a very malignant form . They went , and both caught the contagion , of which they died . The bridgebuilder himself , in his battle against the Niagara epidemic , was constantly exposed to the infection . He determined not to have it . At one time he walked his room all night , fighting with his will power against symptoms which threatened to make him a victim . A man who later related the incident said it was the most striking exhibition of the power of mind over disease that he had ever witnessed . In a letter written July 29 , Roebling reported the waning of the epidemic and told of his treatment : " There are no more new cases of sickness . I have saved two by water treatment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctors had bad luck . . . . Keep off fear ? this is the great secret . Whoever is afraid of cholera will be attacked , and no treatment can save him . . . . Should  | the cholera appear in Trenton , keep up your courage and do not fear , and the disease should not attack you . Best not to think of it at all . " However strange Roebling 's philosophy of physical remedies and preventive treatments may seem to us , his personal application of that philosophy provides a superlative illustration of the power of the mind in combating the ills of the body , particularly when the mental armor takes the form of an iron will . On his ocean voyage to America in 1831 the pioneer , determined not to be seasick , had more than once walked the deck all night in his unyielding fight to ward off an attack . On August 2 , 1854 , the bridgebuilder recorded the end of the epidemic : " No more cholera cases here ; all well , myself included ; say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work . . . . " 10 During Roebling 's absorption in his work at Niagara , the wire business at Trenton had some hard sledding , with the financial depression and the consequent shrinkage of orders , collections , and funds . The bridge contract was a lifesaver during this period . In September Roebling wrote from Suspension Bridge : " The Co. has paid me $17,000 already on Wire , Rope , &; Salary ; all this is gone into the Trenton business , in the shape of drafts and Cash , which I brought home on various occasions . My balance sheet of the Trenton business next New Year will be no brag , but very little if any over minus . It would show a loss perhaps without the bridge orders , which have greatly helped , and which have been very promptly paid . " The following month the bridgebuilder recorded an unfortunate accident on the work . His principal carpenter , Mr. Kenzie , was working on the Cascades side , removing the wooden towers that Ellet had built , when suddenly one of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the carpenter across the face . " His recovery will take time and is doubtful under the bad medical treatment which he has , " Roebling noted . " I am now in a bad fix , and am compelled to complete the work without him . " Late in the fall of 1854 more financial difficulties loomed on the horizon . Word reached Roebling that Peter Cooper 's busi-  | ness ? the Trenton Iron Company ? was forced to close down , and that the local banks were threatened . The bridgebuilder wrote to his superintendent at Trenton : " You had better draw out to within a few $Ioo and keep the Notes in the Safe , and if there is danger , send Philip or Bernhard at various times to draw out gold for their bills . But I do not see that those Banks can be much in trouble unless it was on account of their connection with the Trenton Iron Co . . . . Next winter will be a very hard one for great numbers of laboring men , on account of scarcity of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philadelphia Banks are , I believe , considered safe and in good condition . . . . My Assistant in Ky. has a good deal of trouble in raising money , but he is managing remarkably well ; he is about completing the masonry . . . . Keep me well informed , and keep a good lookout for breakers among our customers , particularly the small and suspicious Coal concerns . These may soon meet with tighter times , at least those who have no capital . " The country weathered the financial storm , and in January , 1855 , the uncompleted Niagara span successfully weathered a physical storm . Roebling wrote from Suspension Bridge : " We had a tremendous gale for the last 12 hours ; my bridge did n't move a muscle . I expect an order of 2000 to 3000 ft. 7 x 7 No. 9 for Stays for the Lewiston Susp . Bridge , which needs guying badly . " The reference to the Lewiston Suspension Bridge related to a light highway span built over the Niagara River between Lewiston and Queenston in 1851 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had replied favorably to Major Stuart 's original canvass concerning the feasibility of a railroad suspension bridge . Constructed without the benefit of Roebling 's intuitive ? or deeply rational ? understanding of the need of bracing , Serrell 's span proved shaky in the January gale and had to be promptly equipped with wire-rope guys to make it safe . In the spring of 1855 Roebling decided to build a new home for his family at Trenton , and this time it was to be of brick . The first modest frame dwelling was crowded far beyond its capacity , with eight or nine Roeblings , seven Meissners , and some ten workmen quartered there , filling every corner of the  | single story and attic . Early in March the bridgebuilder communicated his instructions to his faithful factotum : " I shall want about 290,000 brick for the new house . I wish you to look around and to make a conditional bargain and write to me . . . . You can also enquire about lime and sand , and masons to build the cellar walls and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long job of it , but to get all under roof this season . " This new home must have been for its owner a symbol of success ; two months later , in his final official report on the Niagara span , he found a way of casually mentioning " my brick dwelling at Trenton . " Even after completing the epoch-making Niagara span , following his building of six prior notable structures , and after five years of operation of the Trenton plant , Roebling was still in restricted financial circumstances . A picture of the modest and crowded living conditions of the time is disclosed in a letter from the bridgebuilder to Swan , written in April , 1855 : " I think it would be well that you should board Mr. Bulkley . He can sleep for the present in the bathroom , and I confine myself with the other little room , until the new house is finished , then he can get a room in my house . If you do not like to board him , perhaps I will board him myself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and certainly better for the interest of the business , to keep him near the mill . If he and you are satisfied with this arrangement , Mrs. Roebling can furnish the bedding and keep his room in order . " Although funds were scarce , Roebling was mindful of the personal needs of his employees and tried to help them . He communicated his wishes to Swan : " Fritz Buttendorf wrote to me and enquires if I would not advance him $Ioo or guarantee the purchase of $loo of furniture to furnish his home . He wants to marry now and has got no money to do it with . I think it will be safe to trust him . I therefore request you to offer him either the cash in advance or my credit . " II In March , 1855 , the Niagara bridge was completed . History had been made . John A. Roebling had built the first successful railway suspension bridge in the world . Many engineers in both  | hemispheres had challenged the feasibility of the proposed span , and its failure had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first train passed over the completed structure ? the first train in history to cross a bridge suspended from wire cables . And to the amazement of the public the span did not collapse . In another sense bridge-engineering history had been made . The Niagara span was the first suspension bridge ever built with stiffening trusses . This was a major contribution to bridge engineering ? the first radical improvement in the suspensionbridge art in two thousand years . From the most primitive swinging spans of twisted vines and fibers , there had of course been successive improvements in materials and in details of construction , but the full potentialities of the suspension type could not be realized as long as it continued to be represented by swaying , undulating structures . As Roebling expressed it : " Suspension bridges have generally been looked upon as loose fabrics hung up in the air , as if for the very purpose of swinging . Repeated failures of such works have strengthened this belief . " Even in his earliest spans , the master builder grasped the fundamental importance of stiffened construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " as rigid as stone or cast iron aqueducts " demonstrated the truth of his thesis that cable spans could be built as stiff as desired . In those canal structures , his solidly braced flumes supplied the stiffening element . In his first highway structure , the Monongahela bridge , he made the outside railings or " parapets " in the form of latticed trusses , which served to some extent as stiffening elements for the suspended spans ? forerunners of real stiffening trusses . But it was in the Niagara bridge that this new concept received its first full expression ? the first use of stiffening trusses in all the history of bridgebuilding . Filling the vertical height between the upper and lower decks of the span , this trussed bracing was eighteen feet deep . The amazing success of this radical innovation established it thereafter as a recognized essential feature in the design of suspension bridges . During the week preceding the formal opening Roebling had tested the rigidity of the bridge by running locomotives of various weights over the span and measuring the deflections.  | The results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The opening of the bridge to traffic was described by the builder in a letter : " Last Sunday I opened the Bridge for the regular passage of trains . The first one was the heaviest freight train that will ever pass , and was made up on purpose to test the bridge . With an Engine of 28 tons we pushed over from Canada to New York twenty double loaded freight cars , making a gross weight of 368 Tons ; this train very nearly covered the whole length of floor between the towers . . . . No vibrations whatever . Less noise and movement than in a common truss bridge . . . . Yesterday the first Passenger train from the East with three cars , crowded inside &; on top , went over in fine style . Altogether we passed about twenty trains across within the last 24 hours . No one is afraid to cross . The passage of trains is a great sight , worth seeing it . " At the end of the letter , the proud bridgebuilder added : " Please communicate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing to her . " 12 On May I , 1855 , Roebling presented to his clients , the directors of the Niagara Falls Suspension Bridge Company and the Niagara Falls International Bridge Company , his final report on the work . This document has become a classic in engineering literature . It was a masterly summary of the concepts underlying the success of a courageous and epochal undertaking , the world 's first successful railroad suspension span : It gives me great pleasure to be enabled to report the Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge complete in all its parts . The success of this work may now be considered an established fact . The trains of the New York Central , and of the Great Western Railroad in Canada , have been crossing regularly since the 18th of March , averaging over thirty trips per day . One single observation of the passage of a train over the Niagara Bridge will convince the most sceptical , that the practicability of Suspended Railway Bridges , so much doubted heretofore , has been successfully demonstrated . The work which you did me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than $400,000 . The same object accomplished in Europe  | would have cost four millions without serving a better purpose , or insuring greater safety . . . . Sitting upon a saddle on top of one of the towers of the Niagara Bridge during the passage of a train , I feel less vibration than I do in my brick dwelling at Trenton during the passage of an Express Train over the New Jersey R.R. , which passes my door within a distance of two hundred feet . Professional and public opinion , having been adverse to Suspended Railway Bridges , the question now turns up : What means have been used in the Niagara Bridge , to make it answer for Railway traffic ? The means employed are Weight , Girders , Trusses and Stays . With these any degree of stiffness can be insured , to resist either the action of trains , or the violence of storms , or even hurricanes . And I will here observe , that no Suspension Bridge is safe without some of these appliances . The catalogue of disastrous failures is now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be blown down , as it were , in defiance of the elements . A number of such fairy creations are still hovering about the country , only waiting for a rough blow to be demolished . Without adding much to the weight of the structure , a surprising . degree of stiffness has been obtained by the united action of the girders and trusses . They have fully realized my expectations . The pressure of an Engine and of a whole train of cars is so much distributed , that the depression caused is not readily observed . . . . The next means of stiffness I have applied are wire-rope stays , above as well as below the floors . . . . Their principal duty is to guard against the forces of winds , but at the same time they contribute materially to preserve the equilibrium of the structure during the passage of trains . Bridges of half a mile span , for common or Railway travel , may be built , using iron for the cables , with entire safety . But by substituting the best quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and afford the same degree of security . In the last two sentences the master builder showed a keen anticipation of future developments . His bold prognostication of the feasibility of longer spans has already been largely fulfilled ? with the Golden Gate span of 4,2oo feet accomplished in 1937 and still greater spans projected . The Niagara bridge carried the railroad track on the upper deck and the highway below . This double-deck span , 821 feet long and weighing a thousand tons , was suspended from four ten-inch cables of wrought iron wire . The arrangement of the  | cables was unique , two of them being connected by wire-rope suspenders directly to the upper deck of the bridge and the other two similarly to the lower deck . The greater part of the wire for the cables was manufactured in England . This was supplemented by the wire removed from the cables of Ellet 's temporary span , erected in 1848 and taken down in 1854 . Conviction of rightness and pride of workmanship were apparent in Roebling 's discussion of the results of his method of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only pleasing , but their massive proportions are also well calculated to inspire confidence in their strength . The reflecting man however will naturally inquire : Is this mass of wire put together so that the different strands bear all alike ? Does each individual wire perform its duty , so that when exposed to a great strain , they will resist with united strength to the last ? I can answer this question in the affirmative , and can assure you that the tension of these 364o wires , composing each cable , is so nearly uniform that I feel justified in using the term perfect . " And then , in justification of his assurance , the builder described in detail the construction of the cables : the preliminary oiling , straightening , splicing , and reeling of the wire ; the perfected procedure , with his patented machinery , for stringing the fifteen thousand wires across the gorge ; the careful adjustment of every wire for identical sag and consequent uniform tension ; the grouping and anchorage of the wires to form twenty-eight strands ; the consolidating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cables ; and the final application , by the use of his patented wrapping machine , of a tight , continuous wire wrapping around each finished cable . The bridgebuilder knew that the cables he had built would defy time and load : " What I consider of most importance to the durability of the cables , " he said , " is the fact that their strength is nearly six times as great as their ordinary working tension , and equally important is the fact that their strength will never be impaired by vibration . " The Wheeling bridge disaster , occurring only a year before the opening of the Niagara span , naturally left many questions in the public mind . Most engineers were mystified , and bridgeowners were deeply concerned . Were all cable bridges equally subject to sudden destruction by the wind ? Was the great new  | span over Niagara liable to be overtaken by the same untimely fate ? What defects of design made the Wheeling bridge so peculiarly vulnerable ? What were the safeguards in the Niagara design to prevent a duplication of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report to his clients Roebling felt it his duty to address himself to these questions in order to clarify the mystery and set all doubts at rest . His lucid exposition of the action of the wind in building up dangerous undulations in an unstiffened span showed his unique grasp of the problem . Containing , as it did , reasoning and conclusions that engineers of a later century tragically failed to perceive , Roebling 's analysis of the problem was , in itself , proof of his genius as a master builder : The destruction of the Wheeling bridge by a high wind on the 17th of May last year , the greatest disaster of the kind on record , has naturally given rise to doubts as to the safety of suspension bridges generally . . . . Although I would much prefer to leave this subject alone , I can not conscientiously do so . It is my duty to establish the safety of the Niagara Bridge , which has already , and in the brief space of one month , become one of the greatest thoroughfares on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comparison with other works , and without pointing out the defects which caused the destruction of the Wheeling bridge , and on the other hand explaining the means of safety which have been employed in the Niagara Bridge . The Wheeling bridge formed a span of Toro feet from centre to centre of towers ; its weight , including cables was about 440 tons . The number of cables was 12 . . . . There was no provision in the whole structure which could have had an effect in checking vibrations . . . . A competent eyewitness stated that the waves of the floor , caused by the wind , rose to a height of over 20 feet . This may have been an exaggeration , but no ordinary strength of cables can resist the momentum produced by such a weight falling even i 5 feet . . . . Weight is a most essential condition , provided it is properly used in connection with other means . If relied upon alone , as was the case in the plan of the Wheeling bridge , it may become the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the momentum acquired by its own dead weight , when swayed up and down by the force of the wind . . . . A high wind , acting upon a suspended floor devoid of inherent stiffness , will produce a series of undulations . . . . These undulations will increase by their own effect until , by a steady wind , a momentum may be produded that may prove stronger than  | the cables . . . . Weight should be simply an attending element to a still more important condition , viz : stiffness . The destruction of the Wheeling bridge was clearly owing to a want of stability , and not to a want of strength . This want of stiffness could have been supplied by over floor stays , truss railings , under-floor stays , or cable stays . . . . In the Niagara span most ample provisions for stability have been made . The superstructure , forming a hollow box or beam , twenty-four feet wide by twenty feet deep , with solid girders of five feet depth , and effective trusses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gale . There are 64 diagonal stays of I%-inch diameter rope , above the floors , equally distributed among the four cables . To be prepared , however , for the greatest emergency , there are 56 wire rope stays or guys attached to the lower floor , which are firmly anchored to the solid rock of the cliffs . Each of these ropes has an ultimate strength of 3o tons . Not the slightest motion from high winds was ever noticed . The work has been frequently tested by the strongest gales that blow in this vicinity . I am also convinced that it will be proof against a hurricane . The report of the master builder to the owners of the bridge concluded with an eloquent and fitting expression of appreciation of the faith and trust they had reposed in him : In reporting to you the final and successful completion of the bridge , I would be doing injustice to my own feelings as a man , if I did not avail myself of this opportunity , to thank you publicly for the unwavering confidence which you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged talent and reputation freely expressed their doubts as to the success of this work , a wavering of confidence on your part would have been but natural . But I am happy to state here , that in all my operations I have always met with a cordial support . It is a great satisfaction to me that this work has turned out equal to my promise , and also to know that , on taking leave of you , the mutual confidence that exists will not undergo any change . Respectfully submitting the above , I remain Gentlemen , Your obedient servant , JOHN A. ROEBLING . The bridgebuilder also prepared , for the profession , a " Memoir of the Niagara Falls Suspension and International Bridge . " Illustrated with his own drawings , it was published in  | 1856 in London in a volume entitled Papers and Practical Illustrations of Public Works of Recent Construction , Both British and flmerican . In this scientific report Roebling referred to the earlier discussions in England that had led to the adoption of the tubular plan for crossing the Menai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsuitable for railroad bridges . He admitted that a suspension span will deflect under load ; but so will all other bridge types . It was simply a matter of degree , and this was subject to control ? a fact not previously realized . With keen insight he posed the basic question : How rigid do spans need to be made ? ? a question that has not yet been fully answered . And he proclaimed and proved a principle unknown to his predecessors and unrealized by most of his successors ? namely , that suspension bridges can be built of any desired degree of rigidity . As Robert Stephenson had generously offered to concede , the success of the Niagara span proved that the earlier choice of the heavy and costly tubular type for the British structures had been a mistake . Thereafter that form of bridge construction was abandoned . True , new span types were subsequently developed ? the cantilever truss and the continuous truss held sway from 188o to 1920 ? but finally the suspension form came into its own , and became the dominant type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the foundations laid by Roebling 's genius and prevision the monumental achievements of a later century were reared . In the Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge , Roebling made an outstanding and enduring contribution to the fundamental principles of suspension-bridge design . He taught the profession the importance of stiffening suspension spans , and he showed the world the effectiveness of such stiffening . His predecessors and his rivals had failed because they did not realize the importance of this feature and had omitted it in their structures . The necessity of providing an adequate stiffening system was a - new concept to the profession . For nearly a century thereafter this basic idea was recognized and governed suspension-bridge design , producing structures of a new order of stability and longevity until , in the swing of the pendulum , engineers began to forget or to discount the principle that Roebling 's genius had evolved and demonstrated . With more mathematics than the  | pioneer master builder had available in his time , but with less native intuition and constructive perception , a later generation of designers carried the reversed trend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of catastrophe ? the destruction of the Tacoma Narrows span , by aerodynamic oscillations , in a mild gale , in 1940 . In the Niagara achievement , guided by insight , intuition , and genius , and profiting by his own earlier successes and by the disastrous experiences of his contemporaries , Roebling developed and introduced features of suspension-bridge design that assured strength , rigidity , and stability , not only against the useful loads to be carried but also against the potentially destructive forces of wind and storm . The pioneer gave these principles to the profession ? in his published account of the work and in his printed reports ? but the profession forgot his teachings , only to rediscover them three generations later at great cost . 13 The location of the bridge was in a superlatively picturesque setting . With its shapely stone towers rising from the high cliffs of the Niagara gorge , and with the long graceful sweep of its cables , the span seemed almost a natural part of the scenery . The thundering Falls in the distance and the Whirlpool Rapids beneath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge itself . The Prince of Wales , during his American tour in 186o , made a special point of visiting Roebling 's bridge . He had his train stopped on the span while he walked over the famous structure , examining its construction . It had become the most talkedabout bridge in the world . Other royal visitors and distinguished personages from all parts of the globe were attracted by the fame of the span and had to see it with their own eyes . In the same year the eminent English railway and bridge engineer , Peter W. Barlow , C.E. , F.R.S. , F.G.S. , visited America , in order to see for himself the notable bridge that Roebling had built . On his return to London , Barlow published an enthusiastic account in book form under the title , Observations on the Niagara Railway Suspension Bridge , Made During a Recent Tour in zimerica . He recorded his conviction that , when  | the Britannia tubular bridge was under construction , the suspension principle had been prematurely condemned ; and then he paid tribute to Roebling 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge economically , efficiently , and safely , to carry the heaviest loadings . In his discussion he compared Roebling 's span with the famous Britannia Bridge built by Stephenson . The comparison between the two bridges was striking . The one represented the proudest achievement of the foremost bridgebuilder in England ; the other was the work of a hitherto unknown engineer in America . There were the two contrasting solutions of the problem of spanning wide gaps to carry railroad traffic . Robert Stephenson , with comparatively unlimited resources at his disposal , had built the longest-span railroad bridge in Great Britain ; but his span length was only 46o feet , and he required 3,000 tons of iron girders to carry the load in each span . John Roebling , with his wire cables , to which he gave longitudinal stiffening by means of timber trussing ? because he could not afford iron trusses ? had bridged a gap of 821 feet in a single span ! Moreover the Niagara bridge had to carry the heavier loading . With a span length approaching double that of the Britannia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained , the genius of Roebling had produced a rigid railroad span while using only about one-fourth as much material . After discussing his actual observations of the rigidity of the Niagara span under heavy loading and his calculations of the efficiency of the design of that bridge compared with other railway structures , Barlow presented his conclusion : " The preceding investigation leads to the inevitable conclusion , viz. , that the Niagara Bridge is the safest and most durable railway bridge of large span which has been constructed . " Another prominent English engineer , John Provis , had published a paper in the Transactions of the Institute of Civil Engineers in which he described the effects of wind on the most famous suspension bridge in Great Britain , Telford 's Menai Straits Bridge . In 1839 the thirteen-year-old Menai bridge had been seriously injured by a gale . " This injurious action of the wind , " said Provis , " arises from the undulation of the platform . " He repaired Telford 's span and corrected the weakness by stiffening the suspended roadway . In a previous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wave in the span , as observed by the bridgekeeper , was sixteen feet . This subjected the bridge , in each undulation , to the shock of its weight of four hundred tons falling sixteen feet . To the British engineer the rigidity of Roebling 's span at Niagara was amazing . Three years after the bridge was opened to traffic , Buffalo papers expressed an apprehension ? evidently emanating from some rival engineers ? that the wires in the cables would " crystallize " under the vibrations of passing trains and that the bridge would fall down . Roebling , with the assistance of his son Washington , thereupon made an exhaustive series of experiments on the subject of " crystallization " of iron under all conditions of strain and temperature . He refuted the whole fallacious theory in a pamphlet published at the time . In 186o Roebling inspected the Niagara bridge and wrote , for the owners , a report on the excellent condition of the structure after five years of service . After discussing train speeds , deflections , strength and rigidity of the structure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he stated in conclusion : " I will close this report by repeating , once more , that the cables of the Niagara Bridge are made of a superior quality of material ; that they are free from vibration ; that they are well preserved ; and consequently that they may safely be trusted for a long series of years . " Roebling 's Niagara span was the only railroad suspension bridge in the world to stand the test of time . Five years later , a smaller railroad span , suspended from wrought-iron chains , was built in Vienna ; but it proved to be much too light and showed many defects , with progressive weakening and consequent increase in deflections under load , so that it had to be taken down . Following its completion in 1855 , Roebling 's bridge carried the progressively increasing weights of trains and locomotives for more than four decades . After twenty-six years of service and revenue , the wooden suspended structure ? which Roebling had been constrained to use by the original limitation of funds ? was replaced by iron and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was found that the saddle rollers at the tops of the towers lacked the necessary freedom of motion and that the resulting strains had affected the stonework . A most interesting  | and successful feat was performed in the substitution of iron towers for the masonry towers , without interrupting traffic across the bridge . After this operation ? which Roebling would have enjoyed planning and executing had he lived ? the bridge continued in excellent service condition . Occasionally , in the succeeding years , chord members of the new metallic stiffening truss broke under the ever-growing locomotive loads , but the trains were permitted to travel uninterruptedly over the structure ? with the truss members fractured ? pending and during the repair operations . No other type of bridge would have remained standing under those conditions . Finally , in 1897 , a combination of circumstances made it expedient to retire the veteran structure after its long record of distinguished service . Three considerations governed this decision . The actual sizes and weights of locomotives and trains had increased far beyond anything imagined in the early period when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tonnage capacity and locomotives had quadrupled in weight . In consequence the bridge in its later years was actually loaded to three times the capacity for which it was designed . As the second impelling consideration the tremendous increase that had taken place in the volume of rail traffic between the United States and Canada made it imperative to have a twotrack bridge , whereas in Roebling 's time the single track he was commissioned to provide was ample . The final consideration was that new developments in the immediate locality made it necessary to provide , in addition to highway and railroad facilities , for an electric trolley line ? a totally unexpected item in the march of progress since Roebling 's day . So in 1897 the world-famous span which Roebling had built to carry the railroad trains and highway traffic of his day over the Niagara gorge was finally taken down , to be replaced by a wider and heavier structure to accommodate the new demands of more modern transportation facilities and loads . The town adjoining the crossing retains its historic name of Suspension Bridge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wire cables constructed by Roebling were found to be as sound and strong as when they were originally erected . The service and strain of forty-two years had not impaired them . After sustaining the  | burden of carrying some two million locomotives and trains across the gorge , the wire had retained all its elasticity and even coiled back into the original ring form in which it had been drawn , proving that it had never been overstrained ; and although it was ungalvanized , its original protection had proved effective . In the possession of the writer is a section of the original cable of Roebling 's Niagara span ; and , despite its age since its erection in 1853 , it is remarkably free from any rust , and retains to this day the original sprixgy curvature of the wires . 14 Shortly before Roebling was engaged to build a span over Niagara , Edward W. Serrell landed his opportunity . He secured the commission to construct a highway suspension bridge across the Niagara River between Lewiston , New York , and Queenston , Ontario , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light structure was quickly completed , at a cost of only $50,000 , and in March , 1851 , it was opened to traffic . The span was 1,043 feet long , and it was suspended from ten small cables , each containing only 250 wires . This type of construction , following the French system , was not conducive to enduring stability . In January , 1855 , Serrell 's span was severely shaken in a gale that visited the locality . Roebling , who was then completing his own bridge near by , came to the rescue by promptly supplying a system of wire-rope guys , which the span sorely needed to make it safe . He installed these hold-down guys under the floor of the bridge , anchoring them to the shores on either side . These rope stays served to hold the span against uplift by the strong winds sweeping up the gorge . Early in 1864 a great ice jam piled up about the rocks to which the guys were fastened ; and , in order that the ice should not damage them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that followed , the bridge attendants overlooked the loose guys and failed to refasten them . On April 16 a high wind came up , and the unsecured bridge fell an easy prey to its force . The gale broke the roadway , severed the suspenders , and left the cables dangling uselessly in the air . For thirty-four years the damaged cables were left hanging there , with no  | attempt to rebuild the span . There hung the cables as the sole remains of the wreck , a silent reminder of nature 's power and man 's forgetfulness . The amazing and dramatic developments in bridge construction in America were being followed with the keenest interest by the engineering profession on the other side of the ocean . The new span lengths tackled represented a boldness beyond precedent . The failures simply paralleled familiar experiences with smaller structures in England and on the Continent . But the successes , especially the outstanding achievement of Roebling , made the engineers abroad blink their eyes and readjust their earlier prejudices and judgments . Henceforth the suspension principle must command respect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the type , but only to the examples unscientifically designed or improperly constructed . 15 The success of Roebling 's railway suspension bridge over the Niagara rapids created a demand for a bridge two miles farther upstream , close to the Falls , where the scenic attraction was even more impelling . The promoter and builder was Samuel Keefer , a civil engineer of Ottawa ? the fourth and last of the engineers who had testified to the feasibility of Major Stuart 's proposal in 1845 . After much opposition a charter was obtained , and in the winter of 1867 ? 68 a rope was carried across the river on the natural ice bridge at the site of the proposed span ; thus physical connection was made between the cliffs at this point for the first " Honeymoon Bridge " ? a crossing that was to be the scene of many dramatic incidents in bridge construction and bridge destruction . The span was completed and opened to the public on January 2 , 1869 . It was a wooden structure suspended from cables of iron wire , with the record-breaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten feet wide , and carriages were unable to pass one another on the span . This led to long waits at either end ; lines of carriages in caravan formation moved in one direction across the bridge , while many others were waiting at the opposite end for the line to pass before they could have the right of way . Those were the days when the Niagara  | hackmen were in their prosperous prime , and the electric trolley had not yet been introduced . The bridge was profitable . In 1872 , only three years after its completion , the span was rebuilt , with steel replacing wood in the stiffening chords ; and in 1884 the wooden towers , in which sight-seeing elevators were operated on the Canadian side , gave way to towers of steel . In October , 1887 , the work of widening the bridge was begun , and it was completed the following June , with new steel cables , new anchorages , and a virtually new steel structure from bank to bank . The reconstructed span was the admiration of all who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was doomed to an untimely fate . On the night of January 9 , 1889 , the Niagara was visited by a terrific hurricane , and when daylight came in the morning not a single inch of the suspended structure remained . The span had been torn away from the cliffs as though cut out by a giant knife , and the entire crumpled mass of steel and wire lay bottom up in the gorge below . On the slopes of the bank on each side of the river the ends of the fallen mass were visible , while beneath the deep , turbulent waters of the river the greater portion of the wreck was hidden ; and there it remains to this day . While the public mourned the loss of the bridge , the controlling companies were equal to the occasion , and at once ordered the span to be duplicated . The rebuilding of the bridge was a feat of surprising rapidity ; as the iron mills still had all the blueprints and patterns , the steel parts were quickly at hand . On March 22 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , on May 7 , the new span was opened for t ravel . The structure had a width of 1712 feet , and when it was built the men behind the enterprise believed they were building for all time . But in 1889 they did not anticipate future developments . They little realized that the ensuing decade would bring such great changes in the Niagara region as to demand a voluntary destruction of the proud structure they had built , in order that it might give way to a better and more modern bridge . The hacks and the horsecars had to give way to electric trolleys . The new electric cars were heavy , and the existing bridge was not strong enough to carry them . It was therefore determined to replace the suspension bridge with a new span ; and since the  | suspension span did not seem rigid enough under the loads , the engineers of the time decided to adopt the arch type for the new construction . When taken down , the eight-year-old suspension bridge was rebuilt on the site of Serrell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1864 . The new highway span at the Falls was built in 1897 , and was hailed as the greatest steel arch in the world . It was the fourth bridge built on the site , counting those built in 1888 and 1889 as the second and third . On January 27 , 1938 , this fourth " Honeymoon Bridge " was wrecked by a high ice jam , which crushed the steelwork at the springing points of the arch . To replace it , a new arch span ? the " Rainbow Bridge " ? was built in 1940-41. 16 In 1845 , in response to Major Stuart 's circular inquiry , four engineers had declared their readiness to bridge Niagara . In the years that followed , each in turn secured an opportunity to build a span across the famous gorge . There is drama in this chance competition of four bridgebuilders . The widely differing measures of success they attained afford an illuminating contrast of personalities and capabilities . First there was Ellet . Cocksure and confident , he had started out in a spectacular burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspension bridge . He got as far as erecting a light , temporary span , 71 feet wide , and then he quit . His shaky suspended plankway remained up only six years , and was then torn down to make way for Roebling 's bridge at the same site . Next came Serrell . He built the Lewiston-Queenston span in 1851 ? a flimsy highway bridge , dancing in the wind . Anchor guys had to be added to hold it down . It lasted but thirteen years , then it was wrecked by a gale . Keefer also built a light highway span ? the Niagara-Clifton bridge ? in 1869 . It had the most spectacular location , nearest to the Falls . Three times in its brief life it was strengthened or reconstructed , until a hurricane swept it completely out of existence . And then there was John Roebling . Of the four bridgebuilders who accepted the challenge of Niagara , Roebling was the only one to start a railroad suspension bridge and to finish it ? not a  | shaky footbridge , not a light , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with powerful consolidated cables , to carry the heaviest known trains and locomotives , in addition to affording a wide roadway on a separate deck for heavy highway traffic . It was a real bridge , an enduring structure , the work of a master builder . Through winds and gales and hurricanes the bridge remained staunch and unshaken . Loads increased ? longer and heavier trains of freight cars , more ponderous locomotives thundering over the span until the loading was three times as heavy as any anticipated when the span was projected , and still the bridge firmly carried its steadily augmenting burden . Decade after decade , for forty-two years , it remained in service , carrying the constantly increasing load of international traffic on both rail and highway decks . At a time when other railroad bridges , even those of the most substantial construction in conventional types , had a customary service life of but twenty years before obsolescence and replacement , Roebling 's more daring Niagara span continued in powerful usefulness for twice that period . And it would be standing yet , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only the voluntary decision of man determined its final replacement ? not for any flaw in the structure , not for any inefficiency in the design , but to make room for a more modern span proportioned to new weights and dimensions and capacities that transcended prior conception . That is the whole story . Four men had started out to span Niagara . One built a footbridge , and quit ; two built light , flexible , highway spans , at the mercy of the wind ; but only Roebling met the original challenge ? he built a rigid , railroad suspension bridge , the first successful railroad suspension span in the world . And when we consider the smallness of the sum that was available to build the structure in the first place and the lack of guiding precedents and of design theory at the time , we are stirred by the genius of the man who , defying the doubts of his contemporaries , eagerly accepted the challenge and built a bridge that changed all preconceived notions and shattered all prior conventions . With his invention of wire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With his achievement of the epoch-making Niagara Bridge the master builder was started on the road to immortality .  | THE MIND AND THE HEART IN LATER life Washington Roebling invariably spoke with the highest regard of his father 's genius and professional achievements . But in his reminiscent moods , he would also recall , without reserve and even with a certain apparent gusto , the unrestrained punishments which he had so often endured at the hands of an irascible parent . The severe castigations , the almost unremitting scoldings to which the boy was subjected during his growing years left their mark upon mind and character . Neither the rod nor the child was spared . Fortunately these punishments , though often unmerited , did not embitter , but were recalled in riper years with a philosophic calm mingled with an appreciative sense of their seriocomic aspect . Of his mother , who was evidently devoted in every way to her children , he always spoke with reverent affection . And it was doubtless from her that he inherited the milder qualities of his personality ? gentleness of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adversity and affliction . His strongest childhood attachment was for Julius Riedel , the itinerant tutor who gave him his first instruction in " the three R 's in German . " And when this beloved teacher and preacher had to leave Saxonburg to seek a new post in Ohio , the sobbing child " was dumped into the same wagon and dropped at Pittsburgh to live with a German teacher named Henne . " After the family moved to Trenton in the autumn of 1849 , the youngster was enrolled in the Trenton Academy , which was one of the distinguished private schools of the time . The academy catalogue gave this significant warning : " If there is necessity for corporal punishment it is promptly and judiciously administered . " This phrasing must have caused a wry smile to appear on Washington 's face , for " corporal punishment ? judiciously administered " would be for him a new and rare experience . Here the youth secured the classical Latin educa-  | tion which the father had missed . And here the son of the immigrant had as his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges , senators , educators , and authors . During the years of Washington 's attendance at the academy his father was away from home much of the time , completing his suspended aqueducts at High Falls and Neversink , and then designing and building the Niagara bridge . In the bridge engineer 's absences his faithful steward , Charles Swan , looked after affairs at the mill , aided by young Roebling in such time as he could spare from his studies . Even before he reached his teens , the boy had proved useful as an assistant to his father and had already demonstrated his aptitude in things mechanical . Four years of study at the Trenton Academy found Washington prepared to enter the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy , New York , then the foremost engineering school in America . 2 When young Roebling entered the institute , the students still wore a prescribed uniform ; it consisted of a dark-green frock coat , with a black velvet collar , and a cap with a gold symbol on the band in front . He doubtless purchased an outfit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for students in those days . The printed catalogue supplied information and advice on living expenses : Members of the Institute find Board and Lodgings with respectable private families in the City . . . . The total living expenses , which include board , furnished lodgings , laundry , fires , lights and attendance , vary from about $15o to $300 for the scholastic year , according to the habits and inclinations of the student . . . . There is little necessity for spending much money during the student 's life at the Institute ; and the supply of any more money than what is sufficient is very apt to be worse than useless . . . . Washington was not subjected to the hazard of having " too free command of pocket money . " The Roebling children had to account for every penny they expended , and even had to write home to Mr. Swan to send them a few postage stamps when needed .  | Unfortunately the scholastic records of young Roebling 's college career during his three years ' attendance are not available ? they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the fires suffered by the institute . The only records of his school days that have survived are two or three letters written by himself during his first year at Troy and addressed to the family 's factotum at Trenton . In one of these letters , dated in March , 1854 , he asked Mr. Swan to forward to him " a collection of logarithmic tables by Baron de la Vega , published in Vienna and written on the left hand in Latin and the other in French . " He told Swan exactly where to look for the book at home and asked him to send it to his Troy address , 97 Ferry Street . In another letter , written in May , Washington said he was writing " just after having swum across the Hudson " and was therefore tired out . He continued : " There is no want to me of having plenty to do . It comes of itself , if you only want it , and sometimes there is a little too much of it . As my circle of acquaintances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . But I will take care of that . " Evidently his social popularity was becoming onerous , as it was cutting too much into his hours required for study . In the same letter he expressed concern over the " rolling " troubles Swan was having at the mill , and reported that , as requested , he had tried to find a skilled hand to go to Trenton to work at that operation , but could find none . He also stated that he had heard from his brother " Ferdie " that the Trenton dam had broken away again , and observed " had they taken my advice that would never have happened . " To engineering graduates of today , and their teachers , a glimpse of the curriculum of a century ago , when engineering education was in its infancy , would be a fascinating and startling revelation . In the list of nearly a hundred subjects Washington Roebling had to master in three years of concentrated application were such diverse and advanced courses as Analytical Geometry of Three Dimensions , Differential and Integral Calculus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Determinative Mineralogy , Higher Geodesy , Logical and Rhetorical Criticism , French Composition and Literature , Orthographic and Spherical Projections , Gnomonics , Stereot-  | omy , Acoustics , Optics , Thermotics , Geology of Mining , Paleontology , Rational Mechanics of Solids and Fluids , Spherical Astronomy , Kinematics , Machine Design , Hydraulic Motors , Steam Engines , Stability of Structures , Engineering and Architectural Design and Construction , and Intellectual and Ethical Philosophy . It was a stiff schedule . Under such a curriculum the average college boy of today would be left reeling and staggering . In that earlier era , before colleges embarked upon mass production , engineering education was a real test and training , an intensive intellectual discipline and professional equipment for a most exacting lifework . Only the ablest and the most ambitious could stand the pace and survive the ordeal . Washington A. Roebling was graduated in July , 1857 , with the degree of Civil Engineer . For his Senior Thesis , always an important requirement for graduation , he chose as his subject , " Design for a Suspension Aqueduct. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seventeen , at which age he entered the engineering school , was at least a year too soon for what he called " that terrible treadmill of forcing an avalanche of figures and facts into young brains not qualified to assimilate them as yet . " He declared that the director of the institution was the hardest taskmaster that ever lived , and that " the boys were ground down and crammed with knowledge and mathematics that their poor young brains could not make use of . . . . I am still busy trying to forget the heterogeneous mass of unusable knowledge that I could only memorize , not really digest . When a class starts with 65 and only graduates twelve it is proof of the terrible grind . " He added that " the few who graduated left the school as mental wrecks . " In all probability the Colonel in his memories exaggerated somewhat the strenuous conditions of his student life , and his delight in forceful verbal utterances carried him beyond the boundaries of sober fact . In any event he never appeared to suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depicted , for obviously he never became one of the " mental wrecks "  | which he accused the institute of producing in the educational grinding mill of his descriptive metaphor . His class numbered only twelve at their graduation in 1857 , but all twelve men subsequently gave evidence of the character of the training they had received . Four of them made names for themselves as bridge engineers . Charles Macdonald built the railroad cantilever bridge over the Hudson at Poughkeepsie and the Hawkesbury River Bridge in Australia . Francisco Trujillo laid out the modern city of Havana . Other classmates achieved success in related fields , especially in railroad engineering . Two became engineering teachers of eminence . Four of the twelve were Lieutenant-Colonels in the Civil War , including young Roebling himself . During his three years at Troy Washington established lasting friendships not only with his classmates but also with fellow students in the other classes entering or graduating while he was there . Among these were a number who achieved distinguished careers . Two attained the rank of Chief Engineer of the United States Navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and another , A. J. Cassatt , became President of that railroad . Another contemporary student was Theodore Cooper , whose brilliant career as one of America 's leading bridge engineers was tragically terminated by the collapse of the ill-fated Quebec Bridge during its erection in 1907 . Five fellow-alumni later worked loyally under Washington Roebling on the design and construction of the Brooklyn Bridge , notably Charles C. Martin as Principal Assistant Engineer and Francis Collingwood as Assistant Engineer . Lefferts L. Buck , who graduated after the Civil War , began his engineering career as a draftsman on this work and , following this apprenticeship , he became the builder of other bridges , including two spans over Niagara and the second bridge over the East River , the Williamsburg Bridge . At an alumni reunion in 1881 , two years before the completion of the Brooklyn Bridge , Francis Collingwood paid a tribute to his absent chief , Colonel Roebling , who " despite a nervous shock , from which he never recovered , has never lost his hold on the work " ? and then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them for the task : " The men who have come from the Institute to the bridge have come to stay ; and -  | this seems to be true on whatever enterprise they are employed ; they seem to have a wonderful sticking power . . . . Higher praise can hardly be accorded the Institute than this ; for it shows that her men are all equipped for their work , that their worth is everywhere recognized ; and that , with experience , they are fitted for the highest engineering positions . " Despite his vivid criticism of the scholastic procedure of the time , the Colonel retained a grateful and loyal regard for his alma mater . In after years his benefactions to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute aggregated over $100,000 ; in addition he left a bequest of $50,000 to the institution in his will . His son , John A. Roebling , 2nd , and his brother , Charles G. Roebling , also graduates , added another $1oo,000 to these testimonials of loyalty and affection . About 1906 , after a disastrous fire at the institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanking him , Director Palmer C. Ricketts explained the needs of the school and asked the Colonel for his advice . On receipt of this letter Roebling replied : " Dear Ricketts , What you evidently need is not advice , but money . " Attached to this brief note was another check for $10,000 . Recalling his expressed belief that the school , in his time , had failed to provide properly for the physical and social needs of the students , the Colonel was one of the first alumni to establish a fund for the erection of dormitories . The " Roebling Dormitory , " the finest and largest unit on the campus , was erected by gifts from the three members of the family who were graduates of the institute . About 1917 , when " wireless , " as it was called , was still a plaything , Director Ricketts wrote to the Colonel to ask him whether he would like to build a pair of radio towers on the campus , which would have both educational and publicity value for the institute . A favorable answer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this new development in science . As a result the Roebling family constructed Station WHAZ , for broadcasting and research . It was the first radio station in any institution of learning . Like the Brooklyn Bridge , his alma mater still bears visible testimony to the devotion of Colonel Roebling.  | The human part of Washington Roebling 's education was in his own family circle . Admiring respect for his father , loving tenderness for his mother , humorous appreciation of his brother Ferdinand , and a deep affection for his younger brother Charles ? all these went into the shaping of the man 's responses to life . Between him and his brother " Ferdie , " only five years his junior , a relationship of whimsical and tolerant understanding was established , for there was a wide divergence between their personalities . Ferdinand was not an engineer ; he was of the hearty salesman type ? the advertising man , the merchandising expert , the business getter . He left the engineering problems , the expansion of the plant , and the mechanical operation to his brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public relations , with social and political affiliations . He had none of the shyness and reserve of his brothers ; he was not afraid to meet people , and he knew how to make them like him at the first meeting . Perhaps for these reasons ? because he showed these very differences of talents and traits ? he became the father 's favorite . Ferdinand took life more lightly than the others ; he had no serious ambition apart from his impulse toward business achievement and financial success . For this brother , to whom he quizzically referred in one of his early letters as " that lazy chap Ferd , " Washington entertained a humorous and tolerant regard . But for his second brother , Charles , twelve years younger than himself , Washington felt throughout his life a deep and tender affection . This youngest of the three brothers was a rare personality ? thoughtful , modest , shy , impulsive , considerate of others , and generous to a fault . These were traits that endeared him to the eldest brother , for Washington had early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are precious and rare . Only to the notes that were beautiful and true did the chords in his own heart respond . A rare and heart-warming book could be written on the life and personality of Charles G. Roebling . Where other men achieved by sacrificing the finer instincts of life or by trampling over the feelings and aspirations of others , he kept his gentle-  | ness of character throughout his career and yet left behind him monuments of achievement . Engineer , scholar , musician , student of metaphysics and science , with a keen appreciation of art and a passion for botanical and floral forms , with sympathy for suffering and unquestioned loyalty to friends , reticent and avoiding publicity , he was little known to the general public ; yet his varied engineering accomplishments ? the model industrial town of Roebling which he planned and created , the manifold enlargement and expansion of the family plant , mills , and factories which he engineered and executed , the bridges he built and helped to build ? are monuments to his extraordinary talents . Fortunately we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was through the eyes of the one who knew him and understood him best ? his brother , Washington Roebling . And in this reflected image , we can also perhaps glimpse some of the hue and quality of the heart that mirrored it . Upon the death of Charles in 1918 , his brother wrote this tribute : IN MEMORIAM CHARLES G. ROEBLING WRITTEN BY HIS ELDER BROTHER , WASHINGTON A. ROEBLING Born December 9 , 1849 Died October 5 , 1918 . There may be some people whose sole activities can be confined to two lines such as these , others who have done a little more than living and breathing . But at rare intervals , once in a century , a man appears who towers so high above his fellows that his activities and accomplishments surpass a hundred- , yes , a thousand-fold those of the average man . Such a man was Charles G. Roebling . Then Washington , unconsciously and indirectly , paid a tribute to the personality of his father , when he wrote that Charles , whom he lovingly idealized , " was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in heredity . He was his father over again , to a far greater degree than any of the other children . He inherited his temperament , his constitution , the concentrated energy which  | drives one to work and be doing something all the time . It might be argued that if a man inherits everything he deserves no credit for what he is . That would be so in a life of universal monotony , but with each generation in turn totally different conditions and environment arise . These have to be met by the new individual who must develop his own powers to adapt himself to them , to overcome them and use them as his tools . In the next passage , sketching the childhood of his younger brother , Washington revealed a glimpse of his own early years : The early childhood of Charles passed along rather peacefully . The father was away much of the time at Niagara , Pittsburgh and Cincinnati , so the boy was spared the educational experiments which were applied so disastrously to the older boys . The reference to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ euphemistic allusion to the overworked corrective measures of scolding and cowhide . Then came a dramatic illustration of Charles 's innate warmhearted sympathy and generosity , manifested in childhood and forming the pattern of his character through life : As he grew older the inherent impulsive traits began to show themselves as this little incident will show . While standing at the door one day , a beggar woman came along asking for old clothes . Charles rushed upstairs to his mother 's closet , seized an armful of costly silk dresses , and bestowed them on the astonished mendicant , who marched off with them . In telling how Charles selected his own middle name , the elder brother also recorded a glimpse of the family 's religious life : The boy was not christened as a child ; his father waited until the two younger brothers were ready to march with him to the First Presbyterian Church , where a pew was maintained to enhance the family respectability . My mother was a Lutheran and father more of a Universalist , until he evolved a religion of his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a trunk in the garret , forgotten and unread . Charles was baptized without a middle name . A little later he noticed that his older brothers rejoiced in one , so he selected the middle name of Gustavus of his own accord . The reminiscences went on to sketch Charles 's education : Charles ' older sister , Laura , had married a German school teacher from Muhlhausen named Methfessel , who established a boarding-  | school and pedagogium in Stapleton , Staten Island . Thither the boy was sent when he was twelve or fourteen ; he thrived under his sister 's motherly care and followed the usual academic course for three or four years . He developed great ability as a piano player , and became a brilliant performer , by far the best in Trenton . ( His father before him had been a virtuoso on the flute and piano until his left hand was maimed . ) When he was eighteen he was sent to the Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute at Troy , wherr I had graduated in 1857 . . . . When my father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had two years to serve at Troy . . . . I have at hand an ambrotype taken when he was twenty-one , wearing a high stovepipe hat , with a perfectly smooth face and still capable of doing boyish tricks . He was a fine draughtsman and fair at mathematics , and learned more about machinery than I did . . . . Being an engineer , he naturally took to the manufacturing end of the business . . . . The history of Charles G. Roebling is practically the history of the Roebling Company from now on . . . . Thus we find him down at the mill every day in the year , early and late . That was his pleasure and delight . An occasional business trip gave him all the relaxation he needed . . . . Charles had one very strong point ? he never copied . Every task was an education for him . . . . Charles did not like to write . I have never received a letter from him . . . . Even about such important subjects as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might at least have written a short monograph so as to get credit . He loved his work ; it was his life , his happiness . .. . By the death of Charles , I not only lose a friend and brother , but Trenton loses its greatest citizen and the country at large its foremost mechanical engineer . The diverse facets of John A. Roebling 's character and talents were distributed among these three sons . Washington inherited his engineering skill , analytical power , high courage , thoroughness , steadfastness , and articulateness , if not his brilliance of creative invention . Ferdinand inherited his ability to handle people , his salesmanship , and his excellent business sense ; and later , as secretary and treasurer of the company , he was largely responsible for the financial success of the family industry which the pioneer had founded . Charles inherited his idealism and impulsiveness , his musical gifts , and , above all , a passion for building , which he applied to the founding of a model town and to the physical expansion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's faculty of expression ? he hardly ever wrote even a letter . When we know what a man best loves and admires , we have a measure of him . In the traits of the brother whom he idolized , we find a clue to Washington 's own character and ideals . Finally , we can not have an object of admiring and reverent regard without being influenced by it . In the case of Washington Roebling , respect , tenderness , appreciation , and affection for the members of his family constituted an essential and significant part of his education . Yes , the deepest part ? the heart of the man . 5 Much is said of heredity and environment , the influence of the parents in shaping the character and lives of their children . But may not the process work both ways , with an interaction of characters within the family circle , so that something rare and gentle in the children may soften the hardness in a parent ? Whatever it was ? whether the family relations , or the new influence of Emerson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the advancing years ? something changed the inner life of John Roebling in his later years . He became gentler , kindlier , more considerate , with a new perception of the values he had missed . The younger children were spared the harshness and the severity with which the eldest had been raised , and long-suppressed emotions of tenderness began to show themselves , involuntarily , through the man 's protective shell of reserve . Following this change in outlook , he also began in his later years to give generously of his means ? shyly , privately , unostentatiously . Even his own family little knew of whom he helped and how much he gave . The hardness and the penury that marked the earlier period of struggle ? the initial striving for dollar profits and material achievement in the building up of his wire-rope business ? gave way ultimately to a feeling of warm obligation and responsibility toward his workmen , for the welfare of all who were dependent upon him , and for the needs of the destitute and the helpless among his fellow townsmen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " WASHINGTON ROEBLING 'S preparation for his lifework ? WASHINGTON discipline , schooling , professional education , apprenticeship in the shop and in the field ? closely followed his father 's concept , his father 's plan . Even John Roebling 's impatience and severity toward the growing boy were manifestations of an impelling urge to mold the youth to the exacting pattern of a foreshadowed destiny . As the bridgebuilder designed a bridge , and forged and hewed the members to fit , so he planned his son 's career and obstinately endeavored to shape his mind and character to fit into a preconceived design . Following his graduation at Troy , the young engineer returned to his home at Trenton and took up work in the mill . As the senior Roebling and the plant superintendent , Charles Swan , were away for a part of this time , Washington was left in charge of the works ? a heavy responsibility for a youth of twenty . He wrote regularly to his father ? addressing him as " Dear Sir " ? giving him full reports on the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credits , which were then causing much concern . Collections were slow , and substantial amounts due were lost , for 1857 was the great panic year when widespread failures of banks and business enterprises played havoc with the nation 's financial structure . In that year John Roebling received a commission to build still another bridge at Pittsburgh ? this one to cross the Allegheny at Sixth Street . It was to take the place of an old covered bridge that had served for nearly four decades before it had finally become unsafe . The aged structure consisted of a string of six wooden truss spans , reinforced with timber arches . The roof was flat , and had a railing at the sides and steps at each end . This convenient railed platform covering the bridge was used as a promenade by the belles and beaux of days gone by . 205  | The removal of the old structure and the construction of the new , including the building of the piers and the anchorages , required three years . The ambitious builder was determined to make this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it all the improvements in his art since his first structure erected over the same river twelve years earlier . For the first time he was able to adopt iron , instead of timber , for the suspended construction . To withstand the pull of the cables , heavy anchorages of masonry were built on the banks of the river . Embedded at the bottom of these , under hundreds of tons of rock knit together with cement , were the large anchor plates to which the cables were later connected by wrought-iron links . 2 In the spring of 185 ' 8 Washington joined his father at Pittsburgh to assist him in erecting the new suspension bridge over the Allegheny . At last John Roebling 's dream had come true ? father and son were working together on the building of a bridge . In a letter to the Trenton office written from the Monongahela House , the father briefly mentioned the presence of his new assistant : " Glad to hear that orders are coming in . Here business is generally reviving ; a good deal of life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am getting along well here . Washington is about the work . " During the two years that followed , both father and son wrote many letters to Swan , affording a sketchy record of the progress of the work and some glimpses of life in this growing city at the head of the Ohio . John Roebling 's letters were principally confined to business matters , including inquiries concerning affairs at home and orders for supplies needed for the bridge construction . The younger engineer 's correspondence was more breezy and personal , revealing a permeating sense of humor and a wide range of interests . Happy on his first bridge job , he was in high spirits . He wrote informatively and entertainingly on community progress and local lawlessness , weather and sunspots , music and chess , Christian morality and Democratic politicians . Although he was working diligently and strenuously , his letters gave but little inkling of the fact .  | In his first letter Washington gave his new impressions of the place , which he had not visited since his Saxonburg days . Even at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locally welcome sign of flourishing industrial growth . The river was crowded with steamboats and rafts , and frequent collisions put the pumping boat out of commission , delaying the foundation work for the bridge piers . One anchorage was nearly completed . The young engineer was living at a " very pleasant boarding house " where he hungrily enjoyed his meals , and where " we have no female boarders , fortunately . " In the following months , the father had to make frequent trips to Cincinnati , and during these absences young Roebling was left in charge of the work at Pittsburgh . In June John Roebling reported high water holding up the construction . By the end of the month the river level had fallen , permitting the foundations to be started : " The weather has been intensely hot for the last week , " he wrote . " The rivers are getting low . I am preparing for laying foundations for the Piers . . . . Washington will send you a Pittsburgh Gazette with my article on Steamboat Explosions , which matter I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained . " In deference to both weather and patriotic spirit , Roebling gave his construction crew " a long 4th July to enjoy themselves during the dog days . " For this contract the Roeblings , father and son , had to build three new granite piers in the river , in addition to the two massive anchorages on the banks . The tall piers were built with round ends , to deflect current , drift , and ice , and were neatly finished with copings of large slabs of granite . In a typical letter , written from the Monongahela House in July , Roebling ordered a ton of wire to be shipped to Iowa , inquired about the account of the Pennsylvania Coal Company , referred to a new harness , some notes to be found in Washington 's desk at home , a new lubricating mixture for the machinery , and some trees injured in a recent storm , and then he added : " Please say to Ferdy he should write to me , he has never written yet . " A new note of tenderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soft spot in his armor . The bridgebuilder was wistfully hoping for a letter from his son Ferdinand .  | In August , John Roebling reported the successful conclusion of the financing for the Allegheny bridge : " Our new Bridge Stock was all sold the other day at auction at par , surprising everybody . I have not got as much as I wanted . I first wanted to see the result of my foundations . . . . People have great confidence in this Bridge . " As the construction advanced , the enthusiasm of the bridge company officials grew in proportion ; and John Roebling was given a free hand to do as he saw fit . Here was the opportunity he had long been seeking ? to produce the finest suspension bridge , both structurally and artistically , that had ever been built . He submitted his ideas to the owners as he went along , and they were all approved . Following the public 's generous response to the offering of bridge stock , the purse strings were freely open . For the first and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available to him to build a bridge according to his best ideas of substantial construction and to finish it in a manner that would impress the traveling public of the day . His clients knew that this would be a profitable investment . Unable to leave the work for a visit to his home at Trenton , the bridgebuilder had asked his wife to join him and was anxiously awaiting her arrival . His eagerness was revealed in a letter to Swan : " Do not forget to telegraph me about Mrs. Roebling 's departure or non-departure , so that I know whether she is coming or not . I have been running to the depot to no purpose . " Whether Mrs. Roebling finally came is not known . In the spring of 1859 Mr. Roebling again referred to " Ferdy , " from whom he was still hoping to receive a letter : " I am pleased with your account of Ferdy . He has not written to me yet . We have commenced unroofing the old bridge . " During the Easter season Washington made a brief vacation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trenton . During his absence his father wrote from Pittsburgh : " I want Washington to come here next Friday or Saturday . My plans for the Cincinnati Bridge have been accepted and I am going on with the work . " The bridgebuilder had to leave for Cincinnati . This was Washington 's opportunity . He promptly came back to take  | charge of the job , and his next letter to Swan revealed his enthusiasm : " In one week I bet you will see me jumping about here ; you had better come out and see how it is done . " On each granite pier two handsome iron towers were erected to carry the cable saddles . Each tower consisted of four cylindrical columns of cast iron , slightly inclined inward to form a neatly tapering structure . The spaces between these corner columns were filled with artistically effective latticed ironwork for bracing , with openings left above the sidewalks to form tapered portals . Above the cable saddles each tower was finished with ornamental spires , one at each corner and a higher one in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been tawdry if unskillfully handled ; but in Roebling 's planning , with careful design and innate sense of artistic proportions , a pleasing composition was obtained , accentuating the graceful lines of the spans . In June Washington reported progress on the bridge : " By the middle of this week the cast-iron towers will be up in place . . . . We put up two columns a day ; they are awkward things to handle because they ca n't stand up alone . . . . About the 4th of July the masonry will all be finished ? Thank the Lord . " In erection and adjustment operations the building of a suspension bridge demands the nicest calculations and the widest range of engineering ability . The labor involved in the construction is far greater than the casual observer would imagine . The heart of a suspension bridge is in the quality and strength of the cables . The making of the cables , stringing them wire by wire , requires so much time that the public is often impatient with the delay in the progress of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with which the rest of the work is completed after the cables are finished . The traveling wheel , hung from an endless moving rope , had to make the complete trip over the towers 4,200 times from shore to shore in the stringing of the two main cables ; and then the spinning of the two outside cables , which were smaller , meant 1,400 additional trips from one anchorage to the other . In October Washington happily recorded completion of the stringing of the main cables : " Yesterday the last strand of the big cables was finished ; tomorrow we commence wrapping . "  | Washington Roebling was enjoying the strenuous life of a bridgebuilder , comprising involved office computations alternating with active physical exertion out on the work . On anchorages and piers , on high towers and swaying catwalk , stringing the cables and hanging the ironwork , he was there with the bridgemen ? planning , helping , watching , inspecting , and supervising with eyes and ears open to learn and to make improvements , and with a heavy burden of responsibility on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the main cables and the hanging of the suspenders , the young bridgebuilder met with an accident . While he was out on a suspended " buggy , " a falling wrench struck him on the head , knocking him unconscious . He described the experience in a postscript to Swan : " I was delayed in putting this letter into the post office by having had a hole knocked into my head accidentally , but I am happy to inform you that it is healed up again . I am all right , however . I experienced for the first time the delightful sensation of being knocked insensible . " In November Washington reported gratifying progress on the construction : " We have got along well on the bridge ; the big cables are wrapped , all but about 5o feet at each end when we ran out of wire ? You will have to make some more . The suspenders are all hung up in the main spans and in a day or two we hang on beams . Wrapping goes very well ; no trouble after once getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell that lazy chap Ferd to write . " Later in the month he wrote to Swan concerning morality in Pittsburgh , incidentally revealing his own capacity for indignation at hypocrisy : " I send you two papers containing an account of Rev. Mr. R. 's trial . You will see that although Pittsburgh claims to be the most orthodox Christian city in the United States , there are still some very rotten persons in it . " Very few of Johanna Roebling 's letters can be found . In one of these , written a week before the Christmas of 1859 , she was hoping that her two bridgebuilders would come home for the holidays . She wrote in German :  | My dear Washington It is a long time since I received your letter . Today I will write you only a few lines , for next Sunday is the long-awaited Christmas festival , and we all look forward with pleasure to seeing you here again . If you should bring various small remembrances with you , they will be welcome . Your sisters have also remembered you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fritz Meissner offered me a few dozen stereoscope pictures , at IoI2O each ? various views from here as well as Europe . I want to get some . He sent me one to try out and it fits in our stereoscope . With the hope of seeing both of you here , in good health , next Saturday evening , I remain , Your loving Mother , J. ROEBLING. 5 The stringing of the two smaller cables was in progress when a violent February storm almost wrecked the footbridge . Young Roebling described the experience : " Yesterday we had a furious storm . All hands had to quit ; they could not stand up , and I expected to see our footbridge go to the dickens , every moment ; she jumped and pitched and reared like a wild horse ; the new bridge shook a great deal sideways also because no planks are on yet to make her stiff in that direction . Yesterday morning we had 65 degrees heat and in the night it snowed ; that explains the storm . " He wrote of the anticipated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued opposition of the people on the Allegheny side , who were vexed over the proposed schedule of tolls : " I am afraid that the contemplated opening of the bridge by April I wo n't be exactly accomplished ; it will probably be the 15th . All the stays have to be cut off yet and put on before we can open , and you know that those are not a few by the bill of rope you sent us . . . . The wrath of the Alleghenians has now reached its full height and they have determined to build a free bridge right next to ours ; that is to say , a petition has been circulated for a charter , and since that do n't cost anything , it was fully signed and was nine feet long according to last accounts . The whole move is only intended to frighten our people to put the toll down to nothing . "  | During the early spring the erection of the floor system was under way , and the work proceeded without a hitch . The spans of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full length of the bridge . These were effectively proportioned and neatly designed . For additional stiffening , a system of inclined stays was installed . These wire ropes ran over the saddles and radiated downward from the tower tops for a distance of a hundred feet on each side of the tower . Where these diagonal stays crossed the vertical suspenders , they were lashed together with small wire . In March John Roebling wrote of the large force of men engaged to speed the completion of the job : " The weather has been very cold for a few days , but is now fine . We have 42 Carpenters on the Bridge , some 8o men in all &; are driving as hard as we can . . . . No more orders come in ? " In another of the rare letters preserved from the mother 's correspondence , written to her son in Pittsburgh , she inquired repeatedly when the bridge would be opened and hoped she could see it when it was finished : " Today is Sunday and that is also usually letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confirmation in the German Church . In the absence of an organist , Laura substituted . . . . When will the opening of the bridge take place ? I wish I could see it when it is finished and before it is dedicated . . . . Mr. Swan complains about the hard times . Not many orders are coming in . . . . Will Papa go to Kentucky to the railroad convention ? How long will it be before the bridge will be finally completed ? . . . All is well here . Willie was n't very well for a time , but is now all right again . Willie says he is tired , and the others are studying . . . . My best greetings to Papa , and I hope that you both are well . " The reference to William , the last child born to the Roeblings , was pathetic . Sickly in his fourth year , he died soon after this letter was written . An April freshet , flooding lower Pittsburgh and doing much damage on the Monongahela , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rousing freshet . . . . The water commenced running into all the streets ; all the Point rats were drowned out as usual . . . . Beyond the filling of cellars and damaging of floors there was not much damage done , except in the Monongahela , where 17 coal boats were sunk . The Monon  | gahela bridge will have about $4000 damages to pay for coal boats sunk against its piers . The company has to pay those damages every year and the effect will be to break it up sooner or later . . . . Tomorrow we start to take down the small footbridge , which will take a week ; the main floor will not be opened before the first week in May . We have quite a pile of men at work now ; the check roll runs up to $600 per week . In the next Frank Leslie 's you will see a picture of the bridge as she appeared during the flood .

This is the day of the prize fight , I believe . Hurrah ! for the one that beats . " In his letters to Swan , John Roebling had been repeatedly and anxiously inquiring whether any new orders were coming in for wire rope . On May 1 the bridgebuilder recorded his happy surprise at news that large orders had been received , and at the same time he announced that the Allegheny bridge would be opened for wagon traffic on the following day : " You have quite surprised me by your letter . Those orders amount to 59,130 feet and will weigh about 256,000 lb . How will you be off for wire and iron to fill them ? This is a six months business in place of three months . To fill all these orders will keep you busy all Summer . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery for the present . Always good policy to be prepared for such heavy orders . . . . Tomorrow I shall open the bridge for teams . All well . " Later in the month he made a brief trip to Kentucky and Cincinnati . Following his return in June , he reported the fine behavior and appearance of the new Allegheny bridge and wrote of the finishing touches still required before he could leave . That year John Roebling had secured a patent on his invention of a railroad passenger car made entirely of iron , for greater strength and safety compared with the wooden cars previously used . The inventor promptly arranged to have a number of his new cars constructed in a near-by plant at New Brighton . Following a visit of father and son to see the cars in the process of manufacture , Washington wrote to Swan , reporting enthusi-  | astically on the successful operation of the finished cars . In describing the trip , he mentioned the " misfortune " of running into the Western delegations to a Democratic convention ? " an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few days later Roebling wrote that he and Washington would soon be able to leave Pittsburgh : " I expect I &; Washington can leave here on the 1st or 2d July . . . . We are now finishing Tollhouses and the ornamental parts of the Work , which is a slow business . The Bridge will be beautiful , when entirely completed . " The thrill of the artist is revealed in the last sentence , " The Bridge will be beautiful . " The man had planned and wrought and , as he saw his work approaching completion , his heart leapt at the realization that his dream had taken shape as a thing of beauty . The builder 's pride was justified when others ? artists , engineers , and laymen ? proclaimed this bridge to be one of the most graceful structures in the land . In his next letter Swan sent word that he had been injured in an accident at the mill . Washington had to return to Trenton to take over the work at the plant , while his father remained at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bridge . 6 The new Allegheny bridge was a beautiful example of high technical skill in design and of the finest workmanship in execution . It differed from Roebling 's other later masterworks ? the Niagara , Ohio , and Brooklyn bridges ? in consisting of four comparatively short spans instead of having one long main span . Although lacking the grandeur of larger proportions , it had a peculiar beauty of its own , due to the recurring curves formed by the cables , and the pleasing appearance of the minaret towers over which the cables were suspended . The new bridge was not a massive monument but , in its own way , it was an artistic gem . The bridge , when it was finished in 186o , was generally regarded as the finest in the world . John Roebling had not then acquired the European celebrity which came later with his building of the great Cincinnati span ; but the fame of the new bridge at Pittsburgh soon reached across the ocean .  | The newly completed structure evoked the admiration of the Prince of Wales @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tour . They were astonished to find such a work of art in what was then a rather small provincial town . The Duke of Newcastle , who was a " practical man , " examined it closely and informed the Prince that it was the best bridge he had ever seen . Through the years following its completion , Roebling 's Pittsburgh-Allegheny bridge elicited the admiration of competent authorities . " A structure of importance in the history of bridges " . . . " considered the finest in the world , " said the editors of Engineering News . " Long noted as the most beautiful and graceful in its lines , " said W. G. Wilkins , in 1895 , in a technical paper describing the bridge in the Proceedings of the Engineers ' Society of Western Pennsylvania . Roebling , when asked what the strength of the structure was , said that he had ascertained the power of the greatest hurricane in the history of Pittsburgh , and had multiplied this by nine , which represented the strength of the bridge . This assurance gave the owners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure that no insurance against flood damage was considered necessary , especially as the spans had been put five feet above the highest recorded flood mark , that of 1832 . With its iron trusses and with its solid floor construction of heavy timber on iron beams , it was also considered almost impossible to set the bridge on fire . For these reasons the owners carried no insurance of any kind on the structure ; and for twenty-one years their supreme confidence remained apparently fully justified . In 1881 a fire of mysterious origin occurred on the bridge . Most of the superstructure was of iron ; but the timber floor suffered serious damage . The fire aroused consternation in view of the importance of the structure , and incendiarism was suspected . In an account printed the following day , the Pittsburgh Dispatch voiced the current suspicion : " The bridge was set afire by some evil designed person ; and Old Peter , the night man at the Allegheny Toll House , said last night there was no doubt in his mind that it was set on fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detective work was done by John Harper , president of the bridge company ; and the culprits were found to be " those feathered English pests , " the
