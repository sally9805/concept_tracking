In Paris , the lights which now blaze so brightly may soon be dimmed . In the huge textile mills of Lyons , the spindles are idle . In Belgium the great steel mills in Liege , Charleroi and La Louviere are shut . In many a European village there is ample food , but no way to get it to the hungry cities . <P> These were outward signs last week , two months after V-E day , that the econ omy of western Europe was still paralyzed . <P> Like a watch without a mainspring , it lacked the all-important power needed to start it up again : the power locked up in coal . Until the paralyzing coal shortage is solved , there is little chance that Eu rope 's shattered economy can be rebuilt or that any sizable foreign trade with the U.S. can be revived . <P> As Europe shivered through last winter , so it faced the prospect of freezing in the next . Many a European hopes that the U.S. will ship the coal that Europe needs . Last week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. , said he , will fall short by some 37,000,000 tons of meeting its own needs . Result : coal shipments to Europe , now 500,000 tons a month , will be stopped altogether in September . If Europe is to get coal , it must dig its own . <P> Cold France . In France , which normally imported two-fifths of its coal , the shortage is Europe 's worst . During the occupation , the Nazis kept the French output at a peak of 42,000,000 tons a year by wooing the miners with double food rations . The French Government tried the same stunt but failed to deliver the food . Result : absenteeism in the mines soared to 25% . <P> Moreover , with consumer goods scarce , there is little incentive to work . The prolonged celebration of V-E day ( in some places it lasted a week ) cost France 300,000 tons of coal . Now , coal production is Tmly about half what it was in prewar years , far below rock-bottom needs . <P> Cold Belgium . In Belgium , production has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miners oppose the return of King Leopold ) , and is only 65% of normal . Typical result : the Belgian steel industry was so short of coal in March that only one plant operated . Now the mills are turning out only 25,000 tons of steel a month , 12% of prewar production . <P> The thrifty Dutch have a small coal reserve , piled up by working hard in the mines ' in the southern part of their country while the northern part was being liberated . But current production of 240,000 tons a month is still 82% below the prewar output . Italy , which once used to import 1,000,000 tons of coal a month , is now getting only 10% of that . Norway is out of fuel and Sweden , which managed to build up a stockpile of German coal during the war , will soon be scraping bottom . <P> Help from Germany ? Unable to do the job themselves , all these nations are looking to Germany 's coal-rich Ruhr to do it for them . ( What Russia intends to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far kept to herself . ) The Ruhr mines were little damaged , but the Allied Coal Headquarters set up to run the mines will have to find manpower ( the Nazis employed 160.000 slave workers in the Ruhr ) and provide housing and food for the miners , now getting only 1,000 to 2,200 calories a day ( requirement for men engaged in heavy labor : 4,000 calories ) . In addition , the railroads and canals must be rebuilt to haul the coal away .
