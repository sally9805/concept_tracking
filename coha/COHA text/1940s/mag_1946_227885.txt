Another war-born phenomenon of the U.S. faded away this week : the local OPA board . It had lived a strange , lively and useful four years and ten months . It had diligently pursued a career that had irritated , at one time or another , almost every American . While many millions of U.S. citizens would greet its end with a sigh of relief , other millions would remember it for the thankless tasks it undertook . <P> The local board was born in the frightening , almost unreal days soon after Pearl Harbor . At first it was a tire rationing board . For most of the 20,000 citizens who volunteered to man it , the local board was their way of fighting the war , and they fought it to the end . There were the two men , both 74 , who reported for duty in Newport , R.I. , on Jan. 3 , 1942 , and were still on duty last week . There was the paralyzed man in Rensselaer , Ind. , who came each day in his wheel chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applications . These were the volunteers ; at the peak of OPA 's activity , there were more than 235,000 of them . <P> After tires it was sugar , and then it was rationing of what everybody wanted-gasoline , meat , shoes , fuel oil . Then it was price controls , and eventually it was a list of , about 8,000,000 items-from ouija boards to locomotives . By then the local board , collectively , was one of the Government 's biggest bureaus . <P> Inevitably , the local board had its busybodies , snoopers , chiselers and officious bureaucrats . But it also had its corps of zealously patriotic men &; women who kept the backsliding merchant honest about his weights and prices and could spot a spurious plea by either tenant or landlord . Overall , despite pressures and complaints , the local board managed to maintain a reputation for fairness . <P> The local board suffered a slow and painful death . Last January about 3,600 were closed ; last week 's pre-election splurge of decontrol doomed the surviving 1,642 . Not enough ceilings remained to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their epitaph : " . . . an outstanding example of democracy at its best . "
