Mortain was a critical spot ( see above ) . There the Germans had thrown four armored divisions into desperate counterattack . The object : to pierce the narrow waist of the U.S. corridor from Normandy , thus split the Allied front . One U.S. division , new to combat when it landed in France , took the brunt of the Panzer blow , recoiled , then stood and slugged . <P> On an ear-shaped hill , bypassed in the Germans ' thrust , was one of the division 's battalions . It was in a fine position and in a bad way : it held a prized spot for directing artillery fire , and it was surrounded , raked by German shells . It had many wounded , and no medical supplies , but food and ammunition were dropped by planes . <P> By the third day the battalion 's plight seemed hopeless . Up the hill , under a white flag , came a shiny-booted SS officer . His ultimatum to the battalion 's gaunt , lanky , black-bearded commander , Captain R. A. Kerley : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Texan Kerley 's reply : " Go to hell . " Then he amplified : " I will surrender when every one of our bullets has been fired and every one of our bayonets is sticking in a German belly . " ' <P> Salvos of Mercy . The hillside took an awful going-over that day &; night . There were many more wounded . U.S. shells also began to fall plunk in the battalion 's lines . But the big 155-mm. projectiles did not explode . They were salvos of mercy : smoke shells stripped of powder , cotton-packed with sulfas , plasma , morphine . <P> After five and a half days the Germans retired . Captain Kerley 's outfit spotted a long line of tanks and guns moving out , radioed the range . This time U.S. shells were merciless . The lost battalion could report : " Total destruction . " By night Americans were back in Mortain , and a rescue battalion had worked itself up the hillside . The regiment 's colonel heard then of Kerley 's talk with the SS officer . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nerve to tell the Germans that . " <P> Said Captain Kerley : " They had a hell of a nerve to put a proposition like that up to me. "
