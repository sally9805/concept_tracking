The Seven Lively Arts ( produced by Billy Rose ) had been ballyhooed for months to sound like the eighth wonder of the world . The production , what with buying and brilliantining the historic Ziegfeld Theater , cost $1,350,000 . The show had a record-breaking advance ticket sale of $550,000 . It opened at a $24 top , with enough big names on the program for a vest-pocket Who 's Who , enough plushy people in the audience for a reception to royalty . And in the crowded lounge during intermission , with flunkeys passing champagne , it looked like one . <P> Stripped of its fancy wrappings , The Seven Lively Arts is oversized and overstuffed . At times the whole thing seems less like the seven lively arts ( which presumably include dressmaking and sex ) than like seven luxury hotels . The big names frantically jostle one another as though they were playing " Going to Jerusalem " - with Dialogue Writers Ben Hecht and Moss Hart and Song Writer Cole Porter the first to be done out of chairs . <P> For all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has , to begin with , the finest comedienne on the stage today , Beatrice Lillie . Back to Broadway after five years abroad , but saddled with unworthy material , Actress Lillie performs one of the greatest feats of theatrical alchemy on record . It is just too bad that her satiric and high-comedy gifts are devoted to such smarty songs and Winter Gardenish sketches . <P> The similarly chilling material given Comic Bert Lahr and Patter Merchant Doc Rockwell leaves them no choice but to freeze with it . Although Ballerina Alicia Markova rises above an unexciting Stravinsky ballet to display her dazzling technique , she misses the final magic of her dancing . Benny Goodman , as usual , toots his clarinet with equal skill in a hot ensemble and a classical solo . <P> A lush assortment of girls , much bright costuming and some stylish Norman Bel-Geddes sets give The Seven Lively Arts its fine as well as foolish moments of display . Best moment : a spirited extravaganza celebrating Producer Rose 's past glories ( Jumbo , the Aquacade , Carmen Jones ) -a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lillie . <P> For pint-sized , 45-year-old Billy Rose , The Seven Lively Arts is merely one more exhibit in a great glass-enclosed Hall of Showmanship already crowded with displays . Billy today is Broadway 's most spectacular if least likely-looking impresario , in whose brashness , love of effect , and shameless pursuit of publicity lie real daring , an instinct for the effective , a canny knowledge of the public . <P> One secret of Rose 's success is that whatever he produces makes a good story long before it makes a good show . Jumbo promised to bring the circus to the theater , and Carmen Jones the opera ( in blackface , too ) . The first Aquacade , in Cleveland ( " I 'll use Lake Erie for a stage and Canada as a backdrop " ) , was going to turn a swimming meet into a musicomedy . The second Aquacade , at the New York World 's Fair , starred Eleanor Holm , whom - just as soon as Fanny Brice divorced him-Rose was going to marry . But for the war , Rose would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chorus of 64 planes , " the orchestra in one captive blimp , a glee club in another , and " 70,000 spectators " on the ground .
