Dr. Cyril Forster Garbett , Archbishop of York , recently gave up half his 9,000 ( $36,000 ) salary . Tories who dislike His Grace for his leftish economic and social ideas were quick to point a scornful finger at this renunciation . Said Sir Herbert Williams in the House of Commons : " He has entered into a perfectly splendid arrangement . . . he will pay less taxation in the future . . . . " <P> To the High Church Archbishop 's defense last week came Low Church Viscount Caldecote ( Thomas Walker Hobart Inskip ) , England 's Lord Chief Justice , a former Lord Chancellor . He noted that the financial arrangement between Dr. Garbett and the ecclesiastical commissioners ( authorized by the Church Assembly last March ) lets the commissioners foot some of York 's official bills . Why not ? said the Viscount . He thought the attacks on the Archbishop " ill judged and unfair , " found the " perfectly legitimate arrangement . . . would . . . relieve him of considerable personal bookkeeping . " <P> Further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglican Church 's third-ranking prelate , the Bishop of London . Dr. Geoffrey Francis Fisher let it be known that he , too , had begun negotiations with the commissioners to halve his own salary ( $40,000 ) , revamp ancient 44-room Fulham Palace , keep a few rooms for himself , turn the rest into a diocesan hostel .
