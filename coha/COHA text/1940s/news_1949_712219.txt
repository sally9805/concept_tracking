txt THE CONSERVATIVE PARTY 'S restate. ment of policy , " The Right Road for Britain . " is in many ways markedly similar to what Laborites might have written . The policy states , " We believe that only by release of personal energy and endeavor can our present economic difficulties be surmounted . . . . We believe free enterprise is necessary to ensure independence and efficiency . " But the main plank of , their platform is better administration of nationalized concerns . The Tories do n't intend to undo the socialization of most industries and services taken over by the Labor government though they would halt the attempts to nationalize the steel industry , would restore the LiverpOol cotton market and accomplish some freeing of highway transport . They do n't intend to cut social services or armaments or even food subsidies . The only cuts contemplated are in wasteful administration , which would be unlikely to reduce the heavy tax burden greatly . As to the idea of free international trade , the Tory policy flatly states : " Until we bridge the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be kept . " The Tories would abandon bulk purchasing of food and raw materials by the government and would reopen commodity exchanges . But there is a reservation that purchases of certain commodities from British colonies'would be given a " guaranteed market at remunerative prices . " The policy statement is n't likely to inspire any big swing of votes to the Conservative party . What , is more likely to achieve this is a gradual realization on the part of the electorate that the Labor government ? is failing to deliver the goods . ? ? " GOT A LIGHT ? " may become an overworked question here . ' ? Britons are likely to find matches as well as cigarettes scarce again as a result of cuts in dollar imports . Reduced imports of timber from Canada will trim 5% to 10% Britain 's daily output . ' ? MANY UNION , 1LEADERS who fear a slump is coming hope to get wage boosts before this happens.ao the workers ' pufehitaing power can be maintained .

" This view , like that of many trade unionists , fails to appreciate ** economic position . The workers who think a bigger wage packet , unrelated to the costs of production , will bring them Utopia fail to realize that Britain ca n't live on its own fat . The building industry is a good example . As Britain cuts Imports of non-ferrous metals and timber from dollar areas she must reduce building activities . Either she 'll be short of raw materials or , if she goes to the soft currency countries for them , she 'll find their higher prices hike building costs prohibitively . ? BRITISH VACATIONERS ' are n't spending much this summer , Though hotel bookings at seaside holiday resorts are officially said to be " up to expectations , " storekeepers , cafe proprietors , picture postcard sellers and other traders complain that holiday makers are hanging onto their money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are down 30% from last summer . A restaurant keeper at a wellknown coastal resort reports : " Many people pay $24 to $30 a week for their room and $10 for railroad fares so they have little left to spend on entertainment or in cafes or stores . " ? ? ? A FREE COCOA MARKET would bring Britain more needed foreign exchange , argued L. J. Cadbury in a plea for reopening of the London market . Speaking at the annual meeting of Cadbury Brothers , one of Britain 's largest chocolate manufacturing firms , he said : " Prior to the war we had been buying cocoa in world markets for over 100 years and a study of world prices was an essential part of our business , but we still have cocoa bought for us by the Ministry of Food . " Nearly half of Britain 's $40 million of cocoa , chocolate and confectionery exports during 1948 went to dollar and other hard currency areas . In 1938 , these exports totaled $6 million . ? ? ? BRITONS HOPE . eventually to attract American investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. participation is limited to aid in research projects . One American mission is studying British methods of dealing with tropical pests ; second is looking into agricultural and veterinary problems in Africa ; a third probes rice production in British Guiana . Meantime , the British themselves have contributed some $250 million in grants and loans since 1940 , for development and welfare in the colonies . Some $100 million of this has already been spent . This sum does n't include the $80 million spent on the peanut growing project in Africa , which is being run by the Overseas Food Corp , Then there 's the $530 million added by the colonial governments themselves . This adds up to Ft total cost , for work approved or in hand , of well over $800 million . ? ? ?
