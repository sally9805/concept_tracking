With the final chord of the Prelude to Die Meister singer , the courtly figure on the podium put down his baton , bowed elegantly to his audience , and strode from the stage . The orchestra and audience remained in their seats , but Serge Koussevitzky did not return . In his place , amid a sudden hush , gold-spectacled Henry Cabot , president of the Boston Symphony Orchestra , slowly mounted the stage . The word had already gotten out that Harry Cabot had a very special announcement to make , and most of the audience had a good idea of what it was . <P> In 24 years , Bostonians had come to boast of their Russian-born conductor as their grandparents once boasted of Emerson or Dr. Holmes . He was a welcome autocrat at any Brahmin table , and when his concerts were over , Boston dowagers liked to flock backstage to kiss and be kissed on both cheeks . <P> Members of the orchestra were not so affectionate . They knew him in rehearsal as a sweatered tyrant ( " Do n't spik @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who would exhaust them by demanding repetitions until his long-awaited " Vonnderful ! Ah , vonnderful ! " finally came . But they shared with him a fierce pride in their orchestra , which Bostonians-critics , musicians and public-regard as America 's best . ( Less partisan critics believe that the Boston and the Philadelphia are hard to choose between , with the New York Philharmonic a strong third . ) <P> No Ovation . Now Cabot , in his dry Yankee voice , read a letter from Koussevitzky , announcing his retirement . When Cabot had finished , he looked expectantly up at the balcony , but Koussevitzky was not sitting where Cabot had hoped he would be . His bride of a year , who was there , quietly slipped out . Koussevitzky had gone to his room to change his shirt ; he wanted no demonstration . <P> The old conductor had carefully planned his retirement . " When I was young , " he explained afterwards , " I told myself I would retire at the highest point in my career . I feel that it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1949 . Koussevitzky will go on conducting until he has celebrated his 25th anniversary in Boston next year-marking a longer period as conductor of the Boston Symphony than any man before him . He was pleased with his timing : " It is very Koussevitzky . It is my style . " <P> No Shock . The choice of Koussevitzky 's successor was something of a surprise , but not a shock . Koussevitzky 's 29-year-old protg Leonard Bernstein had long had the inside track with his sponsor , but not with the symphony 's trustees . The post went instead to 56-year-old Alsatian Charles Mnch , who first came to the U.S. in December 1946 , has since guest-conducted in Boston , New York , Chicago and Los Angeles . <P> Bostonians will find some things about Charles Mnch very Koussevitzky . As the elegant conductor of the Paris Conservatoire Orchestra ( " the oldest and best orchestra in France , " says Mnch ) , " le beau Charles " was the idol of lady concertgoers . Like Koussevitzky himself ( whose second wife was rich ) , Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a Swiss condensed-milk millionaire , inherited a fortune said to be close to $1,000,000.
