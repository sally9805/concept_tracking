For the past two years the top prize money for U.S. artists has been not the famed Carnegie International but Pepsi-Cola 's " Portrait of America " contest . But Pepsi-Cola 's President Walter S. Mack Jr . has not been a happy man . Try as he did to stay behind the curtains and let a group of painters run the show , painters and critics alike seemed inclined to gang up on him as a soda-pop Medici , a bumbling Borgia ( TIME , Dec. 31 ) . <P> Last week Mack , complaining that he had " been in the hands of others , " announced a new strategy for giving away $25,750 a year without getting slapped for doing it . Pepsi 's 1946 contest will have a new name : " Paintings of the Year " ( to avoid the taunts of jingoism that " Portrait of America " got ) ; a new director : balding , milk-mild Roland McKinney , ex-director of Los Angeles ' County Museum . There will still be plenty of prize money ( $15,250 ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that winners can go and do better .
