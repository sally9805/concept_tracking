Last fortnight U.S. authors blinked and dived for their typewriters . The biggest cash literary prize ever was offered to book writers . Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer announced that , for the " best book of the year , " fiction or nonfiction , it would award $100,000 in advance of publication , add 20 for each copy sold above the first 50,000 . <P> M.G.M. knew what it was doing . Movie rights of top best-sellers have recently cost producers more than $100,000 . By acquiring the rights before publication , M.G.M. will escape the cut-throat competitive bidding which sends up the price of anything that looks remotely like another Gone With the Wind . For its prize money M.G.M. will acquire the movie rights , control the legitimate stage and radio rights of its prize book . <P> Only manuscripts accepted for book publication by 25 " Grade A " publishers will be eligible for the prize . Before next June 15 , these publishers will submit their entries to M.G.M. From these a dozen or so manuscripts will be winnowed , sent to a " board of experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ literary critics who will choose the " best book of the year , " receive an M.G.M. retainer for their trouble . <P> The idea was born when M.G.M. 's Voldemar Vetluguin persuaded M.G.M. 's Louis B. Mayer that books with a million readers are better movie material than Broadway plays seen by only 100,000.
