Job of the Army 's Ordnance Department is to supply the Army with guns and tanks , powder and explosives . On the business of turning out powder , for everything from pistols to 16-in. guns , Ordnance had to start pretty close to scratch . <P> Last week Ordnance dedicated with due fuss &; feathers the first of its three new smokeless powder plants . Standing in the soggy red clay of southwest Virginia ( six miles from Radford ) , 22,000 workmen who had done the job heard praises for their work from such military bigwigs as Under Secretary of War Robert Porter Patterson , Major General Charles Macon Wesson . Earlier , visitors and workmen had strolled through Radford 's 4,400 scarred acres , inspected its 639 small and scattered buildings , seen demonstrations of escape chutes ( see cut ) for quick slides to safety when fire and powder get together . But what pleased everybody most was that they had beaten a schedule . The Radford Ordnance Works , built and operated by Hercules Powder Co. , was going into production three months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production lines starts rolling this week , it will turn out smokeless powder at the rate of 100,000 Ib. a day , nearly 50% more than the U. S. was producing on a peacetime schedule . And when Radford 's other two lines go into production this summer , its output will be 300,000 . <P> Another new plant at Charlestown , Ind . ( capacity 600,000 Ib. daily ) is well ahead of schedule , will go into production , operated by Du Pont , in April . And the third , at Childersburg , Ala. , will be ready to turn out smokeless powder at the rate of 300,000 Ib. by midsummer . No matter what unforeseen delays might do later , one critical bottleneck was cracked , would soon break . By autumn , the Army and Navy would have a wartime powder supply .
