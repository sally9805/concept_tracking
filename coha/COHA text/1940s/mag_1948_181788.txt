. . . The Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread : <P> And when he had given thanks , he brake it , and said , Take , eat : this is my body , which is broken for you : this do in remembrance of me . <P> After the same manner also he took the cup , when he had supped , saying , This cup is the new testament in my blood : this do ye , as oft as ye drink it , in remembrance of me . <P> For as often as ye eat this bread , and drink this cup , ye do shew the Lord 's death till he come . <P> -I Corinthians 11 : 23-26 <P> By whatever denominational name Christians call themselves , whether they receive the Sacrament standing or kneeling at an altar rail or in their pews , whether they drink wine in a chalice , or grape juice in a paper cup , or drink nothing at all , Christians all over the world next Sunday will be performing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the New Testament was collected and canonized , the Communion was the core and center of the faith of the tiny Christian sect . They met to celebrate it in private houses . Outsiders were exeluded ; even " catechumens " ( those not yet baptized ) were permitted to be present only for part of the rite . And for centuries they met as outlaws in danger of death . <P> " Here We Stand . " On May 19 , 303 A.D. , in the Algerian city of Cirta ( now Constantine ) , one Munatus Felix , high priest of the emperor , personally led a raid on a Christian service . He took with him a stenographer , whose report , taken in shorthand , sounds disconcertingly familiar to modern ears . <P> " Bring out whatever scriptures you have got , " commanded Felix , after his men had collected all the evidence they could find . A subdeacon brought only one large book , explaining that the lectors kept the rest . Felix . . . said to them : " Identify the lectors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are . " Felix said to them : " . . . Tell us their names . " The sub-deacons ' said : " We are not informers . Here we stand . Command us to be executed . " Felix said : " Put them under arrest . " <P> No one knows how many thousands were rounded up in such raids and executed . They could easily have saved their skins by staying home and saying their prayers in comfortable privacy . But they came together because they had to ; they felt themselves to be a corporate whole-the living church of Christ . And for the Church to live , the Eucharist , or Holy Communion , had to be performed . <P> " Heave It Higher . " In his scholarly study of the Eucharist , The Shape of the Liturgy ( Dacre Press , London , 1945 ) , Liturgist Dom Gregory Dix writes of a trend that came after the 4th Century . Multiplication of churches began to spread the clergy thin , and led to the short , popular " low Mass " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took little part . A notion also arose that the Communion was only for those whose lives were almost sinless . As a result of these and other factors , says Dix , the Communion came to be looked upon more &; more as a rite which the priesthood performed for the laity , rather than with it . The congregation came to look , rather than to participate . " Heave it higher , Sir Priest ! " was the plea of the medieval layman when he could not see the Host at the consecration.
