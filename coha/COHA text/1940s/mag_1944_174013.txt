Washington 's Latin American circles were abuzz with an acid anecdote last week . A Peruvian surgeon and a Venezuelan architect ( so the story ran ) were dining with two men from the U.S. State Department . They discussed whose profession was the oldest . " Mine , " said the surgeon , " God created Eve out of Adam 's rib . . . by a surgical operation . " " Mine , " said the architect , " God first created the world out of chaos . . . the work of an architect . " The two State Department men kept mum . " And what do you say ? " the Latin Americans finally asked . Said one of the State Department men : " We were wondering who created chaos . " <P> As U.S.-Latin American policy drifted sluggishly around Argentina 's request for a Pan-American conference ( TiME , Nov. 6 ) , Latin Americans floundered in chaos . Said one Latin diplomat : " Take a look ! The Pan American Union accepts Argentina 's request unanimously . Notes are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' consulted by us , say they will not impede such a meeting . We go back to our chancellories and cook up suggestions to send to our Governments . Then we are told by our Foreign Ministers that U.S. Ambassadors have pressed them to take no initiative . At this rate the Argentines wo n't get their conference until even their meat cans are wrinkled . <P> " So back we go to the State Department . The Immutables look graver than usual . They have sent no instructions to the Ambassadors . They do n't know what we are talking about . There are cold eyes , metallic smiles and silence . <P> " Then our inferiority complexes come to the surface . We feel that our noses are shiny . We stumble over chairs , drop books or ash trays when we put an elbow on the desks of the Immutables . If at that moment a little Immutable would hand us a yoyo , the tension would be broken . We 'd have something in our hands to play with . " <P> Postwar Kindergarten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Department 's current series of " Informal Talks " about postwar organization . At the first two , the Latin diplomats sat like school children ( they claimed ) , while Acting Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius told them about the postwar world . At the third " Talk " last week , Uruguay and Venezuela protested against the postwar plan sketched out at Dumbarton Oaks . Other protests were expected . <P> The Latins were far from united , but most felt that " Talks " were not a satisfactory substitute for a full-fledged conference of Foreign Ministers to discuss the postwar world and the vexed question of Argentina . Some diplomats suspected that the State Department was planning to broaden the " Talks " until it could say : " What is there left to talk about ? " <P> But the Latins could hope that the chaos would not last much longer . Washington buzzed with rumors of imminent changes in the State Department .
