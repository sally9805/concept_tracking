txt That popular dinnertable poser . " Where 's all the butter ? " bobs Up just as frequently out here , in the heart of America 's dairy region , - as it does in New York . Chicago or Los Angeles . The main difference is that hereabouts the question is far from academic . For butter is getting scarce in its home territory . Minnesota dairy experts are blaming everyone from the Office of Price Administration to eastern " pirates , " who , they claim , are raiding this state 's producing communities to supply consumers on the Atlantic Seaboard . In a sense , shortages here have resulted from a natural evolution in dairy marketing practices which have been speeded up by wartime conditions and a rising standard of living in communities where war money is flowing freely . Pressure in the big population centers of the East and Far West is driving buyers into the rich dairy states of Minnesota . Wisconsin and Iowa for fluid milk as well as for taitter . Milk Shipped Out by the Carload One farm community in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six carloads of milk a day to Dallas and New York City . A year ago , it was shipping only one ear Improvements in refrigeration , transport anti handling keep the milk fit for consumption for several days . But students of the Midwest 's dairy economy say , that today 's ready money and the farmer 's habitual dislike for restrictions on his marketing practices are responsible for carrying out of the state thousands of pounds of butter that normally would be consumed locally . Whether this tendency will be altered to any extent by the recent War Food Administfation announcement that military and other Government purchasing - agencies would refrain from buying butter until next March remains to be seen . While the action probably will relieve shortages in areas far distaut from producing centers , the continued high level of consumer purchasing power is expected to draid sway from the dairy states all the butter than can be produced . According to Professor E F. Koller. agricultural economist at the University of Minnesota 's farm school , many Minnesota dairy- men are throwing over long established outlets for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Despite the ceiling price on butter , buyers find many ways to evade the regulation . Drayage fees are a favorite device . The buyer makes an agreement to pay the ceiling rate for butter at the loading platform . and then offers the producer an extra $100 or S200 if he will set it in the freight car . " We believe this is a shortsighted practice , " Mr. Koller said " Dairymen should keep their established outlets and not be lured by easy money . After the war they may want their established customers , the firms they have been doing business with for years . They may find that these buyers have gone elsewhere " Meanwhile , G J. Patsey , sales manager of the Northland Milk &; Ice Cream Co back from a tour of Minnesota for the war bond drive , said that many small creameries in communities he had visited had closed down their butter churns in favor of shipping cream to the East . This has come about because there is no price ceiling on sweet cream in commercial quantities , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Butter As a result . creamery operators find it much to their advantage to sell their cream for as high as 72 cents per pound of butterfat content , saving themselves the extra work of churning The New York ceiling price for the best grade of butter is only 43i , cents a pound The butter shortage is having , repercussions in other directions on the home grounds The development causing most concern , coincident with the recent boost in coupon value of butter to 16 points a pound . is a growing tendency among consumers to turn to oleomargarine as a substitute . Reporting to its members on margarine sales recently , the American Butter Institute pointed out that for the eight-month period January through August . 1943. 307,113,429 pounds were - sold. an increase of 45 6 , ; , over the 1942 total for the corresponding period of 210,911.135 pounds les of colored margarine continued to i use The August . 1943 total of 247.785 pounds was nearly three times the 1942 August sales of 65.264 pounds . Olen Is Invading Wisconsin Wisconsin serves as a . good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the butter market by the oleo interests . " Since 1931 , Wisconsin has erected barriers to discourage sale of the spread . In 1935 , the state legislature boosted the tax on margarine from 6 cents to 15 cents a pound , and continued in ' force license regulations for its sale and manufacture . Producers must pay an an- nual fee of $1,000 ; wholesalers , $500. and retailers , $25 . Until three months ago , you could n't buy oleomargarine in a single Wisconsin retail store But the picture has changed rapidy . The state department of agriculture said last week that more than 69 licenses to sell the butter substitute had been filed . Ten Milwaukee stores now offer oleo to their customers , and Madison . the state capital , has 12 groceries licensed to market it . Merchants add the 15-cents-per pound tax to their final sales price . Margarine which requires but four ration points is selling for 35 to 37 cents a pound . whereas butter , when available . brings tip to 40 cents a pound and 16 points . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flow of margarine into consumer channels , they hope to combat it on its own grounds . Researchers at the University of Wisconsin have developed a new " spread for bread " made of milk solids and fortified with vitamins . The product is not yet ready for the market , but will be tested shortly in Chicago and St Louis Ordinary margarine is made chiefly from cottonseed oil , soybean and peanut oils or coconut oil ( when available . ) Looking at the butter production and distribution picture from a national angle , dairymen in the Middle West are not inclined to be optimistic over the prospect of increased supplies for civilians in the near future . The Bureau of Agricultural Economics reported this week that butter production in the first eight months of 1943 totaled 1.261 million pounds . a drop t , 13.9% , tr6m the corresponding period a year ** production was estimated " at 151 9 million pounds against 167.3 million pounds in August . 1942. a decline of 9.2% ) .

In the past , the disparity between production and consumption trends in butter could be equalized out of storage ' stocks .

Today there are 231 million pounds in storage  --  but every pound is controlled by the Government . The American Dairy Association , meanwhile , is starting a vigorous campaign to obtain the reduction tor present point values on butter and to increase production in the slack season .
