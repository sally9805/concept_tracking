RULERS ' MORNING A Story JOSEPH GEORGE HITREC ow do I feel ? Edward Parsons rose on his elbows and looked around the room . For seven years , every morning , that question had encompassed all the known shades of good and bad ; it possessed the uncanny power of resolving the corning day in a flash . Do I feel good ? He stroked his stubble and looked at his wife . She was still asleep , only partly covered , and in that child-like peace the soft undercore of her character seemed to beam through fat and years . Or not so good ? He climbed out of bed and walked to the balcony , he scratched himself , raised the collar of his pajamas and pressed it around his neck . The sun had already disintegrated Connaught Circle  --  the very heart of New Delhi  --  into separate areas , bright green , brown , gray  --  the lawn , paths cutting it in a thoughtful pattern , the asphalt road binding it like a satin garter . Before all that brightness his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this dew , this nip in the air , always morning , yes ! Warmly inert , his mind registered the white-cloaked men scurrying around and across the Circle ; they always carried something , when did they sleep ? On the sunny side the palms glittered ; the long colonnaded building opposite was still in shadow . I feel good , he thought , could n't be better . He went into the bathroom . Somewhere in the flat a door shut gently ; little Bab , out for her morning walk . Every morning , that door click ushered in a little snore stability , another layer of self-respect . In this country children were a better idea than in most . He rinsed his denture , gargled a few times loudly  --  it was time Pat woke up in the next room  --  and put the denture in his mouth . The flavor of the antiseptic was sharp and cleansing . The sun leapfrogged from the windowpane onto the mirror ; he looked at the image critically . It was n't bad , considering . . . but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries  --  nothing alarming ; incipient pouches , seemingly there for the first time , the skin underneath mildly blue . All right , mirror , we all age . There is more silver on the temples , the mirror said impersonally ; not so fast , Ed ! Well , mirror , a few more years and I wo n't have to go fast any more . He stepped back , the image blurred , and the general effect became more pleasing . When he returned to the bedroom there was a knock on the door . He pulled the sheet over Pat ; she looked at him wide-eyed , still some distance away . " Chutia havi , " he said , " and one of these days you 'll catch rheumatism ; it 's still quite cool , Come in ! " he said aloud . The boy came in with the tray , set it on the table at her side , and went . They sipped the hot tca . The sound of their lips and the fine fresh aroma brought complete awakening . The various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was speech , family , business , and between them half-lit lanes , still drowsy , and they were being crossed by Bab , and right now by Pat ; they exuded color , scents , and familiar words , and all of it geared together , smoothly , like the vitals of a delicate wrist watch . Yes , morning is all right and I feel good . Now that the boy had gone , Pat had thrown off the cover and lay only in her nightgown , a pink one , his favorite color . She looked wholesome , though soft and not so young , and there was something about her very white skin , forever slipping out of that gown , that was comfortable and reliable , and perhaps it was the face after all , indomitably rosy through the years of heat and dust , or the silky blonde hair that guarded her neck , like a permanent insulation against age and erosion . But mornings were like that . Turning over on his side , he slapped her gently , lovingly . Of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but slapping her like this was one that did n't seem to depend on time . The bed was warm with their combined smells , the disorder was an intimate one , and even the rip in the pillow-case seemed somehow a part of a greater unity . " Feeling good , Ed ? " She smiled half-ironically , half maternally . He was still a great fellow , despite the long familiarity , and now , looking at him above the pillow , she saw him only as a man without an office , without anything to do , without clothes and second thought . But when he tried to come nearer , she held her hand out . " The doctor said no , Ed . " " Damn the doctor ! " ( He remained poised , thinking it over . ) " And anyway , he said to use discretion . " The recollection of the doctor overwhelmed his other ideas ; professionals always complicated simple issues . Yet even the remembrance of the pills , the tedious treatment , and the bills could not win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and took the newspaper which the boy had brought . His mind worked again efficiently , now that it was allowed to . The smell of the first cigarette gave the air a crisp scent of worldliness . H E READ the Public Notices page , the Trade Notices , and then spent a long time on Classifieds . Someone wanted an electrical engineer , a European ; someone was being awfully optimistic , it was wartime . He went back to yesterday 's deal . A good deal , I made a lot of money , wait till she hears ! A few more like that and I wo n't have to work . Being on one 's own has its advantages , especially in wartime ; now if I 'd worked for somebody no amount of vision would have helped me . Remembering the transaction made him warmly happy . A few more strokes of luck and we could pack up to the Hills until the war 's over . He suddenly realized that his wellbeing dated from yesterday , that the sleep had only furbished it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Give me that part , " she said . The paper divided , both sank lazily and read . Their feet met where the beds touched . Slowly , absently , he rubbed his big toe up and down her ankle . He wondered if he should buy her a present . Why should n't P We can afford it now , or a nice check to do with as she pleases , though she might go haywire , women are like that . Holding it out on her was an act of meanness . I will tell her , perhaps at breakfast . He poured himself another cup of tea . The sound of car-horns strayed into the room . Like all sounds from outside , always , it brought the realization of the frailty of all little worlds that happened to be inside bigger ones . But , he thought , not for always . It was in the main a question of perspective . On the front page , the fighting had run into a dust-storm . Somewhere in the bog and sludge of a tropical island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; in the hills of Arakan mortar shells blossomed in the paddy fields ; and somewhere in the open blue above Delhi a big plane , or maybe several , churned the morning freshness . He held his breath and listened , but their roar was dull and it was going away . He turned the page and coughed ; I ought to cut down on my tobacco . The inside page was nearer home : seven donkeys parading the streets , each with the name of an official , that was a good one ! even though it bred contempt . A nonentity of nine , ten , eleven letters good lord , who thinks of such names ? ? writes about independence , on and on , miles of it  --  blah , blah , blah independence , they ca n't think of another subject , now can they ? He tried to put himself in the writer 's place , but gave it up . He turned to Pat and flicked the page with his finger . " If it does n't make you sick ! Eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squatting on our borders and these chaps talk of independence now . Where 's their sense of proportion , what do they know about ruling ? Do they know you 've got to rule for a hell of a long time to know something about it ? " " Well , who does ? " She watched him and around her mouth were the beginnings of amusement . She , too , had dropped her paper and was covering her bare knees with it . " Do n't be silty , Pat ; we do , of course . " " Who 's we ? " She smiled but the smile was benevolent . " All of us , what did you think ? The government , all the officials , every man of status . You and me , for instance . What 's funny about that ? " " You a ruler , Ed ? " She found his foot with hers and scratched it . " Go on , darling . " " I 'm trying to talk to you seriously . " " Edward Parsons , Junior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How big is the terri-tory ? " " Oh pipe down , you . . . " Her way of smiling had n't changed in all that time and when she teased there was no sting in it . He bent over her , ruffled her hair , and smacked her bare calf . " If you wo n't grow up yourself , I ca n't make you . Come on , we ought to be getting up . " He threw the paper at her and rose . When the tune in his head steadied he whistled it . He went into the bathroom once more and shaved . The cream smelled MAGAZINE of lilacs in a soft breeze , of an open landscape under a lather of clouds  --  it was a fine invention . Could they have thought of it ? Could they invent the safety razor in another thousand years ? And what of the electricity , the generators , transformers , bulbs , switches , and other things ? Invention was civilization . You ca n't rule somebody else until you 're civilized yourself . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things at the wrong times , and , then , finally , bellyache about the strain of your bellyaching . That 's all this war means to you . The astringent set mild fire to his cheeks . He walked back into the room and began to dress . He sprinkled a little talcum under his arms and a little on his feet , before pulling on the socks . These made a fine morning into a fine day ; did they think of them ? She , too , had got out of bed and gone to wash . He heard the big tap gushing loudly ; there was true fastidiousness for you He stepped into his trousers and pulled them up . Wonder if I should tell her , might as well combine it with a present . Being fully dressed was being fully conscious ; the red tie led to the black bow-tie  --  are we dining out tonight ? He liked dressing in the evening ; one felt purged and equal to everyone else wearing the same symbol . It was a funny life and a funny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pat came out in a spotted blue gown , Shocked and prodded into life , she appeared even younger . He watched her in the mirror . She sat before the dressing table and combed her hair , then she buttoned the gown at the breast and rose . " I 'll see about breakfast . " He felt momentarily lonely . Too long married , I suppose . He assembled the newspaper and put it under the night-table ; he was finished . The traffic outside had become a regular rumble ; someone was clapping hands . rrHE drawing and dining rooms were combined , separated by a half-book-shelf that faced the door of the hall . Pat was already at the table . Everything shone brightly , the smell of fresh coffee made it definitive , irrevocable . He went to the desk and took the file , then sat down at the table and propped the file against the flower-vase . He buttered his toast and took the cup which she pushed toward him . " Are we dining out tonight , Pat ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will probably want to play bridge . " " I do n't like the Fergussons , but I suppose we 'd better . " Her smile was the sublimation of the entire morning . He ate the eggs which the boy brought and remembered Chotturam , the driver . Yesterday , Chotturam was not at his post when he came out of the office ; he was going to be fined eight annas . I think he knows it too . " Ed , I 'm having trouble with the ayah . I think she 's stealing . Bab likes her food sweet but she could n't eat all that sugar . " " If you 're sure , sack her . " " That 's easily said ; willysa try to get me another one ? " " Talk to her then . I subscribe to a little regulation squeeze , but stealing is quite another matter . Only you 've got to be sure , Pat . " The front door clicked and Bab came in with the ayah . She kissed her parents ; her cheeks were like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a prickly-heat rash on her neck and arms and the ointment had dried over it in white crusts . She had light blue eyes and sandy hair ; she talked impetuously , four years old . " Look , daddy , a black boy da ' me this . " She opened her hand and showed a dirty wooden top . " Look , he played like this . " " No , you do n't , " her father said . " Give me that . " He took it and gave it to the ayah . " Throw that away , Kanji ! How many times must I tell you not to let her touch dirty things ? " He turned to his wife : " This is your department , darling . I wish to God you 'd do something about it . " " Go and wash now , Bab , " she said . " I 'll see you after breakfast . " As she was dragged into the hall , Bab turned around and waved . " It 's getting lovelier every day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they both laughed . The idea of babu-English was still as droll as in their first year in India , and now they appreciated the finer points . " It wo n't be so lovely in a few years , " he said , " but she wo n't be the only one . " A few years ago the thought would have poisoned them both . Not now . We 're all in the same boat , he thought ; one of the things the war did to us , among others . Now it was merely amusing . He opened the file . The clean-typed contract he had prepared yesterday was on top . He clipped it to the file-cover . " Let me glance through it , " he said to Pat . He read it again , although he knew it by heart . The boy came in carrying a new pot of coffee ; he set the tray an the table and began to pour . " Tell the ayah I want to talk to her after breakfast , " Pat said to the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her , listening , the dark , steamy spout missed the cup and the coffee splashed on the table , over the cruet , the file , and the clean copy of the contract . Then it ceased , just as suddenly . Both of them jumped and the boy shrank back babbling . " For God 's sake ! " he shouted . " You fool ! " she said . The servant ran for a cloth and the two of them stood over the table and looked at each other . " God almighty ! " he said through his teeth . By then blood had rushed to his head and swept everything before it . He could n't think of a word . His hands trembled and he thrust one of them in his pocket . " Easy now , Ed ! " she said . She had wiped the file with her napkin and shaken it . She took the contract copy , dabbed it , and when all the liquid had gone into the white cloth , she wiped the table . The boy returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , still clutching the fork and gasping . When the words came , they were short and murderous , but absurdly inexpressive of the tumult inside him . " You clumsy idiot , you . . . I " It was unreasonable , of course , and in the back of his mind somewhere he knew he was overdoing it , but all that was poignant and frenzied seemed to be heaved out in front . His throat dried up and he heard the beat of his temples . Suddenly , too , the room lost its freshness and the street noise closed in . Bundled up in his wrath and in the sharp , deadly words that flitted around his mind , was this horror of the street-noise coming nearer . I must n't , he reminded himself , I must n't , the doctor said . Better count , quickly , one . . . two , three , four . . . . He was five when his mother first said : " Behave or I 'll call the dark Indian ! " It was a terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you , Edward ? " It had been enough to still him for hours . Why ? It sprung on him without warning , a pulverizing horror evanescent with images . . . . G ET hold of yourself , Ed . Sit down . " She put her hand on his shoulder . The boy had again vanished . It was an unreal hand , though gentle , and its pressure forced him back into the chair , like a man uncertain of his seat . But the hand in his pocket shook as before . " God , they 're all the same , " he said with difficulty . He thought he was beginning to control himself ; he gathered the stained contract and put it into the file . Six , seven . . . Words coalesced painfully and he fought hard to keep them back . He closed the file and rose ; 1 must n't , I must n't , his mind said . He walked to the drawing room and opened the desk ; a little time is all I need eight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed it on top of the first one . On the street , a car-horn sounded three times . " I 'll get your coat and topee , " she said . He walked to the balcony and looked out at the Circle . Long , welling processions crossed the park in all directions  --  little brown men dressed in white , their unremitting progress charged with an undefined menace . The centipede ! He recalled the newspaper article , whole lines began crowding back , blah , blab , blah , one on top of another , like the little bastards in the park , not stopping , face after face and all alike , always going somewhere , swarming , like some treacher ous vermin . Again his temples beat louder . Fifteen , sixteen . . . H is sister 's marriage had finally crystallized it . He had been sixteen . Sister Martha in London , who thought nothing of marrying into another race . Who thought beauty could be black and equally noble . Foolish Martha . " Martha dear , it 's an awful jump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You are prejudiced , mother , why try to conceal it ? Really , you talk as if he were a Zulu from darkest Africa . He 's cultured and modern , you know that . Besides , I like brown men and he 's one of the most attractive I 've met . " " But Martha , we know nothing of his background . . . . " " What difference does that make ? He 's lived here ever since he came to school . This is his background and home and we 're going to live in London . Anyway , I love him . " Tragic Martha , who always chose the long road to wisdom . Martha , whose firm , white body would be explored by dark hands , shriveled at the knuckles , bleached from inside . And those eternally purple lips , as if bruised . . . H ERE , Ed , " she said . She held his cotton jacket behind him and he slipped into it , and when the seams gripped his shoulders he felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't think about it now , forget it , remember what the doctor said . Would you like a capsule ? " " No , thanks , " he said . " I 'll be all right in a moment . " They walked to the outer door and she held him around the waist . Her soft touch was the single communication with the warm intimacy of that earlier morning , but though reassuring it was already faint . The face , too , looked worn after the strain , the blue dots of her gown seemed mocking in comparison . " Try and be back early , " she said . " We 're lunching at home today . " He bent down to kiss her cheek , stiffly . At that moment he would have liked her to smell stronger . Smells were symbolic , they had degrees , like other things in life ; so much depended on them . Ile remembered their flowers . They were strong-smelling and loud-colored , but usually dead by the evening . Yes , smells were important . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The narrow street in a swirling flood of humanity , the dust and the sun beating down on them obliquely . He had been caught in it like a fly in a large pool of five years ago , and terrified to the bone , but afraid to show it . " Look at them , " he had said to the friend . " We 'll never get out . " Philip was driving . He had spent years in the East ; the sight of a large crowd , even demonstrators , did n't worry him . " They 're all right , Ed . A lot of noise , that 's all . Would you believe it , there 's so many of them they 're pushing the car . " " What do you suppose they 're shouting , Phil ? " " Oh something , how should I know ? They always are " " Christ , they smell , do n't they ! " " They always do when they 're excited , " Philip said . " But they 'll be all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hot perspiring bodies , that moved down the street with the imminence of an elemental calamity . An overpowering , warm odor that made him turn yellow . Like the dank vapor of a jungle swamp , sweet and stomach-turning . It brought sweat to his forehead . He never understood why he did n't getsick . He leaned on the window , pressing his lips and holding his breath , and the flood tore at the car and around it for a full hour , and then subsided , gradually , unwillingly , and left them suddenly alone , like a boat perched on the tallest sandbank . T AKE care of yourself , dear , " she said . As he left her he had the impression that she had somehow grown more fragile , that standing in the open door with her hand on her gown , and the murky hall framing her from behind , she was something of himself , equally helpless , equally unhappy . Downstairs , he got into the car ; the driver started . The shops in the arcades were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't tell her after all ; the thought of the present left him mutely unmoved ; I 'll think about it , there 's no hurry , one never knows . He saw Chotturam 's white cap and again remembered ; this time I 'll do it , I 'm damned if I wo n't , that 'll teach him ! It 's the only thing they really understand . He watched the white cap and the streak of grease along the rim and the decision in him boiled up to a fighting pitch . As the road and the people blurred in the window he finally realized very clearly that they were all against him , that even at this moment they were plotting his doom , that there was still plenty of tough pushing ahead whether he chose to acknowledge it or ignore it .
