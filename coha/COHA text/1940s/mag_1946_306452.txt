The coal strike was over , and it was a clean-cut triumph for Harry Truman . <P> From the beginning to the end , Harry Truman had not uttered a public word . But his victory had not been easy . His strategy had been simple-he had set the power of the Government against John Lewis , like a tractor against a redwood tree , and had waited for something to give . <P> John L. had a terrible weapon and no qualms about using it . He had the means of freezing up U.S. industry , the means of hurting the U.S. abroad . He had allies as well as power . Many a businessman , desperate for coal , was for peace at almost any price . Labor backed him , from the simple instinct of self-preservation . <P> Firm Stand . Harry Truman 's advisers were divided . His " labor specialist , " Reconversion Director John Roy Steelman , was plainly for appeasement . His crony , George Allen , the rolypoly RFC director , did n't want to be mad at anybody when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clifford , the President 's counsel , ghostwriter and onetime naval aide , clamored to stand and fight . The Secretary of the Interior , huge J. A. ( " Cap " ) Krug , agreed . So did Attorney General Tom Clark . So did the President . <P> Once he had made his mind up , the President ordered John Steelman to stay away ; Mr. Steelman went on a hunting trip . Then the President made Clifford , Krug and Clark the members-and the only members-of his GHQ . He set out to take and keep the offensive . <P> Deaf Ears . From the nerve-racking start to the triumphant finish , the four agreed that there was only one way to battle Lewis-throw everything at him and stay deaf to every counter-offer short of unconditional surrender . The first Administration blows , the injunction and the $3,500,000 fine , thudded home . <P> As each day passed , John Lewis worked harder &; harder at dangling unspoken offers of truce . The bait was not taken . Lawyer Clifford reasoned that when the other side was talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Heavy Weapons . In a way , the effects of the strike were a help to the Truman strategy . Hundreds of thousands were out of work , and angry . Every day the strike lasted , more were thrown out of work . Hundreds of trains were shunted out of service . The thousands of citizens who had jammed postoffices with Christmas bundles to beat the Government 's rail embargo on freight , parcel post and express shipments , raised their voices against Lewis . <P> The White House GHQ , with everything staked on bringing Lewis to his knees , planned an even stricter embargo . They wheeled up other heavy weapons : an all-out Presidential speech , the threat of another fine , the sending of troops to guard the mines . <P> But these supplementary weapons were not necessary . John L. collapsed . With his collapse , an era ended-the 13-year-old era in which labor leaders , because of their implied political power , had been able to go to the White House and get almost anything they asked for .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
