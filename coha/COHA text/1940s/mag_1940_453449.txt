A SENSE of cold coming from under the floor awakened me . There were broad cracks in the floor , from which cold air was blowing . My neck was stiff , my bones ached , my feet were icy cold ; only my head was hot . Besides , the skin of my hands was cracked and hurt me . The floor was covered with a gritty dust and I felt as if my whole body were covered with it . Carefully , so as not to awaken anybody , I slipped out of the room , to the corridor , then to the kitchen ? in search of water to wash in . I had to shake off that night at all costs . Luck helped me . Through the window I spied my rubber tub hanging on the hedge , and in the corridor I found two pails full of water . I had hardly brought it all into the kitchen when the door opened and Olesia entered . Zosia , are you mad ? What are you going to do ? ' Really I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , as you see , I am doing my hair and afterwards I mean to wash and change my dross .

She is going to wash and dress her hair and make herself look pretty , when a woman in her senses would only think of how to make herself look the worst she can . Do you want a Bolshevik to fall in love The first entries in this graphic journal describing the seizure of a front-line Polish hospital by the Bolsheviks appeared in the February issue.with you and carry you off to Moscow ? Look at me ! I have not curled my locks and I hide my hair under my cap and do n't mean to wash , my face until this captivity is over .

Looking at Olesia , I could not help thinking that really there was little risk that even a Bolshevik would run away with her . Olesia looked offended . She continued in a serious voice : It seems to me , Sister Zosia , that jokes are quite out of place at this time , and that you might once in a while listen to your sisters , who , being older in years than you are , have more sense . Instead of washing , you would do better to rub your face with soot . See how provoking you look ! ' Olesia took a small mirror out of her pocket and poked it under my nose . I could not see anything wrong about my face . Surely I looked pretty much as usual ; only fever and exertion had made my eyes larger and unnaturally bright , and circled them with dark blue lines . I should like to be able to write that marble whiteness clothed my face ' ; unfortunately it was not so . My cheeks were as regularly rosy as could be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hectic , but anyway quite out of place , in my opinion , after the dreadful things we had passed through . Olesia , I am sure , scolded me out of sheer kindness , and her grumbling only deleted material potatoes , which we shared with our patients , the awful reality came back to Us again . We had forgotten it in the everyday business and in the everyday joy of being alive . Those dead were still lying under our windows and we were still in ignorance of what had become of the other Sisters . IIalka , our chief , took me with her to the commander of the detachment which had ' conquered ' Cichinicze . He had put up his headquarters in the schoolhouse . Many soldiers and civilians were bustling round . Sticky mud covered the floor . The reception was rather ceremonious . The ' commander , ' a man of about thirty years of age , with a simple clear face , sunburnt and healthy , the type of a corporal of the regular army , could not apparently decide what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ form , ' but could not make up his mind whether he had to be ' venger of the bourgeois ' or a representative of the ' severe authority . ' He received us with his cap on , sitting on a chair , very full of himself and his position ? apparently enjoying himself very much . On our request to give orders to bury the dead , he replied that ' his soldiers were no gravediggers . ' With such a typo one must speak in a very scientific style , a language full of pretentious words , rendered familiar by political meetings and propaganda brochures . So Halka began to expound ' on principle , ' that ' the decomposition of bodies ' threatens with infections ' and ' epidemics ; which , from the point of view of the sanitary condition , may be ' undesirable , ' and suchlike nonsense . All that was graciously listened to , with comprehension , the result being that the commandant promised us to ' practise no sabotage ' and not to oppose the peasants of Cichinicze who would bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We then went out to the president of the local ' committee , ' under escort . This president was apparently the poorest peasant of Cichinicze , dwelling in a half-decayed hut . He was drunk . On hearing our business , he put on a face of shocked and scandalized horror . ' ' What are you thinking about ? ' he said in perfect Russian . ' Bury the " White Guardsmen " ? That must not be . ' When Halka had cleared his doubts by telling him that we had come at the commander 's order , the viceroy of Cichinicze put the whole affair on a business basis , demanding sixty rubles for the digging of the grave . A hard condition it was , considering that our money had been stolen together with our other things , but Halka accepted it . Two men with spades followed us . After a couple of hours , a broad and deep ditch was ready in the middle of the park , under an ash tree . When it came to paying , Halka suddenly discovered that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found ten in mine , Peo and Olesia only two or three . Unexpectedly our patients came to our rescue . One after the other began to pull out money from under his pillow and give it to us without counting : ' Take it , take it all , Sisters , as much as you want . Today you bury these , tomorrow it may be our turn . ' Having collected sufficient money , we left the patients under the care of Staszewicz , and all four of us set to work to carry our dead over to the ash tree . We found a whole crowd standing waiting for us in front of the house . They went in and out among the litters , lifting up the sheets and discussing the wounds amid laughter and jeers . They went to look at the grave and were constantly going to and fro between the ash tree and the house . There was a holiday air among them , an air of expectation , as if waiting for some performance . The soldiers were walking about with the Cichinicze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dead , and the belles ' squealed and pretended to be afraid . deleted material Fury was roused . The beasts wanted to humble us , to trample us down . A young man , with a red band on his arm , kicked at the body lying nearest to the edge of the ditch till it rolled down , nearly smothering Make . Now all set to kicking down the dead into the grave . ' Look , how good we are ! We help you , though you did not even ask us to ! ' This was a little too much . Beside myself with rage , I seized a litter and hurled it at . the crowd . ' Get out ! ' I shouted . The mob retreated a step , but came back the next moment . We were standing on the very edge ; another moment and they would push us into the grave . Peo drew herself up and , standing in front of me , called out : ' You can kill us , but we shall not let you dishonor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Poles , ' jeered somebody in the midst of the mob . ' Yes , Poles ! ' cried Peo defiantly , and took a step forward into the crowd , which retreated involuntarily before her . ' She has a temper ! ' remarked a voice approvingly . I looked at Pco out of the corner of my eye , because I did not want to turn my face away from the crowd . I saw a face as if cut of stone , with slightly drawn eyebrows and a beautiful look in her eyes , of calm contempt . Beside her the head of Olesia , whose pale lips and cheeks had taken a greenish hue . ' Down into the ditch with them ! ' called somebody from the rear . ' Of course , make an end of them . Why all that ceremony ? ' shouted the mob . ' Eat earth together with your boys ! ' But they dared not quite yet . I knew that our minutes were counted . Those behind would push on those in front and it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 0 God , let us die looking them straight in the eyes ? die and not be afraid and not scream ! ' I could trust Pco and myself , and , luckily , Olesia was perfectly petrified . She didnot make a movement , only became more and more pallid . At that moment unexpected help came . Things apparently happen in life as they do in novels . A Bolshevik Commissar began shaming the crowd for quarreling with women , and , when this was of no avail , he threatened them with his revolver and drove the mob away , putting two soldiers on guard , gun in hand , to maintain order . Now that calm was restored , we jumped clown into the grave to help Hallut put the bodies into position . At this moment a sledge drew near . Two peasants threw down the body of a man and drove off . I caught up with them and plied them with questions . They told me that it was a Polish soldier , who had been killed at the entrance of Cichinicze ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people had been afraid to bury him . He was a young man in underclothes only ? no distinguishing marks , no papers or initials , nothing to show his identity . His fine brown face , which death had frozen into a stern expression , was lighted by kindly childish lips and open eyes naively staring at the clouds above . We quickly covered the bodies of the twelve men with sand , but first Bailin took a pinch of earth and threw it into the grave . We did the same . Our lips trembled , as if those unknown women they had left at home were bidding them farewell through us . When the grave was filled in with earth , we knelt down to pray . We recited the ' Angelus ' aloud . It was dark , and no one was left in the garden except the sentries , but it seemed to me as if here once again a bit of Poland had grown into the earth . The third day of captivity Three days of captivity have passed . Life has become systematic . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch all night a couple of hours each . 352 THE ATLANTIC MONTHLY We never undress , and sleep on the floor  --  awaiting dawn as we would salvation . The night is always like some awful nightmare . The patients are more feverish ; sometimes I think one of them is dying . I am so nervous I can hardly find his pulse . I save myself by writing his diary . Towards morning everybody falls asleep . I take the opportunity of that moment to bring water and cut : wood and take my bath , unseen by Olesia . Today a new band of Bolsheviks arrived at Cichinicze , all sailors ? dark , hostile , and mute . They turned all the house upside down , searching it through from cellar to attic , pulling out all the patients ' belongings and sticking bayonets through the straw beds . I wonder if they knew themselves what they were looking for . Each of us was called separately to be questioned . At last they left us in peace . Pco and I went to the kitchen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led by a peasant , short , guns in their hands , all of them very well equipped . Generally speaking , the sailors have a style of their own , but they are coldly cruel and more difficult to manage than all the rest . They ordered us to come out . Before the house we saw Staszewicz , and his two companions , Halka and Olesia , standing in a row against the wall ? in front of them a group of marines , guns in hand , and in the position of ' ready . ' We were told that we were going to be shot for hiding healthy soldiers . Staszewicz , in his white underclothes , was trembling from cold and partly from fear , swearing that he did not know the peasant who had led us from the kitchen here ? that he had never seen him in his life . ' Oh , my God ! ' groaned the Cichinicze Don Juan sweetly . ' Am I quite dumb ? Why , that gentleman ? damn him ? punched my very nose . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned to us , ? ' speak out : is he ill ornot ? Speak the truth and we will let you go free ? if not , you die together with those men . ' We looked at each other , our eyes fixed on those of Halka standing against the wall . How we understood each other I do not know ? but we did . Yes , at a glance we knew : we should lie ! Haiku spoke out first , in a bold , calm , positive way , without a quaver in her voice ? explaining that Staszewicz , was one of our oldest patients . Pei ) offered to bring the hospital diary ( she counted on the probability that the marines did not understand Polish ) . I began to enumerate volubly the possible and impossible diseases those men had gone through . So , you ? , you wanted to cheat us , to cause the death of those people ! ' Shaking the traitor with his right hand , and pounding the man 's face with ltis left till it grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow on the nose and , with a push , sent him sprawling on the snow , where he lay motionless like a beetle , pretending to be dead . The severe and upright judge was very much satisfied with himself and his verdict . He even wanted to show off his graciousness : Staszewicz and his companions were ordered back to the hospital . He then turned to us , asking who was the head nurse . We pointed to Hallo , . Ho ordered her to follow him . Hanka returned after a moment and behind her Bolsheviks , carrying a pail full of herrings and a bag of sugar . In exchange the Commissar asked for cocaine , of which we gave him two boxes . Our fare is getting varied . Beans with herrings , and herrings with sugar ! A wonderful diet for typhoid and dysentery ! Fourth day of captivity We have doctored in the village today . Anczow ? the Commissar who saved us when they wanted to bury us alive together with our dead ? came this morning and told Halka to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is he leading HaIlia ? ' I wondered , and ran after them . I caught up with them on the road . He consented to take me with him too . It appeared that he was taking us to a cottage where a child of four had been badly hurt , playing with a hand grenade . There were a number of patients in the hut , mostly surgical cases . It was dark when we had finished . The women were kissing Anczew 's hands and heaping blessings on his head . On our return we were astonished not to find Peo . Olesia said that she had gone to look for bread , because she could not bear any longer to look at the sick men who had had nothing to cat but herring and peas for three days . She had taken a bag , had thrown it on her back , and had walked from cottage to cottage . Sister Peo , who had proudly challenged the crowd who wanted to push her into the grave ! We saw her as she came back , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ashes . She threw off her bag and sat down heavily . She had been after bread , knocking at every door . She did not know how to beg . Standing on the threshold , she would speak out ih the loud tones of a charity bazaar collector : ' Please , give some bread for the sick . ' The men generally received her with mocking and jeers . A boy threw a dead mouse into the bag she was holding up . But some of the women cut quite large chunks of bread and put them into the bag . And so she had walked on through the village street , as through a street of shame . But the number of life-giving slices grew . We made bread soup for the less ill . For the others we cut the bread in very thin slices and made toast .. It was only black bread , but to us healthy , hardworking girls it smelt ? oh , so good . Halka had said the bread was only for the patients , because it might run short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went about the work silently , amid the calmof our little kitchen , lighted dimly by a lamp . For the first time , after three days , we began to feel animal hunger . But we understood instinctively that though there might be enough bread for us four ? only a tiny bit each ? it wax better not to touch it . Sister Olesia simplified our feelings , expressing them in her own way : ' I do n't want any of your beggars ' bread . ' She wrapped herself tightly in her warm shawl and sat down 011 a log of wood , very cross . I went up to her and kissed her very hard . Dear , good old Olesia ! Fifth day of captivity All the Bolshevik staff is in a great commotion today , ever since this morning . They curse the ' damned Poles ' and throw at us looks full of hate . But in general they seem uneasy . Good old Anczew , who had got somehow accustomed to us , came several times during the day , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us ? the news of Bolshevik defeat . As if we could take part in his sorrow ! It appears that the Polish army has gone forward . The first regiment of Uhlans is marching on to Cichinicze . They have occupied Mr. Bulhak 's estate on the other side of the river , four kilometres from here . Four kilometres only , behind that forest ? why , we can almost touch them ! They may be here at any time ! This band will not hold against their attack . We are out of our wits for joy . In a few hours perhaps I may see Maurice , Dziewanowski , Bostropowicz . . . . Every now and then one of us ran in front of the house to look out into the distance , beyond the river . And so everybody in the house , we and the Bolsheviks , spent the whole day in a state of great emotion . By the evening , only a handful of them remained ; and they were preparing to depart . It was quite dark outside and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round our smoking lamp , speaking in whispers and trying to calm the wild beating of our hearts , in which hope was beginning to awake . We understood that the worst would be the peasant interregnum . The peasants hated us , and , what was more , the beast in them was roused by the massacre of the hospital and the impunity of plunder . So that now , listening to the sounds of evacuation , we mjoiced ; but at the same time We prayed that the Bolsheviks would remain . No , not exactly that ? if somebody wished to picture our inmost desire it would happen thus : the Bolsheviks guard us faithfully to the last moment and give us herring and sugar ; suddenly the Polish Uhlans fall on us , kill the Bolsheviks , and burst into our But those daydreams were very far from the minds of the Bolsheviks , who fled as fast as they could . Fear for ourselves and our patients weighed upon our hearts as with a hundred-ton weight ? on that evening so joyous on the one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While we were thus talking together , Anczew came to see its for the fourth or fifth time during the day . We were glad to see him , hoping to get news . But he , contrary to his habit , remained on the threshold and only beckoned to me to go out with him . I went out , and noticed directly that he was fully armed , with all the straps fastened and his Commissar 's badge , a red band , on his left arm ( he had not worn it the other times ) . He told me briefly that he had some business with me and started walking towards the river . I did not understand , but followed him . During the past days we had learned to trust Anczew . ' But why is he leading me towards the Polish army ? ' I wondered , walking uneasily in Anczew 's huge strides . When we were out of the park , hestopped a moment and asked : ' Sister Zosia , do you want to go back to your own people ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I did , very much indeed . Then lie started to walk on very fast again . The snow was not so deep in the fields ? II caught up with him . Without slowing his pace for one moment , Anczew began telling me that they were all leaving Cichinicze in an hour 's time . They must hurry , because the Polish soldiers generally attacked in the night , and most certainly they would be in Cichiniece towards morning . ' But you , Sisters , ancl your patients have nothing to rejoice about , ' he said , and went on explaining that we should remain guarded by armed peasants , to whom the Bolsheviks had given guns and ammunition with orders to ' liquidate the hospital and everybody ' at the approach of Polish soldiers . The peasants would be on guard within an hour . A nczew suddenly stopped and turned to me . ' You are so young , Sister Zosia . My daughter is exactly your age ? and she remained alone in Petrograd . Perhaps she has nothing to eat . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pity you should die , Sister Zosia . ' A light breeze lifted a cloudlet of snow and carried it over the fields . I looked back . Our house in Cichinicze was far away . I could only just see the windows of our ward dimly lighted . It was dark on t he Bolshevik side ( they were probably making preparations for departure in the courtyard ) . In front of us we suddenly saw appearing the light of some distant village . Beyond the village I could distinguish the dark outline of a forest . . . . ' Look here , Sister Zosia , ' Anczew went on ; ' I will lead you through that village and forest . Your soldiers are beyond . I will show you their village and then you will go up to them your-self ! ' I was by now perfectly aware of what Anczew was aiming at , and I was struggling with myself . I note this because I resolved to write down everything , even though I am very much ashamed of it . I struggled with myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to remain , but I did not want to acknowledge it . Anczew went on saying something , and whilst he was speaking I sought feverishly , desperately , for some unrefutable argument which would tell me that I must seize the opportunity offered to me . My head was empty . Not one thought ! Only that consciousness that I must make up my mind quickly , quickly , and that certainty that my duty was to remain in Cichinicze , and that desperate searching . Well , come along , Sister Zosia , ' said Anczew , taking my hand impatiently . A flow of blood rose to my head . I had not found anything I had not had time to find it . Then suddenly I realized something as if with a blow : I Shall Remain . Pulled on by Anczew , I stumbled against a root and lost my balance . Mechanically I followed him a few steps , knowing that I would not go and subconsciously hoping for some miracle . What if suddenly we were surrounded by our soldiers and an act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fields were silent . I stopped after a few steps . I understood clearly that I must not go and would not go . A sudden animal fear seized me . I stiffened with horror , because my awakened imagination set before my eyes clearly and distinctly , with every detail , the scene of how we were going to be murdered . Why , our death was certain and I wanted to live ! What good would it do if I died ? No , I did not want to die , with Maurice only a few steps away from me . Suddenly I seemed to see my darling Maurice with perfect clearness . Our quiet sunny drawing-room at home . Maurice , aged ten , is playing at soldiers with me . The piano is a cannon . Now , attention ! ' calls Maurice , and aims his toy pistol at me . He does not allow me to wink when the cartridge is fired . No , that is clear ? how could I shake hands with him ? What would our relations be ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I stopped Anczew . I told him that I had made up my mind and resolved to remain ; I began to walk very fast in the direction of Cichinicze . I made no answer to his arguments , only shook my head . He was angry . At a certain moment , when the road branched off to the farm , he made an impatient movement with his hand and left me without saying a word of farewell . I went on alone towards the dull light of our window . My heart felt warm and happy , as if 1 were going back to my own home and to those who were dearest to me . On approaching our door , I came across a few village ragamuffins already on guard . They held their guns like sticks , but they might shoot us with them all the same . Some of them sat on our threshold . They never took the trouble to get up , only one of them leaned aside a little and muttered , ' Pass on . ' There was a fathomless hatred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at the same time the lazy security of a beast which is in no hurry , knowing that its prey can not escape . That night in the stuffy air of the izolatka was the worst we had passed . Worse even than the one in which the moon shone upon the faces of the dead men lying under our window . It was the sixth night we had spent without undressing , sleeping on the floor . All that time we lived only on peas and herrings . No wonder our power of resistance had greatly diminished . livery now and then one of the sentinels would come into our ward and with his finger count us like sheep . I could not sleep , and sat writing this diary of mine all night . Once Peo woke up and asked me if I was writing my will . At last , when it was already dawn , I could n't keep quiet any longer , and I woke Hit ! kit and Peo . ' Look , girls , it is morning and we are still alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always feel courage coming into me in the morning . After all , we are not going to let ourselves be butchered like sheep in clear daylight , for no reason whatever . ' We kissed each other heartily , for good morning . This sixth day was marked by the fact that . we had ceased to make ready for the other world . We had got quite bored with it . All the week through , over and over again , no result . Anybody 's patience would be at an end . So we gave it up and resolved to remain in this vale of tears . It must be admitted , however , that , alt hough belonging to this earth , we all look like ghosts from the other world , owing partly to our salt-herring cure , in addition to other pleasures . Herring for breakfast , herring for dinner , herring for supper , and not even a bit of bread with it . Afterwards each of us drinks at least a bucketful of water , which I must fetch . It is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the bag of bread ; besides , we have obtained permission to milk two or three cows in the stables . But that is for the sick . Peo wo n't even have the first look at all these delicacies . But I forget to write about the most important thing . The Bolsheviks have returned this morning and have taken command over Cichinicze again . The news about the Poles ' attack seems to have been false . Our hopes fall . We return to our everyday occupations . Olesia doctors , washes , scrubs andsweeps and dusts , and is , in spite of her little oddities , a splendid nurse . Many new Bolsheviks have come , together with the old ones . There are some horrible types among them drunken faces with a completely animal expression in them . The first thing they ( lid on arriving was to dash into the laboratory , looking for alcohol . Luckily there was not any left , but what they did find was a large bottle of valerian OH ether . One of them poured out a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me that the pure ether would burn his stomach . I stopped hire , saying that he would kill himself . I d id it not out of pity for him . My heart has grown so hard now that if I had been told about his death post factum I should even have been glad . But , as it was in my presence , I felt it my duty to warn him . It would have been inhuman to look on calmly when a man was taking his life out of stupidity and ignorance and do nothing to prevent him . The Bolshevik stared at me as if he understood my thoughts and said : ' What does my life matter to you , Sister ? You should be glad there will be one Bolshevik less ! ' That was it ? why should I not per-mil , myself to be frank ? I answered that of course I should be glad of it , but I am a Christian and this was why I had warned him . The Bolshevik twisted his head to one side , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his large paw to me . ' Well , then , shake hands , comrade-Sister , ' said he . I pretended not to see him , extremely busy with tidying up the medicine bottles on the shelves . I did not care at all for a handshake with such a brute . Nevertheless I observed him with a corner of my eye , and saw that my warning had been given in vain . The Bolshevik poured out half the contents of the glass , which he then filled with water . After that he swallowed it . Even that dilution must have been very strong , because the beast lay for twenty-four hours on the floor dead drunk , but he got up quite well . At last we know what has happened to the other Sisters . Anczcw told us today that directly after taking possession of Cichinicze the Bolsheviks sent them to Mohilev and that certainly no evil will come to them . He said that only one of them , the ' woman doctor ' ( probably Mrs. .16zka ) , fired at the escorting Bolsheviks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he laughed , so perhaps it was not true , They often tell us stupid stories on purpose to annoy us , as they did yesterday , for example , telling us that the first regiment of Uhlans was completely smashed . But I do not believe a word of it . We learned also that when the Bolsheviks were shooting the head doctor one of the Sisters knelt before the soldiers , begging them to shoot her too ( it must have been Henrietta ) , and another one , ' tall and dark , ' probably Lala Landsberg , covered the head doctor with her body when one Tartar had sprung at him with his sword , so that the sword slipped on her shoulder without touching the doctor . After that , all the Sisters were surrounded and sent to the station , because ' we do not kill women ! But with the rest we made order ! ' That Anczew seems a good man ; and yet he can say in such a matter-of-fact way that they have been murdering defenseless men . I felt quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to pretend to be calm so as to has everything . We have a new trouble . One of the soldiers we have hidden is ill . Probably he caught something from the other patients ? the worst of it is that we do n't know what is the matter with him . It is awful that we have no doctor . We assemble for a great consultation and decide that the patient musthave pneumonia , because he breathes so heavily . We apply compresses , inject camphor every hour . We force into his mouth milk , tea , or bread soaked with milk , in spite of his resistance . Unfortunately we have nothing else to give him , and the worst of it is that our medicine score is coming to an end . What shall we do afterwards ? %Ire resolved to go to the head Commissar and ask him to give us horses and the permission to title the patients to some hospital in Roltezew . Halka was elected for that mission . I followed her , of course . The Commissar occupies a large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire burning in the stove . In the middle of the room a large barrel full of lard was standing ; in the corner loaves of bread were heaped up , and there were bags full of sugar and flour . All the treasures of Ali-Baba seemed to us nothing beside this . I felt a painful contraction inside ? hunger probably . The Commissar was unexpectedly gracious and , when we had made our request , promised to give us sledges for transporting the patients . He calmly stated that he would probably send us Sisters from Rohaczew to Tula , or to Smolensk , because they are in want of educated women workers in Russia . ' Confound you , ' I thought . Halka kicked me under the table to prevent my saying something unnecessary , and thanked the Commissar . The horses were ready at five o'clock in the afternoon instead of two . The peasants did not want to give us horses until they were compelled to by the Bolsheviks , who in fact are glad to get rid of us , because there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typhus and other diseases . We wrapped the patients in blankets , put pillows round them , and covered them with straw , because the thermometer marked twenty degrees below zero centigrade . It was almost dark when we started . There was no room for us in the sledges and we followed on foot . Three Bolsheviks , armed to the teeth , escorted us . They had guns , swords , revolvers , and such a lot of cartridges that one would think they were escorting the most dangerous criminals . We were rather lightly dressed for such cold . I stamped , rubbed my hands , and , when that proved useless , started running . Suddenly I heard a shot fired behind me , then another . I looked round and saw Anczew aiming his revolver at me a third time . Was he mad ? Halka and Peo were making desperate signs to me to come back to them . They had lingered behind a little . I went to t hem and they told me that the man was drunk . They explained that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run away . Well , he was only aiming at my feet , but , being very tipsy , he might have hit where he did not mean to . Halka confessed to having done a very stupid thing . Throughout our captivity she had kept a bottle of alcohol , hidden very carefully , thinking it might be wanted in some critical moment for the patients . No such critical moment demanding alcohol occurred , so just before starting she had offered the bottle to Anczew , as a token of gratitude , to thank him for his protection and help and for the safety we owed him . He drank up all the contents on the spot , after which he declared that he would escort us . And this was the result . It was eleven o'clock when we reached Rohaczew . Those twenty miles took us six hours . And now the tragedy began , because we could not find a hospital which would take us in . In one they did not accept Poles , in another they would not have contagious eases . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The peasant drivers were angry at being forced to go from one end of the town to the other . They threatened to throw the patients out of the sledges intothe street , and go home to Cichinicze . The frost was growing sharper every minute . You felt as if you were breathing some thick mass . The horses were quite white with frost and could hardly drag along their legs . What about ourselves ? It was one o'clock and we were still in the street . I kept on eating snow , alt hough I was quite still with cold , because I could not quench my horrible thirst . There was only one hospital left in the neighborhood near the station . If it would not take us in , we should return to Cichinicze , Halka decided . I did not contradict her , although I knew half of us would die somewhere on the way and that probably I should be one of them . I should even like to . And then I did not desire even that , because it was all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to move from here . I was sitting on the ground , beside one of the sledges , awaiting the moment when Halka would come back from the hospital saying that they did not want us hero either . But no , Halka came out followed by some men bearing litters who carried the patients indoors . Olesia pulled my hand and led me to a large building , then upstairs . I smelled medicine , so we were in the hospital . When the transporting of the patients was over and the confusion and hurly-burly had subsided , I began slowly to shake off that strange coma which had overcome me outside ; although I could move and see and hear everything , I did not understand what was happening around us . Before an hour had elapsed I felt quite well again . We were given one very large room . Unluckily it was not heated . Our patients were given fresh linen , and a few minutes later were lying in fresh white beds , drinking hot tea . Halka told us that the doctor agreed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remain on duty with our sick tonight , because his staff and all the hospital service were indignant that he had taken in Poles and they might do them some harm . So we prepared to sit up all night on guard . We barricaded the door with empty beds , on one of whirls we all four sat down , with our feet tucked up , huddled together to keep each other warm . We talked to one another in sleepy voices so as not to fall asleep , but it did not help much , so every minute We had to shake each other . Morning cane at last , and no one had even looked into our ward . We found a Polish Sister that morning and she took our patients and us under her care very kindly and heartily . She brought a doctor at our request and he said nearly all of our patients had passed the crisis and were out of danger . We learned from him that the soldier we were treating for pneumonia had typhoid fever . But we did not really do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last the moment came when we could go to sleep for some hours quietly , for the first time . The kind Sister put us into an empty room , beside our ward , and even served us dinner in bed . I remember having written in an autograph album that happiness is inner contentment ? what nonsense ! Happiness is dinner in bed , when somebody serves you and shifts your pillows . We were so hungry that if it had not been for the presence of the Sister , and some remains of good manners , we should have swallowed our plates and forks together with the food . When dinner was over I saw that Peo was going to sleep again . I pulled at her sleeve , because I felt quite wide awake and rested . ' Peo , wake up . I just wanted to ask you to give us some herring for dessert . I do n't believe that you have n't got one in store . You must have taken at least the tail of a herring for a keepsake . ' At five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We glanced into our ward and at our patients . They looked beautiful : clean , rested , and fed . Two Sisters and a hospital orderly nursed them , all Poles . Feeling quite secure as to their fate , we went out into the town . There we found the Head Commissar of Rohaczew , quite a decent and even an elegant man , who made no difficulties about our permission to go to Minsk , which was now in the hands of the Bolsheviks . We might start directly if we wanted to . But when we told our patients about . it on our return to the hospital , such a lamentation arose that we resolved to stay for another day . We spent all the next day with our patients . Before starting , we recommended them to one of the doctors , who promised to take care of them until they should be strong again , and then added in a low voice a hope that by that time Rohaczew would be in Polish hands once more . The worst of all was the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our care , stooped to our feet and kissed our hands . Some of them were sobbing quite loudly . We could not tear ourselves out of the room , because they held us back by our dresses ? imploring us to stay only one moment longer . One or two who could walk accompanied us to the staircase . One more sleepless night in the cattle truck . A compact crowd of soldiers surrounded the smoking stove in the middle of the wagon . The frost was biting sharply in the farther corners . We huddled together and tried to warm One another . A funny nation , the Russians ! That passiveness of theirs , often terrible in its thoughtless cruelty , becomes sometimes a mercy . For instance , now they never even noticed us . Curled up in a dark corner , we listened greedily to the lazy talk of the crowd in the middle . We had been cut off from the world for eight long days . As was natural , the conversation ran on the doings of the Polish First Corps , lweause the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From their words we understood that the process of exterminating our Corps was almost at an end . It was more than we could bear . To go through such suffering , to hang betsveen life and death for so many days , with only that one hope for our Corps , and now to learn that all the hardships , the deaths , all the blood , all the sacrifices had been in vain , that this group of Polish soldiers had been submerged and drowned in the sea of barbarism and injustice and crime ! We had never shed one tear all the time of our captivity , but now our moral strength was gone . I sobbed aloud . Hallus and Peo , weeping themselves , did all they could to calm me , by burying my head in the folds of their dresses . The soldiers noticed us . What are you blubbering for , Sisters ? ' asked one of them . Poles , ' explained a lazy hostile voice . That means they are sorry for their countrymen , ' concluded the first . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look here , ' said another , producing a paper with a headline shouting ; ' Final Liquidation of White Guardsman Dowbor . ' There was no more doubt . We drew ourselves up and looked with dry eyes at the Bolsheviks , who had meanwhile turned to other subjects of conversation . We never spoke to each other during the rest of the journey . It was ten o'clock in the evening when we arrived at Mifisk . Directly at the station we learned not only that the First Corps had not been defeated , but that it was advancing . We drove straight to our houses , too tired to make plans except that we should meet next day . Home at last ! 1.0 the morning I was awakened by the news that Mifisk was free ! I jumped out , of bed and ran to the window . The streets were crowded and throbbing with movement . That crowd with its holiday air , its bright colors , how unlike the population of MiAsk in the days of the Bolsheviks , when everybody tried to look as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Polish eagles on their catts . There were no Polish soldiers , but the civilians were mostly carrying Suddenly there was a movement in the crowd , and the corner of the street brightened with the yellow caps of the Ulslans of the Third Regiment , Funny soldiers they were ? in fur coats , sheepskin-lined jackets , and black civilian coats ! It appeared that during the night the Pules had taken up arms . With fifteen men they took the arsenal , in which 14,000 guns were found . Those guns were distributed its motorcars to the population 1 ( 11 over the town , and in a few hours several thousand volunteers stood in readiness . And so , by morning , we had a ' regular army . ' In the year 1920 our army again reached Cichinicze . The grave , clumsily built up by our hands under the ash tree in the park , was still there , and remains there to this day , as a bloody seal of the Republic of Poland . . . . There are many such graves around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
