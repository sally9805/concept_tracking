Letters to The Times Hanover to England Urged Historical Background of Province Traced to Queen Victoria To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : It is just over a hundred years since the Kingdom of Hanover , now being invaded by the Allied armies under Field Marshal Montgomery , was lost to the British Crown because a Teutonic law laid down that Queen Victoria , who did a very good job of ruling an empire , could not , being a woman , ascend to the dignity of a little German throne . It is less than eighty years since Bismarck deposed Victoria 's cousin and , taking its autonomy away , reduced Hanover to the position of a province of Prussia , because the King and his people sided with Austria in the first of Bismarck 's wars for the aggrandization of Prussia . These events are not of ancient date , yet , in the short time since they happened , their consequences have been enormous . Successively they led to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power which has twice in the last generation drenched the world in blood and tears . Without Hanover and the ports of Bremen , Emden and Wilhelmshaven , Prussia was no great danger . With Hanover , all that has happened became possible . For a longer time than they have been separated Britain and Hanover were under the same Crown . Immediately after the defeat of Napoleon , when the influence of the independence of the United States and the doctrines of the French Revolution led to a clamor in all countries for modern liberties , Hanover was given her first democratic Constitution with two houses of Parliament . In 1833 an even more liberal Constitution , similar to that of Britain , was granted . The power of the monarch was reduced , and Ministers were made responsible for all acts of government . The peasants were enfranchised . A liberal , democratic regime was begun in that part of Germany which was ruled by King William IV of Britain and Hanover . Constitution Suppressed There was opposition . These new liberal ways did not accord with the ideas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law against women in office to reject the girl Victoria and install as King of Hanover her uncle Ernest Augustus , Duke of Cumberland , fifth son of George III . He disapproved of , and in 1840 suppressed , the new English model Constitution which his brother William had granted his Hanoverian subjects . But the second liberty wave that shook Europe in 1848 compelled him to restore what he had taken away . He died disconsolate in 1851 , leaving his throne to his blind son George V , who at least distinguished himself by distrusting Prussia and opposing Bismarck . He and his Hanoverians sided with Austria and even won a battle over the Prussian forces at Langensalza on June 27 , 1866 . For that act of independence King George lost his throne and his country was annexed to Prussia as a province . Even the Duchy of Brunswick which the deposed King inherited in 1884 was kept by Prussia . The independence and liberty of Hanover were strangled by Bismarck 's iron hand . It became just part of the Reich which he created , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the free world . Liberated by Own Sovereign Now Hanover has been invaded and conquered again , this time by the troops of a direct descendant of the Guelph dynasty which had ruled it since 1497 . King George VI of Great Britain is seventh in line from that first George who was called from Hanover to the throne of England because , through his mother Sophia , a granddaughter of James I , a drop of Stuart blood flowed in his veins . It could then be claimed , without exaggeration , that Hanover has now been liberated by her own rightful sovereign and his people from the power of Prussianism and the evil of Nazi government . Although the proposal has not yet been put forward publicly , many Englishmen have begun to claim that , as a measure of public safety , Hanover should be restored to the British Crown , which gave it its first liberal Constitution . It would have many definite advantages . Even the Big Three do not know exactly what to do with Germany when the Nazi system of rule has been destroyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanent solution in a world of constantly changing human emotions , ideas and interests . The only thing about which there seems to be agreement is that the united Germany of Bismarck and Hitler must be split up . Then why not make a beginning by lopping off Hanover and handing it back to the British Crown , or perhaps one might say restoring the benefit of the British Crown to Hanover ? The British have had long experience in the associated rule of other peoples . A new growth of that democratic system of government which Hanover was given in 1833 and 1848 could be started to the advantage of the country , and as an example to much of the rest of Europe . There would be other advantages . Holland , Belgium , Denmark , the Scandinavian countries and even France would feel safer if England had a foothold on the Continent . This addition to the British Commonwealth , even with the Duchy of Brunswick , would not be so large as to constitute any disproportionate increase in British power with respect to the other giants in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would lie . It is as a measure of security that it must be judged . Last time we were afraid that France would be too strong . We tried to build peace on principles and theories and words , and we seem in danger of being hypnotized by them again . The real problem is how to destroy effectively that authoritative German unity . which Bismarck forged and the Kaiser and Hitler have so evilly misused . As a beginning , the return of the British Crown to Hanover has much to commend it as a practical step . It is also considered by many in England as essential for the safety of the British people and all the democracies along the western fringe of Europe . P. J. PHILIP . Ottawa , April 30 , 1945 . Compromise Is Suggested Invite Representatives From Both Polish Groups to Conference To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES 1 According to reports , the participants of the Yalta Conference agreed that the Provisional Polish Government should he so constituted as to be representative of the various political parties of Poland , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States was appointed in order to carry out this agreement . They have not succeeded yet , and since neither the Lublin nor the London groups are acceptable as truly representative of Poland , the country has no representative at the San Francisco Conference . I am thoroughly in favor of carrying out the engagement taken at Yalta , but since the question appears to have reached an impasse  --  at least , for the present  --  I am wondering why the following compromise could not be reached and be acceptable to the U.S.S.R. , Great Britain and the United States delegations . To invite to San Francisco representatives of each of the Lublin and London groups . They could be invited as observers without vote ( we ourselves have taken part in the past in many conferences with the sole role of observer ) , or else each delegate could be given one-half vote . Personal contact between these two delegates and their experts , in the atmosphere of San Francisco could not but help to remove suspicions and fears between the two factions and make it possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ N. J. , April 30 , 1945 . War Trials Questioned To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : A novel proposal for conducting trials of known German war criminals by means of Allied military judges and German juries was set forth in a letter to the editor , which appeared in THE TIMES on April 26 , 1945 . The author of that letter expresses the thought that this procedure would make the German people a party to any conviction and thereby prevent future generations from condemning executions as acts of vengeance . My quarrel with that proposal is based solely on the ground that such a procedure is likely to encourage that which is sought to be avoided . If a ruthless Nazi army and government could not control the underground movement in conquered lands , it would seem to be the height of optimism to expect the Allies to exterminate , at least immediately , German underground organizations such as the " Werewulf . " Consequently , any German jury might well be under pressure to acquit suspects . If , as the writer suggests , those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence , the future German generations would be fortified in their contention that , after a " fair " trial and a jury verdict of acquittal , the Allied Nations by subsequently executing the accused had given effect to murderous vengeance . The proposal does deserve serious consideration and it might , as a localized experiment , prove to be an effective and salutary solution to the war trials problem . If so , then by all means we should make use of it . WILLIAM J. NOLAN Jr . New York , April 28 , 1945 . Aid for India Needed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Your announcement in yesterday 's paper that the Earl of Halifax , British Ambassador in Washington , has joined in sponsoring a $1,200,000 campaign for Indian relief is significant news . Information that comes to me personally confirms statements made by American Relief for India , Inc. , the organization which launched the campaign , that the after-effects of last year 's famine are still grievous . The country needs food and , above all , medicines which can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . After this war India will he important to America politically as well as economically . Unlike China , India never knew much about the United States . Nor did many Americans go to India . This is changing . American armed forces based in India have made a contribution to a new American-Indian friendship . Help in time of dire need will strengthen the ties . Four hundred million Indians should be told that America has sympathy and understanding for India . Tell it with drugs , bandages , vaccines , food and trucks .
