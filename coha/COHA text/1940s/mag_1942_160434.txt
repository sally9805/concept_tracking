Mobile warfare is always a contest for communications , but never is it more so than during the dead of winter . Last week winter in Russia had reached its height : it was the brittle time that the Russians call " the Christening Frost . " Along with the cold , Russian success in cutting German communications also reached a height . <P> Railways were now the only sure means of communication . Slow-moving artillery and infantry were now the only sure weapons of attack . It was for railways that the Russians were driving hardest , and they were succeeding , thanks to their superiority in artillery and infantry . <P> The important lines to cut were the lateral lines , which the enemy used to shift power from sector to sector of the front . Last week the Russians struck at Germany 's lateral lines in four places : <P> The greatest success of the week , like the greatest successes of the war , belonged to wily Marshal Semion Timoshenko . He sent his men on an oblique , ten-day , 65-mile plunge into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications between the great center of Kharkov and the south . This he did at Lozovaya. * <P> Farther south , the Russians pulled another sneak near the Sea of Azov , advancing 115 miles beyond German-held Taganrog . Here their ultimate aim was to choke oft ' German communications into the vital Crimea . <P> On the central front , they drove for the important Smolensk-Bryansk line . <P> Up north , where bright-faced Marshal Klimente E. Voroshilov was back in action after organizing new armies to the rear , the Russians drove their spectacular wedge between the Moscow and Leningrad fronts a little deeper . This drive had already cut the lateral line from Leningrad to the central front . <P> These attacks pointed up the difference between Russia 's bad-weather tactics and Germany 's fair-weather tactics . The Russians drive wedges , hoping to cut communications and make the enemy fall back . The Germans drive wedges and bend them into encirclements , hoping to cut off the enemy and destroy him . In the difference may lie the future of Russia . <P> <P> *At Lozovaya Timoshenko @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ site of the once great , now ruined Dnieper Dam . The Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic last week announced that before the dam was dynamited to render it useless to the Germans ( TIME , Sept. 1 ) , its 740,000-h.p. turbines and other power machinery had been dismantled and moved eastward to safety .
