( See Cover ) <P> The Constitutional requirements for President ( 35 , native-born ) are liberal . The unwritten requirements , time-honored in U.S. politics , are strict . <P> A candidate must know and obey the Ten Presidential Commandments . The road to Presidential conventions is strewn with the political skulls of men who have disregarded these rules : <P> Rule 1 . The candidate must have a solid American background-as humble as possible . As birthplace , a log cabin is best , a farm nearly as good , the combination practically irresistible . For parents , the watchword is poor but honest . In the family background , a horse thief is fatal , a millionaire nearly as bad . <P> Rule 2 . He must look good-but not too good-in newsreels and portraits . U.S. voters like their candidates big , broad-shouldered , modestly handsome . Citizens generally refrain from voting for a politician who makes them laugh-unless , like New York City 's Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , the man is obviously an expert caper-cutter . At the same time they suspect any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and doubly suspect one handsome enough to inspire a faraway look in their wives ' eyes . <P> Rule 3 . He must be healthy and vigorous . He should be at ease with a fishing rod and shotgun ; if possible , he should walk to work . Voters do not like to think of their President as a man subject to such drab ailments as the sniffles . <P> Rule 4 . He must have an attractive wife and children . His wife must look as if she can cook , darn , speak in public modestly and not too much and dance sedately with an Ambassador . <P> Rule 5 . He must be successful-but not too successful . His accomplishments should be solid ; they should not be so enormous as to have set him beyond and apart from his fellow men . <P> Rule 6 . He must identify himself with a popular national issue . But he should choose an issue like states ' rights or economy , appealing to a maximum number of voters , outraging a minimum . At that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the question . <P> Rule 7 . He must let someone else , preferably the electorate , decide to make him a candidate . Unabashed seeking of the Presidency is still considered immodest . The decent , in fact the only permissible procedure is to be drafted , as Franklin Roosevelt in 1940 , even if it taxes all the candidate 's skill to engineer the draft . <P> Rule 8 . He must be acceptable to old-line party leaders . <P> Rule 9 . He must have some well-heeled backers , concealed as carefully as possible . <P> Rule 10 . He must let the voters see him , as often and auspiciously as possible . <P> Of all the candidates who have come forward ( or , in accordance with Rule 7 , have been pushed ) for 1944 , the man who most exactly fits these specifications is Ohio 's Governor John William Bricker . Therefore , he is a formidable force in the jockeying for the ' 44 Republican convention . He is strong enough already to make his friends confident and his enemies bitter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and even to anti-Bricker-men Ohio is in an interesting condition .
