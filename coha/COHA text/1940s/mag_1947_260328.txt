THE WALLACES OF IOWA ( 615 pp. ) - Russell Lord-Houghton Mifflin ( $5 ) . <P> <P> More than one plain-spoken journalist has found his phrases turning fuzzy trying to explain Henry Wallace . Some basic amorphous quality of mind &; manner in Wallace has defied definition , by either swooning admirers or exasperated critics . <P> After six years of working at it , Biographer Lord , a Wallace admirer and himself a farm writer and editor , takes refuge in mystical pronouncements that are as ponderous as they are unrevealing . Writes Lord : Wallace is " no chance growth . The product of an extraordinary heritage and upbringing , deeply-almost broodingly-aware of a genetic continuity in his every act , he lives , moves , and grows as a continuing force . " <P> Father Henry C. Wallace , a solid , competent editor and a good Secretary of Agriculture ( he helped blow the lid off the Teapot Dome scandal ) , would test the talents of a Boswell . It is Grandfather ( Uncle Henry ) Wallace who steals the show . First @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm-paper editor , Uncle Henry passed on his name but none of his sharp wit and little of his peppery common sense and talent for writing . <P> Although the second half of this fat book is about Henry A. Wallace , neither " the force " nor the man is brought into focus . Lord can record the official acts and pronouncements of Editor ( Wallaces ' Farmer , New Republic ) , Agriculture Secretary . Commerce Secretary and Vice President Wallace , but the man himself eludes him . Wallace , to Lord , " is my kind of guy . " but readers will look in vain for something of Wallace 's personal life , his tastes and habits . Nor does Lord document , though he tries to support , Fiorello LaGuardia 's estimate of Wallace as " just a humble little man who has lived the Sermon on the Mount . " <P> Henry A. Wallace inherited his Scotch-Irish parents ' capacity for work , but he lacked color and , except as a student of agriculture , any conspicuous abilities . He spoke poorly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before him were editors . He was 33 when , in 1921 , Father Henry C. became Harding 's Secretary of Agriculture and made Henry A. the editor of the influential Wallaces ' Farmer . He was 44 when he met President-elect Franklin D. Roosevelt at Hyde Park , used the language of the Brain Trusters so patly that F.D.R. , to Wallace 's surprise , made him his Secretary of Agriculture six months later .
