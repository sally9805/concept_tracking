THAT WOMAN A STORY BY NANCY HALE M EN outnumber women by a considerable percentage in the United States , it is reported , and this sounds splendid except that in actual practice in many places there just are n't enough extra men , and a girl has the very devil of a time getting a beau for her exclusive use . This is particularly so in the small proud towns of the South , like Bremen , where the fact of being a woman implies a long battle to get escorted to entertainments , and getting married represents a victory over practically insuperable odds . When I lived in Bremen there were only three unattached males you could consider having in your house , no matter how pressing the necessity to make an even number , and of these one was sixty , one was twenty-four , and the third had fits ; all three were insufferably conceited . Before moving to the South I had heard that Southern women were brave , capable characters while Southern men were often boors ; I soon found that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were a pretty infuriating lot principally because since the cradle they had known themselves to be in crying demand . It is a beautiful , oak-shaded , graceful , honeysuckle-scented little town , Bremen . Old country houses with beautiful names ? Lutesville , De Courcy , Music Hallmark at intervals the romantic , rolling countryside . In town the houses are set back from velvet lawns ; magnolias and crape myrtles shade the porches wherefriends from families that have visited each other since Queen Anne 's day gossip and sip juleps . The hours are gently passed in pleasant ways , as though these Southerners had long ago given up thoughts of effort or strife and were making lovely each hour on the way to the grave . If there were plenty of men , surely all would be peace in Bremen . But in Bremen an old maid is an object of pity and shudders of self-congratulation ; a girl with a date is one with a considerable triumph to her credit ; an engaged girl is one on tenterhooks , who will not be able to relax until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a married woman is a successful woman ; but a woman like Alida Norris , who has been married four times , is a serpent and a menace and a slur on Southern womanhood and worse than that . I said a woman like Alida ; there are no other women like Alida in Bremen . To find another husband after one 's husband dies is a definite coup , and hardly to be expected . But to have the gall to divorce a perfectly good husband , and another , and another , and end up with a fourth , even if he is the town drunk , is cosmic impertinence due for punishment from the gods . I heard about Alida soon after I moved to Bremen . Her name was not long off people 's tongues . I was sitting in Sally Davis 's living room , drinking a highball in the late afternoon ; there were four or five women sitting about having a drink , smoking lazily , unhurriedly , as if there were an eternity for seeing one 's friends . The minute Alida @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . Sally explained for my benefit . " She was Alida Maupin  --  as good blood as any in Bremen . First she married Dick Wells , back up country at Perryville , owns a racing stable . We did n't know what to think when she divorced him . Thought he must have tried to kill her , the way Maizie Hankins ' husband is always acting up ; could n't think of any other reason ; thought she was a fool for throwing away a husband like that when Heavers knew where she 'd get another . She was always a right pretty girl , went to dances at the University and all when she was young and had plenty of attention ; but sort of vague ; used to say the craziest things , still does . Well ! If she did n't marry Duke Enters , who is , I reckon , the most famous Bremenite we 've got ; you know , consul or something at Paris , real distinguished man . She married him and went abroad to live , and first thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's , divorced again . She got Duke while he was young and not famous yet , but he was getting famous by the time she left him , and would you think . . . Well ! We naturally thought that finished Alida for good and all . We thought she must be just naturally crazy , throwing away husbands . And what should she do but marry again . Armistead Butts , the head of the school board and principal of the high school and a most scholarly man , really old family , never looked at a girl before , although of course every girl had been after him for years . We had to hand it to Alida , " Sally said grudgingly . " She certainly fooled us . But when she divorced Armistead too we really had had enough of Alida . Did n't have any use for her . Did n't know a good thing when she had it , just flighty and unprincipled and common , throwing husbands around like pea-pods . And so then she married again , Billy Norris , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits around all day , not worth the powder and shot to blow him to Kingdom Come . Serves her right . What does she think she is anyway ? Cleopatra ? ? I suppose we 're just jealous , " Sally added to me in a tone designed to make it clear that she was not any such thing . The one thing sure was that she was good and mad just from talking about Alida . " What has she got that we have n't got ? " The question was unconscious and heartfelt ; it was put by Miss Betty Coxe , who had never got married and , you could see it in her face , knew now that she never would . " If she had gone away from here , picked herself up husbands somewhere else , it would be one thing , " Virginia Staige said . " But every  --  single  --  oneof those husbands of Alida 's was a Bremen boy . Now how did she do that , Sally ? How do you reckon ? " " Well , she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's still just as pretty as she can be , though she must be forty-three if she 's a day . Maybe forty-four . She 's got a right pretty figure , and she 's funny to listen to sometimes , if you do n't go stark staring crazy trying to follow what she 's talking about . I do n't know how she got them , Virginia . What is it that men want anyway ? " There was real , stark tragedy in that question , I thought . There was all the long , frenzied , anxious asking of all the women of Bremen . " Well , she can have her four husbands but she ca n't come into my house , " Helen Randolph said , and all the women nodded . " I 'm through with Alida . I do n't care if her grandfather was my grandfather 's colonel ; she has gone too far and behaved disgracefully and I ca n't receive her in my house where my children are , just growing up . She 's a bad woman , " Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suddenly saw fear in her eyes , in her voice . They were all afraid , all these women . They were terrified of this woman , Alida Norris . She had done the impossible ; she had married four separate and distinct times ; surely it was not inconceivable that she might at random pluck a husband from some other woman . Terror was in their hearts and distrust in their minds , and deep down inside of all of them they hated her . They were all nice women too ; but they knew what trouble was and the frantic search for a husband , and to them Alida Norris could only spell danger . " I 'd like to meet her , " I said . They all looked at me and I could see the same look in all their eyes . You have n't got a husband , they were thinking , you do n't have to be afraid of her . " You wo n't meet her here , " Sally said firmly . " I do n't know where you would meet her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't feel about Alida as I do . She just is n't received , she or Billy either , although I may say I feel sorry for him , even if he does get faIling-down drunk , which my father always said no gentleman could do no matter how much whisky he had inside him . Bad blood somewhere , that 's what it is . Of course Billy , his grandmother was in Staunton and his great-grandfather went over to the Yankees . " Sally looked at me sidewise . " But I do n't know where it got in with the Maupins . But it 's there . Bad blood . You can always tell . " " I 'll point her out to you some day on Jefferson Street while we 're marketing , " Virginia Staige said . " Or you 'll probably meet her , sooner or later , at one of the Club dances . You ca n't keep her out of the Club after all ; she is a Maupin , whatever . But I ca n't invite you to meet her at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and that 's all there is . " " Of course I understand , " I said . But I was obsessed with a desire to meet Alida Norris . The potentialities were enormous . In this quiet town of conventional women , hag-ridden only by the difficulty and necessity of getting married , I had discovered the existence of what sounded like a guaranteed femme fatale . She must be something to see in-MAGAZINE deed , a sort of super Southern belle , all beauty and lure , or else brilliant and witty , or  --  something . Bremen was no place to be a femme fatale in ; there was n't anything to work with . But here was a woman who had done it anyway . Quite a lot of time went by after I first heard of Alida Norris , and I did n't meet her . There was a real blockade against her in Bremen society . I thought of her as so fascinating that she kept her husband contented with her sole company ; but I wondered , in view of her record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching toward the time when she would divorce him too and accomplish another impossibility , marry a fifth husband . I could not imagine what she would be like . She was my mystery woman . Someone pointed her house out to me , a perfectly ordinary house in need of paint . The house told me nothing . One day in October I went to a cocktail party a little way out in the country . Sally Davis drove me out in her car . It was a characteristic Bremen party , lots of whisky and soda , or water , to drink , more women than men , and the men behaving the regular Bremen way . At a Bremen party all the men go off and talk among themselves , leaving the women to drink and gossip . The women do n't seem to mind a bit ; only the unmarried women , looking a little like anxious loose horses , keep drifting in among the men who receive them without enthusiasm . The doctors flock together and talk medicine ; the lawyers form groups ; the horsemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men , and so meek and resigned of the women , that I was that day especially exasperated . One likes to see women putting out sparkle and magnetism , men making an effort to be charming to the women ; here the women sat and drank together and the men stood and drank together . I was sitting with Sally and two or three other women , when Bourne Davis , Sally 's husband , walked past with a fresh drink in his hand . He did not even glance toward us , he was making for the back room and his friends , but Sally called to him , and he turned . " The children are at Janie Bray 's birthday party , " she reminded him . " You 'd better go and get them . It 's getting late . Come on back here for me after you 've picked them up , " he said and strolled off . She began gathering her things together quite unconcernedly . I was suddenly in a rage . I was furious at Bourne 's spoiled selfishness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that men all treated their wives like this in Bremen and got away with it . The wives ate it up . It was as bad as the Middle Ages ; the wives put out everything , ran everything , and the men took it as their right , and there was nothing to be done about it because of the incontrovertible fact that men were at a premium . In Bremen there seemed to he no ignominy too great for a woman to take in order to get and to keep her man . I thought that Southern men were even worse than I had heard . I was too mad to speak . After Sally had left I decided to walk home alone and work off my temper . A couple of men offered to drive me home , but I wanted to walk and , besides , I knew now how much my acceptance of an offer I should have once thought quite an ordinary one would disturb the wife of whoever made it . It was exquisitely beautiful outside in the dusk and my rage evaporated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broad land lay in the twilight , large and generous ; rolling in great swells back toward the lights of occasional houses riding on the hills , toward the lights of Bremen shining up from the shallow valley ahead . The side of the road was deep in fallen leaves and I scuffed along through them ; scuffing leaves is a very soothing thing to do . At least , if the social system of Bremen was all wrong , the physical aspect of the place , its sights and smells and sounds were divinely right . I could smell apples and grapes and the indefinable sweetness of the fields , and I could hear cow bells from the pastures and the sound of a church bell tolling the hour faintly , away in the town . I rounded a curve and there was a car standing on the side of the road . As I got nearer I saw that there was a woman sitting on the running board . I came abreast of her . " Hello , " she said , in one of the most beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " Is n't it lovely this time of day ? " she remarked casually . " I 've been sitting here for hours looking at that hillside . It turns a different color every few minutes . It 's been orange and then yellow and then blue and now it 's dark purple . " This was a most unusual way for:anybody to talk in Bremen . You felt that everyone loved the beauty of the country passionately but quite inarticulately ; it was a part of their blood , their bone , that they felt without outwardly perceiving . " I do n't think I ever saw such lovely country , " I said . I could not see the woman 's face clearly . Shc just sat there , leaning forward with her arms crossed over her knees . " I 'd like to stay here all night , " she said . " It would be fun , " I said . I started to walk on . I wanted to talk to the woman , but she seemed so absorbed , so really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself , that I had a feeling of intrusion . I had got a little way down the road when she called after me . " I forgot . Do you know anything about cars ? " I walked back . " Not much , " I said . " Is something the matter ? " The woman got up from the running board . " I was forgetting why I stayed here , " she said , and laughed a laugh as lovely and musical as her speaking voice . " I stopped the car to look at the view and then I could n't get it started again . So I just got out and enjoyed myself . " She got back into the driver 's seat and I got in beside her . In the glow from the dashlight I looked at her profile . It was innocent and like a child 's although I could see now that she was in middle age ; she had a tipped-up nose and a high smooth forehead . She put her foot on the starter and the engine whirred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It just wo n't go . I 'd better walk back to town with you . My husband will do something about it . He knows all about cars . " " You have n't got the ignition turned on , " I said . " Oh . " She sounded slightly crestfallen . She turned on the switch and the car started at once . I thought of Mrs. Peterkin and all the vague and impractical ladies of fiction . " I think you 'll be all right now , " I said and started to get out . " Oh , but you must let me drive you back to town , " she said , and I thought of a little girl exhibiting her best company manners . " I 'm Alida Norris . I 'm Mrs. William Norris . You must let me take you home . " Wild horses could not have dragged me from that car . I introduced myself . " You 're from the North , " she said . " Mr. Wilson at the drugstore told me all about you . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have stomach-aches . You live in the Marvin house , do n't you ? " I have never felt such tangible , irresistible charm radiating from anyone . She was facing me now eagerly , and I could see her face . It was a child 's face , alive , unconscious . Its most beautiful feature was the mouth . The mouth was large and soft and mobile and as delicate and sensitive as a young girl 's . As we drove into the outskirts of town she suddenly turned to me , breaking off a conversation in the middle ; it was a charming , impulsive turning , but it nearly killed us because two cars were passing just at that moment and , as Alida Norris turned her body she turned MAGAZINE the wheel too . I did a moment 's intensive praying . " My , " she remarked when the bad moment was over . " There are so many crazy drivers , are n't there ? I was going to say : do n't go home , come and meet my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't a bit Northern and I 'd like to prove it to him Northern women can be real nice . You see , I know it anyway . I 've traveled . I 've lived in Paris , Le Havre , New York , and Washington , D. C. , " she added . " I 'd love to come , " I said fervently . " I want you to see Billy . Billy 's wonderful . He could be anything he wanted to . He can fix cars and electric lights and plumbing , and even the stove . I never knew anyone like Billy . And I ought to know , I 've been married three times before . I suppose you 've heard that , " she said , more mournfully than anything else . " They were all perfectly wonderful men . Wonderful men . But there 's never been anybody like Billy . He 's so nice to me , " she said in an ecstatic voice . I could not imagine anyone not being nice to her . Also my preconceived ideas of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being badly confused by this ingenuous , enthusiastic , affectionate creature . She was more a mystery woman than ever to me . She stopped the car . " This is n't the house , " she said . " The house is three houses back . But I always stop the car here . It spoils the view out of my front windows , and I 'm perfectly sure the Carters  --  they live in this house do n't mind having their view spoiled . " We got out and walked back . We went up an untidy front walk and through a front door that opened directly into a large shabby living room . Although it was in disorder , the room had charm . It looked like a room in an antique store . Nothing was in place ; a pile of Wedgwood plates stood on the floor under a Hepplewhite desk ; a lovely old flower print lay flat , face up , on an end table ; a screen that looked like a Coromandel stood meaninglessly in the middle of the room . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand ; he got up as we came in . " This is Billy . He 's just having a drink . He drinks too much , " Alida Norris said proudly . Again I thought of a little girl , this time showing off . The man laughed and shook hands . He was not an attractive man . He was short and sloppily dressed and he had a bad , grayish complexion . But he had gentle intelligent eyes . Alida put her arms round him and kissed him . It was quite obvious that they were both very much in love with each other . " You 'll have a drink , wo n't you ? " she said to me . " We 'll all have a drink . Billy , you get them . " " There are n't any more of the glasses , " he said , getting up . " Oh , gosh . So there are n't . Well , there are the other glasses in a basket under the table in the hall , darling . They 're awfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me . Billy Norris got us drinks and we all sat round the fire . It was somehow very happy . You feel it when you are with happy people . We were all rather childish and laughed a lot . I liked them both enormously . They were both absolutely simple . Alicia with her charm and beauty was perfectly irresistible . Her violently illogical remarks , her trains of thought made me laugh and they made her husband laugh too . He was the first man I had met in Bremen who did n't act like a lord of creation . He was just himself . He was extremely pleasant to me and attentive to his wife . I never saw a man with better married manners . But there were no two ways about it , he was a nondescript , unimpressive little man . As time went on it was apparent that he was feeling his liquor . " Billy 's getting drunk , " Alida said to me . " Are n't you , Billy ? " " Unh-hunh . Gettin ' drunk now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Bremen this interchange of remarks may not seem significant , but I had been living in Bremen for some time by then , and I had seen too many husbands asserting with a proud and didactic air that they never got drunk when they were obviously reeling , and too many wives not daring to take the wheel of the car when their husbands were quite incompetent to drive safely , not to realize that in the South ability to hold his liquor is almost the ultimate point of a man 's pride , and that wives arc taken to task for far less than questioning that point . I thought it was time for me to leave , and I said good-by to Alicia . I asked her if she would not come in to lunch on the following Tuesday . " Tuesday , " she said reflectively . " Tuesday  --  let 's see , that 's Thursday . Yes , I 'd love to . " God knew what she meant . I left . When I got to know Alida better I realized that in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tuesday unquestionably was Thursday by some personal mathematics of her own , and black was white and the moon was green cheese . I thought , in view of the opinions I had heard expressed , I should tell the women I invited to lunch on Tuesday that Alicia was coming . As soon as they knew that they promptly declined in no uncertain terms . Sally Davis hauled me over the coals for even suggesting that she come to lunch with that woman . " You might as well understand that none of us are going to tolerate Alicia for one moment , " she said over the telephone . " She 's ostracized herself permanently in Bremen by her carryings on . I wo n't come to lunch with a woman who 's been married four times , and that 's that . And I 'm surprised at you asking her . But of course you 're a Yankee , " she said condescendingly . " I know people are right broadminded up North . But you ca n't be too broadminded down here . I 'm just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't going to put up with Alida . You ca n't have her and us . She 's a hard-hearted , fickle , common woman . Four husbands ! " Sally went on about it for some time ; people talk for hours on the telephone in the South . And so Alida and I had lunch alone on Tuesday . By the time we left the dining room it was impossible not to feel that I had known Alida long and well . She had that gift of intimacy without effrontery . She had charm and style and a wit of her own . She was by far the most attractive woman in Bremen . I understood , all right , about how she had found herself four husbands , and why the hand of every woman in Bremen was against her . She was a real honestto-God charmer . We sat in the little drawing-room . Over the mantel was a painting by a friend of mine of the lie St. Louis . " I know that place ! " Alida exclaimed . " I told you I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to my second husband . He was a vice-consul . Named Duke Enters . My , he was handsome . " She said it with frank admiration . " Duke was the handsomest man I ever saw , ever . I used to love his ears . I remember I told the Consul to look and see how beautiful Duke 's ears were . He was awful mad at me that time . I wish you could have seen him then ! You 've probably seen his picture . But then ! Oh , he was so tall and dark and kind of American-looking , it gave you a thrill to look at him . Like looking at the American flag . He looked so handsome in his clothes . He looked handsome out of them too but he never liked me to say that . He liked his clothes himself , I do think . Liked to have them kept pressed and all that . I was so awful , I never remembered . Somehow I never can remember about clothes . Once we were staying at the George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was good and mad that time . " The picture she was calling up of herself was irresistible to me . I could see why men would be mad about her , even more than I had before . A young Alida , fresh and gay and irresponsible , as natural as the wind , vague and bat-brained and lovely  --  no wonder she had had a success with men . But with her outspoken admiration of Enters I wondered what had made her divorce him . There are some things one ca n't ask , and since she was so frank about everything else and volunteered no information on that point I concluded that it must have been for a very good and very personal reason . Perhaps her third husband had won her away from her second . I asked about the third husband  --  what was he like ? " Armistead ? Now , you would have adored Armistead . I did . Except I was n't good enough for him , I mean I do n't know anything and Armistead knew everything . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He loved books . Really loved them . It used honestly to hurt him when I did awful things , like leave books open face down , or bend the corners of pages back . I ought to have learned , but I never could somehow . And when I was cross one morning and threw a lot of books around the room it just about killed him . I used to feel so guilty . Afterward . It used to humiliate him awfully how dumb I was when we went out . I never knew what he was talking about and he did talk about such fancy things . " I thought I could guess why Alida had divorced that one . The pedantic grade had been one she could n't make , and I did n't blame her . Armistead sounded terrible to me . One of the most disarming things about Alida , I thought , was the way she always told the bad tales on herself and never blamed anyone else . She had n't said a critical or unchivalrous word about either of the husbands she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seeing that she had found it necessary to get rid of them , I thought it was very sporting of her . A few days later I went to see Alida at her house , stopped in on my way back from a luncheon party . As I walked up to the house I saw a man in painter 's overalls sitting on the doorstep occupied in some curious way not connected with painting . Alida came running out as I approached . " Hello ! I 'm so glad to see you ! " " Would you mind telling me what that man is doing ? " I asked . I could see what he was doing now . He was picking up silk stockings from a pile of them next to him , running his hand up each one and scrutinizing it , then rolling them up in pairs into neat little balls . " Oh . He 's the man who 's painting the kitchen . I asked him if he 'd mind sorting my stockings and he said he 'd love to . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They accumulate for months in my bureau drawer . " She led the way into that strange antique shop of a living room . We sat and smoked together in the pleasant atmosphere of being old friends . Alida looked perfectly lovely . Her soft , red , sweet mouth was all quivering with smiles and her eyes beamed . She sat at the end of a sofa with her pretty legs hanging over the arm , playing with a china zebra that stood among green-china grasses . " I was married to a horseman first , you know , " she said . " This zebra makes me think of it . I guess that would make Dick pretty mad if he heard me say it , as if zebras had anything to do with horses . But they have , have n't they ? I do n't know why horsemen are so fussy about names . You must n't call hounds dogs , you know , " she said like a little girl repeating a lesson . She sighed . " Dick was my first love . I fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my back . He was such a marvelous horseman and he looked so wonderful in his pink coat  --  you must n't say red  --  and his top hat when he went out hunting . I was just crazy about him . I do n't suppose you can ever feel like that again when you get older . He sort of had so much glamour . He could ride any horse that ever was born , he used to ride steeplechases  --  my , that scared me ; he used to get so mad when I 'd scream right in front of people . I used to try so hard to get interested in horses because he wanted me to . But I just ca n't make myself get so excited about an animal . I mean that way . Of course I always was interested in the wrong animal . The fox . I used to feel sorry for the fox , and you must n't feel sorry for the fox ; it kills chickens or something . I hate chickens . Once I was out in the pony cart when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the huntsman asked me which way the fox had gone and I told thin the opposite way . Was n't that awful ? I do n't think Dick ever forgave me . He was good and ashamed of me . I could n't seem to learn to ride right . I fell off so much . My , I hated it ! But I did try . Honestly I did . But I 've always been scared of horses . They look like wild animals to me , with those big mouths , and I always feel as if they were going to put their heads round and bite me when I 'm on top of one . I mean mounted . I always think a horse would look better behind bars  --  like a lion  --  than out loose there in the fields , do n't you ? Dick used to tell me that they were scared of me , but I did n't believe him for a minute . I was awful . I do n't blame Dick for being mad at me most of the time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alida and Billy to have dinner with me at the dance at the Club the next Saturday . Alida said they 'd love to . " But you ought not to be seen with me , " she said quite cheerfully . " People think I 'm awful , you know , on account of all those husbands and everything . You must n't get criticized for going around with me . " Her humility , her gentleness and frankness touched me deeply . " I like you better than anyone I 've met in Bremen , " I said . " And I 'll see you all you 'll let me . " She gave me the most beautiful smile . When I first came to Bremen I thought perhaps Club dances would be a cut above ordinary parties  --  that the men would stay with the women perforce , since surely a dance is designed for the glorification of the female . But they ? were only a little bit better , or rather , better for only part of the time . People sat in parties at tables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather good , and everyone of course knew everyone else , and the stage seemed set for gaiety . But along about eleven or midnight the blight would strike . The men would drift off into the smoking room and the bar , to talk to one another , and the women would be left high and dry at the tables to twiddle their thumbs . I had grown increasingly enraged at a succession of these dances , and it was a relief at this one to have my own table which I hoped to be able to run as I pleased . It was a table for four  --  the Norrises and one of the three extra men  --  I think it was the old one  --  and myself . The extra man , I remember , annoyed me by acting as if he were seated at table with the Scarlet Woman of Babylon . He kept his eyes downcast and replied to Alida 's amusing sallies in mumbles , or else leered at her in a manner I considered offensive and which she ignored . She was at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress that showed her pretty shoulders , and if ever I saw a woman intended to be surrounded by adoring and competitive admirers , she was the woman . She seemed to have an inexhaustible stock of vitality which struck off like sparks in gaiety and her own characteristically ridiculous remarks . Her husband was not much of a conversational addition but he did seem to appreciate Alida . It was plain that he was crazy about her . When he danced with her he looked down at her with the look that men have for women who enchant them utterly . He was a funny , drab little man for Alida to be married to , I thought , especially after the romantic or impressive characters she had described her other husbands as . But she loved him , you saw that . She seemed perfectly satisfied with him , and with his drinking , of which he was doing plenty that evening . Alida had hardly anything to drink , but she seemed more than ever intoxicated with the fact of being alive . She played absurd games with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiddlywinks to pop a spoon into a glass of water . I was aware of disapproving glances thrown at our table , but she either did not see them or did not care . " There are a lot of the horsy people here to-night , " I said at one point . " These ones are mostly Yankees , " Alida said , squinting her eyes up and looking round the room . " That 's the way to get somewhere down here . Buy a big place and a lot of horses and then climb the social ladder dung by dung . " Billy Norris laughed uproariously . The extra man looked a little shocked and I could have slapped him . The hour was growing later and the men in the room were beginning their customary thinning out . More and more women sat unattended at their tables , gossiping of this and that and of , no doubt , us . Billy Norris was getting good and drunk . The fact seemed to amuse both him and Alida . Billy kept propping his elbow on the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them would laugh . I have seen few wives who do not become either acid or morose when their husbands get drunk . Finally he got up in a sort of diagonal way and excused himself . We waited , and he did not come back . It was well on to two o'clock . " I suppose he 's joined the masculine circles in the bar , " I said bitterly . " I do n't think so , " Alida said . " They bore Billy . He 's probably just off finishing up his drinking . He does love to drink . " We waited for a while longer and still he did not come . My earlier approval of him was being dissolved by annoyance at this treatment of Alida . " Do you think we ought to send someone to look for him ? " I asked her , glancing meaningly at the extra man , who had been looking wretched for hours . I knew he wanted to get away and I was not going to let him go . For this once let him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go and look for Billy , " Alida said to the extra man with that special Southern intonation and rise of the voice at the end of the request which makes unnecessary the word " please . " He went , and he did not come back . Nobody came back . " Well , what do we do now ? " I said after a long time . Alida looked quite happy . She was drawing a picture on the tablecloth . It seemed to be some cats with their tails curled under them sitting on top of an elephant seen rear to . " You take me home , " she said . " What's-his-name will never turn up if he has n't turned up now . And Billy 's probably gone long ago and taken our car . " " And left you here ? " " He likes to go back in the mountains toward Sugar Hollow and wake up the mountaineers and drink with them , " she explained . " It reminds him of his youth in Prohibition when he had to buy corn liquor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind a bit , you know . " We left and I drove her back into town to her house . I waited while she went up the path , for her to get in safely . But she turned and came hack to me . " I forgot . Billy 's got the key . I ca n't get in . It just shows how silly it is to lock doors anyway . You just lock yourself out . " " You come right home with me and spend the night , " I said " That 's right sweet of you . I 'd love to , " she said contentedly , and climbed back into the front seat . But I was really indignant now . Billy Norris was just another insufferable Southern male with no consideration for his wife . Leaving her stranded at a party , and going off with the key so that she could n't even go home . . . When we got back to my house I showed Alida her room and got her a nightgown and a toothbrush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things she did reminded mc of a very small girl . " Do n't go away yet , " she said , smiling coaxingly . " Let 's talk . It 's fun spending the night out . " I sat down in the armchair and put my feet up . The feeling of intimacy and affection I had for Alida was extraordinary ; she gave out warmth and friendliness and love . " I 'm beginning to feel like one of those women with a Cause , " I said . " All I do is get madder and madder at the men down here in the South . I think they really do behave too abominably . Billy just going off and leaving you in the lurch is the last straw . I should think you would be furious at him . " Alida lay on her back with her hands behind her head and looked at the ceiling . " I do n't mind one bit . Billy really loves me . And I just love to be loved . I do n't mind anything as long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have them love me back . Billy loves me back , lots , and he does n't mind the awful things I do . He thinks I 'm funny . " " Well , who would mind ? You know you 're a perfectly fascinating woman and your vagueness just makes you more amusing . " " My other husbands minded , " Alida said mildly . " They minded terribly . I made them just as mad as the devil . " " The saps . I suppose that was why you had to divorce them . " " Oh , I did n't divorce them ! " Alida said in a tone of childlike surprise . " They asked mc for a divorce , all three of them . They could n't stand me . Billy is the only man who has ever been able to stand me . " I have never been more astonished . " You mean to tell me those men wanted to be divorced from you ? " The whole picture was changing violently . " They certainly did want to be divorced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sometimes , but nobody except Billy has ever been able to stay married to me . " " But . . . why ? You 're the most attractive woman in Bremen . " " You 're sweet to say so . . . . But I have n't any whatyoumaycallit , dignity , you know . I spoiled their dignity . Bremen men have an awful lot of dignity . They want their wives to reflect to their credit , and I was so undignified . They all ended by being ashamed of the things I did , ashamed of me . I loved all of them , you know ; I guess I would have been happy with any one of them . But they just could n't keep on loving me after the way I would disgrace them . You know the way I act . I ca n't seem to help it . Billy loves me the way I am . Billy does n't worry about dignity . " " It 's the most preposterous thing I ever heard . Why , in the North the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the more sought after , would make a Northern man all the crazier about you . It 's just these damned pompous spoiled Southerners . . . " " Oh , but I love it here down home . I like it Iazy , living . " I was so stunned by what she had told me that I did n't speak for a long time . " I suppose you know everyone thinks you just tossed your husbands aside . Nobody has the faintest idea , nobody could have the faintest idea , that they were the ones who wanted a divorce , " I said finally . " Honestly ? " Alida 's childlike eyes were large and astonished . " Is n't that funny ! Imagine anyone thinking I would want to divorce wonderful attractive men like that ! Are n't people funny , " she said . SPRING IN THE WOOD BY EDWARD WEISMILLER D O NOT go , or else do not return . I did not tell you , " Come . " I did not say there would be new paths pushed through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not welcome you , saying , " There is a waterfall The ice is gone , it fell like scattering thunder . " Tou have found these things yourself ; and now I may not say at all What ends are made for wonder . If you stayed you would learn how subtly beauty is worn , How even in the heat of earth its roots turn cold And suddenly nothing grows , nothing even is born But frail mushrooms , poison-gray and gold . If you stayed  --  but the heart must know nothing , or all , of death . Slay then or go ; but if you go do not come back . Do not leave this flowering wood and think you will dare return when there is frost even without breath , Wind without wings , and a forest of water-soaked leaves , and a single leaf-filled track .
