A. F. of L. 's William Green , a Baptist , has in his time spoken from Christian pulpits . C.I.O. 's John L. Lewis is less famed for personal piety . Last week the Ohio Pastors ' Convention , meeting in Columbus , where the United Mine Workers were also gathered ( see p. 19 ) , sent Mr. Lewis its felicitations and an invitation to come talk . Mr. Lewis went . In no pie-in-the-sky mood , he voiced a layman 's proposition which any theologian worth his salt could turn upside down : " Before men can worship , they must eat . " Said Preacher Lewis : " I believe in God and the Christian church . I believe any country devoted solely to materialism lacks something . You can draw your object lesson from Germany . . . . The church in Germany has lost the confidence of young men and women . "
