Disgruntled Britons , still griping about the proposed $4.4 billion loan from the U.S. , had a somewhat sour spokesman in one Tom Collins , London suburbanite . His comment , in a News Chronicle interview : " The loan should be liquidated by charging the U.S. a yearly rental for the use of the English language . " <P> Snorted Baltimore 's bellicose H. L. Mencken ( The American Language ) : " I think they ought to charge us for it , but all to the Bostonians . They are the only ones who speak the English language in America . The rest of us speak American . " <P> Possible compromise : let the tenant rent the language , but charge the landlord for repairs .
