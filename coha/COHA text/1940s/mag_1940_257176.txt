The golden call of a trumpet blazed last week in a rococo Manhattan theatre . On the stage , blonde , hollow-cheeked Dancer Tatiana Riabouchinska , in the blazing gold costume of the cock in Coq d'Or , soared in the grand jete , the ballet 's classic leap . On other nights , when the stage was ranked with silk tights and tutus ( tarlatan ballet skirts ) , pretty , plump-cheeked Irina Baronova and dark , lissome Tamara Toumanova took the spotlight for effortless spins , whirls , leaps . <P> These three , reunited , were the " baby stars " who seven winters ago , when they were in their teens , began making the U. S. ballet-conscious . Then their director was an ex-Cossack colonel named Wassily de Basil , who founded the Monte Carlo Ballet Russe in the great tradition of the late Serge Diaghilev , named his troupe for the little principality where it first danced . Last week , after many complicated schisms in the Russian ballet , the troupe was called the Original Ballet Russe . Colonel de Basil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped to keep it going in Manhattan through the winter , was shrewd , bland S. ( for Sol , for Solomon ) Hurok , famed concert manager . <P> Sol Hurok has another ballet to his string . The Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo , directed by swart , 44-year-old Leonide Massine , onetime maitre de ballet for Colonel de Basil , had opened in Manhattan , had now begun a 22-week tour of the U. S. The Massine ballet lacked pretty young stars and its ensemble would not make the Rockettes jealous , but it had two of the world 's best ballerinas : dark , svelte British Alicia Markova , who excels in classic ballets like Giselle and Swan Lake , and dark , vivacious Alexandra Danilova , who was in the old Diaghilev company , Danilova - once married to Massine 's rival choreographer Georges Balanchine-dances with a gaiety and precision which belie the fact that , in her late 30s she is old for a ballerina . <P> Dancer Massine now confines himself to character dancing ; like an actor , he knows how to give an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with deft body movements , well-timed claps and stomps . But where the De Basil ballet is short on men-its best is David Lichine , choreographer as well as dancer-the massine troupe has four of the best : Roland Guerard of Flat Rock , N.C. one of the first U.S.-born Ballet Russers who was allowed to dance under his own name ; Frederic Franklin , exuberant British onetime hoofer ; and two genuine Russians , Igor Youskevitch and Andre Eglevsky . These dancers perform capably the difficult leaps , entrechats ( crossing of the feet in midair ) tours en l'air ( twirls in the air ) demanded by the classic style . <P> For all its eye-filling and breath-taking qualities , the Ballet Russe has its **25;8091;TOOLONG the more grave because much U.S. money has gone into the ballet , notably from such backers as Edsel Ford and Yeast Scion Julius Fleischmann . Whereas Diaghilev was imaginative , ahead of his time , and not above shocking his audiences . Mr. Hurok 's two troupes make little effort at even keeping up to date . Massine 's ballet , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best in the modern theatre , has slipped from the repertory ; Sol Hurok does not like it . Among the new ballets now presented by the two companies , the best has to do with a man who died a century ago , Fiddler Paganini.
