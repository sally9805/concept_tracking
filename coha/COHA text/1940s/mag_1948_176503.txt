The Luck of the Irish ( 20th Century-Fox ) burdens a pleasant little comedy with a forbiddingly sticky title . The movie is just about as sham as most shamrock tales , but , with one exception , it is presented with taste and ingenuity . The exception : sequences taking place in Ireland are smeared with a green tint that displays the world as through a shower curtain . <P> Like the same studio 's Miracle on 34th Street , the new picture is a fantasy in which a pixie ( well played by Cecil Kellaway ) takes sides in a conflict between two oversimplified sets of values . The conflict involves Newsman Tyrone Power , who must choose between Good ( writing as he pleases for " nickels and dimes " and marrying lovely Anne Baxter ) and Evil ( selling out to New York Publishing Tycoon Lee J. Cobb and his predatory daughter , Jayne Meadows ) . Any leprechaun knows the difference between good &; evil , but it takes some time for a stuffy hero to figure it out . <P> This picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fantasy - and works its miracles with a minimum of photographic hocuspocus . <P> <P> Larceny ( Universal-International ) is as slick as the two con men ( John Payne and Dan Duryea ) who set out to fleece a pretty , not very bright war widow ( Joan Caulfield ) . Their plot is to persuade the lady to finance a youth center as a war memorial to her hero-husband-or rather , as a paid-up charity benefit for themselves . Their dastardly scheme is clicking along like the southbound express when it develops a hotbox . Payne is far too successful as a lady-killer . He has a hard time convincing the widow that he is not part of the memorial package he is trying to sell , and he can not escape the relentless pursuit of a gun moll named Tory ( Shelley Winters ) . <P> Neither of the girls gets him , and Miss Winters gets nothing , finally , but a lead slug in her midriff . But not before her shrewd playing has made Tory a wench to be remembered . Larceny ends on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made its crooks into likable lads who seem to be getting a raw deal . This medium-budget picture 's brisk , realistic details may make its manufacturers a tidy profit . <P> <P> In the past year Shelley Winters , 26 , has made solid hits in two successive pictures . The other was A Double Life , in which she played the waitress who got strangled . She is no longer regarded as just another cute platinum blonde : she has graduated into the actress category . Her bosses speak hopefully of " an amalgam of Harlow and Lombard , " and are billing her as " the blonde bombshell . " If she is not as bold as Harlow nor as brittle as Lombard , she is frequently as bouncy as Betty Hutton and as breezy as Grable . Even in repose , she is still a nifty blonde ( 5 ft. 4 in. ) with bright , blue eyes . <P> Her parts in two unreleased films are also villainous .
