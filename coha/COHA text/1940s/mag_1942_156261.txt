Senator Harry Byrd , the apple-cheeked Virginia apple grower who has staked his political future on his reputation as a pinchfist , last week unloosed a new array of figures . Congress has appropriated and authorized $205 billions for war . Of this incomprehensible vastness , about $163 billions have not been spent . At the present spending rate ( $4,494,000,000 in July ) , the fallow $163 billions will take two years to spend . His point : Congress stands to lose control of spending , because the unspent balances amount to blanket appropriations ; taking into account taxes , war appropriations and non-defense spending , it is inevitable that the Federal debt will rise from the present $80 billions to more than $200 billions .
