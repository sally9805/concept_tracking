In the winter of 1943-44 , after a bloody mauling at Salerno , the men of the 36th Division went back into the line . A few weeks later , at the Rapido River , the Fifth Army 's Lieut . General Mark Clark committed them to one of the bloodiest engagements of the Italian campaign . <P> German artillery , high in the hills , were zeroed in on the river banks . German mines were thickly sown along its shores . Major General Fred Walker , the division 's commander , thought ( and told General Clark ) that an attempt to cross the river at that point would be suicide . Nevertheless lean , nerveless Mark Clark ordered the attack and drove the 36th at the river for three days . In those three days the 36th lost more than 2,000 men-taken prisoner , wounded or killed . <P> Six months later Walker was sent back to the U.S. in a training command . The 36th , with replacements , fought on , landed in southern France , fought its way into Germany . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world as much as they hate lanky , stubborn Mark Clark . <P> Last week , as the 36th Division , built on a skeleton of Texas National Guardsmen , held a reunion in Brownwood , Tex. , the men who still remembered the frightful days at the Rapido did what they always promised they would do . They demanded that Congress investigate the " colossal blunder and take the necessary steps to correct a military system that will permit an inefficient and inexperienced officer , such as General Mark W. Clark ... to destroy the young manhood of this country . " Said one company commander : " I had 184 men . . . 48 hours later I had 17 . If that 's not mass murder I do n't know what is . " <P> Marines who had seen battalions melt at Tarawa and Iwo Jima might tell him .
