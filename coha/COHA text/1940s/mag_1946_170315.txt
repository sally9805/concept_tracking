The fight for the heavyweight championship was just a week away . The accident of war had given it the longest , ( five year ) buildup in history and canny Promoter Mike Jacobs , who generally knows what the traffic will bear , had scaled ringside seats at an imposing $100 apiece. * <P> At Pompton Lakes , N.J. , where Joe Louis trained , he played gin rummy like he fought-coolly , with a slight trace of a frown . He laughed , though , when he got a first-card knock : " Boy , you sure got to concentrate on this game . . . . " Joe did n't like to lose , even when he was playing for fun . <P> After a nap , the 212-lb. champion climbed into the ring for a workout . His lethal right hand , the payoff weapon , looked like a lead weight . His left seemed to have lost its old lightning . His legs had thickened at the thighs . Said Joe : " I know I look lousy . . . it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the time to look good was for one hour on the night of June 19 , in Yankee Stadium . <P> The Boss . Some of the training camp second-guessers thought G.I. Joe 's come back pace was too slow after four years in the Army . He had boxed only 113 rounds against 235 for Conn . But he hit the road every morning at 6 a.m. to run and walk six miles ( Conn ran only two miles ) , caught up on sleep by dozing through his rubdowns , drank only bottled mineral water . <P> Joe was his own boss . For the first time in 60 fights , he was doing his own managing , signing papers , paying bills . At 32 , Joe Louis was a bit past his fighting prime but he had his strategy figured out : " If I boff him , Billy loses his head . When he loses his head , I got him . " The fight odds were 13-to-5 in Louis ' favor and never wavered when a millionaire Texas oilman bet $300,000 on Challenger Conn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , outbox Joe for twelve rounds back in 1941 , then fall from one murderous punch . <P> The Other Camp . Twenty miles away at an abandoned resort hotel on Greenwood Lake , Pittsburgh 's 182-lb . Billy Conn looked good - in training . There were no gin rummy games in his camp any more : Billy had lost $1,800 to his brother in less than a week . Now they played quick two-handed poker games , anteing $20 bills , and raising with $205 . Occasionally Billy commanded Manager Johnny Ray : " Gim me another hundred . " Said Manager Ray : " We 're just a bunch of plain , ordinary bums having a good time . " <P> Billy 's big assets were his youth ( at 28 he was in his prime ) , speed and the best left hook in boxing . He had come out of the Army weighing a blubbery 204 ; now his legs were lean , his shoulders solid . His strategy : " Make Louis back up . . . when you do , he loses half of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , the fans showed what they thought of Uncle Mike 's prices . Just before Willie Pep knocked out Sal Bartolo to become undisputed featherweight champion , the fight announcer ballyhooed the details of the coming heavyweight fight , and was drowned out by boos . The day before , Manhattan police raided the Jacobs Ticket Agency , just around the corner from Mike 's office , found the best seats being scalped for $175.
