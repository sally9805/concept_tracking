txt With the city 's truck tie-up getting worse instead'of better at the I end of its second week , Mayor O'Dwyer decided yesterday to name Hugh E. Sheridan , impartial chairman of the local trucking industry , as his personal representative in seeking a settlement of the tangled labor dispute . The Mayor acted after most of the 4,300 members of Local 282 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters , AFL , had returned to the idle list , causing new disruption in food and freight movements . The signing of individual contracts by Local 807 , spearhead of the strike , slowed up during the day , but the local reported that 4,911 of its 9,400 members were back at work on the union 's terms . In New Jersey , trucking was expected to return to normal this morning under an agreement between Local 478 and the Associated Express and Truck Owners of New Jersey . The agreement covered 3,100 striking drivers in the Newark area , the . only group that had been away froth its trucks . Task Faced by Sheridan The task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting the thirteen New York aixtNew Jersey unions to agree on a uniform set of demands.and'then persuade ' the " five employer associations to accept them . Mr. Sheridan , who has been chief arbitrator in the trucking industry for eight years and who enjoys the confidence of both sides even though he is president of one of the.city 's most important trucking concerns , commented ruefully that he would have to be a " Houdini " to fulfill the Mayor 's assignment T is is the situation that confronts him : The employer associations insist they have a binding agreement with the area-wide committee , representing the unions , to sign contracts calling for a blanket wage increase of 15 cents an hour and no other gains . Local 282 is asking for a general pay rise of 25 cents an . hour , a welfare program and other concessions that would bring the total increase in labor.costs to 37 cents an hour , according to employer estimates . Local 807 has signed contracts with 727 employers covering more than half its membership that Previde a wage increase of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour in hospitalization , sickness ? and death benefits . Local 816 , smallest of the three , general trucking locals in this city , has kept its members at work , under contracts . based on the 15-cent formula worked out by Government mediators and union and employer representatives before the strike . The Newark settlement between Local 478 , a member of the . area wide committee , and its employers provides an Open=end contract under which an increase of 15 cents is guaranteed , plus any additional pay rise that may be won in the final settlement of the New York . strike . The Newark , agreement also grants a welfare fund providing sickness and accident benefits of $25 ' for twenty-six weeks . Fail Cooperation Promised Employer and union spokesmen promised , full cooperation to Mr. Sheridan in the carrying out of his new duties , but none of the factions indicated any disposition to depart from its present position . Privately , however , some hope was expressed that Mr. Sheridan might float a " face-saver " under which all the parties might agree on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed by Local 807 . This would mean higher pay for the members of Local 816 , and would cause only a theoretical loss to Local 282 as it has not yet entered into any contracts with its employers . In appointing Mr. Sheridan , the Mayor made it plain that he expected the unions to unify their demands and thus bring order out of the " chaotic condition " into which the trucking industry had been plunged . He emphasized that there could be no stability in the industry if each local held out for its own wage program . This warning was underscored by Mr. Sheridan , who pointed out that employers who signed conr tracts calling for a lower wage rate would have an unfair competitive advantage over those who were obliged to pay their drivers a higher rate . Mr. Sheridan , in addition to his services as arbitrator , is president of Sheridan &; Duncan , which moves ' freight for the New York Central Railroad and which has been tied up by the stoppage of members of Local 282 . He said he felt his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unions could harmonize their demands . However , there was no hint from the committee representing the five employer associations of any willingness to go beyond the 15-cent figure . At a meeting last night at the Pennsylvania Hotel , .. 500 truck owners voted unanimously to stand Eta .. E. Shea-Mara fast against signing on the terms sought by Local 807 or 282 . Joseph I Adelizzi , chairman of the joint committee , said those at the meethig employed nearly 7 ; 000 of the 8,000 striking . drivers . As a token of their adamancy , the employers - filed suit against Local 807 for $3,000,000 in damages , alleging that the local had violated the Taft-Hartley Law by refusing to bargain collectively with the employers ' committee . Herbert Burstein of Zelby , ' Burstein and Reich , counsel for the owners , said it was the first time the law had been used to support an action based on the theory that an employer was entitled to damages if it could be proved that a strike was the outgrowth of an unfair labor practice . In another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Board to cite Local 282 for a similar violation of the TaftHartley Law . It was indicated that a Federal court action against the local would be filed today or tomorrow . Milk Supply Holds tril The most adverse development in the trucking situation yesterday was the halting of deliveries of milk containers from the Brooklyn and Jersey City plants of the American Can Company . However , negotiations for a contract that would permit prompt resumption of the movement of containers were under way last night , with union officials hopeful that a settlement would be reached . Local 807 had issued a special permit to the company last week to avoid interference with the dish tribution ' of containers ; but the union insisted , that the company adhere ? tO. , the .. 47.4 ' - cent . contract IerMula it ? cOndition of continuing-the deliveries .

' , The renewed stoppage by mem= bers of Local 282 , who had begun trickling back to work Monday after an unofficial sympathy strike , was occasioned ' by the refusal of their employers to promise to makel retroactive to : Sept. 1 any wage increase finally ag-eed upon . MoSt , of the ' employers , . acting on instructions from the joint committee , insisted that the drivers be bound by the 15-cent agreement reached before the strike . John J. O'Rcitirke , president of Local 282 ; * accused the owners of " locking out " the members of his union . He said all trucking operations between yards and piers of the New York Central and Pennsylvania Railroad had been halted .
