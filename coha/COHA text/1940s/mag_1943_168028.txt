Other minds and imaginations than those of statesmen focused last week on the role the U.S. must play in a future world . Two years ago the Federal Council of the Churches of Christ in America set up a commission to study the bases for a " just and durable " peace. + Last week came the commission 's findings-a six-point program which it hopes will be adopted by the Congress and Administration as the official policy of the U.S. <P> Urging American participation in an international alliance of all nations to pre-serve the postwar peace , the Council 's program laid down these fundamentals : <P> &gt;International political cooperation based on the present unity of the United Nations . ( " Such collaboration should , as quickly as possible , be universal . But practically , the initial nucleus is the United Nations . . . . Europe particularly illustrates the need for regional collaboration . . . . " ) <P> &gt;Control of economic and financial acts which may disturb international peace . ( " . . . All people are subject to grave risk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , disrupt the flow of world trade . . . . The world requires that the areas of economic interdependence be dealt with in the interest of all concerned . . . . " ) <P> &gt;Establishment of an organization to adapt the treaty structure to changing conditions . ( " We must have an organization to promote changes in the treaty structure ... as may be needed to keep that structure responsive to future changes in underlying conditions . " ) <P> &gt; Autonomy for subject peoples . ( " There is a ferment among many peoples who are now subject to alien rule . That will make durable peace unattainable unless such peoples are satisfied that they can achieve self-rule without passive or active resistance to the now constituted authorities . " ) <P> &gt;International control of armaments . ( " Military establishments everywhere should be brought under some form of international control . . . . The economic and military power of the world community should be subject to mobilization to support international agencies which . . . serve the general welfare . " ) <P> &gt;Religious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to economic causes . They have their origin also in false ideologies and in ignorance . ... It is therefore indispensable that there exist the opportunity to fuller knowledge of the facts . . . . Spiritual and intellectual regimentation that prevents this is a basic underlying cause of war . . . .
