The Queen had an especially radiant smile for the fish wives as the latter plodded past the reviewing stand with fish baskets slung over their shoulders and their skirts kirtled , showing their long pink and white striped petticoats . Munitions workers , women as welt as men , many of whom displayed the medals awarded them in World War I , also had their place of honor among the paraders .
