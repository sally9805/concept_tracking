txt A reader picking up this or any other metropolitan newspaper today must realize that he is getting a more complete picture of the world than he did while the war was still going on . The United States and Britain have wiped out wartime censorships . Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek announced this week that " within a specific time limit " press censorship would end in China , which should mean that outgoing dispatches will be free of interference . France has lifted restrictions on outgoing news , though retaining the right to rebuke correspondents for " unfriendly " or " tendentious " communications . The situation is better in Eastern Europe . We can not say , however , that it is as good as it ought to be in either Russia or China , in both of which countries a peacetime censorship has long existed . Something more is involved here than the desire of newspapers , press services and radio chains to satisfy the curiosity of their patrons . Something more is invqlved , even , than the important principle of freedom of the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experiment in international relations .. How can we carry out the purpose of the United Nations Charter to " achieve international cooperation in solving international problems of an economic , social , cultural or humanitarian character " if there is not a free flow of pertinent information ? These objectives do not depend on a few leaders who can meet behind closed doors . They require the understanding and assent of whole peoples . China has a one-party Government which the Generalissimo assures his fellow-countrymen is soon to give way to a more representative form . Russia does not intend to drop the one-party system , though her spokesmen main-. tain that democracy , in their sense , is possible within the system . America manifestly will not make the arrogant and foolish attempt to alter the system in Russia or China . What we do desire is to furnish the Chinese and the Russians with as much information about ourselves and our country as they desire , and in return to learn more about their countries and themselves . We need information if we are to help them with loans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a mutually profitable trade with them . We need to know the why as well as the what of their ways of living and doing business . Surely the dignity of Russia , after her magnificent victory , and of China , after her heroic endurance , will not suffer from a little Western sunlight and a sweep of Western air . Both countries have reason to be proud . Both profess to desire our friendship , and assuredly we want and need theirs . This is , as Mr. Willkie discovered , one world . There can peaceably exist within it a variety of political and economic systems , but in essentials the nations are interdependent . Civilization goes forward as a whole , lags as a whole , could collapse as a whole . It can go forward if we really have the " cultural and educational cooperation " eftntemplated in Chapter IX of the Charter . But first we have to lift the veil of censorship and unnecessary secrecy .                  @ @ @
