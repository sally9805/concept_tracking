All day long Rio 's fashionable hairdressers entwined flowers , jewels and ostrich plumes into lacquered coiffures . The weather was warm-but ladies who like to show off their platinum fox coats showed up at the Teatro Municipal in them anyhow . The cheapest seats in the gallery were $4.80 ; and the house was sold out . Baldwina ( " Bidu " ) de Oliveira Sayao ( rhymes with bye now ) , the cause of it all , was not surprised . Said she : " When they love an artist , they really love . " <P> For her first home-town performance in six years , Soprano Sayao chose Debussy 's ethereal opera , Pellas et Mlisande , which she considers her best job at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House . ( Said she : " I do n't know how Brazilian audience will receive this thing . They just begin to understand Wagner and Debussy maybe . " ) Her suspicions were right . <P> Brazilians yell themselves hoarse over the spectacular quartet from Rigoletto , but they listened coolly while Sayao and French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luckily for Bidu , she could do no wrong in Rio . <P> Pert , red-haired little Bidu Sayao was born into one of Rio 's wealthiest families 39 years ago . She made her debut at Manhattan 's Metropolitan in 1937 , became famed for her slight-voiced but lyrically graceful Manon , Mimi ( in La Bohme ) and Meisande . <P> But for years Bidu gave Rio a wide berth . Reason : in her last appearance there in 1940 she was booed and hissed by a claque . The claque had been hired , cried she , by a jealous operatic impresario named Gabriella Besanzoni . Bidu swore she would return only when Besanzoni was out of power . Last week in true operatic fashion , Gabriella - now retired - swooped backstage after the first night 's performance . Gabriella , dressed in full-length ermine , gathered Sayao into her arms and kissed her on both cheeks . <P> <P> *Cellist Gregor Piatigorsky , Dr. Koussevitzky .
