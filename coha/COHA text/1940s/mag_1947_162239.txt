With un-Bostonian enthusiasm , the Atlantic Monthly had beaten the drum for its 90th anniversary number : " No night fireworks over the lagoon , no drum majorettes , trotting races or paper hats . Nary a clam will be baked . Just a slightly fatter than usual issue filled . . . with a rich assortment of good reading . . . . Otherwise , it will be the same kind of supernormal , extraordinary , quite-without-precedent , all-time-high collection that the subscribers get in the mail every month . " <P> The flamadiddles were justified . In the November anniversary number , Editor Edward A. ( " Ted " ) Weeks had rounded up : Albert Einstein on atomic-energy control ( as told to Raymond Swing ) ; war letters of General George S. Patton Jr. ; unpublished love letters of Mark Twain ; excerpts from the notebooks of Henry James ; part of a new novel by John P. Marquand ; articles by George Bernard Shaw , Budd Schulberg , Sumner Welles , Sir Richard Livingstone. * To show off these prizes to better advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its first four-color cover and had its type face lifted by topnotch Typographer W. A. Dwiggins . <P> New Flavor . In Weeks 's nine years as editor , the Atlantic 's circulation had climbed to a record 160,956 . After years of losing money or just breaking even , it had made money from 1943 through 1946 . But it had slipped into the red in its last fiscal year , chiefly because of heavy spending for promotion . It is continuing the spending , and " does not expect to turn the profit corner this year . " Weeks knew that soaring paper and production costs might mean hard times ahead . But he hopes that the promotion splurge and the Atlantic 's color ( and photographs he plans to put on covers ) will help it to hit 200,000 and bring in more advertising . <P> Like the eight distinguished editors before him , New Jersey-born , Harvard-educated Ted Weeks is careful to nurture the Atlantic 's New England roots , but just as careful not to trip on them . He does not forget that the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the Atlantic 's ivy-covered Back Bay brownstone home on Arlington Street , opposite the Public Garden , Weeks labors at a furious pace . He does much of his work in a Windsor chair with his lap full of manuscripts , shortens interviews by seating visitors in an uncomfortable straight-backed Italian chair . <P> Old Trees . The Atlantic gets 40,000 manuscripts a year and the nine-man staff reads them all . ( The G.B.S. piece came in " over the transom " - unsolicited . ) Associate Editor Charles W. Morton helps Weeks develop new article ideas . They understand each other so well that conferences are as elliptical as shorthand . ( Morton to Weeks : " Atomic bomb-Einstein . " Weeks to Morton : " I 'll call Swing . " ) <P> Weeks pays $100 to $350 for stories and articles , three times as much as his predecessors did . Editor Weeks gets bargains because of the Atlantic 's prestige . And by encouraging new writers , he has often been able to use their later fame-and articles - to add to this prestige . The only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , and the Atlantic is now ahead of it in circulation . Weeks wishes there were more competitors . Old trees , he likes to say , are always healthier when they stand together ,
