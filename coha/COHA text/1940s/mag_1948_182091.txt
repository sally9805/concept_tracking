Paul-Henri Spaak , Belgium 's Socialist Premier , is usually several jumps ahead of political trouble . Last week he was caught off guard . Paul Struye , Spaak ' s Minister of Justice , had just commuted the death sentence of two Belgian collaborators . When Socialists joined Communist deputies in protest , Struye , a member of the Catholic party , handed in his resignation , bringing down the coalition cabinet of Socialists and Catholics . <P> " This is not a political crisis , " he declared , " It is a crisis for our consciences . " Out of 1,166 Belgian traitors sentenced to death since the liberation , 232 had already been shot . Struye ( himself a Resistance hero ) had personally sent 107 to their death . Said he : " On my soul and conscience , I declare that those 107 deserved supreme punishment . " Now he thought it was time to slow down . Spaak , just back from the U.N . in Paris , agreed . " Yes , " he declared , " this government is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we not return to those happy days when the death penalty was abolished in Belgium ? + Is not the abolition of the death penalty a victory of humanity and civilization ? " A Communist deputy jumped to his feet . " Do n't interrupt me , " exclaimed Spaak . " It 's hard enough to see my way clearly as it is . " When the Regent Prince Charles asked him to form a new government , Spaak resisted : " With the U.N. , the chairman ship of O.E.E.C. , Western military union and the direction of Belgium 's Foreign Office , do n't you think that 's enough for one man ? " But he finally gave in , promised to try to form a new coalition cabinet . Sensible Belgians agreed with a tart observation made by the Brussels newspaper , Nation Belge : " To save two heads , the government was decapitated . Was it worth it ? " <P> + Spaak was wrong . The death penalty was never legally abolished in Belgium , but from 1865 to 1909 King Leopold II automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
