C44 HOW EDITH McGILLCUDDY MET R. L. STEVENSON A STORY BY JOHN STEINBECK ALINAS was a dirty little California 0 cow-town in 1879 . There was a small and consistent vicious element ; there was a large wavering element , likely to join the vicious element on Saturday night and go to church repentant on Sunday . And there was a small embattled good element , temperance people , stern people . Twenty saloons kept the town in ignorance and vice while five churches fought valiantly for devotion , temperance , and decency . The McGillcuddys belonged by right , by race , and by inclination to the good element . Mr. McGillcuddy passed the plate in the Methodist church ; for the McGillcuddy family had joined the Methodists at a time when anyone who was n't a Presbyterian was automatically an atheist or an idolator , Mrs. McGillcuddy labored at making the trousers that were sent twice a year to Africa and to the Sandwich Islands to curb the immorality of those backward peoples . The little twelve-year-old Edith McGillcuddy , however , was a problem . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the matter of the company she kept . She could and did play decorously with the children of her own class but , left to her own devices , she invariably drifted to those dirty-faced children who , if they went to Sunday school at all , worshipped sticks and stonesin the basement of the Catholic church . This was a matter of alarm and sometimes of anger to Mr. and Mrs. McGillcuddy . One Sunday morning in summer , when the sunshine lay sweetly on the weedy lots and when the sloughs on the edge of town sent up an arrogant smell of moss and frogs and tules , Edith was given five cents and started on her way to Sunday school . She had no intention of going anywhere else . Of course she rattled a stick against the fence pickets as she went along , but it was a small clean stick . She walked carefully to keep dust from flying on her blackinged shoes , and she did n't climb a fence and cut across lots because by so doing she might have torn her long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front every now and then to see that the pink hair ribbon was stiff and perfect . Had she climbed the fence none of this adventure would have happened . She walked around it instead and , at the corner , sitting among the mallow weeds , was Susy Nugger , a little girl of Edith 's age but not of her class . Susy 's hair strung down over her eyes like the forelock of a pony . Her face was sticky and streaked where candy juice had collected dust ; one puffed cheek was tight-stretched over a black all-day sucker . Her gingham dress was gray with dirt and she wore neither shoes nor stockings . Susy reclined among the yellowing mal-low weeds and looked at the light summer sky . Occasionally she removed the sucker to see how it was getting along . Edith did n't see Susy until she came abreast and until Susy spoke . " Where you going ? " Edith knew she should n't stop , but she did . " Going to Sunday school . What you doing ? " " Sucking on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , " said Susy . Her words were mushy because of the sucker . The two girls eyed each other belligerently . " Well , I guess you better go on , " said Susy . " I 'm going to a free funeral . " She watched with satisfaction the interest rising in Edith 's face , and she saw with malice that Edith was unconsciously picking her hair ribbon . " What 's a free funeral ? " Edith demanded . " They 're all free . They do n't even pass the plate at funerals . I been to lots of them . " Susy plucked some little cheeses from the mallow weeds and put them in her mouth on top of the sucker . " I bet you never went to a funeral that had a free train ride to it . " Edith 's hair ribbon suffered . " Train ride to where ? " " To Monterey , that 's where , and back too . And it do n't cost a cent to mourners or friends of the deceased . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Edith . Susy took the paling sucker from her mouth and regarded it maddeningly . " Well , if I cry a little ever'body 'll think I am . " Edith scuffed one toe in the dirt , forgetting the new blacking . " Why'nt you come along ? " Susy suggested . " No . I got to go to Sunday school . Got the nickel for the plate right here . " " Why'nt you wait till next Sunday and put two nickels in . They do n't care just as long as they get it sometime . " " God might not like it , " said the weakening Edith . Susy guilefully pressed on . Nice-people she might not be , but logician she was . " When you pray for some-thing do you get it right off ? No , sometimes you wait a long time for it and sometimes you do n't get it at all . I prayed for about a million things and I never even got a smell of them . Why'nt you let God wait a week for his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was terribly wrong , but Susy was powerful and subtle . Out of her gingham pocket she drew a huge all-day sucker , scarlet and shiny . " I was saving this red one for the funeral . IL 's a hot one . " Edith gave up . " The red ones always are hot , " she said kindly . " Well , this one is the hottest you ever had . I tasted it . It 'll burn the mouth right out of you . I ate the black one first because I like the red ones best , but you can have it . " Edith accepted the sucker and the bribe . " What train we going on , the big train ? " " Of course not , " said Susy . " We 're going on the narragauge . Not just one car either . The Alvarez family rented the whole train . They 're going to bury ' Tonio Alvarez in Monterey . " Before she put the big sucker in her mouth Edith rubbed it a little on her sleeve to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better be going to the depot and get a seat , " she said . The funeral train was festive in a mournful kind of way . First was the little engine rolling black smoke out of its head and puffing steam out of its belly . After that was the flat car carrying the coffin on two saw-horses . Flowers and pillow pieces were piled all over the coffin car and no one sat on it . After that came four more flat cars with benches for the mourners . Black crepe hung from the funnel of the engine and lined the sides of the cars . By special arrangement with the company the train bell tolled mournfully . Edith and Susy got there just in time . The coffin was in place and the benches were nearly full of mourners . On the first two cars ladies and gentlemen in black formal clothes sat stiffly , ready handkerchiefs and smelling salts clutched in their hands . They had already got the churching over with . The priest and the family sat on the first car . The last two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the benches were cluttered with lunch baskets and paper bags and cans of milk . Edith saw with relief that she and Susy were not the only ones who were combining a funeral and a free train ride . For there were courting couples whose self-imposed gravity was constantly racked with giggles . There were hair-trigger children who needed only a leader or an incident to break into happy riot . The engine bell tolled mournfully on and the steam from the stomach of the engine hissed . Susy and Edith squeezed in and sat on the floor between two rows of benches . Already Edith 's face was streaked with red from the sucker ; her hair ribbon was a ruin , and in crawling up on the flat car she had torn the knee out of one of her long ribbed stockings . There came a pause to the tolling bell . Then the whistle screamed . The wheels turned and the little train gathered speed . It moved out of town and into the yellow grain fields . The wind rushed by . Some of the smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hayfields . Women gathered their dresses about their ankles and pinned their veils tight round their throats . The priest hugged his surplice close . Two boys were fighting already on the last car . Through the ripening country the train tore at twenty miles an hour . The sparrow hawks flew up from the squirrel holes and the blackbirds soared away in flocks , like wind-blown black curtains . The wind was warm and it was perfumed with the funeral flowers and with the black smoke from the engine . The sun shone brilliantly down ; the little train raced on through the hayfields . Now a few people , made hungry by all the excitement , began to open the lunch baskets . Ladies pushed their veils up to take each bite of sandwich . The children in the last car threw orange peels and apple cores at one another . The train left the yellow fields and entered the bleak country where the earth is dark sand and where even the sagebrush grows small and black . And then the round , sparkling bosom of Monterey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell tolled . Four men had climbed forward to the coffin car to hold down the larger and more expensive bunches of flowers and the symbolic funeral pieces , such as pillows and flower crosses and broadsides of red geraniums with lambs in white verbenas . A group of small boys on the last car began to snatch caps and throw them from the train . It is remarkable that during the whole trip no one fell off the train . Nervous mothers spoke of it afterward , spoke of it as a provision of Providence , probably set in motion by the sacred nature of the journey . Not only did no one fall off , but no one was hurt in any way . When the train pulled into the depot at Monterey every passenger was safe . Ladies ' clothes were a bit blown , but since their dresses were black they did n't show the engine smoke at all . At the station in Monterey a crowd was waiting , for Monterey was the home seat of the Alvarez family , and the big granite tomb was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few surreys for the immediate family . The rest of the people formed in a long line to walk to the graveyard . Just as they were about to move , the brakeman shouted , " The train will start back at four o'clock , and it wo n't wait for nothing . " The granite vault was open , its bronze doors wide . The crowd of people stood in a big half circle facing the entrance , and the coffin was in front of the door . The people had put their lunch baskets behind tombstones , out of the hot sun . Edith was alone now , for the treacherous Susy had allied herself with a little girl who carried a big lunch pail . Edith had seen them walking in the procession , Susy helping to carry the pail . And now the grave service was going on , and Edith stood between two big men . She could see the inside of the vault with the inscribed squares where other coffins lay . She felt deserted and alone . The priest said the hollow burial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  suddenly she sobbed aloud . One of the big men looked down at her . " Who is this ? " he asked of the big man on the other side . " I do n't recognize her . " The other man glanced down at her and shrugged his shoulders . " One of ' Tonio 's bastards , I guess . The country 's full of them . " Edith stopped crying . She did n't know what a bastard was , but she was glad to be one if it gave her an official position at the funeral . She watched while the coffin was carried into the vault and slid into the little black cave that was ready for it . Then the tomb door clanged shut and the people began to disperse , some to eat their lunches in the cemetery and others to search out the shade of oak trees on the hill behind the graveyard . The crickets were singing in the tall grass and the bay breeze blew in over the graves . Edith looked for Susy and found her with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eating thick sandwiches . Susy called out ungraciously , " Go away ! There 's just enough for Ella and me , huh , Ella ? Ella 's my friend . Huh , Ella ? Ella knows me . " Edith turned disconsolately away . A reasonably well-fed McGilleuddy would n't think of eating thick sandwiches with Susys and Elias , but Edith was growing hungry . Her insides were hollow too from the dry scanty wind . Nearly all the people were gone . Edith noticed that the wind brought with it a delicious odor . There was kelp in it and crabs and salt and clean damp sand ; but it was a lonely smell too . As Edith walked down toward the bay she thought of Salinas . Were her people looking for her body down wells or in the quicksand holes of the Salinas River ? For her family probably thought Edith was dead . Her eyes dampened . She thought how it would be to be dead , not in a dry , comfortable coffin like ' Tonio Alvarez , but floating in the stale water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oozy quicksand . She felt very sad as she walked through the sunny streets until she came to the beach . The little waves were lipping on the sand . A few rowboats lay bottom up on the beach . A wavy line of dead sea-weeds left by the high tide cut the white beach in half . Edith walked thoughtfully to one of the overturned boats and sat down on it . There came a scrabbling sound from under the boat . Edith got down on her knees and looked underneath . She leaped hack quickly , for a dirty little face was peering out at her . The face and a frousy , frizzled head came worming out from under the boat , and a red dress followed , and long , skinny bare legs . It was a plain ragamuffin . Compared to this little girl , Susy was as elevated as Edith was above Susy ; for this little specter of dirt and low-classncss not only had a dirty face and uncombed hair ; what was infinitely worse , she had on no pants under the dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time . She was on her knees now , clear of the boat , and she stared at Edith with animal eyes . " What you doing under that boat ? " Edith demanded . The ragamuffin spoke in a hoarse , cracked voice . " Nothing . I was just laying there . What 's it your business ? " " What 's your name ? " Edith continued sternly . Her tone cowed the wild girl . " Name 's Lizzie . And I never seen you before neither . " " Of course you did n't . I came to the funeral from Salinas . " " Oh ! That old funeral . I could of went to that . But I did n't want to . " " Sure , you could of walked to it , " Edith agreed sarcastically , " but you could n't of come over to it from Salinas on a train . " The shot was deep . Lizzie changed the subject . " There 's a lady in this town smokes cigarettes . " " I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeering triumph came on Lizzie 's face . " Ho ! You do n't believe it , Miss Smarty-face . Well , I can show her to you with a cigarette right in her mouth . " " I do n't believe it , " Edith said again , but there was no conviction in her tone . She knew of course that it was impossible , but Lizzie 's manner wavered the impossibility . " You can come with me and I 'll show you , " Lizzie continued . " And we can make a nickel too . " " How ? " " Well , this lady that smokes and a man with long hair live up to the Frenchman 's . They buy ever'thing . They bought abalone shells even , and they could of picked up all they wanted . Ever'body sells things to ' em . I bet they 'd even buy dirt for a nickel . They are n't sharp ; that 's what my pa says . " " What are we going to sell them ? " Edith asked . " Huckleb'rries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Huckleb'rry Hill and help pick a bucket of berries , and we 'll take them down , and the man with long hair 'll give us a nickel for them , and you can see the lady smoking . " " Is the man with long hair an Indian ? " " I do n't think so . He 's just kind of crazy . That 's what my pa says . " " Is he scary ? " " No , he ai n't scary . He treats you nice and gives you a nickel for ever ' - thing . " A warmth of yellow was in the afternoon sun as the two little girls climbed the hill among the tall straight pines . The straight shadows lay on the needle beds , and the little crisp dead pine twigs snapped under the girls ' feet . Fallen pine cones littered the ground . Lizzie showed Edith how to bruise the Ycrba Buena under the heel so that the sweet smell of it arose into the air . They tore their way through a blackberry thicket and the thorns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they came to the open slope where the neat huckleberry bushes grew , and the tips of the twigs were loaded with black fruit and the leaves of the bushes were as shiny as mirrors . " There , " said Lizzie . " Now we 'll pick them . Do n't mind if you get leaves in the bucket because those people will buy anything . " Edith watched while her new friend filled half the bucket with pure huckleberry leaves . That helped to make the bucket fill up with berries more quickly . It took very little time to make the top brim with the black , shiny berries . The girls ' hands were purple-black with the fruit juice . The sun was even yellower when they went back down the hill and the wind came swishing up from the bay . The little fishing boats with sails were spanking home in the afternoon . " Suppose they are n't home ? " Edith suggested . " The train 's going back to Salinas at four o'clock . " " Do n't you worry . They 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the lady 'll be smoking . " They trudged through the dirt streets of Monterey . A few horsemen idled about and a few rigs were tied to the sidewalk hitching posts . A barouchc passed , bearing a sad lady in black satin , and the polished spokes of the wheels flittered in the sunshine . At last Edith and Lizzie came to a large white adobe house . There were two storeys to the house and the curtains were red . Beside the house there was a high wall of limestones set in mud . Little eaves perched on top of the wall to keep the rain from washing the mud away . A heavy two-leaved gate was in the wall , and in the middle of the gate was a big iron ring . Over the wall the tops of fresh green trees showed and the tips of ivy . Lizzie whispered hoarsely , " They 'll be sitting right on the ground . They always are . " " On the ground ? No chairs ? " " Right hell on the ground , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground too . " " I do n't believe it , " said Edith . " Well , you watch then . " Lizzie picked up a stone from the ground and hammered on the gate . sharp voice called , " Eu11 on the ring if you want to get in . " Lizzie reached and gave the ring a tug . The gate posts must have leaned inward , but without help , the heavy leaves folded open by themselves . Edith 's eyes widened ; her mouth dropped open ; her hands hid in the folds of her ruined dress . It was just as Lizzie had said it would be . The yard was flagged with smooth limestones . Nice trees lined the walls . Toward the back of the yard a white cloth was on the ground and a teapot and cups . On one side of the cloth sat a lady in a white dress smoking a cigarette , and on the other side squatted a longhaired young man with a lean , sick face and eyes shining with fever . A smile came on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not change her expression ; she just looked blankly at the two little girls standing in the open gateway . Edith and Lizzie stood self-conscious and clumsy . When the young man spoke , some kind of a memory rippled in Edith 's head . " What is it you want , girls ? " Lizzie 's hoarse , cracked voice came explosively . " Huckleb'rries , " she croaked . " Nice fresh huckleb'rries . Fi ' cents a bucket . " The young man put a lean hand in his pocket and brought out a coin . Edith and Lizzie marched stiffly forward . Lizzie held out the bucket of berries and took the coin in her purple paw . Then , without warning , she whirled and ran like a rabbit out the gate . It was so silent in the yard that Edith could hear the retreating footsteps for a time after the disappearance of her friend . Edith turned slowly to the people . The lady 's face had not changed . A little spurt of smoke escaped from her nose and writhed in her dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did you , did n't she ? " he observed . Then Edith 's anger arose . " That 's not all , " she said sharply . " The bucket 's more than half leaves . " The long-haired man smiled on . " It always is , " he said gently . " One must take that into consideration . " " You knew it ? " Edith demanded . " Oh ! Gracious , yes . But , " he said softly , " I did n't care . " The woman on the other side of the cloth spoke for the first time . " They just take you for a fool . They make a fool of you . " The man pinched the tip of his nose . " It 's not bad sport to be a fool , " he said , " ? for five cents . " He faced Edith again . " Will you have a cup of tea ? " She looked yearningly at the fat brown teapot on the ground and at the fat brown sugar bowl and cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mother wo n't let me . " The man bowed in the face of this law . Edith continued quickly , " But if it 's half milk , that 's cambric tea . " " Certainly it is , " he said sharply . " Certainly it is . " " And I can have that . " He poured it for her and held out the brown sugar bowl . Edith sat down on the ground . The woman still gazed at her , but Edith 's courage came back . Edith was what she was . " You are n't an Indian , I guess , " she observed . " No . I 'm really not . " " Because , " she went on , " you talk pretty near like Granma McGillcuddy . " " You have a Granma MeGilleuddy ? " the young man cried . " My own name is Edith McGillcuddy and I live in Salinas and I came on a train to the free funeral . . . " The man turned to the woman . " Take note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more in a line than I could do . There 's condensation for you , and his-tory , and if you were so minded  --  philosophy . " The woman looked slightly annoyed . Edith sipped her cambric tea and continued , " I should of gone to Sunday school . " " You should , all right , " agreed the man . " Salinas is twenty miles away , is n't it ? " " Yes , and it 's a nice town , but there 's no ocean beside it and it 's got twenty saloons . " Edith nodded dismally to show how bad the last fact was . " The McGillcuddys of Salinas , " he murmured , " and you came in a train to the free  --  look , what 's a free funeral ? " At that moment a high scream filled the air . Edith grew tense . The scream was repeated . " I know , " she cried . " It 's the train going back . " She ran wildly out through the big gates and kited down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she climbed aboard . And that was how Edith McGillcuddy met Robert Louis Stevenson . WILD MARES RUNNING BY FRANK SWAIN U NDER the breast of a crimson hill By a desert pool , at close of day  --  I three horses , three wild mares Running , at play .
