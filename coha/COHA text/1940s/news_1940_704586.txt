txt Attorney General Robert H. Jackson is being deluged with protests against the high-handed methods allegedly employed by Chief 0-Man J. Edgar Hoover in " gettting his man . " The Federal Bureau of Investigation , over which Mr. Hoover presides , is a division of the Department of Justice , but several Attorneys General have found it easier to give Mr. Hoover a free hand in pronouncing policy and running his Bureau than to cross him . With the accession of Mr. Jackson to the Attorney Generalship , a new attack on Mr. Hoover has been launched by liberals who charge his methods in " taking glamor from the criminal and giving it to the G-Men sometimes have violated the civil liberties guaranteed by the Constitution . " Specific cause of complaint was " third degree " treatment G-Men allegedly had given 16 persons arrested in Detroit for violating Federal law by enlisting volunteers for the Spanish Loyalist Army . Senator George W. Norris , - outstanding Senate liberal , wrote the letter of protest to the Attorney General . As soon as Senator Norris ' letter appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had complaints to make against Mr. Hoover . The Civil Service Commission remembered its old feud with Mr. Hoover over his refusal of its examination and selective services on the ground that he can get better equipped G-men and keep his staff freer from politics than he could if he worked through the civil service . The issue as to whether wire tapping is a proper method of obtaining evidence was revived . Mr. Hoover 's pronouncement that there is no place in this country for " parlor pinks " was compared with statements from Attorney General Jackson and former Attorney General Frank Murphy that there would be no Department of Justice prosecutions for political opinions while they were in office . Mr. Hoover 's winter in Miami , Fla. , his facility for timing publicity , his yearly trips to Hollywood , Calif. , in behalf of anti-crime movies , his ' fondness for night clubs , have all been brought up and discussed , whether they had any bearing on the real issue or not .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
