txt Walter P. Reuther , president of the United Automobile Workers , C10 , opened its twelfth constitutional convention today by excoriating industrial management and Wall Street as the unwitting allies of the Soviet Union who were driving America " down the road to a depression . " He made a fighting speech designed to mobilize the 2,400 delegates in support of a showdown with the Ford Motor Company that he said would come within two weeks . Declaring that industry had closed ranks against all increased labor costs in 1949 , Mr. Reuther said there would be no retreat by the UAW in the face of such opposition . He asserted that Ford this year had the money with which to meet the workers ' demands for pensions , a health and security fund and a wage increase , " and we are going to go after them in Ford in 1949 . " The chieftain of more than 1,000,000 workers berated big business and economy-minded Congressmen for attempting to cut back production and Government expenses . He declared that more purchasing power for workers and decreased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mentioned The 1949 demands of the automobile union , he told the cheering throng in Milwaulthe Auditorium , represented part of the answer , and the workers would strike , if need be , to win them . " We are going to change that in America , and we are going to start in the next couple of weeks , " he shouted . The Ford contract was to expire next Friday midnight , but has been extended on a day-to-day basis at the request of the UAW . The timetable projected informally today by Mr. Reuther would bring about the showdown before July 25 . Only a surrender by the Ford Company would avert strike action , he warned , declaring that " we say to them here and now we are prepared to use all the weapons possessed by free labor in America in these negotiations . " Mr. Reuther , who called for a strong alliance between labor and the farm group in creation of a new political bloc in the nation , received support from President Truman in the latter 's greetings to the convention . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility than many unions to the people of the country " because your organization has as one of its objectives the formation of a strong working alliance between the workers of one of our key urban industries and the workers on the land . " " In forming the bond between these two groups you have an opportunity to serve the common . interests and the common aspirations of millions of our people , " Mr. Truman said . " The Administration shares your determination that we shall continue along the road to a better understanding between labor and management and that we must have economic conditions which will enable the working ' men and women of our country to enjoy their full share of the fruits of our economy ' " Decent Labor Laws " Asked " We must maintain a high level of employment , with a low level of unemployment We must make sure that the purchasing power of our people remains high . We must have decent labor laws . We must provide better educational opportunities for our youth , and we must have a broader program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of our people , " Mr. Truman stated . The convention was only a few hours old when Mr. Reuther received a convincing demonstration of the power he now holds over the organisation . The delegates , by a show of hands that appeared to be about ten to one in the affirmative , voted for a motion that was admittedly unconstitutional after Mr. Reuther had told them that the constitution would be changed later in the convention to take care of the matter . The motion was to adopt the report of the rules committee , including a provision that all international officers be elected together rather than separately as in the past and as required by the constitution . The decision was believed to presage smooth rolling by the Reuther band wagon through the convention . Mr. Reuther kept up a running attack on Wall Street and the National Association of Manufacturers throughout his speech , starting off with the statement that " the real people who are supporting Joe Stalin 's world plan do n't live in labor unions . " " Economic Royalists " Hit " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Franklin Roosevelt characterized as the economic royalists , the boys in Wail Street , the people who control the National Association of Manufacturers . They are sitting there in Wall Street . on their fat money bags and instead of cutting prices and profits to keep our economy going in high gear they are cutting production and laying workers off . " The people in Wall Street who are doing these things that drive the nation down the road to depression are Joe Stalin 's real fifth column agents in America , not people in the labor movement . " Mr. Reuther said the conflict in this country was between " two kinds of planning . " " 1t is privately planned economic scarcity by companies for profits or publicly planned economic abundance for people , " he went on . " That is really the struggle , I say the challenge can be met . " We have to build a broad coalition of labor and farmers in America and weld a joint political and economic program . With a program that makes pense , these forces , welded together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "
