( See Cover ) <P> " I think the time has come to fill the sad vacancies in the Sacred College . " Thus Pope Pius XII this week addressed about 30 oldtime cardinals who had foregathered , along with the Pontiff , in the Vatican 's Consistory Hall . His Holiness read the names of 32 prelates whose domains were scattered from Mozambique to Berlin , from Armenia to Australia ( TIME , Jan. 7 ) . <P> " Quid vobis videtur ? " ( " What do you think ? " ) inquired the Pope . The Princes of the Church stood up , removed their red skullcaps , bowed in assent . The papal proposal was not a surprise to them : the Pope 's intentions had been announced to all the world two months ago . <P> The ceremony opened the five days of public pageantry and secret meetings which made up the Church 's first Consistory since 1940 . The ceremonies , a reminder to the world of the venerable traditions and teachings of the Church of Rome , had been preceded last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world had changed since the Sacred College first met in the 12th Century : two giant planes had brought to Rome the new U.S. cardinals-Archbishops John J. Glennon of St. Louis . Samuel A. Stritch of Chicago , Edward Mooney of Detroit and Francis J. Spellman of New York . <P> That arrival from the skies marked the arrival of the U.S. , its principles and policies , as a major force in the temporal and even spiritual policies of the Vatican . Rome , which once looked uncertainly toward the American Church , today looks to the U.S. as : 1 ) the world 's most effective counterweight to the newly emergent power of Russia ; 2 ) the world 's greatest reservoir of food and goods to forestall the further demoralization of Europe ; 3 ) the world 's greatest embodiment of the form of government which offers the Church its best milieu for survival-democracy . <P> This represents , in sum , the greatest reorientation in Church policy since the Council of Trent . <P> As a political experiment , the U.S. has been viewed with misgivings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new republic seemed based upon philosophical premises of a heretical nature and imbued with an alarming spirit of independence , not confined to temporal affairs . <P> There was also , in European Catholic circles , a fastidious tendency to identify Catholicism with Europe itself . Wrote Englishman Hilaire Belloc : " The culture of the U.S. is , from its original religion and by its momentum and whole tradition , opposed to the Catholic Church . " <P> Until as late as 1908 the U.S. was regarded by Rome as a missionary province-it had to import priests to care for the faithful , money to support their activities . The Vatican had permitted the U.S. clergy to choose the first three of their bishops , beginning with John Carroll of Baltimore in 1789 , had then taken alarm . For the next century , U.S. bishops were chosen by Rome 's Society for the Propagation of the Faith , and those selected were most often either Irish or French in background .                   @ @
