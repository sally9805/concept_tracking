Nine years ago in Bradford , Pa. , an engineer named C. G. ( " Center of Gravity " ) Taylor gave up the corporate ghost trying to manufacture and sell a light , cheap airplane , the Taylor Cub . On the auction block went his two-year-old Taylor Brothers Aircraft Corp . For $522.50 a native Bradford boy , husky , genial William Thomas Piper , ex-oilman , engineer and Harvard hammer thrower , whose flying experience consisted of one short ride , bought the defunct firm . With an additional $2,877.50 he formed Taylor Aircraft Co. , took Taylor in as partner . <P> For five years the two worked at cross purposes , Piper plugging for cheap mass production , Taylor for experimental engineering techniques . By 1936 they had turned out 333 planes , made no money . Weary of quarreling , losing his money , Planeman Piper bought out his partner for $5,000 . With his three Harvard sons . <P> William T. Jr. , Thomas and Howard ( " Bill , " " Tony " &; " Peg " ) , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the company 's first net profit-$9,706 . Then catastrophe struck . <P> While Planeman Piper was attending the Los Angeles aircraft show on March 16 , 1937 , his plant burned to the ground . Only 15 planes , some wings , fuselages , spare parts were saved . When he got back , he found his mechanics out on the field putting together a plane with one silver wing , one red one . Pocketing his $75,000 loss ( virtually no insurance ) , he bought a fireproof brick building from Susquehanna Silk Mills in Lock Haven , Pa. , 80 miles away , renamed his company Piper Aircraft Corp. , and started over . His loss for the year was only $39,555 , and in 1938 profits were $14,031 . Last year he added a fireproof repair shop , 15 hangars , a shipping room , and profits zoomed to $94,213 on $1,768,652 worth of sales . <P> Today 60% of U. S. light planes sold are Piper Cubs . The three-place , 75-h.p.cruiser ( price : $1,798 ) and the two-place , 65-h.p . Coupe ( price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruise at 87 , have a range of 320 to 380 miles . The slower trainers sell for as little as $995 . Last year Piper 's total production was 1,753 planes of all types , of which some 75% were bought on the installment plan ( many of them for training amateurs at U. S. airports ) . <P> With comparatively few of his Cubs in the hands of private owners , Planeman Piper is doing everything possible to stimulate private flying . His sales policy includes a free training course with each plane sold . Last week he was pleased as punch to deliver twelve Cub Coupes ( equipped with two-way radios and blind-flying instruments ) to the Civil Aeronautics Authority , which is making many potential Piper customers by training 10,000 new pilots this year . To get ready for them , the No. 1 U. S. light plane maker last week offered 33,290 shares of stock ( price : $8.75 a share ) to the public . Investors snapped it up , oversubscribed the issue in the first hour .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
