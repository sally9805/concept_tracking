water , how can we tie cloths about all of them ? Our ancestors taught us wisdom in seatless trousers . Shall we flout their wisdom ? We have three wash maids as it is . " " In our house she would not be troubled with any small children except our own , " Madame Wu said . " And with her own a woman learns wisdom . " She was too kind to tell Madame Kang that in this matter she secretlyfelt sympathy with Linyi . The wet nurses and maids in this house were continually holding out the babies to pass their water on the floor until one did nut know where to step . Madame Wu had never allowed these easy-going ways in her own house . The maids had always commands to take the small children into certain corners or behind trees . Madame Kang looked doubtfully at her friend . " I would be glad for you to have her , " she said . " She needs to be married and have her mind taken up . But I love you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel she will demand foreign learning in Fengmo even if she is willing to marry him . She will think it shameful that he speaks no foreign language . " " But with whom would he speak it ? " Madame Wu asked . " Would she and he sit together and talk foreign tongues ? It would be silly . " " Certainly it would , " Madame Kang agreed . " But it is a matter for pride , you know , in these young women , nowadays , to chatter in a foreign tongue . " The two ladies looked thoughtfully at each other . Then Madame Wu said plainly , " Either Linyi must be satisfied with Fengmo as he is , or I shall have to let the matter drop . War is in the air , and my sons may not go off to coastal cities . Here we are safe , for we are provinces away from the sea . " " Wait ! " Madame Kang was suddenly cheered . " I have it , " she said . " There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engage him as a tutor for Fengmo ? Then when I speak to Linyi , I can tell her Fengmo is learning foreign tongues . " " A foreign man ? " Madame Wu repeated doubtfully . " But how could we have him come into the house ? Would there not be disturbances ? I hear all Western men are very lusty and fierce . " " This is a priest , " Madame Kang said . " He is beyond such thoughts . " Madame Wu considered the matter still more thoughtfully . " Well , " P101she said at last , " if Linyi should insist upon this , it would be better than sending Fengmo away from us into a foreign school . " " So it is , " Madame Kang agreed . Madame Wu rose . " Then you will speak to Linyi and I will speak to Fengmo . " " If Fengmo will not ? " Madame Kang asked . " He will , " Madame Wu said , " for I will choose the right time . With a man , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . " " How well you know , " Madame Kang murmured . The two ladies rose and hand in hand wandered out of the room . Tea was set in the court and some cakes . " Will you not stay and refresh yourself , Sister ? " Madame Kang asked . But Madame Wu shook her head . " If you will forgive the discourtesy , " she said , " I will go home . Today may be the right time for me to speak to Fengmo . " She did not like to tell even Madame Kang that Fengmo might be disturbed because he had seen Ch'iuming before she had gone into his father 's courts . She said good-by and left some money for a gift to the maid who had prepared tea , and Ying came from the servants ' rooms where she had been gossiping , and so Madame Wu went home again . The first person whom she saw , however , upon her return was not Fengmo , but the foreigner , Little Sister Hsia . Even as all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on in the Wu family house and the Kang family house , who were the two great families , so Madame Wu knew that Little Sister Hsia 's cook also had heard and told the news . Little Sister Hsia was just crossing the main court inside the gate when she saw Madame Wu . She stopped at once and cried out , " Oh , Madame Wu , I have just heard  --  it ca n't be true ? " " Come in , " Madame Wu said kindly . " Is it not a fair day ? The air is not often so clear at this season . We will sit outdoors , and Ying must bring us something to eat . It must be nearly noon . " She guided Little Sister Hsia across the general court and into the one which was her own . " Please sit down , " she said . " I must go to my own rooms for a moment . But rest yourself . Enjoy the morning . "  |p102Smiling  and making her graceful bows , Madame Wu withdrew into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It must be we shall have rain , again , " she muttered . " The devils are out . " " Hush , " Madame Wu said . But she smiled as she sat down before the mirror . She smoothed a hair out of place , touched her cheeks with powder , and changed her earrings from plain gold ones to her jade flower ones . Then she washed and perfumed her hands and went outdoors again . Little Sister Hsia 's pale face was twisted with sympathy . She rose from her chair with the awkward swiftness which was her habit . " Oh , good friend , " she sighed , " what a trial has come on you ! I never dreamed  --  Mr. Wu seemed so different from other men  --  I always thought  --  " " I am very glad you have come this morning , " Madame Wu said lightly , with her warm smile . " You can help me . " They were seated . Little Sister Hsia leaned forward in her intense way , her hands clenched together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dear Madame Wu , sometimes the Lord punishes those whom he loves  --  " Madame Wu opened her large eyes widely . " Do you wish to preach gospel this morning , Little Sister ? " she inquired . " If you do , I will postpone what I was about to say . " " Only to comfort you , " Little Sister Hsia said , " only to help you . " " But I am very well , " Madame Wu said in surprise . " I heard , I thought  --  " Little Sister Hsia faltered , much bewildered . " You must not heed the gossip of servants , " Madame Wu said gently . " They always wish to be bearers of some exciting news . Had they their way we should all be ill today and dead tomorrow and risen again on the third day . " Little Sister Hsia looked sharply at Madame Wu . Was she making a joke ? She decided not to be angry . " Then it is not true ? " she asked . " I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wu returned . " But I can assure you that nothing happens in this house without my knowledge and my permission . " She took pity on the slight purplish blush that now spotted the pale foreign face at which she looked . " You are always kind , " MadameWu said gently . " Will you help me ? " Little Sister Hsia nodded . Her hands fell limply apart . A shade of disappointment hung about her pale lips and eyes. ,  |p103Madame  Wu touched her own pretty lips with her perfumed silk handkerchief . " I feel my third son needs more education , " she said in her gentle voice , whose gentleness seemed always to put distances between her and the one to whom she spoke . " I have decided , therefore , to have him taught by a suitable foreign man to speak a foreign language and read foreign books . After all , what was enough for our ancestors is not today enough for us . The seas no longer divide the peoples , and Heaven is no more our own canopy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the city whom I can invite to teach Fengmo ? " Little Sister Hsia was so taken aback by this request that had nothing to do with what she had heard that for a moment she could not speak at all . " I hear that there is a foreign priest , " Madame Wu went on . " Can you tell me about him ? " " Priest ? " Little Sister Hsia murmured . " So I hear , " Madame Wu said . Little Sister Hsia looked doubtful . " If it is the one I think you must mean , " she said , " I do n't think that you would want him for your son . " " Is he not learned ? " Madame Wu inquired . " What is the wisdom of man , dear friend ? " Little Sister Hsia asked . " He is as good as an atheist ! " " Why do you say that ? " Madame Wu asked . " I can not think he is a true believer , " Little Sister Hsia said gravely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Wu said . " There is only one true religion , " Little Sister Hsia said positively . Madame Wu smiled . " Will you ask him to come and see me ? " she asked . She was astonished to see a flying dark blush sweep over the plain face before her . " He is unmarried , " Little Sister Hsia said . " I do n't know what he would think if I were to visit him . " Madame Wu put out a kind hand and touched the bony fingers lying on Little Sister Hsia 's lap . " None could suspect your virtue , " she said . The kindness melted the foreign woman 's shyness . " Dear Madame Wu , " she said , " I would do anything to help you . " The edge of intensity crept into her voice again , but Madame Wup104put it off gracefully , disliking intensity above all things . " You are so good , " she said . She clapped her hands , and Ying came in with the tray of tea and sweetmeats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Then she took steps to help her guest to leave . " Now , " she said in her sweet way , " would you like to make a prayer before you go ? " " I 'd love to , " Little Sister Hsia said . She closed her eyes and bowed her head , and her voice began its fervent address to someone unseen . Madame Wu sat in graceful silence while this went on . She did not close her eyes . Instead she watched Little Sister Hsia 's face with forebearing comprehension . How empty was this soul , so alone , so far from home ! She had come across the sea to do her good works . All knew of her , of her weekly meeting to teach sewing to beggar women . All knew that she lived poorly and gave away most of what she had . But how lonely the woman in this poor creature ! A kind affection stirred in the depths of Madame Wu 's heart . Little Sister Hsia was ignorant , of course , and one could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was lonely . When Little Sister Hsia opened her eyes she was astonished at the liquid warmth she saw in the great beautiful eyes of Madame Wu . For a moment she thought her prayer had been miraculously answered . Perhaps God had touched the heart of this heathen woman ? But Madame Wu rose and by that firm movement bade Little Sister Hsia farewell . " You will send the priest to me soon ? " she asked and made it a command in the asking . Against her will Little Sister Hsia found herself promising that she would . " How can I repay you ? " Madame Wu said courteously . " At least , let me say this , Little Sister . In return for your kindness in arranging a teacher for my third son , please pray for me whenever you like . " So she dismissed her visitor . All day during this day Madame Wu had not forgotten what Ying had told her , that she had heard Rulan sobbing in the night . But Madame Wu had long ago learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in order . This order was first in her own mind . She had tried to see Tsemo and Heaven had preventedit . The time was not ripe , therefore . And as she had learned to do , while she pondered on large things , she acted on small ones.  |p105She  sent for the cook to bring in his monthly accounts , which had been due two days earlier but which he had withheld , feeling the confusion in the house . Madame Wu read these accounts and remarked on the high price of the fuel grass . Now , Ying always took care to be present when the accounts were presented , for she believed that her husband , although a better cook than any could find , was nevertheless not clever at anything else . When " Madame Wu spoke of the fuel , she knew at once that some other servant had reported the matter , and she guessed that it was a certain middle-aged woman servant who had once approached the cook with offers of love . But Ying 's husband knew better than to look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sour and could not find enough fault with Ying and the cook . When Madame Wu mentioned the fuel , Ying cried out to her husband , " You bone , I told you not to get it at the West Gate Market ! Everything is more dear there . " " We should not buy any fuel at all as early as this , " Madame Wu said . " The fuel from our own lands should be enough until the eighth month , when new grass can be cut . " " The steward has plowed some of the grass lands , " the cook replied . Madame Wu knew it was not necessary to carry the matter further . She accepted his excuse since she had administered her rebuke , and she closed the books and gave them to him . Then she went to her money box and brought out what was due on the past month and enough to use as cash for the next month . The family numbered something over sixty persons , including all mouths , and the sum was never small . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next , and with him the two sewing women , and Madame Wu discussed with them the summer garments required for servants and family , the changes of bedding , and such matters . When these were finished , carpenterscame in to estimate the costs of repairs to two leaking roofs , and the building of a new outhouse for storage . To all such affairs Madame Wu gave her close and entire attention . It was her talent that whatever she did , it was with the whole of her mind and for that time nothing else was . When one affair was settled , her mind went wholly to the next one . Thus during this day she accepted one task after the other . It was only when dusk came on and the household matters were finished that she acknowledged her own thoughts again . They centered on Fengmo.  | " I have this day proceeded very far toward the decision of his life , " she thought . She had not risen from the big chair by the library table , at which she had worked all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her decision that he should marry Linyi , nevertheless it was only just that she should talk with him and allow him some freedom first to rebel . She summoned Ying from the next room where she was preparing the bed for the night . " Go and tell Fengmo to come here , " she said . She hesitated while Ying waited . " And when you have summoned my son , " Madame Wu went on , " invite the Second Lady to appear at the family meal tonight . " Ying pursed her mouth and went away , and Madame Wu sat , her finger and thumb to her lip , while she waited . At this time Fengmo would be in his room , since it was about the hour for the evening meal . If Fengmo were in good humor with what she decided , she would eat tonight with the family instead of alone , as she had done during the last few days . It was time for her to come out and take her place among them again . In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step of each son . Liangmo 's was slow and firm , Tsemo 's quick and uneven , and Yenmo ran everywhere . But Fengmo walked with a rhythm , three steps always quicker than the fourth . He appeared at the door of the library , wearing his school uniform of dark-blue cloth . On his head was a visored cap of the same cloth , and on the cap was a band giving the name of his school , the National Reconstruction Middle School . Madame Wu smiled at her son and beckoned to him to come in . " What is the meaning of this National Reconstruction ? " she inquiredhalf playfully. t " It is only a name , Mother , " Fengmo replied . He sat down on a side chair , took off his cap and whirled it like a wheel between the fingers of his two hands . " It means nothing to you ? " Madame Wu inquired . " Of course we all want national reconstruction , " Fengmo replied . " Without knowing what it means ? " Madame Wu asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At present I am having difficulty with algebra , " he replied . " Perhaps when I have overcome that I will understand National Reconstruction better . "  | " Algebra , " Madame Wu mused . " In India several such studies were first devised and then found their way to Europe . " Fengmo looked surprised . He never expected his mother to have any knowledge out of books , and Madame Wu knew this and enjoyedsurprising him . " You look pale , " she said suddenly . " Are you taking your tonic of deers ' - horn powder ? " " It tastes worse than rotten fish , " Fengmo objected . Madame Wu smiled her pretty smile . " Then do n't take it , " she said comfortably . " Why take what you dislike so much ? " " Thank you , Mother , " Fengmo said , but he was again surprised . Madame Wu leaned forward , and her hands fell clasped into her lap . " Fengmo , " she said , " it is time we talked about your life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stopped whirling the cap . " Yes , " Madame Wu repeated , " your life . Your father and I have already discussed it . " " Mother , do n't think I will consent to your choosing a wife for me , " Fengmo said hotly . " Of course I would not , " Madame Wu said quickly . " All that I can do is to bring certain names to you and ask you if you like any of them . Naturally I have considered your tastes , as well as the position of the family . I have put aside any thought of such a girl as the Chen family 's second daughter , who has been brought up in oldfashionedways . " " I would never have such a girl , " Fengmo declared . " Of course not . But there is another difficulty , " Madame Wu said in her calm way . " The girls are also demanding much today . It is not as it was when I was a girl . I left all such things in my mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's place . But now the girls  --  the sort you would want , Fengmo  --  do not want a young man who can not speak at least one foreign tongue . " " I study some English in school , " Fengmo said haughtily . " But you can not speak it very well , " Madame Wu replied . " I do not know that language myself , but certainly I hear you stammer and halt when you make those sounds . I do not blame you , but so it is . " " What girl will not have me ? " Fengmo asked angrily . Madame Wu rode to her goal upon this anger as a boat ricks the surf to the shore . " Madame Kang 's third daughter , Linyi , " she said , 1p108and while she had seen no interest pass between them , Fengmo 's present anger was enough . He was immediately interested . " That girl ! " he muttered . " She looks too proud . I hate her looks . " " She is really very handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the important thing . I do not speak of her except as one of others . If Linyi , who knows our family and position , still objects to you , can we look higher ? " " You could send me away to a foreign school , " Fengmo said eagerly . " I will not do that , " she replied in her pretty voice that was neverthelessas inexoral ) le as sun and moon . " There will be war over the whole world in a few years from now . At such a time all my sons must be at home . " Fengmo looked at her astounded . " How can you tell such things , Mother ? " " I am not a fool , though all the world around me are fools , " Madame Wu said quietly . " When certain steps are taken and n9 ne prevents them , then more steps are taken . " The boy was silent , his eyes fixed on his mother 's face . They were large and black like hers , but they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too young . But he did not speak , as though he were struggling to comprehend the things of which she spoke . " I have heard there is a foreign priest here in the city , " she went on , " and he is a learned man . It is possible that for a sum he would teach you to speak other languages . For this are you willing ? Foreign languages may serve you well some day . It is not of marriage only that I think . The times ahead are due for change . " Her voice , so clear , so musical , was nevertheless full of portent . Fengmo loved and feared his mother at the same time . To him she was always right , and the few times that he had disobeyed her she had not punished him , but he was always punished nevertheless , Slowly and hardly he had learned that what she said carried wisdoms But , being a boy , he demurred for a moment . " A priest ? " he repeated . " I do not believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to believe in religions , " she said in reply . " It is not of that we speak . " " He would try to convert me , " Fengmo said sullenly . " Little Sister Hsia is always trying to convert everybody in the house . Whenever she passes me she hands me a gospel paper . " " Do you need to yield to conversion ? " Madame Wu asked . " Arep109you so weak ? You must learn to take from a person that which is his best and ignore all else . Come , try the priest for a month , and if you wish then to stop his teaching , I will agree to it . " It was the secret of her power in this house that she never allowed her will to be felt as absolute . She gave time and the promise of an end , and then she used the time to shape events to her own end . Fengmo began to whirl the cap slowly again between his hands . " A month then , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " " A month , " Madame Wu agreed . She rose . " And now , my son , we will go to the night meal together . Your father will have begun without us . " In the Wu household men and women ate at separate tables . Thus at the threshold of the great dining room Fengmo parted from his mother and went to one end , where his father and brothers and the men cousins were already seated , and Madame Wu walked with her usual grace to the tables where the women were seated . All rose at her approach . She saw at once that Ch'iuming had taken her place among them . The girl sat shyly apart from the others and held a small child on her knee . With this child still in her arms she rose and managed to shield her face with the child . But Madame Wu had taken a full look at her before she did this . The girl was grave , but that was natural in a strange household . It was enough that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wu said courteously to all and to no one . She took her own place at the highest seat and picked up her chopsticks . Meng had been serving the others , and Madame Wu put her chopsticks down again . " Proceed for me , please , Meng , " she said . " I have been busy all day with household matters , and I am a little weary . " She leaned back smiling , and in her usual way she gave a word to each of her daughters-in-law , and she spoke to Meng 's little boy whom the nurse held . The child was fretting , and Madame Wu took her chopsticks and chose a bit of meat and gave it to him . Then she spoke directly to Ch'iurning . " Second Lady , " she said kindly , " you must eat what you like best . The fish is usually good . " Ch'iuming looked up and flushed a bright red . She rose and gave a little bow , the child still clutched in her arms . " Thank you , Elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She sat down and did not speakp110again . When a servant put a-bowl of rice before her she fed the child first . But by this kind address Madame Wu told the whole house that Ch'iuming 's place was set , and that the life of the family must now include this one added to it . All heard the few words , and a moment'ssilence followed them . Then servant spoke to servant and nurse to child to cover the silence . Madame Wu accepted the food given her and began to eat in her delicate slow fashion . The little grandson , wooed by the gift of the meat , now clamored suddenly to come and sit on her knee . Meng reproved him tenderly . " You with your face and hands all dirty ! " Madame Wu looked up as though she had been in a dream . " . Is it me the child wants ? " she asked . " He is so dirty , Mother , " Meng said . " Certainly he is to come to me , " Madame Wu said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set him on her knee . Then with her instinctive daintiness she took up a pair of clean chopsticks and found bits of meat in the central bowls and fed them to the child . She did not speak , but she smiled at each mouthful . The child did not smile back . He sat as though in a dream of content , opening his little mouth and chewing each bit with silent pleasure . It was Madame Wu 's usual effect on children . Without effort she made them feel content to be near her . And she took content from the grandchild . In him her duty to the house was complete , and in him , too , her secret loneliness in this house was assuaged . She did not know she was lonely , and had anyone told her that she was , she would have denied it , amazed at such misreading . But she was too lonely for anyone to reach her soul . Her soul had outstripped her life . It had gone out far beyond the four walls within which her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the past and climbed toward the future , and her many thoughts played about that constant voyaging . But now and again her soul came home to this house . It came back now . She was suddenly fully aware of this child and of his meaning . The generations marched on , hers ending , his beginning . " Son of my son , " she murmured and continued to put bits of meat into his small red mouth , opened for what she gave . When he was fed she gave him to his mother . But before the others had finished she was finished , and she rose begging them to continue , and walked slowly out of the room . As she passed Mr. Wu and her sons they greeted her , half-rising fromp111their seats , and she smiled and inclined her head and went on her " way . That night again she slept the whole night through and did not wake . But to Ch'iuming the half-hour of Madame Wu 's presence was her marriage ceremony . The night had left her confused . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not spoken one word to her , and he had left her before dawn . She had slept after that until noon . No one had come near her all afternoon except a woman servant . Then she had been bidden by Ying , at evening , to join the family meal . She had hastened to make herself ready for this , and when the time came she had slipped into the dining room late , and had quickly taken the child from his nurse . He had not cried . But children never cried with her . In the village she had cared for many babies of farm mothers . One by one the ladies who were now her relatives had greeted her , half carelessly , half shyly , and she had only bent her head a little in reply . Nor could she eat . But after Madame Wu had left the room , she suddenly felt ravenousand , turning herself somewhat so that she did not face the others , she ate two bowls of rice and meat as quickly as she could . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meng and Rulan went away . But Meng in her gentle kindness stayed a moment to speak to her . " I will come to see you tomorrow , Second Lady , " she said . " I am not worthy , " Ch'iuming replied faintly . She could not meet Meng 's eyes , but she was comforted and happy . She lifted her eyes , and Meng saw the timid desolate heart . " I will come and bring my child , " she promised . And Ch'iuming went out with the women and children , hiding herself among them from the men . But they looked at her , each in his own secret fashion . That night Mr. Wu came early to the peony court , and she was not yet in bed . She was sewing upon her unfinished garments when she heard his step . She rose as he entered and turned her face away . He sat down while she stood , and he cleared his throat , put his hands on his knees , and looked at her . " You , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must not be afraid of me . " She could not answer . She clung to the garment she held with both hands and stood like stone before him.  | " In this house , " Mr. Wu began again , " there is everything to make you happy . My sons ' mother is kind . There are young women , my sons ' wives , and young cousins ' wives , and many children . You look good-tempered , and certainly you are obliging . You will be very happy here . " Still she did not answer . Mr. Wu coughed and loosened his belt a little . He had eaten very heartily , and he felt somewhat breathless . But he had not finished what he wished to say . " For me , " he went on , " you have only a few duties . I like to sleep late . Do not wake me if I am here . In the night , I like tea if I am wakeful , but not red tea . I am hot in blood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other things you will learn , doubt-less . " The garment dropped from her hand . She looked at him and forgother shyness . " ' Then  --  I am wanted ? " She put the question to him out of her longing to find shelter somewhere under Heaven . " Certainly , " he said . " Have I not been telling you so ? " He smiled , and his mooth handsome face lit from a sudden heat from within him . She saw it and understood it . But tonight she would not be afraid . It was a little price to pay , a very little price to pay a kind man , for a home at last . LITTLE SISTER HSIA was always acute to her duty , but Madame Wu had not expected such promptness , for seven or eight days later Ying came running in . Her little round eyes were glitteringwith surprise . " Lady , Lady ! " she cried . Madame Wu was walking among her orchids , and she stopped in displeasure . " Ying ! " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fish on a hook . Now tell me what is the matter . " Ying obeyed her , but almost immediately she began again , " The largest man  --  I ever did see  --  a foreigner ! He says you sent for him . " " I ? " Madame ' Wu said blankly . Then she remembered . " Perhaps I did , " she said . " Lady , you said nothing to me , " Ying reproached her . " I told the gateman by no means to let him in . We have never had a foreign man in this house . "  | " I do not tell you everything , " Madame Wu replied . " Let him come in at once . " Ying retired , stupefied , and Madame Wu went on walking among her orchids . Even in so short a time the plants had revived after their transplanting . They would do well in this shadowy court . She wondered if the new peonies were doing as well . At this moment she heard a deep , resonant voice from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She had been expecting the voice but was not prepared for the quality of its power . She looked up from the orchids and saw a tall , wide-shouldered man in a long brown robe which was tied about the waist by a rope . It was the priest . His right hand clasped a cross that lay on his breast . She knew that the cross was a Christian symbol , but she was not interested in that . What interested her was the size and strength of the hand which held it . " I do not know how to address you , " she said in her light silvery voice , " otherwise I would return your greeting . Will you come in ? " The priest bent his great head and came through the gate into the court . Ying followed behind him , her face pale with fright . " Come into my library if you please , " Madame Wu said . She stood aside at the entrance for the priest to enter ahead of her . But he loosened his hand from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In my country , " he said smiling , " it is the lady who enters first . " " Is it so ? " she murmured . " But it is true that I had perhaps better lead the familiar way . " She went in and sat down in her accustomed seat and motioned toward the other chair across the table . Ying crept to the door and stood staring , half hidden . Madame Wu saw her . " Ying , come out , " she commanded her . Then she turned to the priest with a slight smile . " This silly woman has never seen a man of your size , and she cannotkeep from looking at you . Pray forgive her . " The priest replied with these curious words , " God gave me this immense body perhaps for the amusement of those who look at me . Well , laughter is a good thing . " His great voice rumbled around the room " Heave ,  --   --  Ying said faintly , looking up into the beams above her , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fetch hot tea , " Madame Wu commanded to calm her , and Ying scuttled away like a cat.  |p116These  words , said so calmly , struck Madame Wu as sharply as though a hidden knife had pierced her without her knowing exactly where it had struck . She began at once to deny them . " I am , on the contrary , entirely happy . I have arranged my life exactly as I wish it . And I have sons  --  " He lifted his deep and penetrating eyes , but he did not speak . Insteadhe listened attentively . It was the quality of this silent and absolute attention which made her falter . " That is , " she went on , " I am entirely happy except that I feel the need of more knowledge of some sort . What sort 1 do not know myself . " " Perhaps it is not so much knowledge as more understanding of that which you already know , " he said . How did it come about that she was speaking to this stranger of herself ? She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply . " It was not for myself that I have invited you to come hither , " she said . " It is for my third son . I wish him to speak a foreign language . " " Which language ? " he inquired . " Which is the best ? " she asked . " French is the most beautiful , " he said , " and Italian is the most poetic , and Russian the most powerful , German the most solid . But more business is done in English than in any other . " " He had better study English then , " Madame Wu said with decision . She lifted her eyes to his dark face . " What is your fee ? " " I take no fee , " Brother Andre said quietly . " I have no use for money . " " A priest with no use for money ? " Her smile held a fine irony . " I have no use for money , " Brother Andre repeated with emphasis upon himself . " But you put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something for nothing , " Madame Wu said . " Shall I not give money to your religion then  --  for good works ? " " No , religion is better without such gifts , " Brother Andre replied . He considered a moment and then went on , " It may be that from time to time there will be things which ought to be done in this your own city  --  such , perhaps , as a place for foundlings to be housed . I have taken some of these foundlings myself until I could find good parents for them . When there are such things to be done , I will come to you , Madame , and your help will be my reward . " " But these things in our own city are not for you , " she said . " Is there nothing I can do for you ? "  | " This is to do for me , Madame , " he replied . His voice tolled through the room , and she did not contradict it . Ying , who had withdrawninto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again when she saw them sitting there as they had been . " When shall we begin the lessons ? " Madame Wu asked . She felt unable to contradict this man . " Now , if you like , " he replied . " All times are alike to me . " " Will you come every evening ? " she asked . " My son goes to the national school by day . " " As often as I am wanted , " he replied . She rose then and summoned Ying . " Tell Fengmo to come here . " She stood on the threshold of the door , the garden on one hand , the library on the other . She had for a moment a strange sense of being between two worlds . She stepped into the court and left the priest sitting alone . She stood listening as if she expected him to call . But she heard nothing . On the encircling wall a nightingale alighted as it did every evening about this hour . Very slowly it sang four clear notes . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry she had invited this foreigner to come here . What strange things he might teach in foreign words ! She had been too quick . She walked to the door again and glanced in . Would he think it rude that she had left him alone ? But when she looked in she saw his great head sunk on his breast and his eyes closed . He was asleep ? No , his lips were moving . She drew back in a slight fear and was glad to see Fengmo approachingthrough the gate opposite where she stood . " Fengmo ! " she called . She turned her head and saw the man 's head lift , and the dark eyes opened and glowed . " Fengmo , come here ! " she called again . " I come , Mother , " Fengmo replied . He was there in an instant , very young and slight in comparison to the great priest . She was surprised to see how small he was , he who she had always thought was tall . She took his hand and led him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fengmo , " she said to Brother Andre . " Fengmo , " the priest repeated . In courtesy he should have said Third Young Lord , but he simply repeated his name , Fengmo . " I am Brother Andre , " he said . He sat down . " Sit down , Fengmo , " he said . " I am commanded to teach you a foreign language which your mother has said must be English . " " But only the language , " Madame Wu stipulated . Now that thep118lessons were to begin , she asked herself if indeed she had done wrong in giving the mind of her son to this man . For to teach a mind is to assume the power over it . " Only the language , " Brother Andre repeated . He caught the fear in Madame Wu 's words and answered it at once . " You need not be afraid , Madame . I am an honorable man . Your son 's mind will be sacred to me . " Madame Wu was confounded by this foreigner 's comprehension @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hairy a body . She had known no foreigner  --  except , of course , Little Sister Hsia , who was only a childish woman . She bowed slightly and went away into the garden again . An hour later the priest appeared at the door of the library . He was talking to Fengmo in unknown syllables . He pronounced them clearly and slowly , and Fengmo listened as though in all the world he heard nothing else . " Have you taught him so quickly ? " Madame Wu asked . She was sitting in her bamboo chair under the trees , her hands folded in her lap . " Madame , he does not understand them yet , " Brother Andre replied . " But I teach by speaking only the language to be learned . In a few days he will be using these words himself . " He turned to Fengmo . " Tomorrow , " he said and bowing to Madame Wu , he strode through the gate with his long , unhurried steps . With the passing of this huge priest everything took its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son ? " Madame Wu said . But Fengmo seemed still dazed . " He taught me a great deal in this one hour . " " Speak for me the words he taught you , " she urged him . Fengmo opened his lips and repeated some sounds . " What do they mean ? " she asked . Fengmo shook his head and continued to look dazed . " I do not know  --  he did not tell me . " " Tomorrow he must tell you , " she said with some sternness . " I will not have words said in this house which none of us can understand . " . All through the great house the word went on wings of the big foreign priest , and Mr. Wu heard them , too . It was about midafternoonof the next day when Madame Wu saw him coming towardp119her . She was matching some silks for the sewing woman , who was about to embroider new shoes for the children . " Send this woman away , " Mr. Wu said when he came near . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the silks togetherand said to the woman , " Come back in an hour or two . " The woman went away , and Mr. Wu sat down and took out his pipe and lit it . " I have heard that you have engaged a foreign tutor for Fengmo without telling me a word about it , " he said . " I should have told you , indeed , " Madame Wu said gently . " It was a fault in me . But somehow I did not think you could want to be disturbed , and yet I felt it necessary that Fengmo have his eyes turned toward Linyi . " " Why ? " Mr. Wu inquired . She had long since learned that nothing is so useful at all times for a woman as the truth toward a man . She had not deceived Mr. Wu at any time , and she did not do so now . " Fengmo happened to see Ch'iuming the other day while she was here , " she said . " I do not think anything lit between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a thing might happen with any woman young and pretty . Therefore I have fanned the flame from another direction . It would be awkward to have trouble in the house . " Mr. Wu was as usual confounded by the truth , and she saw his telltale sweat begin to dampen the roots of his hair . " I wish you would not imagine such things so easily , " he said . " You are always pairing men off to women . You have a low opinion of all men . I feel it . I feel you have made even me into an old goat . " " If I have made you feel so , then I am a clumsy person , and I ought to beg your pardon , " she said in her silvery voice . She sat with an ineffable grace that made her as remote from him as though she were not in the room . She perfectly understood this . Long ago she had learned that to seem to yield is always stronger than to show resistance , and to acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she saw he was still hurt , and secretly she did feel humiliated that she had indeed been so clumsy as to hurt him . " I wish you could see the way you look today , " she said with her charming smile . " It seems to me I never saw you so handsome . You look ten years younger than you did a few days ago . " He flushed and broke into a laugh . " Do I , truthfully ? " he asked . He caught the tenderness in her eyes and leaned toward her acrossp120the table between them . " Ailien , there is still nobody like you , " he exclaimed . " All women are tasteless after you . What I have done has been only because you insisted . " " I know that , " she said , " and I thank you for it . All our life togetheryou have only done what I wished . And now when I asked so much of you , you have done that too . " His eyes watered with feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . He put his hand into his pocket and brought out a handful of tissue paper which he unwrapped . Inside were two hair ornaments , made in the shape of butterflies and flowers of jade and seed pearls and gold . " I saw these yesterday , and they made me think of you . But I am always thinking of you . " He wiped his bedewed forehead . " Even in the night , " he muttered , not looking at her . She was very grave at this . " You must not think of me in the night , " she said . " It is not fair to Ch'iuming . After all , her life is now entirely in you . " He continued to look unhappy . " Is she not pleasant to you ? " she asked in her pretty voice . " Oh , she is pleasant , " he said grudgingly . " But you  --  you are so far away from me these days . Are we to spend the rest of our lives as separately as this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life  --  " His full underlip trembled . Madame Wu was so moved that she rose involuntarily and went over to him . He seized her in his arms and pressed his face against her body . Something trembled inside her , and she grew alarmed , not of him but of herself . Was this moment 's weakness to defeat all that she had clone ? " You , " he murmured , " pearls and jade  --  sandalwood and incense  --  " She drew herself very gently from his clasp until only her hands were in his . " You will be happier than you have ever been , " she promised him . " Will you come back to me ? " he demanded . " In new ways , " she promised . The moment was over , now that she could see his face . The lips with their lines of slight petulance were loosened . At the sight of them she felt her body turn to a shaft of cool marble . She withdrew even her hands . " As for Fengmo , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tutor , it seems Linyi wants him to speak English . She says he is too old-fashioned otherwise . He will be ready to marry Linyi in a month . See if he is not ! "  | " You plotter , " Mr. Wu said , laughing . " You planner and plotter of men 's lives ! " He was restored to good humor again and he rose and , laughing and shaking his head , he went away . A few minutes later when Ying came in she found Madame Wu in one of her silences . When she saw Ying she lifted her head . " Ying , " she said , " take some of my own scented soap and tell Ch'iuming to use no other . " Ying stood still , shocked . " Do not look at me like that , " Madame Wu said . " There is still more you must do . Take her one of my sandalwood combs for her hair , and put my sandalwood dust among her undergarments . " " Whatever you say , Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment that Madame Wu saw Mr. Wu 's pipe . He had put it on a side table as he went out . She perceived instantly that he had left it on purpose as a sign that he would return . It was an old signal between man and woman , this leaving of a man 's pipe . She pointed toward it as Ying turned and her pretty voice was sharp . " Ying ! " she called . " He forgot his pipe . Take it back to him . " Ying turned without a word and picked up the pipe and took it away . When Madame Wu had finished matching the silks , it was too ( lark to see the colors . She was about to have the candles lit when Fengmo came in from the twilight . He had taken off his school uniform and put on a long gown of cream silk brocaded in a pattern of the same color . His short hair he had brushed back from his square forehead . Madame Wu when she had greeted him praised him for his looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . She studied his brow as she spoke . It was a handsome brow , but one could not tell from it what was the quality of the brain it hid . Fengmo was only beginning to come into his manhood . " Can you remember the words you learned last night ? " she asked him , smiling . He had lit a foreign cigarette , of which he and Tsemo smoked many . The curl of rising smoke seemed somehow to suit him . He did not sit down but walked restlessly about the library , and he stopped and repeated the foreign words clearly . " Can you understand them yet ? " she asked  |p122He  shook his head . " No , but tonight I shall ask him what they mean , " he replied . He paused to listen . " He comes now , " he exclaimed . They heard the long powerful footsteps of leather shoes upon stones . Then they saw Brother Andre at the door , escorted by the gateman , who fell back when he saw Madame Wu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in common greeting . " I eat in the middle of the day only , " Brother Andre said . He was smiling in a pleasant , almost shy fashion . Again as he stood there Madame Wu felt the whole room , Fengmo , even herself , shrink small in the presence of this huge man . But he seemed unconscious of his own size or of himself . " Fengmo was repeating the foreign words you taught him last night , hut we do not know what they mean , " Madame Wu said as they sat clown . " I gave you words once spoken by a man of England , " Brother Andre said . " That is , he was born in England , and he lived and died there . But his soul wandered everywhere . " He paused as though he were thinking , then he translated the words in a sort of chant . " And not by eastern windows onlyWhen daylight comes , comes in the light . In front the sun climbs slow , how slowly ! But westward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Wu and Fengmo listened , drinking in each word as though it were pure water . " This is not religion ? " Madame Wu asked doubtfully . " It is poetry , " Fengmo said . " I teach you the first English words that were taught me , " Brother Andre said , smiling at him . " And I did not understand them either at first , when I was a little boy in Italy . " " So this same sun lights the whole world , " Madame Wu said musingly . She laughed . " You will smile at me , Brother Andre , but though I know better , my feeling has always been that the sun has belonged only to us . " " The sun belongs to us all , " Brother Andre said , " and we reflect its light , one to another , east and west , rising and setting . " The four walls of the room seemed to fade ; the walls of the courts where she had spent her whole life receded . She had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peoples under the same Heaven , and in the seven seas the same tides rose and fell . She longed to stay and hear the next lesson which Brother Andre would give , but she knew that Fengmo would not feel at ease if she stayed . She rose . " Teach my son , " she said , and went away . " How does Linyi feel now that Fengmo is learning English ? " Madame Wu asked Madame Kang . Her friend had come to see her late one evening , after the day 's turmoil was past . Here was a symbol of the friendship between the two women , that a few times a year Madame Wu went to Madame Kang , but twice and thrice in seven days Madame Kang came to Madame Wu . To both this appeared only natural . " I am surprised at my child , " Madame Kang replied . " She says she will marry Fengmo if she likes him after she has talked with him several times , and after he has learned enough English to speak it . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember when I was a young girl , I yielded to a mischievous maidservant who enticedme one New Year 's Day when Mr. Kang came with his father to call at our house . I peeped through a latticed window and saw him . I was married and our first son horn before I dared to tell him . And all that time the shame of it weighed on me like a sin . " Madame Wu laughed her little ripple of mirth . " Doubtless the damage was done , too , by that one look . " " I loved him all in one moment , " Madame Kang said without any shame now . " Ah , those moments , " Madame Wu went on . " You see why it is wise to be ready for them . The hearts of the young are like fires ready to burn . Kindling and fuel are ready . Yet how can we arrange a meeting between our two , or several meetings ? " The two friends were sitting in the cool of the evening . On a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The yellow heart , dotted with glistening black seeds , was dewy and sweet . Madame Wu motioned to the portion at her friend 's side . " Eat a little melon , " she said gently . " It will refresh you . You look tired tonight . " Madame Kang 's plump face was embarrassed as she heard these kindly words . She took out a flowered silk handkerchief from her bosom and covered her face with it and began to sob behind it , not hiding her weeping , since they were alone.  | " Now , Meichen , " Madame Wu said in much astonishment , " tell me why you weep . " She put out her hand and pulled the handkerchief from her friend 's face . Madame Kang was now laughing and crying together . " I am so ashamed , " she faltered , " I can not tell you , Ailien . You must guess for yourself . " " You are not  --  " Madame Wu said severely . " Yes , I am , " Madame Kang said . Her little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . " You , at your age , and already with so many children ! " Madame Wu exclaimed . " I am one of those women who conceive when my man puts even his shoes by my bed , " Madame Kang said . Madame Wu could not reply . She was too kind to tell her friend what she thought or to blame her for not following her own example . " The strange thing , " Madame Kang said , twisting and folding the big handkerchief now spotted with tears , " is that I do not mind any of them so much as Linyi . Linyi is so critical of me . She is always telling me I am too fat , and that I should comb my hair differently , and that it is shameful I can not read , and that the house is dirty , and that there are too many children . If Linyi stays with me and I have to tell her  --  " " Linyi must come here quickly , " Madame Wu said . In her heart she asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stubborn , willful young girl who judged her own mother . " You can teach her , " Madame Kang said wistfully . " I think she is afraid of you . But she fears neither her father nor me . " She laughed suddenly through her tears at the thought of her husband . " Poor man , " she said , and wiped her eyes . " When I told him this morning he pulled his hair out in two handfuls and said , I ought to go and set up a business alone in another city : " Madame Wu did not answer this , and as though her friend found her silence cool she looked at her and said , half shrewdly , half sadly , " Perhaps you are lucky , Ailien , because you do not love your hus-band . " Madame Wu was pierced to the heart by these words . She was not accustomed to sharpness from this old friend . " Perhaps the difference is not in love , but in self-control , " she replied . She picked up a slice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , " perhaps only it is thatp125I have never liked to be laughed at . You , after all , are stronger than I am , Meichen . " " Do n't quarrel with me , " Madame Kang pleaded . She put out her plump hand , and it fell hot upon Madame Wu 's cool narrow one . " We have the same trouble , Ailien . All women have it , I think . You solve it one way , I another . " " But is yours solution ? " Madame Wu asked . She felt her true and steady love for her friend soften her heart as she spoke , and she wound her slender fingers around the thick kind hand she held . " I could not bear  --  to do what you have done , " Madame Kang replied . " Perhaps you are wise , but I can not be wise if it means somebodybetween  --  my old man and me . " Who could have thought that at that moment Madame Wu 's heart would be wrenched by an inexplicable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hands clasped , that she was terrified . She stood on top of a peak , surrounded by ice and cold , lost and solitary . She wanted to cry out , but her voice would not come from her throat . Twilight hid her . Madame Kang could not see the whiteness of her face and , engrossed as she was , she slid not see the rigidity of Madame Wu 's body through her tightening fright . In the midst of this strange terror , Madame Wu saw Brother Andre . The priest 's huge straight figure appeared upon her loneliness , and it was dispelled in the necessity of speaking to him . " Brother Andre , " she said gratefully , " come in . I will send for my son . " She loosed her hold on Madame Kang 's fingers as she spoke and rose . " Meichen , this is Fengmo 's teacher , " she said . " Brother Andre , this is my friend , who is a sister to me . " Brother Andre bowed without looking at Madame Kang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the library . There in the light of a candle they saw him sit down and take a book from his bosom and begin reading . " What a giant ! " Madame Kang exclaimed in a whisper . " Do you not fear him ? " " A good giant , " Madame Wu replied . " Come , in a moment Fengmo will be here . We should not seem to be speaking of him . Shall we go inside ? " " I must go home , " Madame Kang replied . " But before I go , shall Linyi speak with Fengmo or not ? " " I will ask him , " Madame Wu said , " and if he wishes it , I willp126bring him to your house first , and then one day you can come here and bring her . Twice should be enough for them to know their minds . " " You are always right , " Madame Kang said and , pressing her friend 's hands , she went away . Madame Wu delayed Fengmo that night after his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books . Madame Wu had walked past the door , unseen in the darkness , and had looked in . Something in Fengmo 's attentive look , something in Brother Andre 's deep gravity , frightened her . Was this priest witching the soul out of the boy by the very power of his own large being ? She sat down suddenly faint on one of the bamboo seats and was glad of the darkness . " Flow one tries , " she thought , " and how one fails ! How could I imagine when I invited a priest to come and teach my son that this priest would be so full of his god that he glows and shines and draws all to him ? " She knew that Fengmo 's soul was at that moment of awakening when , if a woman did not witch it , a god might . She did not want him to be a priest , and this for many reasons ; but most of all because a priest 's body is barren , and Heaven is against barrenness When a god steals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and twists the soul and wrecks it and mars it . Body and soul arc partners , and neither must desert the other . If twenty-five years from now , having begat sons and daughters , Fengmo should wish to turn priest , as many men living in temples had done , then let him serve his soul when his body had been served . But not now ! Should she enter and break the spell she saw being woven ? She hesitated on the threshold , still unseen . Then she withdrew . She , the mother and only the mother , was not strong enough to withstand this great priest . To show himself independent of her , if for no other reason , Fengmo would turn against her . No , she must have a young woman , a gay girl , a lovely piece of flesh and blood , to help her . Linyi must come quickly . When the lesson hour had passed , she called out from the darkness , " Brother Andre , my thanks for teaching my son so well . Until tomorrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these greetings . Both men stopped as though shocked by her presence . Brother Andre bowed and went swiftly away , his long robes flying shadows behind him . But Madamep127Wu put her hand into Fengmo 's elbow , and when he was about to follow she clung tightly to him . " My son , " she said , " stay with me a little while . I have a very strange thing to tell you . " She felt refusal stiffen in Fengmo 's arm , and she lifted her hand . " Dear son , I am sometimes quite lonely . Tonight is one of those times . Will you stay with me a little while ? " What son could refuse that voice ? She had her hand on his arm again , pulling gently . " Come and sit down in this cool darkness , " she said . " Will you let me speak and answer me nothing until I have finished ? " " If you wish , Mother , " Fengmo said . But she could feel him wanting to leave her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could read those signs ! " Fengmo , " she said , and her voice was music coming out of the darkness . He could not see her . There was only the lovely voice pouring into his hearing . " I do not know how to tell you , " she said . He heard a soft half-embarrassed laugh . " You are so grown now  --  t man . I suppose I must expect  --  Well , certainly I must not be selfish . Linyi wants to talk with you . Such a thing I would have said was Impossible when Liangmo was your age . I do not think Meng would have thought of asking it . But Linyi is very different from Meng , and you are very different from Liangmo . " The pretty voice poured all this into the night . It was difficult to believe that this was his mother 's voice , so young , so shy , half laughing , broken with pauses . " How do you know ? " he asked brusquely . " Today her mother told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her chair , her face tilted up to the black soft sky , weighed and measured every tone of Fengmo 's voice . She felt an excitement , as though she were pitting herself against a force stronger perhaps than her own . But she would win . She had Fengmo by the body , and body is stronger than soul in a man . " It is perhaps very wrong of me , " she said half plaintively now to Fengmo 's silence . " My first feeling is to say that if Linyi is so bold  --  I do not want her in the house . " These were the right words . Fengmo answered hotly out of the darkness . He leaned toward her . She could feel his fresh young breath against her face . " Mother , you do n't understand ! "  | " No ? " She felt secure again at these familiar words of the young . So all sons say to all mothers . " Many young men and women meet together these days , " Fengmo declared . " It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even when Liangmo was married . " " Perhaps you are right , " she sighed . " I want you to be happy  --  that is all . I do not want you to see Linyi if you would rather not . I can tell her mother it is not convenient . Then she will know you care nothing for Linyi . " " Of course I will sec her , " Fengmo said in a lordly way . " Why should I object ? " " Fengmo , " she said in the same pleading voice , " do not lead Linyi to imagine things . There are many young women who would like to come into our house . Now that I think of Linyi , I remember that I have always thought she was a little cross-eyed . " " If she is I will see it clearly , " Fengmo declared . " Then shall I tell her mother that in a few days you and I will  --  " " Why you , Mother ? " he asked very clearly . " Fengmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yield too far . How can you see the girl alone ? " " Certainly I shall see her alone , " Fengmo said with some anger . " Ivlust I be led by my mother like a small child ? " " What if I say you shall not go at all ? " Madame Wu asked with vigor . " Mother , do not say it , " Fengmo said with equal vigor . " I do not want to disobey you . " Silence now fell between them . Madame Wu rose from her chair . " You insist , then , on going to see Linyi ! " " I will go , " Fengmo said doggedly . " Go , then , " Madame Wu said and swept past him and into her own room . There she found Ying waiting for her . Ying had heard the loud voices . " Lady , what  --  " she began . But Madame Wu put up her hand . " Wait ! " she whispered , " listen ! " They stood listening , Ying 's mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face was lit with laughter . They heard Fengmo 's harsh and angry footsteps stride from the court . Madame Wu hugged herself and laughed aloud . " Lady , " Ying began again , " what is the matter ? " " Oh , nothing , " Madame Wu said gaily . " I wanted him to do something , and he is going to do it  --  that is all ! "  |p129Fengmo  did not come near her the next day , but the morning after Madame Kang came again . The two friends clasped hands quickly . " Fengmo and Linyi have met , " she said . " How was the meeting ? " Madame Wu asked smiling . " I laughed and wept , " Madame Kang replied , smiling back . " I sat far off , pretending not to be there . They wanted me gone and could not speak for wanting me gone . They were speechless , miserable together , and yet they could not keep from gazing at each other . I went away for only a few minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had been . Neither had moved . They were only staring into each other 's faces . Then he rose and went away , and they said to each other , Until we meet again . ' " " Only those common words ? " Madame Wu asked . " But how they said them ! " Madame Kang replied . " Ailien , you will laugh , but it made me go and find my old man just to sit near him . " " He thought you a simpleton , doubtless , " Madame Wu said , still smiling . " Oh , yes , " Madame Kang said laughing , " and I did n't tell him anything , for I did n't want to stir him up again ! " " What damage could it do now ? " Madame Wu asked mischievously . " Ah , Ailien , do n't laugh ! " Madame Kang said sighing . " When I saw those two young things  --  so much happiness  --  such troubles ahead  --  one dares not tell the truth to the young ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wu said . " The sooner the better , " Madame Kang agreed . " It is wrong to light the fire under an empty pot . " Fengmo did not come near his mother that day nor any day . She did not see him until Brother Andre came again at night . She passed and repassed the door . Fengmo was asking him new words . He wanted to write a letter . She looked at Brother Andre 's face . It was kind and patient but bewildered . He spelled the words out for Fengmo over and over again and wrote them down . Madame Wu heard the letters without comprehending them , strange sounds without meaning . But whether she understood them did not matter . Fengmo understood , and Linyi would understand . He was eager to write her a letter in English . Madame Wu laughed silently in the darkness . Then she felt shamed before Brother Andre for the ease of her victory . She went away and did not see him that night . Instead she went early to bed and to sleep. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninth month , Linyi came to the house , a bride . The season was a good one for marriages , for the harvest was ready to be cut and the rice washeavy in the ear . Summer had paused and autumn had not yet begun . The two families came together in mutual joy for this second union between them . Liangmo and Meng were especially full of joy . Meng 's little body was swelling with her child . She was hungry day and night , and her sickness had left her . She looked beautiful and ripe with happiness as she welcomed her sister . The two mothers talking together had decided to follow the childen 's wishes , and they did not have the old-fashioned long wedding which they had given to Liangmo and Meng . Three days ' feasting was too long for these impatient two , Fengmo and Linyi . They wanted the swift marriage of the new times , a promise made before the elders and that was enough . So it was done , and Madame Wu made amends to the townspeople , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hiring a restaurant for three days . This saved the trouble of crowds passing through the house . " There are some good things about these new ways , " Madame Kang said at the end of the marriage day . Again the men were in Mr. Wu 's court and the women in Madame Wu 's . Sweetmeats of the most delicate kinds were served to the women and heartier meats to the men . Fengmo and Linyi had withdrawn to their own court . Luckily an old cousin had died about a month before and left two rooms empty , and by Madame Wu 's command these had been repairedand painted . " Certainly we do not have broken furniture and filthy floors as we , did after Liangmo 's marriage , " Madame Wu agreed . She felt happy tonight , as she always did when some member of the household was settled . Her freedom grew yet more complete . For g , week Fengmo by his own will had taken no lessons and Brother Andre had not come . Madame Wu did not object . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fear Brother Andre 's power now . Whether he came any more or not was nothing to her . She had saved Fengmo for the family.  |p131The  court was lit with red-paper lanterns , and these drew the moths out of the darkness . Many of them were only small gray creatures , dusty wisps . But now and again a great moth would flutter forth with pale green-tailed wings , or wings of black and gold . Then all the women cried out , and none could rest until it was imprisoned and impaled upon the door by a pin where all could exclaim at its beauty while they sat in comfort and ate their sweetmeats . Old Lady especiallyenjoyed this sport and clapped her hands with pleasure . One such moth had just been caught when Ch'iuming came into the court . Madame Wu saw her instantly , as she always did whenevershe entered , and as always she made no sign . The young woman had taken her place in the house day by day , in grave silence . None spoke of her , either good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame Wu was conscious of her always . Sometimes at night when he woke , she wondered  --  and put the wonder away . Now as Ch'iuming came in she saw her . The girl looked thin and a little too pale , but prettier in her delicacy . " I must inquire how she is , " Madame Wu thought in unwilling self-reproach . " After the wedding is over , I will send for her . " Again , as always she did , she put Ch'iuming aside and out of mind , and Ch'iuming made herself quietly busy pouring hot tea for the guests . She had taken part in the day but half-hidden and quietly busy about the food or the children or some such thing . Now and again some would call to her , " Second Lady , rest yourself ! " But Ch'iuming replied always with the same words , " I do only this one thing more . " Now , as they were all looking at the new moth , she , too , went to look at it . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lemon called Buddha 's Hand , and it had long black antennae . These quivered as it felt itself impaled . The wide wings fluttered and dark spots upon them showed green and gold for a moment . Then the moth was still . " How quickly they die ! " Ch'iuming said suddenly . They all turned at the sound of her voice , and as though she had surprised herself by speaking , she shrank back , smiling her halfpainful , half-shy smile . She stood waiting until all were seated again . Then in silence she slipped behind the others and , coming to Madame Wu , she felt of her tea bowl . " Your tea is cold , " she said . " I will warm it . " " Thank you , " Madame Wu said . She sat quite still while Ch'iu/ming leaned to perform the task . And as the girl leaned she smelled the fragrance of sandalwood , and as she smelled it she looked into the girl 's face . A look of humility was there . " May I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asked in a low voice . " Assuredly you may , " Madame Wu replied . She did not know how to answer otherwise , for how could she refuse ? But she felt mirth go out of her . What new trouble cast its shadow on her ? She sipped her tea and was silent until the guests were gone . When they were gone , Ch'iuming waited alone , except for Ying . " Go away , " Madame Wu told Ying , " and come back a little later . " She ( lid not want to take Ch'ituning into the house . The air in the court was still and ctrl . The late purple orchids were blooming under the lanterns . Meng today had brought her the first seedpods of lotus . The white flesh inside the pods was scentless and the taste bland . She sat down after the guests were gone and took up one of the big soft pods . Ch'iuming stood half drooping , hesitating . " Please seat yourself , " Madame Wu said . " I have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will eat them . " But Ch'iuming said , " I will not eat , I thank you . " " I will eat then and listen , " Madame Wu replied . Her delicate hands tore the pod apart . These hands of Madame Wu 's always looked as though they had no strength in them . But they had strength . The pith inside the pod was tough fiber , yet it gave way beneath her fingers and she plucked out of it one of the many seeds it hid . With her small sharp teeth , which were as sound today as they had been when they grew , she peeled the green skin from the white flesh . " Let me peel them for you , " Ch'iuming begged . But Madame Wu felt a distaste for Ch'iuming 's hands against the meat she wanted in her own mouth . " Let me do this for myself , " she said , and as though Ch'iuming read something beyond the words , she did not offer again . And while Ch'iuming sat watching this tearing apart of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and while she heard Madame Wu 's teeth breaking the crisp meats , neither spoke . Then suddenly as though her hunger were assuaged , Madame Wu threw down the ruined seedpod upon the stones.  | " You are with child , " she said abruptly . She used the common words of the common woman . Ch'iuming looked up at her . " I have happiness in me , " she acknowledged . She used the words which women in a great house use when an heir is expected . Madame Wu did not correct herself nor did she correct Ch'iuming . She said in the same clear sharp voice , " You are very quick . " To this Ch'iuming replied nothing . She drooped her head and sat with her hands lying apart on her lap , the palms upward , the fingers listless . " I suppose he is pleased , " Madame Wu said in the same sharp way . Ch'iuming looked at her with her large honest gaze . " He does not know , " she said . " I have not told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was angry with Ch'iuming and amazed at her own anger . She had brought Ch'iuming into the house for a purpose and the girl had fulfilled it . Why should she feel angry with her ? But the anger lay coiled in her like a narrow green serpent , and it sprang up and its poison lay on her tongue . " Concubines , " she said , " usually hasten to tell the men . Why are you different from other women ? " Ch'iuming 's eyes filled with tears . By the light of the flowered lantern above her head Madame Wu could see the tears glisten . " I wanted to tell you , " Ch'iuming said in a low , half-broken voice . " I thought you would be pleased , but you are only angry . Now I would like to destroy myself . " These desperate words brought Madame Wu to her right mind . It was common enough for concubines in great houses to hang themselves or swallow their rings or eat raw opium , but this was always held a shame to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , to guard the house . " You speak foolishly , " she said . " Why should you destroy yourself when you have only done your duty ? " " I thought if you were glad , that I could then be glad , too , " the girl continued in the same heart-broken voice . " I thought I could warm my hands at your fire . But now , at what fire shall I warm myself ? " Madame Wu began to be frightened . She had taken it for a matter of course that Ch'iuming was a common girl , country-bred , who would welcome as a beast does the signs of its own fertility . The cow does not think of the sire , but of the calf . If ever she had thought atp134all of Ch'iuming 's own life , she had comforted herself because , she thought , Ch'iuming would be rewarded with a child and with a child would be satisfied . " What now ? " she asked . " Are you not glad for your own sake ? You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laugh at , a small thing of your own to tend . If it is a boy , you will rise in your place in the house . But I promise you that if it is a girl , you will suffer no reproaches from me . Male and female I have made welcome in my house . When my own daughter died before she could speak , I wept as though a son were gone . " The girl did not answer this . Instead she fixed her sad eyes on Madame Wu and listened . " You must not talk of destroying yourself , " Madame Wu went on briskly . " Go back now and climb into your bed . Tell him , if he comes , that you have good news . " She spoke coldly to bring the girl back to her senses , but in her own heart she felt the chill of the mountain peak coming down on her again . She longed to be alone and she rose . But Ch'iuming sprang forward and clutched the hem of her robe . " Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me sleep here as I did when I first came . And you  --  you tell him for me . Beg him  --  beg him to leave me alone ! " Now Madame Wu was truly afraid . " You are losing your mind , " she told Ch'iuming severely . " Remember who you are . You came to me without father and mother , a foundling , picked out of the street by a farmer 's wife . You were widowed without having been wed . Todayyou are second only to me in this family , the richest in the city , a house to which any family in the region longs to send its daughters . You are dressed in silk . Jade hangs in your ears and you wear gold rings . You may not return to my court . How could I explain it to the house ? Go back at once to that court where you belong , for which you were purchased . " Ch'iuming let go the hem of Madame Wu 's robe . She lifted herself to her feet and fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hardness cracked suddenly at the sight of her desperate face . " Go back , child , " she said in her usual kind voice . " Do not be afraid . Young women are sometimes afraid and unwilling with the first child , although I had not expected it of you , who are country bred . Fall asleep early and do not wake if he comes in . I know that if he finds you unwilling to wake he will let you sleep . He is goodp135enough , kind enough . Do I not know him ? Why fear him ? And I will do this for you  --  tomorrow I will tell him . That much I will do . " As though restored by this kindness , Ch'iuming whispered her thanks and slipped out of the court . Madame Wu put out the lanterns one by one until the court was dark . Wearily she went to her room , and Ying came and made her ready to sleep . She dared not ask her mistress anything when this lady wore the look on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cold . She drew the curtains about the silent figure and went into the noisy servants ' courts . There the men and women and children were still eating what remained of the wedding feast , and Ying loved her food . She filled her bowl with many meats and she went and sat on a doorstep and ate with pleasure , listening as she ate to all the chatter of servants in the great house . She was above them all except for Peng Er , who was servant to the master . Peng Er sat eating , too . His fat face was glistening with sweat . At his knee stood his youngest child , a small thing of some two or three years . Whenever he stopped for breath she opened her mouth and shrieked , and he held the bowl to her mouth and pushed food into it with his chopsticks . " Peng Er ! " a woman 's loud laughing voice shouted out of the dusk . " Does the master sleep in the Peony Court every night ? " " I take tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ying ! " The same loud mirthful voice shouted . " How is it in the Orchid Court ? " But Ying disdained to reply to this . She finished her bowl quickly and dipped cold water out of a jar , rinsed her mouth , and spat the water into the darkness whence the voice had come . Men and women and children scattered at the sign . They were all afraid of Ying . In this house she sat too near the throne . Madame Wu woke at dawn . She felt a load upon her , and under this load she struggled toward wakefulness . The night had not been a good one . She had slept and waked and slept again , never wholly forgetful . Living in the center of the house , there were such nightshen she felt the whole family as the heart feels the body . Now she remembered . It had been Fengmo 's wedding night . Any wedding night was an anxious one . Were the two mated ? Had the mating gone well or ill ? She would not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see them . Not until the matter took its own course and the day turned to the right hour could she know.  |p136She  sighed and then remembered the second weight . She had given a promise to Ch'iuming which she would like to have had back . Yet how could she take it back ? Doubtless the girl had clung to it as a hope throughout the night . Then , as though she had not trouble enough , Ying came in when she saw her mistress awake . " Old Lady is ill , " Ying told her . " She says she feels she has eaten a cockroach in the feast yesterday , and it is crawling around in her belly . She feels it big as a mouse , sitting on her liver , and scratching her heart with its paws . Of course it can be no cockroach . My man , whatever his faults , would never be so careless as that . " " Heaven , " Madame Wu murmured , " as if I had not enough withoutthis ! " But she was dutiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in a few minutes she went into the court next hers where Old Lady lay high on her pillows . She turned dim sockets of eyes toward her daughter-in-law . " Dos nething for me quickly . I am about to die , " she said in a weak voice . Madame Wu was frightened when she saw the state in which Old Lady was this morning . Yesterday she had been as lively as a mischievouschild , boasting because she had won at mah Jong and eating anything at hand . " Why was I not called earlier ? " she asked Old Lady 's maid . " It is only in the last hour that our Old Lady ha : , turned so green , " the woman said to excuse herself . " Has she vomited and drained ? " Madame Wu inquired . Old Lady piped up for herself , " I have vomited enough for three pregnancies , and all my bowels are in the nightpot . Fill me up again , daughter-in-law . I am all water inside  --  water and wind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I must be filled somehow , " Old Lady declared in a faint but valiant voice . Thus encouraged , Madame , Wu directed that thin rice soup be brought , and she herself grated fresh hot ginger root into it , and took up a spoon and fed the mixture to Old Lady . Old Lady was always touching when she was ill . Her withered old mouth was as innocent and helpless as a baby 's . Madame Wu looked into it with each spoonful . Not a tooth remained , and the gums were pink and clean . How many words had come from that pink tongue , now shrunk so small ! Old Lady had always had a violent temper , and when she was angry she had hurled curses on anyone she saw.  |p137That  tongue was her weapon . Old Gentleman had been afraid of it . But doubtless he had heard other words from her , too , and Mr. Wu , who had always been the core of Old Lady 's life , had learned childish rhymes and laughter out of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Lady sighed at last . " I need only to be kept filled . At my age the body has no staying power . Life now is like a fire of grass . It burns only when it is fed . " " Sleep a little , " Madame Wu said soothingly . Old Lady 's eyes opened very sharply at this . " Why do you keep telling me to sleep ? " she demanded . " I shall soon sleep forever . " Madame Wu was shocked to see tears well into Old Lady 's eyes and dim their sharpness . Old Lady was crying ! " Daughter , do you think there is any life after this one ? " she muttered . She put out a claw of a hand and clutched Madame Wu 's hand . The old claw was hot and full of fever . Madame Wu , who had risen , sat down again . Old Lady 11 her life long had been nothing but a lusty body . She had been a woman , happy enough , dismissing from herself anything she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great house , what had she lacked ? But since she had lived entirely in her flesh , now she was frightened when she saw the flesh wither . Where would she go when the body failed her ? " I hope there is a life beyond this one , " Madame Wu said carefully . She might ha-'e deceived Old Lady as one deceives a child , but she could not do it . Old Lady was not a child . She was an old woman , about to die . " Do you believe that I shall be born again in another body as the priests tell us in the temple ? " Old Lady demanded . Never had Old Lady talked of such things before . Madame Wu searched herself for honest answer . But who could penetrate the shades ahead ? " I can not tell , Mother , " she said at last . " But I believe that life is never lost . " She did not say more . She did not say what she believed , that those who had lived entirely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine Brother Andre alive with no body , but not Old Lady . Old Lady was already falling asleep in spite of all her will to stay awake . Her eyelids , wrinkled as an old bird 's , fell over her eyes , and she began to breathe deeply . Her bony hand fell out of Madame Wu 's soft one . Madame Wu went away , staying only to whisper to the servant , " She will recover this time . But try to keep rich foods out of her sight so that she will not crave them . "  | " Our Old Lady is willful , " the servant murmured to defend her self , " and I do not like to make her angry . " " Obey me , " Madame Wu said sternly . But as she approached Mr. Wu 's court , she was pleased with this one good thing out of evil , that Old Lady 's illness gave her a reason to come here beyond the real one . She had sent Ying ahead to announceher . When she came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to tell her that Mr. Wu had gone out on some business and had only just returned . lie sent word by Ying to beg her to sit down while he changed his outer garments . So to wait she went into the familiar court where she had spent so many years of her life . The transplanted peonies were growing there most heartily . The blooms were over , the petals dropped , but the leaves were dark and thick . In the pool someone had planted lotus roots , and the great coral flowers lay open on the surface of the water . In the center of each flower ripe stamens quivered , ready and covered with golden dust . Their fragrance drenched the air of the court , and Madame Wu took out her handkerchief and held it before her face . The scent was too heavy . She passed through the court into the main room . The furniture was as she had left it , but certain things had been added . There were too many potted trees . Some framed foreign pictures were on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . She was displeased to see dust swept under chairs and into corners . She rose and went to the heavy carved doors , set with lattices , and now wide open . She looked behind one of these doors . Mr. Wu came in , buttoning his gray silk jacket . " Is there some thing behind the door , Mother of my sons ? " he asked in his hearty voice . She looked at him and flushed faintly . " Dust , " she said . " I must speak to the steward . This whole room needs cleaning . " Mr. Wu looked about it as though he saw the room for the first time . " Perhaps it does , " he said . " It needs you , " he said , after anothermoment . But he said it gaily and with a sort of teasing laughter . She grew grave and did not answer . They seated themselves . She examined his face without seeming to do so . He looked well fed , and the curves of his mouth were cheerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had planned . Then why did she feel in herself a cruel desire to hurt him ? " Your mother is ill , " she said abruptly . " Have you been to see her ? "  |p139He  dropped his smile . " Alas , no , " he said . " I should have gone the first thing this morning , but what with one thing and another  --  " " She is very ill , " she repeated . " You do n't mean  --  " he said . " No , not this time , " she said . " But the end is not too far off . Her soul is beginning to wonder what is to come next , and she asked me if I believed in another life after this one . Such questions mean that the body is beginning to die and the soul is afraid . " " What did you tell her ? " he asked . His face turned suddenly solemn . " I said I hope , but how can I know ? " she answered . He was inexplicably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he cried . ' ' To an old soul how can you show your doubt ? " He unbuttoned his jacket at his full throat and took his fan out of his collar at the back of his neck and began to fan himself with energy . " What would you have said ? " she asked him . " I would have assured her , " he cried . " I would have told her that nothing but happiness waits for her at the Yellow Springs . I would have said  --  " " Perhaps you had better go and say it , " she said . When she was angry she never raised her voice . Instead she poured into it molten silver . Now it flowed and flamed . But he thrust out his underlip . " I will tell her indeed , " he re=torted . They sat in silence for a moment , each struggling for calm again , She sat perfectly still , her hands limp in her lap , her head drooping a little on her slender neck . He sat solidly motionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constantly . Each wondered at being angry with the other , and neither knew why it was . She was the first to speak . " I have another matter to mention . " Her voice was still silvery . " Speak on , " he said . She chose straight truth again . " Ch'iuming came to me last night and asked me to tell you that she is pregnant . " Again she used the common word . She did not lift her head nor look at him , but continued to sit , motionless and graceful . She heard the fan drop and brush against the silk of his garments . He was silent for so long that at last she looked up . He was staring at her , a clownish sheepish smile on his face , and his right hand was rubbing the crown of his head , rubbing round and round in a gesturep140she perfectly understood . It was a mixture of amusement , shame , and pleasure . When he met her eyes , he laughed aloud . " Poison me , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold into my wine . I am too shameless . But , Mother of my sons , I was only obedient to you  --  nothing else . " Against her will laughter came creeping up out of her belly . The corners of her mouth twitched , and her eyelids trembled . " Do n't pretendyou are not pleased , " she said . " You know you are proud of yourself . " " Alas  --  I am too potent , " he said . Their laughter joined as it had so many times before in their life together , and across the bridge of laughter they met again . In that laughter she perceived something . She did not love him ! Meichen had been right . She did not love him , had never loved him , and so how now could she hate him ? It was as though the last chain fell from her soul . Time and again she had picked up those chains and put them on . But now no more . There was no need . She was wholly free of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their laughter was over . " You must be kind to her . " " I am always kind to everybody , " he insisted . " Please , " she said , " be grave for a moment . It is her first child . Now do not plague her . Stay away from her for as long as she turns her face to the wall . " He wagged his head at her . " It may be that one concubine is not enough , " he teased , and put the tip of his tongue out to touch his upper lip . But he could not hurt her or harm her any more . She only smiled . " Now , " she said , " you can go to your mother . And better than talking about her soul , tell her that you are to have another son . " But Old Lady was not cheered even by the news which her son brought to her . Madame Wu had scarcely reached her own court , she having stopped along her way to play with children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old Lady is worse , " she cried . " Old Lady is frightened and iscalling for you , Mistress ! Our lord is there and he begs you to come . " Madame Wu turned herself instantly and hastened to Old Lady'sbedside . There Mr. Wu sat stroking his mother 's half-lifeless hand.  | " She has made a wrong turn ! " he exclaimed when he saw her . " My old mother has chosen a downward path ! " A flicker lighted Old Lady 's glazed eyes , but she could not speak . Instead she opened her mouth and puckered up her face as though she were about to weep . But neither sound nor tears came as she gazed piteously at her daughter-in-law . Madame Wu understood at once that Old Lady was now more afraid than ever . " Fetch some wine , " she murmured to Ying , who had followed her . " We must warm her  --  she must feel her body . Fetch the Canton wine . Heat it quickly . And send the gateman to call the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begging her for help , her face fixed in the piteous mask of weeping . " Ying will fetch some hot wine , " Madame Wu said in her sweet and soothing voice . " You will feel better and stronger . Do not be afraid , Mother : There is nothing to fear . Everything is as usual around you . The children are playing outdoors in the sunshine . The maids are sewing and tending the house . In the kitchens the cooks are making the evening meal . Life goes on as it has always gone , and as forever it will . Our forefathers built this house , and we have carried on its years , and our children will come after us . Life goes on eternally , Mother . " Her singing , soothing voice sounded full and rich through the silent room . Old Lady heard it , and slowly the lines of her face softened and changed and the mask of weeping faded . Her lips quivered again and she began to breathe . While the mask had been fixed on her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ying hurried in with the hot wine in a small jug with a long spout , and this spout Madame Wu held to Old Lady 's parted lips and she let the wine drip into Old Lady 's mouth . Once and twice and three times Old Lady swallowed . A faint pleasure came into her eyes . She swallowed again and muttered a few words . " I can feel  --  " Then a look of surprise and anger sprang out of her eyes . Even as she felt the hot wine in her belly , her willful heart stopped beating . She shuddered , the wine rushed up again and stained the quilt , and so Old Lady died . " Oh , my mother ! " Mr. Wu moaned , aghast . " Take the jug , " Madame Wu commanded Ying sharply . She leaned over and with the fine silk handkerchief she pulled from herp142sleeve she wiped Old Lady 's lips and she lifted Old Lady 's head with both her hands . But the head was limp , and she laid it down again on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . " Oh , my mother ! " Mr. Wu moaned again . He began to weep openly and aloud , and she let him weep . There were certain things which must be done quickly for the dead . In a creature such as Old Lady had been , the seven spirits of the flesh could not be expected to leave the body at once . Old Lady must be exorcised and confined , lest these spirits loosed out of the flesh do harm in the house . Priests must be called . In her innermost heart Madame Wu did not believe in those priests nor in their gods . She stood looking down while Mr. Wu continued to fondle his mother 's hand as he wept . She was surprised to find in herself the urgent wish to call Brother Andre here and give him the task of exorcising evil from the house . Yet this could scarcely satisfy the family . If even a year from now a child fell ill under this roof there would be blame because Old Lady 's fleshly spirits had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family , she must follow the old ways . She turned to Ying . " Call the priests , " she said . " Let the embalmerscome in their time . " " I will attend to everything , " Ying promised and went away . " Come , Father of my sons , " Madame Wu said . " Let us leave her for a little while . The maids will wash and dress her , and the priests are coming to exorcise her , and the embalmers will do their duty . You must come away . " He rose obediently , and they went out together . She walked along slowly by his side , and he continued to sob and to wipe his eyes with his sleeves . She sighed without weeping . It had been many years since she had wept , and now , it seemed , her eyes were dry . But when he heard her sigh he put out his hand and took hers , and thus hand in hand they walked to his court . There she sat down with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his mother , how she used to save him from his father 's punishment , and how when his father compelled him to study his mother would steal into his room and bring him wine and sweet cakes and nuts , and how on holidays she took him to theaters , and when he was ill she called in jugglers and showmen to amuse him at his bedside , and when he had the toothache she gave him a whiff from an opium pipe . " A good mother , " he now said , " always gay and making me gay . She taught me to enjoy my life . "  |p143To  all this , Madame Wu listened in silence , and she persuaded him to eat and drink and then drink a little more . She despised drunkenness , but there were times when wine had its use to dull the edge of sorrow . So he drank the fine hot wine she ordered , and as he drank his talk grew thicker and he said the same thing over and over again until at last his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet feet went into the room which had once been hers . She peered under the satin curtains of the bed . There , rolled against the inner wall , she saw the back of a dark head , the outline of a slender shoulder . " Ch'iuming , " she called softly . " Are you sleeping ? " Ch'iuming turned , and Madame Wu saw her eyes staring out of the shadows . " Ch'iuming , you need not sleep here tonight , " Madame Wu said. , " Our Old Lady is gone to the Yellow Springs , and he is drunk with wine and sorrow . Rise , child . " Ch'iuming came creeping out of the bed , silent , obedient . " Where shall I go ? " she asked humbly . Madame Wu hesitated . " I suppose you may go to my court , " she : said at last . " I myself shall not sleep tonight . I must watch over Old Lady . " " Oh , let me watch , too , " Ch'iuming whispered . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , and you ought not , for the sake of what is within you , stay awake all night , " Madame Wu replied . " Let me be with you , " Ch'iuming begged . Madame Wu could not refuse . " Well , then let it be , " she said . So when she had seen Mr. Wu helped into his bed and had herself drawn the curtains about him , Madame Wu moved to take her place in the house this night . Those who had been sitting in watch now went to bed , but the servants did not sleep , nor the elder cousins . Old Lady was washed and dressed , and Madame Wu stood by to see that all was done as it should be , and Ch'iuming stood near , silent : but ready to pick up this and hand her that . The girl had deft hands and quick eyes , and she read a wish before it was spoken . Yet MadameWu saw clearly enough that Ch'iuming felt no sorrow . For her this was no death . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not pretend to weep , as another might have done . " Her heart is not yet here in this house , " Madame Wu thought , , watching her . " But when the child comes , he will tie it here . "  |p144So  one generation now was fulfilled and passed from the house , and Madame Wu became the head within these compound walls as Mr. Wu was the head outside . Old Lady was not buried at once . When the geomancers were consulted they declared that a day in midautumn was the first fortunate day . Therefore , when the rites were finished and Old Lady slept within her sealed bed of cypress wood , the coffin was carried into the quiet family temple within the walls . No one , not even the children , felt that Old Lady was far away . Often in their play they ran to the temple and looked in . " Great-grandmother ! " they called softly . " Great-grandmother , do you hear us ? " Then they listened . Sometimes they heard nothing . But oftentimes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another that they did hear Old Lady answer them from her coffin . " What does she say ? " Madame Wu once asked a small girl , the daughter of a first cousin . The little child looked grave . " She says , Little children , go and play  --  be happy . ' But , Elder Mother , her voice sounds small and faraway . Is she content in the coffin ? " " Quite content , " Madame Wu assured her . " And now obey her  --  go and play  --  be happy , child . " After Old Lady was gone , for a time stillness seemed to come over the family . It was as though each generation , with her passing , knew itself further on in time and place . With her death life leaped ahead , and so all were nearer to the end . Mr. Wu when he had finished his first mourning and had taken off his garments of sackcloth was not quite what he had been . His full face looked older and more grave . Now sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they talked over the family of which they were the two heads . He worried himself because he fancied he had not been so good a son as he should have been . When they had discussed the crops and the evil taxes of overlords and government , and whether they should undertakean expense of one sort or another , and when they had talked over children and grandchildren , then Mr. Wu would fall into broodingabout his mother . " You were good to her always , " he said to Madame Wu . " But I forgot her much of the time . " Then to comfort him Madame Wu answered thus : " How can a man forget his mother ? She gave you breath , and when you breathep145it is to remember her . She gave you body , and when you eat and drink and sleep and however you use your body , it is to remember her . I do not ask of my sons that they come running always to me to cry , Ah , Mother , this , ' and Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they live and are healthy and when they marry and are happy and when they have sons . My life is complete in them . So is it with our Old Lady . She lives in you and in your sons . " " Do you think so ? " he said when he had listened , and he was always comforted so that he went away again and left her . She , left alone , pondered on many things . Now more than ever her life was divided into two  --  that part which was lived in the house and that part which was lived inside herself . Sometimes one prevailedand sometimes the other . When the household was at peace she lived happily alone . When there was trouble of some sort she went into it and mended it as she could . About the middle of that autumn she saw a little trouble begin in the house which she knew would swell big if she did not pinch it off , like an unruly gall bud on a young tree . Linyi and Fengmo began to quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she made her inspection of the house . For all her pert beauty , Linyi was slatternlyin her own court . At first Madame Wu had not wanted to speak of this , because Linyi was her friend 's daughter and she knew that Madame Fang , with her great family , could not keep to constant neatness and cleanliness . It could only be expected that her daughters also might be less careful than Madame Wu was herself . But Meng was Madame Kang 's daughter too , and rather than re proach Linyi , Madame Wu went to the elder sister to take counsel with her . She found Meng combing her long hair in the middle of the morning . It was a soft gray morning , and the house lay half asleep . MadameWu did not reproach Meng that she was only now combing her hair , but she thought that it would perhaps aid the elder sister if she knew the younger was reproached . Meng hastily caught her hair in her hand when she saw Madame Wu . " Is it you , Mother ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have not combed my hair ! I will twist it up . " " No , child , do it properly , " Madame Wu replied and sat down , and the maid went on combing Meng 's long soft black hair . Rulan and Linyi had short hair , but Meng kept her hair old-fashioned.  | " How many more days have you ? " Madame Wu asked . " Eleven , by the moon , " Meng answered . " I hope , Mother , that you will give me your counsel . You know I suffered very much with the first one . " " When I had my children , " the maid said cheerfully , " I had them in the field where I was helping my man to plow . " The maid was a woman from the Wu lands , and they had known her always . Even now in summer she went back to the land , and only when the harvests were reaped did she return to the house to serve for the winter . This she did because she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she loved the land and must go back to it once a year . " You will not suffer so much with the second one , " Madame Wu said to Meng . " But it can not be expected that women reared behind walls will bear their children so easily as those who live freely . " " Will Linyi bear her children better than I do ? " Meng asked innocently . " No , she will do no better , " the woman said . " She is too learned . " Madame Wu laughed . " That is scarcely true , good soul , " she said . " I have perhaps as much learning as Linyi , but my children came easily . But I have had much fortune in my life . " " Ah , you are one of the ones that Heaven marks , " the woman agreed . " Linyi says she wants no children , " Meng said suddenly . " Linyi says she wishes she had not married Fengmo . " Madame Wu looked up , startled . " Meng @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is true , Mother , " Meng said . She stamped her foot at the maid . " You pull my hair , dolt ! " she cried . " Blame your sister , who frightened me , " the woman replied . " I never heard of a woman who did not want a child , except a concubinewho was afraid her shape would be spoiled . But in this house even the concubine bears . " Madame Wu did not listen to this talk with servants . " Meng , I came here to speak of your sister 's being a slattern and to ask you what I should say to her , but what you tell me is more grave than dust under a table . I should have inquired earlier into the marriage . But I have been busy with Old Lady 's death affairs . Tell me how you know . " " Linyi told me herself , " Meng said . Neither of the two ladiesp147took thought of the woman servant . Indeed , what was there to be hidden ? Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see and heed , and servants had their place here , too . " Say what Linyi told you , " Madame Wu commanded . " She says she hates a big house like this one , " Meng said . " She says she wishes she had not married into it . She says Fengmo belongs to the family and not to her , and she belongs to the house against he s will , too , and not to him She wants to go out and set up a house alone . " Madame Wu could not comprehend what she heard . " Alone ? But how would they be fed ? " " She says Fengmo could work and earn a salary if only he knew more English . " " She wants him to know more English ? " " So that he could get some money for the two of them to live alone , " Meng replied . " But no one disturbs them here , " Madame Wu declared . She felt outraged that under her roof there should come out this spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family ways , " Meng said . " The feast days and the death days and the birthdays and the duties of daughters-in-law and the servants who take over the children and all such things . She says Fengmo thinks of the family before he thinks of her . " " So he should , " Madame Wu declared , " and so should she . Is she a prostitute that she does not belong to this house ? " Meng kept silent , seeing that Madame Wu did not like what she heard . The woman , too , knew that the matter was too deep for a servantto speak about . She finished her young mistress 's hair , put in two pearl ornaments , and cleaned the hair out of the comb and wound it around her finger and went outside and blew it off . Madame Wu and Meng were alone . " Have you such thoughts as these , too ? " Madame Wu asked severely of this round pretty creature . Meng laughed . " Mother , I am too lazy , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is kept clean and ordered without my two hands . And I am glad when a servant takes my child if he cries , and I am happy all day . But then I never went to school , and I do not care if I read books or not , and my son 's father tells me everything I ought to know , and what more do I want to know than what he wants me to know ? "  | " Liangmo is good to you ? " Madame Wu asked . Meng 's soft cheeks turned very pink . " He is good to me in everything , " she said . " There was never so good a man . Thank you , Mother . " " Is Fengmo not good to Linyi ? " Madame Wu asked . Meng hesitated . " Who can tell which is the hand that slaps first when two take up a quarrel ? " she asked . " But I think it is Rulan 's fault . She is always with Linyi . She and Linyi talk together about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other 's husband to her own . " Madame Wu remembered Rulan 's sobbing on that night now long past . " Is Rulan also discontented ? " she now asked . Meng shrugged her shoulders . " Linyi is my sister , " she replied , after hesitating for a second or two . " I have no talk with Rulan . " " You do not like Rulanl " Madame Wu exclaimed . It seemed to her that she was pursuing her way through a maze and sinking deeply into something which she had not suspected in her house . How monstrousit was for these to quarrel who should be the next after herself and Mr. Wu ! " I do not like Rulan , " Meng said without change or hint of hatred in her voice . " Must women always quarrel ? " Madame Wu said severely . Meng shrugged her shoulders again . " Not liking somebody is not to quarrel with them , " she said . " I do not like Rulan because she is always behaving as though she were right and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mother , and I wonder you have not , seen it . I have told Liangmo he should tell you , but he always says he does not want you to be troubled . But Old Lady knew  --  she used to slap Rulan . " " Slap Rulan ! " Madame Wu cried . " Why was I never told ? " " Tsemo would not let Rulan tell , " Meng said . She was now beginning to enjoy all this telling . " Rulan is too learned , " she went on . " She is more learned than Linyi , and so Linyi listens to her . She is always talking about things women should not know . " " What things ? " Madame Wu inquired . " Constitution and national reconstruction and unequal treaties and all those things , " Meng said . " You seem to know about them , " Madame Wu said with a hint of a smile . " Liangmo knows , but I do not , " Meng said.  | " Do you not want to know what Liangmo knows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many other things for us to talk about together , " Meng replied . " What things ? " Madame Wu asked again . But Meng did not answer this with words . Instead she dimpled her cheeks with a smile and looked away . And Madame Wu pressed her no more . She rose after a little while and went back to her court with this new knowledge in her of fresh turmoil in the house . But some sort of weariness fell upon her that day . She felt as one does who must run a race without food . These young , these men and women whose lives were dependent upon her , she was not strong enough for them . Her wisdom was too ancient for them  --  the wisdom of the unchanging human path from birth to death . She thought of Brother Andre . He had a wisdom that went far beyond these walls . She would call Fengmo and suggest to him that he begin again his studies . Then when Brother Andre came she could share with him the troubles of these young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fengmo to her , and he came at once , having nothing to do and happening at that moment to be at home . There was a look about him that Madame Wu did not like . Had he not been properly wed , she would have said he was dissolute . He looked sullen and dissatisfied and yet satiated and overfed . " Fengmo , my son , " she said in her pleasant voice , " I have been too busy all these days since your grandmother left us . I have not asked how things have gone with you . I have seen you and Linyi in your places in the family , but I have not considered you alone . Now , son , talk to your mother . " " There is nothing to talk about , Mother , " Fengmo said carelessly . " You and Linyi , " she said , coaxing him . " We are well enough , " he said . She looked at him in silence . He was a tall young man , spare in the waist , fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made but exceedingly strong . His face was square , his mouth full and easily sullen . She smiled . " How much you look as you did when you were a baby , " she said suddenly . " It is strange how little men change after they are born , while women change so much . Sometimes when I look at each of you , it seems to me that you are just as you were when you were first put into my arms ! "  | " Mother , why are we born ? " he asked . She had asked this question of herself often enough , but when her ' son asked it she was alarmed . " Is it not the duty of each generation to bring the next into being ? " she replied . " But why ? " he persisted . " Why should any of us exist ? " " Can we cease to be , now that we are made ? " she replied . " But if I exist only to bring forth another like myself , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what use is this to me ? " he went on . He did not look at her . His thin young hands were loosely clasped in front of him . " There is a me , " he said slowly , " that has nothing to do with you , Mother , and nothing to do with the child to come from me . " She was frightened . Such questions and such feelings she herself had , but she had not dreamed to find them in a son . " Alas , " she cried . " I have been a bad mother to you . Your father never had such thoughts . I have poured some poison into you . " " But I have always had these thoughts , " he said . " You never told me before , " she cried . " I thought they would pass from me , " he replied . " Yet I continue to think them . " She grew very grave . " I hope it does not mean that you and Linyi do not go well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do not know what Linyi wants . She is restless . " " You are with her too much , " she declared . " It is not well for husband and wife to be continually together . I see that she does not come and sit among the women as Meng does . She stays inside your court . Naturally she growns weary there , idle , restless  --  " " Perhaps , " he said , as if he did not care . She continued to look at him anxiously . " Fengmo , let us invite Brother Andre here again . While you were with him it seemed to me you were happy . " " I might not be now , " he replied listlessly . " Come , " she said firmly . She had learned long ago that listlessness must be met with firmness . " I will invite him . " He did not answer . " Fengmo , " she began again , " if you and Linyi wish to go out of this house , I will not forbid it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ask why you should only be a link in the chain of the generations . I have other sons . If you wish to go out , speak and tell me so . "  | " I do not know what I want , " he said again in the same listless 5ashion . " Do you hate Linyi ? " she asked . " This can only be you are entirelyunhappy . How long have you been married to her ? Only three little months . She is not pregnant and you are listless . What does this mean , Fengmo ? " " Mother , you can not measure us by such things , " he declared . But she was too shrewd . " By this alone I will not measure you , " she said , " but I know that if man and woman are not well mated in the body first , there is no other mating . If the body is mated , then other mating will come , or if it does not the two can still live as one . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build . Soul and mind , and whatever else , is the roof , the decoration , whatever one adds to a fine house . But all this fails without the foundation . " Fengmo looked at her . " How does it happen my father has a con-cubine ? " She would not accept this rudeness . " There is a time for everything , " she said severely , " and one time passes into another . " He knew that he had overstepped the boundaries of a son , and he rubbed his short-cut hair and passed his hands down over his cheeks . " Well , let Brother Andre come , " he said at last . He thought again awhile and then he said : " He will be my only teacher . I shall stop going to the national school . " " Let it be so , my son , " she said . IN THIS way Brother Andre came again into the house of Wu . He made no mention of the time since he had been here , nor of anything that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lesson and went away again . But when Brother Andre was passing through the court after the lesson , Madame Wu called to him gently . She was sitting in her accustomed place where she always sat in the evening until the autumn grew too cold . It was cold tonight , but because she was reluctant to let the summer escape her , she held fast to a night or two longer . Ying had complained against her for sitting outdoors , and now in the library a brazier of coals burned ready to cure the chill which Ying declared was ready to fall upon her.  | " Good Brother Andre , " Madame Wu called . Brother Andre 's tall figure stopped . He turned his head and saw her . " Did you call me , Madame ? " he asked . " Yes . " She rose as she spoke . " If you have some time , please spare it to me to talk for a little while about this third son of mine . I am not pleased with him . " Brother Andre @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Madame Wu told her , " and stay to mend the coals . " She remembered that Brother Andre was a priest , and she wished to spare him uneasiness at being alone with a woman . If he was uneasy , he did not show it . Ile sat down when she motionedhim to a chair and waited . His deep eyes were fixed on her face , but she knew that he did not think of her . The eyes might have been looking down out of heaven upon her . " Why is Fengmo unhappy ? " she asked him directly . " He is too idle , " Brother Andre replied simply . " Idle ? " Madame Wu repeated . " But he has his duties . Every New Year 's Day I assign duties to each son and to each daughter-in-law . This year my eldest son is responsible for the oversight , under me , of the lands . And Tsemo must look to the buying and selling , and Fengmo is learning about the grainshops where we market our grains in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is busy at this for several hours every day . " " Still he is idle , " Brother Andre said . " Fengmo has an unusual mind and a searching spirit . He learns quickly . You bade me teach him English . But with all he learns of the English , he takes in something more today . I found he had forgotten nothing . The knowledge I gave him months ago has rooted in him and has sent up tendrils like a vine , searching into the air for something upon which to climb and flower and fruit . Fengmo will always be idle , although you fill every hour of the day , until he has found the thing which uses his mind and his spirit . " Madame Wu listened to this . " You are trying to persuade me to let you teach him your religion , " she said shrewdly . " You do not know what my religion is , " Brother Andre answered . " I do know , " she said . " Little Sister Hsia has read me often out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your foreign ways of praying and all such things . " " My religion is not hers , nor hers mine , " this strange man replied  | " Explain me yours , " she commanded him . " I will not explain it , for I can not , " he said . " Little Sister Hsia can read you out of a book and speak to you a way of praying , but these are not my ways . I read many books , I have no set ways of prayer . " " Then where is your way of religion ? " she demanded . " In bread and in water , " he replied , " in sleeping and in walking , in cleaning my house and making my garden , in feeding the lost childrenI find and take under my roof , in coming to teach your son , in sitting by those who are ill , and in helping those who must die , that they may die in peace . " " I wish I had called you when our Old Lady died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish to call you . But I was afraid the family would still want the temple priests . " " I would not have kept your priests away , " Brother Andre said . " I never forbid anyone who can bring comfort anywhere . We all need comfort . " " Do you also ? " she asked curiously . " Certainly I also , " he said . " But you are so solitary , " she exclaimed . " You have no one of your blood . " " Everyone is of my blood , " Brother Andre said , " and there is no difference between one blood and another . " " Is your blood like mine ? " Madame Wu exclaimed . " There is no difference , " he replied . " All human blood is of the same stuff . " " Why are you only a priest ? " she asked . This she knew to be rude , and so she made haste to be pardoned . " You must forgive me . I am too curious . I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest . But I feel that you have committed no crime and that you need no sanctuary . " " Do not ask my pardon , " Brother Andre replied . " Indeed , I scarcely know how I became a priest , unless it is because I was first an astronomer . " " You know the stars ? " she asked in great surprise . " Madame , no one knows the stars , " he replied . " But I study their rise and fall , their coming and their going across the heavens . " " Do you still do this ? " she inquired . She was ashamed of her curiosityconcerning him , and yet she could not keep herself from it . " Madame , when my day 's work is done , unless the night is cloudy , I do so , " he replied . His manner was so frank , so calm , that it piquedp154her . He answered her questions because she put them and because he had nothing to hide , but also as if he had no concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said abruptly . " All day you work among the poor and at night among the stars . " " It is true , " he agreed calmly . " Have you never wanted a home and wife and children ? " she asked . " Madame , I once did love a woman , " he replied , " and we were to be married . Then I entered into loneliness , and I no longer loved her nor needed her . " " This was very unjust to her , I think , " Madame Wu said with dignity . " Yes , it was , " he agreed , " and I felt it so , but I could only tell her the truth . Then I became a priest in order to follow my loneliness . " " But your faitli ? " she inquired . He looked at her with his full dark gaze . " My faith ? It is in space and in emptiness , in sun and stars , clouds and wind . " " Is there no god there ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But I have not seen His face . " " Then how can you believe in Him ? " she asked . " He is also in that which is around me , " Brother Andre replied . His grave voice spoke the large , simple words . " He is in the air and the water , in life and death , in mankind . " " But your foundlings , " she urged . " If you love your loneliness and need no one , why have you taken these chance children ? " He looked down at his huge workworn hands . " These hands , too , must live and be happy , " he said , as though they were separate creaturesand did not belong to him . " The flesh , too , must be employed if it is to let the soul be free . " Madame Wu stared at him with ever-rising curiosity . " Are there other men like you ? " she asked . " No man is quite like any other one , " Brother Andre said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as though a light came on within him . " But your son , Madame , young Fengmo , I think he could become like me . Perhaps he will become like me . " " I forbid it ! " Madame Wu said imperiously . " Ah ! " Brother Andre said , and now he smiled . His lit , mysterious eyes glowed on her for an instant and then he said good-by . And she sat gazing up into the handful of stars above her court . Twice Ying came out to scold her.  | " Leave me , " Madame Wu told her . " I have things to think about . " " Can you not think in your bed instead of in this chill night air ? " Ying complained . When Madame Wu did not reply , she went and fetched a fur robe and wrapped it about her knees . Still Madame Wu did not move . She leaned back in her chair , gazing at the stars . The walls of the court cut a square out of heaven as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneath and above , her thoughts went deep and rose high . In the earth beneath this house human roots ran down  --  the unseen , the unknown roots of all who had lived here of the Wu family . Here they had been born and here they died . The foundations were unshaken . And yet even before them there had been others . Old Gentlemanhad told her what he had heard from his own father , who had been told it by his father , that when the Wu house was founded , the hands that dug the earth out had placed the stones not upon earth but upon rubble and cracked porcelains and potsherds and fragments of tile . " No house can reach to the bottom of our earth , " Old Gentlemanhad told her . " City upon city , our ancestors have built five cities one upon another . Man has built upon man , and others will build upon us . " In the thousands of years to come the Wu house would take its place to make the foundations for still other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She comprehended the loneliness of Brother Andre , and yet she understood why he was content in it . She trembled upon the edge of this loneliness herself as she gazed up at the stars . " Madame ! " Ying cried out from the house in despair . But Madame Wu did not hear her voice . Ying grew frightened at last . She tiptoed near and looked down into Madame Wu 's face . It was pure and cold and fixed . Her great dark eyes continued to gaze into the sky . In the dimness of the court , lit only by the shaft of candlelight from the library , her face looked almost translucent in its creamy whiteness . " Alas , her soul is fled ! " Ying murmured and then clapped her hands to her mouth . She backed away in terror at what she saw and tiptoed across the court . Madame Wu heard her dimly , without caring or knowing why Ying was afraid . She was free from these walls . They did not , as she had thought , reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stars . Instead , when she had surmounted them she saw the wholep156earth lying before her , the seven seas and the countries and for peoples of whom she had heard only in books , the two poles of the earth and their unmelting ice and snow , the tropics and their earthy life . " From the stars , " she thought , " doubtless all things are seen . " For the first time in her life she longed to rise out of these four walls and travel everywhere upon the earth to see everything and to know all . " But there would still be the stars , " she thought . " How can one reach the stars ? " She thought of Old Lady , now dissolved into free soul and coffinbounddust . But Old Lady 's soul was hovering about this house . " As soon as I am free , " Madame Wu thought , " I shall leave this house . I shall go straight up until I know what stuff the stars are . " Thus dreaming , Madame Wu forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now she did not see her come back with all three sons . Liangmo and Tsemo and Fengmo came together and stood gazing at their mother . Liangmo spoke first . " Mother ! " He made his voice gentle , for he feared that her soul had left her body , and when this happens the soul must be wooed and coaxed and not frightened , lest it never return . For the body is the cage and the soul is the bird , and once the door is left open and the bird goes forth free , why should it return to the cage ? It must be tempted and deceived . " Dear Mother , " Liangmo said gently , " your children are here your children wait for you  --  " But Madame Wu was in a trance . She heard no voice . Her sons looked at one another in terror . " Call our father , " Liangmo commanded Tsemo . Tsemo made haste to obey , and in a few minutes , while the others waited in silence lest the runaway soul escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind him , unnoticed , came Ch'iuming . " How did this come about ? " he demanded of Ying . " The foreign priest left her so , " Ying replied . They looked at one another in renewed fear . " Mother of my sons ! " Mr. Wu called gently . His large face was paper-colored . Madame Wu did not answer . " Ailien ! " he called . He did not dare to touch her . Her hands hung from her wrists like limp white flowers.  |p157But  Ch'iuming said not a word . She knelt at Madame Wu 's feet and slipped off the narrow satin shoes and the white silk stockings and began to chafe the bare feet . They were cold , and she put them against her bosom . " You will wake her too quickly , " Mr. Wu urged . " No , for she is not afraid of me , " Ch'iuming said . She knelt lookingup at them , father and sons , in this house where Heaven had thrust her . " She is afraid of no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not afraid of me because she does not care for me , " Ch'iumingsaid strangely and looked down on the narrow bare feet she held . At this moment Madame Wu brought down her eyes from the stars and saw her three sons . " You three ? " she said . " What do you want ? " Ch'iuming quickly put on her stockings and shoes again . Madame Wu seemed not to see her . But she saw Mr. Wu . " Why are you here ? " she asked in a cold and distant voice . All could see that her soul was unwilling to return to them . " Mother , I think Meng is about to bear her child , " Liangmo saidquickly . " Mother , " Tsemo called , " I wish you would teach Rulan how to make honey cakes . " " Mother , " Fengmo said in a low voice , " today I told you a lie . " One by one , they called her back . Mr. Wu took his turn . " Mother of my sons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it is time to allot the seed wheat for the land ? " So at last she returned . " You , " she murmured , " will you never be done with your troubles ? " " No , " Liangmo said , " never ! " She was fumbling with the robe about her knees , and now she rose and let it drop . She had come down from the stars and was here in the house again . She looked about her , dazed . " Where is Ying ? I am tired  --  I must sleep . Tomorrow  --  tomorrow . " The men fell back and let Ying lead her into her room . Only Chi'umingslipped off into the darkness . But the men stayed in Madame Wu 's sitting room in silence , looking at one another , listening until Ying came out and told them , " She is safe now  --  she has fallen asleep . " They went away then . " Can you explain this , Father ? " Liangmo asked Mr. Wu as they went out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before , has it ? "  | " I do not know what has come over her , " Mr. Wu grumbled . " Ever since her fortieth birthday she has been too strange . " But Fengmo shook his head . " Not one of you understands our mother as I do . I know how she feels . She feels that she has wings and has never been allowed to fly  --  that is how she feels . " His father and Liangmo and Tsemo only looked at him as though . he were out of his mind , and the next moment they bade one another a grave good night . Madame Wu woke the next morning with great dread of what had happened to her the night before . Nothing in her life had been as sweet as those moments of whole freedom when her soul had left her body behind . She knew that this freedom could become drink to the soul , a liquor which it could no more resist than a drunkard his wine . For while her soul had been wandering among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this great house had dropped from her . She had cast them off and left them behind her as surely as a nun escapes the travail of womanhood , as surely as a priest escapes the burden of manhood . She felt angry with Brother Andre this morning because he had tempted her to such freedom , and she was afraid of herself because she had yielded . When she woke guilt was as heavy on her as though she had given herself to a secret lover . She rose immediately and with severity to herself . She called Ying to account sharply for several small faults . She pointed to dust swept behind a big chair which was seldom moved and to a cobweb which hung from a polished beam . After her meal she took accounts with the cook and directed him concerning the foods for many days ahead . " Now that winter is not too far away , " she said , " it is time you ceased to give us melon soups and cucumbers and such cooling things . It is time to brown pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the vegetables . " He opened his little eyes widely at this . " Where have you been eating , Lady , that you have not seen that I have already begun to do these things ? After these years , do I need to be told of the seasons ? " He was surprised by Madame Wu 's sharpness since , being so excellenta cook , he had his place in the house sure , and he was impudent when he liked , which was often , for he had the hot temper of all good cooks . But Madame Wu did not lessen her sharpness . " Go away , " she said . " Do not tell me what you do and do not do . " She took no time for herself this day . No sooner was one gone than another came . She had not calmed herself from the cook when shep159saw Mr. Wu entering her court at a time earlier than he usually rose . " Come in , Father of my sons , " she said . " I have been taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He grows too loose in the tongue . " " But he is the only cook who makes crabs as I like them , " Mr. Wu said in alarm . " You know how I searched in seven and eight cities before I found him , and then I married him to your maid to secure him . " " Ying is impudent , too , " Madame Wu said . This was such unusual talk from her that Mr. Wu was more than a little disturbed . He sat down and drew out his pipe from his sleeve and filled it and lit it . " Now , Mother of my sons , " he said , " you do not feel well this morning . Your eyes are shadowy . " " I am well , " Madame Wu insisted . Mr. Wu took two puffs and put down his pipe . " Ailien , " he said in a low voice , first looking right and left to see that no one heard him , " you do very wrong to separate yourself from me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from each other . It is not only a matter of offspring . It is a matter of balance . Come , see yourself as you are . You are not toothless , your hair is still as black as it ever was , your flesh is firm , your blood quick . Have you forgotten how well we  --  " " Cease there , " she said firmly . " You know I am not a changeable woman . I have arranged my life . Have you discontent in you that you come here and speak to me so ? " " Indeed I would welcome you , " he said frankly , " for I love you better than any other and must until I die , but I am not thinking of myself . " " You need not think of me , " she insisted . " I must think of you , " he declared . For a moment he had the monstrous thought that perhaps she had by some strange twist of nature become attached , through the soul , to the foreign priest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . He knew her fastidiousnessin all matters . Aside from his priesthood the man was foreign . Even when Mr. Wu was young and impatient , he knew that it was better for him if he held his impatience and bathed himself and sweetened his breath and his body before he came near her . But foreigners were rank from the bone because of the coarseness of their flesh , the profuseness of their sweat , and the thickness of their woolly hair . He put his monstrous thought aside , lest with her magic instinct she divine it and accuse him . He had recourse , therefore , to the one thing which he knewp160would always command her attention . He put on peevishness and complained that he himself did not feel well . " Ah , you are right . I am old , too , " he sighed . " My belly rumbles , I wake up two and three times in the night . In the morning I am tired . " But she was still cruel . " Eat only a little broth for supper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gave up then and sat with his underlip thrust out , and she tapped her foot on the stone floor and sighed . Then she rose to pour tea for him . He saw her thin fingers tremble as she held the lid of the pot , but he said nothing . He drank tea , and she drank also from a bowl she poured for herself , and then he rose and went away . He had not reached the door when she called to him in that clear pure voice of hers which was as hard as silver , " You have forgotten your pipe yet again ! " He turned and his face was crimson . " Truly , I did forget it , " he said . But she stood there on the threshold and pointed at it as though it were a filthy thing , and he went back like a beaten boy and snatched it up , and then he strode past her , his lips pursed and his cheeks red . For a moment she stood looking after him , and in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blow had fallen there . But before she could heed it , who then should come in but Little Sister Hsia ? Of all mornings it seemed to Madame Wu that this was the last one on which this poor pale woman was welcome , but what could she do except to invite her to come in and sit down ? " I have not seen you for so long , " Little Sister Hsia said in her rapid broken way . Madame Wu had learned to understand her meaning without understanding the words , for Little Sister Hsia controlled neither breath nor tongue . The sounds tumbled out , dull where they should have been sharp and sharp where they should have been dull , and the rise and fall of her voice had nothing to do with the words . " Have you been ill , Little Sister ? " Madame Wu inquired . " No , " Little Sister replied , " but somehow  --  the last time  --  I felt perhaps I intruded . " " Can you intrude ? " Madame Wu murmured politely . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her innocence she accepted the politeness . " Today I have come for something so speciaL Dear Madame , Please , I have a plan and if you approve  --  " t . " What is this plan ? " she inquired  | " You know that priest ? " Little Sister inquired . " My son 's tutor , " Madame Vu murmured . " He has a foundling home , " Little Sister said . " I have long felt that a woman should have some oversight of the girls there . He has only an old servant . But they should be taught , Madame . Do you not think so ? I was wondering if you would ask him  --  that is , perhaps , I would like with your approval to offer my services as a teacher . " " Why do you not ask him yourself ? " Madame Wu inquired . " You must know , " Little Sister Hsia said earnestly . " His religion is not mine . " " How many religions have the foreigners ? " Madame Wu inquired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " There is only one true God , " Little Sister Hsia said solemnly . " Do you believe in this God ? " Madame Wu asked . Little Sister Hsia opened her pale blue eyes . She lifted her hand and brushed a lock of pale yellow hair from her cheek . " Why else do you think I left my home and my country to come to this strange land ? " " Is ours a strange land ? " Madame Wu asked in some surprise . " To me it is strange , " Little Sister Hsia said . " Did your God tell you to come ? " Madame Wu asked again . " He did , " Little Sister Hsia replied . " Did you hear His voice ? " Madame Wu asked . Little Sister Hsia blushed . She placed her long pale hands upon her breast . " I felt it  --  I heard it here , " she said . Madame Wu gazed at her . " But did your parents never try to betrothyou ? " she asked . Little Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countryparents do not arrange marriages . Men and women marry for love . " " Did you ever love ? " Madame Wu asked in her calm voice . Little Sister Hsia 's hands dropped into her gray cotton lap . " Of course , " she said simply . " But you did not wed ? " Madame Wu asked . " In my country , " Little Sister Hsia said painfully , " the man must ask the woman . " Now Madame Wu was silent . She could easily have asked the next question , but she was too kind to do so . She knew that no man had asked Little Sister Hsia to marry him.  |p162Little  Sister Hsia lifted her eyes again bravely , although they were misted . " God had other plans for me , " she said . Her voice was bright . Madame Wu smiled kindly at her and said , " Do I not know you well ! " She took up her tiny silver-bound pipe and lit it and smoked two puffs and put it down again . " Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not leave so important a matter as marriage to men and women or God . Marriage is like food and drink and shelter . It must be arranged for , or some will have too much and others will starve . In my house I plan meals for all , even for the servants . Each has the right to his share . Some foods , of course , are liked better than others . But if I left foods to their choice , the children would eat nothing but sweets . My son 's father would cat nothing but crabs and fats . Some of the servants are greedy and would cat too much and leave nothing to the more timid ones , who would hunger . To each servant I allot a certain quantity , to each member of the family I allot a certain quality . Thus all are fed under my care . " Little Sister Hsia 's fingers were knotting themselves . " I do not know how we came to talk about all this , " she said . " I came here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , now . " " You have forgotten because it was not what was really in your mind , " Madame Wu said kindly . " I will answer you . No , Little Sister Hsia , you must leave Brother Andre alone . I assure you he is like a great high rock , hard because it is high . You must not beat yourself against that cliff . You will be wounded , your flesh will be torn , your heart will bleed , and your brains will be spilled like curds , but he will not know it . Occupy yourself with your own God  --  I advise it . " Little Sister Hsia was now pale to the lips . " I do n't know what you mean , " she stammered . " Sometimes I think you are a very wicked woman . You think thoughts  --  you put thoughts into me  --  I do n't have such thoughts  --  " " Do not be ashamed of your thoughts , " Madame Wu said kindly . " They are good thoughts , for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do not ' want to be lonely . But you must be lonely . It is your doom . Life has not provided for you . Yours is the strange cruel country . Not even your parents provided for you when life did not . Little Sister Hsia , I would myself arrange a marriage for you were it possible . But there is no man of your kind here . " Little Sister Hsia listened to her . Now her mouth opened and shut , she gasped , and suddenly she burst into tears of anger . " You arep163hateful ! " she cried to Madame Wu . " You  --  you  --  I 'm not like that  --  you 're all alike , you Chinese  --  just thinking of such  --  awful things . " Madame Wu was deeply astonished . " Little Sister , " she said , " I speak of life , the life of man , the life of woman . I pity you , I would help you if I could  --  " " I do n't want your help , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve God . " " Poor soul , " Madame Wu murmured , " then go and serve your God . " She rose and with a tender hand she took Little Sister 's hand and led her to the door and bade her farewell . She resolved never to see her again . Serenely she sat down , her eyes still full of brooding pity , when Ying came running in . " The First Young Lord , his wife is beginning travail , " she cried . " Ah , " Madame Wu said , " send for her own mother . Meanwhile I will go to her at once . " She rose and went into her bedroom and washed her hands thoroughly and changed her silk coat for one of clean blue linen . Then , perfuming her hands and cheeks , she went unto Liangmo 's court . She welcomed the news . Nothing was so exciting in a house as the birth of a child . She had not enjoyed the act of birth for herself , and yet each time she had given birth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fears today for Meng . Meng was young and healthy and made for children . It was the day of women , as all days of birth are . The main room of her eldest son 's court was full of excited women servants and female cousins and relatives . Even the children were excited and laughing as they tried to help carry pails of water and pots of tea . The great house was crowded enough and yet all welcomed the coming of another child . Moreover , since Meng was the wife of the eldest son , there was added dignity to this birth . " Another son would be best , " an elderly cousin was saying when Madame Wu entered the court . " Then if something happens to the first one , here is the second . A house with many sons is always secure . " At this moment Madame Wu entered and all rose . The highest seat had been kept for her , and she took it . Murmured greetings came from the suddenly silenced room . Rulan as the second daughter-in-lawrose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rulan , " Madame Wu said.  |p164She  looked with a sharp , swift gaze at the girl . Pale  --  she was lookingpale . She never saw Rulan without remembering that once in the night she had wept aloud . Then Madame Wu saw Linyi sitting somewhat apart . She was cracking dried watermelon seeds between her teeth and blowing the shells on the floor . Madame Wu restrained a rebuke . In a few minutes Madame Kang would be here , and it was better not to disturb Linyi . The girl stood when she saw Madame Wu 's eyes on her . " Ah , Linyi , " Madame Wu said . Then she took up the affair of the birth . " How are matters ? " she inquired of the midwife who had come running out of the bedroom when she heard the commotion of Madame Wu 's arrival . " All is well , " the stout woman replied . She was a loud , coarse , hearty soul who performed her task everywhere , but who welcomed a birth in a rich house because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she delivered the child whole and alive and if it were a boy . " It is surely a boy , " she said . Her broad face beamed . " Our First Son 's Lady carried him high . " But Meng 's voice raised in sudden screams now was clearly heard , and the midwife ran out of the room . In less than half an hour Madame Kang came hurrying in . She herself was already shapeless , although she had put on loose robes . Silence fell as she crossed the threshold . Curiosity and pity made the silence . She felt it and covered her shame with words . " Sisters ! " she exclaimed , " here you all are . How good you are to care for my child ! " Then she spoke to Madame Wu . " And you , Eldest Sister , how is she ? " " I have waited for your coming , " Madame Wu said . " Let us go in together . " Together they went into the room where Meng lay upon a narrow couch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . The two ladies went to her , one on either side , and held her hands . " Mother , " Meng gasped , " Mother  --  it 's worse than last time . " " Truly it is not , " Madame Kang comforted her . " It will be much quicker . " " Do not talk ! " Madame Wu commanded them both . " Now is the time for effort . " To Madame Wu 's cool thin hand , to Madame King 's plump warm one , Meng clung . She longed to lean her head on her mother 's breastp165and weep , but she did not dare because it would not have been dutiful to her husband 's mother . The reek of hot blood filled the room . The midwife was suddenly very busy . " He comes , the little lord of life ! " she cried . " I see his crown . " Meng shuddered and screamed and twisted the two hands she held . Neither flinched . She bent her head and bit her own hand that her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it tightly against her bosom . " Why wound yourself ? " she exclaimed . But Meng flung herself straight and made her body an arch of pain . She opened her mouth wide and put out a great groan that rose into a final scream . Madame Kang dropped her hand , pushed the midwifeaside , and put out both hands and caught the child . " Another boy , " she said reverently . As though he heard her , the child who had drawn in his breath now let it out with a yell . Madame Wu smiled down into the small wrinkled , furious face . " Are you angry that you are born ? " she asked the child in a tender teasing . " Hear him , Meng , he is blaming us all . " But Meng did not answer . She was released from pain and , her eyes closed , she lay like a flower beaten upon the earth after rain . That night Madame Wu and Madame Kang sat together . All was well in the house . The child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content the two friends now sat . Madame Wu , to spare her friend pain , had not spoken all day of Madame Kang 's own shamefullyswelling body . While they sat and talked of family matters and many small things and wove these in with memories of their youth , a long shadow fell across the open door . It was Brother Andre coming to give Fengmo his lesson as usual . " The foreign priest ? " Madame Kang asked . " He comes here still to teach Fengmo , " Madame Wu said . It seemed very long to her since last night when her soul had climbed out of the walls of the house . Now tonight it was fast again , caught and tied afresh by this new child born today . This was another mouth , another mind for which she was responsible . " I do no more understand a priest or nun than I understand a foreign language , " Madame Kang said . Madame Wu smiled at her . " You , " she said , " you  --  " Madame Kang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am alone , " she confessed , " I am happy . I am glad to have one more child . "  |p166In  Madame Kang 's rosy face so far from youth Madame Wu saw to her amazement something of the same divine content which she had seen last night on Brother Andre 's face . This friendship had been always upon the level of their common womanhood . Madame Wu knew that her friend had never so much as learned to read . Indeed , Madame Kang would have thought it a waste of time to read when she could bear a child . " Meichen , " Madame Wu said , half smiling , half tender , " you are insatiable . You are not willing to leave children to the young women . You are as good as bearing your own grandchild . Will you never leave off ? " " Alas , " Madame Kang sighed with mock shame , " I find such pleasure in it ! " " Do you truly never wish for anything else than what your life is ? " Madame Wu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If I could just keep on bearing a child every year  --  of what use am I if I cease bearing this fruit ? " The thin and graceful shadow of Fengmo crossed the threshold . Madame Wu glanced at its passing . " Fengmo is come for his lesson , " she said . Both ladies watched his slanting shadow move away . " Linyi  --  " They both began and stopped , each waiting for the other . " Go on , " Madame Kang said . " No , you are her mother , you proceed , " Madame Wu insisted . " No , I will not , " Madame Kang said . " Well , then , " Madame Wu said after an instant , " I will proceed . Fengmo is not happy with your daughter , Meichen . It is a pity you did not teach her how to make him happy . " " Fengmo ! " Madame Kang exclaimed . Madame Wu was surprised at the tone of her voice . " Fengmo not happy ! " Madame Kang repeatedwith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is Linyi who is not happy ! " " Meichen , " Madame Wu said in her most silvery voice , " recall your-self . " " Yes , " Madame Kang declared , " you think you have taught Fengmo well . But Linyi is not happy with him . In a marriage there must be two . Can there be hand-clapping with only one hand ? You have not taught Fengmo his part in marriage . " " I ? " Madame Wu said sharply.  | " Yes , " Madame Kang said . " Liangmo is like his father . He is a man by instinct , and so Meng is happy with him . But Fengmo is like you . " " That is to say , he demands something a little above the common , " Madame Wu said bitterly . Madame Kang wagged her head . " Then let him find it outside , " she said . " Let him take up his book learning and let him find a work to soak up his discontent . It has nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Madame Wu exclaimed . " Linyi had better come home for a while , " Madame Kang replied . " You and Fengmo , you can study your books and do without her until you see her value . " Madame Wu saw this friendship , deeply dear , tremble and crack . " Meichen , do we quarrel ? " she exclaimed . Madame Kang replied with passion , " I have been a good friend to you always , and I have never judged you even though I saw you thinking thoughts above a woman . But I have always known that you were too wise , too clever for happiness . I told your sons ' father so " Have you two talked of me ? " Madame Wu asked . Her voice was coo quiet . " Only for your sake , " Madame Kang replied . She rose as she spoke and gathered her loose robes about her and walked sturdily away from Madame Wu . Late that night when Madame Wu was in her bed Ying said , " Do you know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tonight , Lady ? " " I know , " Madame Wu said . She closed her eyes as though for sleep . But she did not sleep . She had not believed that Madame Kang would reach into this house and take back her daughter , as though Linyi still belonged to her . She lay still , and she could scarcely sleep for anger all that night . Had Madame Wu been a lesser woman she would merely have been angry with her friend and sure of herself , but she was not such a woman . She blamed herself for carelessness in her own behavior . She had always known that her friendship with Madame Kang was of house and family , earth and clay . Why had she not been content with this instead of opening a door which frightened her friend ? Every soul is frightened when it is forced beyond its level . Now out of her carelessness the rift between Fengmo and Linyi was widened.  |p168For  surely it is very grave when a young wife is taken out of her husband 's house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go and bring her back . She sent for Fengmo . He came in looking pale but quiet . " Son , " she said , " I have sent for you to confess my own fault . Linyi 's mother and I quarreled . Like stupid women , each of us declaredfor her own child , and she took her daughter home again . I have to tell you this so that you will know it was not Linyi 's fault . Now we must invite her to come back to us . " To her horror Fengmo shook his head . " I will not invite her , Mother , " he declared . " Let it be as it is . Linyi and I are not suited . " " How can you say that ? " Madame Wu asked . Her heart was beatingso quickly that she could feel it throb against the thick satin of her coat . The morning was cold , and she had put on a lined garment . " Any man and any woman , with intelligence , can suit each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a discipline . One may not consider himself only . " " Mother , I know that is what you have been taught , " Fengmo replied . " And it is what you have taught us . Were I your only son , I might in duty accept it . But I have two brothers ahead of me . Mother , let me go free . " Madame Wu leaned forward in her chair , her hands clasped together . " Fengmo , " she said , " tell me what happened between you and Linyi . I am your mother . " " Nothing , " Fengmo said doggedly . But Madame Wu took this literally . " Nothing , " she repeated aghast . " You mean you two went into the same bed and nothing happened ? " " Oh , Mother , " Fengmo groaned . " Why do you think that is the only thing which can happen between men and women ? " " But it is the first thing , " Madame Wu insisted . Fengmo set his lips together . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was the first thing . Then you see , Mother , I expected something more . " " What did you expect ? " she asked . He flung out his big thin hands . " Some kind of talk , some kind of understanding , companionship  --  something after the introduction . I mean , after you are through with the body , what then ? " " But at your age you are never through with the body , " Madamep169Wu said . She began to see that she had not understood Fengmo . She had taken it for granted that all men were only males . She had once laughed at a foreign story she had read , an ancient story of Greece , of a woman who had fallen in love with a man not her husband because his breath was sweet . For this woman had known only her husband and had thought a foul breath was a part of man and that all men had such breath in them . Now she perceived she was as silly as this woman to consider that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a man who was more than a male . This so astonished her that for some time she sat looking at her son . But Fengmo seemed unaware of her thoughtful eyes . He sat , his body bent , his elbows on his parted knees , his hands hanging clasped between . " I feel I can not command you to do anything , " she said at last in a low voice . " I see now that I have violated your being . " He looked up and she saw tears in his eyes . " What do you call freedom ? " she inquired . " Tell me and I will give it to you . " " I should like to go away out of this house , " he said . These words wrenched her heart . But she only asked next , " Where would you like to go ? " " Brother Andre said he would help me to cross the sea , " Fengmo said . " If Brother Andre had never come into this house , " she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ? " " I would have thought of it , " he replied , " but I would not have known how to do it . Brother Andre has shown me the way . " To this she said nothing . She sat mute and thoughtfuL Then she sighed , " Very well , my son , " she said at last . " Go free . " IN LESS than a month after this , on a day when the first light snow fell , Fengmo went away . All the household stood at the gate to see him go . The street that went past the gate ended at the river , and the menfolk , and with them only Madame Wu , walked with him to the water 's edge . Hands helped him with his baggage andp170hands helped him over the side of the rocking rowboat that was to carry him to a small steam launch that would take him to a river steamer . The river steamer would take him to the ocean and the great ship that lay waiting . Above the whitened ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and snowflakes melted on the boatman 's oars . A score of farewells followed Fengmo . Madame Wu did not call after him . She stood , a small straight figure wrapped . in fur , and watched this son of hers cast off from the shores of his home . She was frightened and sad , but she comforted herself by these words , " He is free . " And wrapping her coat about her , she returned to her own walls . With Fengmo 's going Brother Andre would have ceased to come , but Madame Wu invited him to continue his lessons , taking Linyi as pupil instead of Fengmo . " When my son returns from foreign countries , " she said to Brother Andre , in her cool graceful fashion , " I would like his wife to know something of what he knows . " Now Fengmo 's marriage had been patched together in this fashion : One day Madame Wu went to the Kang house and talked with Linyi very gently in her mother 's presence . She told Linyi that Fengmo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return in order that if possible before Fengmo went away , he might leave her with child . " I do this , not only for the sake of our house , " Madame Wu said to Linyi , " but also for your own sake , lest you be unfulfilled . " She had studied Linyi 's face as she spoke  --  a selfish pretty face , she thought . Good mothers always had selfish daughters . Meichen was too good . She made her children too happy . They thought of home as heaven and their mother as earth . " It is not well for a young woman to be left empty when her husband goes away , " she continued . To this Madame Kang had heartily agreed . Since her quarrel with her friend she had repented her anger . Linyi had aided her in this , For , while the girl had come home with all her mother 's pity , MadameKang began after some days to see her Linyi as a willful young woman . She was no longer a girl , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was a girl in a rich house . She rose late and dawdled about the courts and did not so much as pick up her handkerchiefwhen it fell from her pocket , but she called for a maid ITT come and hand it to her . In small ways Madame Kang now began terp171reproach Linyi and to think that perhaps Fengmo had had something to complain about . When she heard that Fengmo was going away she , too , was eager for Linyi to return to him . " You do not belong to this house any more , " she told the girl more than once . " You belong to the Wu house . " " How can I make that slender , naughty girl become a woman and a wife ? " Madame Wu now asked herself secretly . " And not only for my house but for her own happiness ? " So Brother Andre had come into her mind again . She saw his great patient frame , his dark kind face . But could he teach a young wife ? " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame Kang declared . And as eagerly as she had once taken Linyi back , she now sent her forth again . Linyi went in silence . She was not stupid , and clearly enough she felt the change in her own mother . She knew that she had been put out of her heaven and earth . Her heart smarted , and silently she went back into Fengmo 's court . He had been exceedingly busy preparing for his going . But since he knew he was to be freed , he was gay and careless to her . It did not now matter greatly whether she were here or not since he was leaving the house . " I have come back , " she had said to him . He did not say he was glad , she did not ask if he were . Neither expected the other 's love . She helped him with new docility to fold his garments , and she dusted his books . At night they slept together . He took her and she yielded , partly for duty 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry . In the morning they had parted still without speech . For decency 's sake she did not go outside the court . " Until we meet ! " he had said . " Heaven give you safe journeying , " she had replied , and stood leaningagainst the door to watch him while he went . Some faint uncertaintyshook her heart from its middle place in her breast , but she was not ready to see any fault in herself . " I am still sleepy , " she thought , and yawned widely , and without hiding her red mouth she returned to the big bed and rolled into the silk quilts and slept like a little chrysalis . From this sleep Madame Wu awakened her as soon as Fengmo was gone . " Come , Linyi , " she said , " you have slept long enough . Now you must wake and begin your education . "  | " My education ? " Linyi faltered . " You will learn cooking and embroidery in the morning , " Madame Wu said . " Elder Cousin will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal you will come to me , and I will teach you the classics . In the afternoon Brother Andre will teach you foreign languages . In the evening you will help the maids to put the children to bed . You must learn how to care for children . " Linyi looked up out of the quilt . Her big eyes were startled , and her soft hair was all awry . " Now ? " she asked . " Now , at once , " Madame Wu said firmly . She held a thin bamboo cane in her hand , and she tapped this on the floor . " Wash yourself , " she said . " Brush your hair . Then come to me . " She went back to her own courts , her mouth set too grimly for its own beauty . " I do this for Fengmo , " she thought . " Then when this is done I can think again about my own freedom . " But because she did not trust Linyi she stayed by her that afternoon when Brother Andre came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the sake of honor she herself must supervise the hours this foreign priest was with her own daughter-in-law in her son 's absence . She knew that Brother Andre was a soul , but who else but her would believe the big body was only a husk ? In this way every day she sat in the highest seat in the library , her dragonheaded cane , which she carried now that Old Lady was dead , between her hands . She listened to everything Brother Andre taught Linyi . But while the girl plodded unwillingly along the hard part of learning , Madame Wu 's mind flew ahead and wandered into a hundredbypaths of wonder . Thus she came to know how the earth and the seas are gathered into a great ball swinging among the stars and planets , and she understood the paths of sun and moon , the passage of winds and clouds . But these were as nothing to her wonder when she came to understand the tongues of man . For she liked to do this : she chose a word , such a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , food , air , water , hunger , sleep , house , flower , tree , grass , bird , and she learned this word through all the languages which Brother Andre knew . These languageswere the voices of mankind . She learned everything with the excuse of helping Linyi to learn . And as she learned , all the things which had occupied her life came to have meaning . In the past she had sometimes wondered why she should spend herself in the continued round of birth and death andp173birth again . Within these four walls , as man begot and woman conceived in order that the house of Wu might not perish , sometimes she had asked herself what it mattered if one house died . In a year when too many girls were born , in a year when an idiot was dropped too early from a womb , she had often been disheartened . Especially in the years when she had only looked forward to her fortieth birthday had she refused to answer the questioning of her own soul . Little Sister Hsia on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read you from the blessed book , Madame ? " Little Sister had asked . Madame Wu had been weary to the bone that day , for in addition to all else she had known that she was pregnant again . But she was always too courteous to refuse a guest . " If it is our pleasure , read , " she had replied . Then Little Sister Hsia had taken out her sacred book , and she had read aloud in her broken childish fashion words like these : " What is man that thou art mindful of him and the son of man that thou rememberest him ? For the clays of man are as grass  --  " " Stop ! " Madame Wu had cried . Her voice had burst out of her , and so unusual was this that Little Sister Hsia had stared at her . " Are these words to comfort a soul ? " Madame Wu had demanded . " Are these the words of a god ? Rather , I say , of a devil ! If I should listen to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Read me no more from your book , lest I can not live . " But she had brooded over the words , and she remembered them now . Yes , it was true . Man 's flesh was as grass . When her child had been born dead , she had reme.ibered the words as she held the small , still body in her arms . But today , as she listened to the voices of mankindcrying out in different tongues but always the same word , she felt in herself a new wonder . " Do all men also cry out a word for God ? " she asked Brother Andre . " All men , " he replied gravely , and then he rolled out sonorous syllables that struck upon her ears like drums . " God  --  God  --  God -- God  --  " in twenty tongues , and all the tongues of man . " From all over the earth we cry out to Old Heaven , " she said musingly , and the drums echoed in her soul . On such nights she could not sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she climbed into the high redwood platform of thep174bed . Behind the silk curtains she gave herself up to her soul and meditated on the meaning of all she had learned . Brother Andre came to be for her a well , wide and deep , a well of learning and knowledge . In the night she thought of scores of questions to which she wanted answers . Sometimes when her memory grew burdened with their number she rose from her bed and lit her candle . And she took up her camel's-hair brush and brushed down the questions upon a sheet of paper in her fine script . The next afternoon when Brother Andre came she read them to him one by one and listened carefully to all he said . Now , his manner of answering questions was exceedingly simple , but this was because he was so learned . He did not need , as lesser men do , to talk over and above the pith of the matter . Instead , he knew how , as Taoists of old knew , to put into a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stripped the leaves away , and he plucked the fruit and cracked the husk and peeled the inner shell and split the flesh and took out the seed and divided it , and there was the kernel , pure and clean . And Madame Wu 's mind was so whetted at this time of her life , so bladelike and piercing , that she took this kernel and from it comprehendedall . Young Linyi sat between the two , her eyes wide , as these few words were said and heard , and it was plain that for her it was all far above her and beyond her . Her mind still slept in youth . But Brother Andre marveled at Madame Wu . " You have lived behind these walls all your life , " he said one day , " and yet when I speak as heretofore I have spoken only to one or two of my few brother scholars , you know what I mean . " To this she replied , " You have told me of the magic glass which makes small things large . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made as large as a desert , and if the fragment were comprehended , the desert was known . This house is the fragment of dust , and from it I comprehend all . Inside these four walls is the whole of life . " She caught sight of Linyi 's hostile young face . " Are you saying we are dust , Mother ? " she asked . " No , child , " Madame Wu replied . " I am saying that you are all of life . " Over the young head her eyes met Brother Andre 's . " Teach this child , " she said . " Mother , I am not a child , " Linyi pouted . But Madame Wu smiled . That afternoon when Brother Andre wasp175putting his books together , she asked , " Dare I ask you to take me , too , as your pupil ? " she asked humbly . " I am honored by the wish , " he replied in his grave way . " Then for an hour , perhaps , after you have taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening for an hour he answeredMadame Wu 's questions . Scrupulous in spite of her age , Madame Wu bade Ying sit on the seat nearest the door while she *nd Brother Andre talked . " Madame , I must ask you a question . If it makes you angry I beg wou to send me away , " Ying said one morning . " Why should I be angry at you now after the years you have spoken as you liked ? " Madame Wu asked . She put down the book she was reading , but she kept her thumbthe pages , ready to read again when Ying had finished . " I can not please you in what I am about to say , " Ying began . " But while you have been wandering around the earth with this big priest , the household has been at sevens and eights with disorder . The wet nurse to your eldest son 's wife 's second son is losing her milk . The child grows thin . At night there is quarreling in your second son 's court . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet . And the Second Lady and our master  --  well , Madame , I will not presume . But I say it is wrong for a lady like you to withdraw herself into books as you do . It is not all evil that our ancestors taught us that women ought not to read and write . " This Ying said as though she had committed it to heart . Madame Wu listened , the old half-smile on her face . But her thumb slipped out of the book , and she closed it and put it on the table . " Thank you , good soul , " she said . She rose and went into her bedroom . The morning was cool , and she put on a fur coat before she went out . In the court the orchids were drying with frost and the leaves were sinking into the loam of the earth . But the sprays of berries on the Indian bamboo were growingscarlet and heavy . A blackbird sat perched on a rock , eating them , and Ying ran at him to frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been so patient under rebuke , Ying felt guilty of impudence , and she tried to make amends with her usual chatter . Madame Wu listened to it without answering . It occurred to her as she went through Old Lady 's empty court that it would be well if Liangmo brought his family here to live , near her , so that she couldp176more easily watch over the children . Then she could move Tsemo and Rulan into Liangmo 's present court , and the larger spare might add peace to them . The day was fair . She moved through the clear sunshine in a wellbeingwhich she herself did not understand . These four walls around this piece of earth were full of human troubles , but she felt herself able to meet them and even to cure them because she was no longer a part of them . By her separation from Mr. Wu , in the flesh , she had cut all cords that had entangled her . She mused on this strong secret bond of body to body , which when it was cut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed the paths that were now opened over all the earth . Thus she stepped into Liangmo 's court as a goddess might have come , to minister and not to share . But the wail of the child crying struck her ear with painful sharpness . She forgot everything and hurried into the house . There Meng sat , and there , too , sat the young wet nurse holding the hungry child to her empty breast . Tears ran down her pale cheeks . The child sucked and turned his head away again to scream with anger when no milk came . " What now ? " Madame Wu asked . " How has your milk dried ? " The young woman laid the little boy in Meng 's arms while she wept . " Have you given her crab soup with poached eggs ? " Madame Wu inquired of Meng . " We have tried everything , " Meng replied . " I thought it was nothingat first , a cold she had , or that she had overeaten , and we mixed rice flour into gruel for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has gone on for two days , and the child is not fed . His flesh is slipping from his hones . " The older child 's wet nurse now came in. " 1 have offered my milk , " she said , " but it is too old for this child . He vomits it up . " She looked pleased with herself as she spoke . " I have never lost my milk , Elder Lady , so how can I know what should be done ? " " Go away , " Madame Wu ordered her , seeing her vanity and knowing that she was a woman greedy for gifts . The young wet nurse went on crying , and Madame Wu sat down and folded her hands on her dragonheaded cane and looked at her . " Your milk has dried because you are sad , " she said . " What is your trouble ? " At first the young woman would not answer . She wiped her eyesp177on her sleeves and looked down , and when the tears came welling out she wiped them away again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own tears and not for milk for my son , " Meng said distractedly . " Hush , " Madame Wu said . " She is a human being . Speak , good soul . " Thus encouraged , the young woman faltered in a voice so small as scarcely could be heard , " I have not seen my own child . I do not know how she does  --  I have been here nearly a month . Next week is the full month birthday of this child , and I do not know how my own little one does . " At this Meng looked exceedingly angry . She pursed her red mouth and opened her black eyes wide . " How can you think of your child and let your milk dry up ? " she exclaimed . " Hush , " Madame Wu said again . " Let her child be brought here . " " To he nursed with mine ? " Meng cried . " To save your son , " Madame Wu replied . The young nurse fell on her knees before Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasped , " you are not cruel  --  they told me you were cruel  --  " " Who said I was cruel ? " Madame Wu asked . " The steward  --  on the lands  --  he said I must not disobey you  --  that no one dared to disobey you . I did not want to come here , Lady . I have my own little house , my man works on your land , we have our child  --  a girl , it is true , but our first child . I was so proud of her . I had such a lot of milk . The steward said I must come or he would drive my man away from the land we have rented . " " He had . no command from me to speak so , " Madame Wu said . " I told only him only to find a wet nurse . " " In the villages he makes us all feel afraid of you , " the young woman went on . " On the lands we all fear you through him , Elder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by these words , but she did not want this servant woman to know her confusion . In a great household those who command must not put themselves at the mercy of those who obey . She inclined her head and said gently , " I will send word today that your child is to be brought here . She may sleep near you , but not in the same room with my grandson . " " You save a life , " the woman said , and fell on her knees and knocked her forehead on the tiles before Madame Wu.  |p178But  the child was wailing again and the woman rose from her knees and took him back . The tears dried on her cheeks , and she held the little boy to her breast . He snatched the nipple again and began to suck , and milk began to flow . " You held back your milk , " Meng cried . " You refused to let it come down . " But the woman looked up at her in timid wonder . She was a plainfacedfarm woman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do not know where my milk went nor why now it has come back , except that when our Elder Lady said my little girl could come , I felt loosened inside my heart , and so the milk came down . " But Meng was still angry . " You common soul , you are too stupid ! " Madame Wu rose . " Since your son 's life depends upon her , it is perhaps better for you not to be angry , my daughter , " she said . " And you , woman , when your child comes , do not forget your duty is to my grandson . " The young woman looked up humbly at Madame Wu . " I will not forget , Elder Lady , " she said in a low voice . " I will always feed him first . " Something in her look and in her voice stayed Madame Wu 's steps . Underneath the quiet she felt something sullen and strong . But she did not ask what it was . She had never inquired too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lest she be somehow entangledin them . So now she spoke to Meng . " I will give our Old Lady 's courts to my eldest son and you . Then I can be near my grandsons . " Meng did not looked pleased , and Madame Wu hardened her purpose . " I will send servants to help you move today , " she said and without waiting for Meng to speak she went on to find her son Tsemo . At this hour Tsemo should have been away from the house and at his business , which was to supervise the markets where they sold their produce . But he was still here . Madame Wu saw him in his court rinsing his mouth as though he had only just eaten . She entered , and he spat hastily and put aside the cup he held . " You are early , Mother , " he said . " I am going my rounds , " she said . " I stopped to say that I shall give Liangmo 's court to you because I give him Old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near me . " " I will tell Rulan , " Tsemo said.  |p179At  the name she thought she saw a slight cold shade on his face , and she spoke straightly as her habit was when she saw trouble . " I am told that Rulan cries in the night . " " Who told you ? " he asked shortly . " The servants , " she replied , " and it is a shameful thing when the troubles of the family become the talk of servants . " " You were right , Mother , " he said . " I should not have married this woman . " " Has love ended between you already ? " Madame Wu inquired . But to this he would not say no or yes . He walked about the tiny court , ten steps this way , sixteen steps that . " We have nothing to say to each other without its leading to quarreling , " he replied at last . " How is it that she is not with child ? " Madame Wu asked . " Quarreling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . " " How can I tell ? " he replied and shrugged his shoulders . " She does not conceive . It is assuredly not my fault . " " There can be no conception where there is quarreling , " Madame Wu told him . " Hearts in a roil dry the body 's juices and poison the blood . Between man and woman the stream of life forces must be kept clear . " She looked at this handsome son . " It is always easy for men and women to quarrel , " she went on . " Their natural difference is so great that unless they unite to create the new generation , they fly apart from each other like water and oil . A wife without child is a creature against nature , and she rebels against Heaven and earth , and the man is nothing to her . You must be patient with her until she conceives . Once that comes , you will find her a new woman . " " Am I nothing to Rulan ? " he asked arrogantly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , " and that is why she hates you . Her love comes to no fruit . She is teased by it . She has no defense from you , no refuge . She has no place to hide from you and be herself . " She could see he was deeply hurt by what she said . " You shall take a journey somewhere , " she went on . " Then when you come back be gentle , not arrogant . Do not remind her that she is older than you or that she sought you first . " " How do you know she sought me ? " he asked . He stopped his pacing to stare at her . " How do you know everything ? " he said half laughing , half rueful . " I can see with my eyes , " she replied . She rested her round chin ofp180her hands folded over the dragonhead of her cane . " She fears you and she hates her fears , and she loves you and she dreads her love . Yes , go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between men and women , and you and Rulan have proceeded out of order . Look at Meng  --  with her all things proceed as Heaven ordains , and what harmony there is in her house ! Her sons come one by one , and Liangmo is content with her . Neither of them loves the other too much , and together they create their new generation . " " Meng is old-fashioned , " Tsemo said impatiently . " Also she is a little stupid . At least Rulan is not stupid . " " It is not necessary for a woman to be stupid or not stupid , " Madame Wu replied with patience . " Such things are all in proportion . Man and woman in marriage must be in proportion to each other and so I chose Meng for Liangmo . He is wiser than she , but she is wise enough so that she understands what he says . In your marriage you are too equal and so you contend . " " You are wiser than my father , " Tsemo said . He threw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by it . " Ah , I learned my wisdom , " she said quickly . " I am wise enough so that there was never any trouble between your father and me . That is why I sent Ch'iuming into his courts so that he could continue to be happy as he grew old . " " And you ? " Tsemo probed her cruelly . " I also continue to be happy , " she said tranquilly . Now Rulan came out of the house , as though she could no longer pretend she did not hear all that was being said in the small court outside her window . Madame Wu knew well enough that she had heard all , but in courtesy she carried on the pretense . " I was telling Tsemo that if you please , my daughter , you may move into Liangmo'slarger court since I move them into the court next mine , where I can watch over my grandsons better . " " We thank you , Mother , " Rulan said . But no thanks showed in voice or look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and green squares laid next to each other , and she looked older than she was . " As soon as Tsemo goes away , " Madame Wu thought , " I will teach her not to look so ugly . " She continued to sit and look thoughtfully at her daughter-in-law , and Tsemo , following this gaze , found new fault with his wife . " I hate that robe , " he said violently .   " Buy me another , " she said insolently , tossing back her short hair . Madame Wu rose at once . She would not sit and see the two quarrellest she be compelled to strive for peace between them . But she could not keep back entirely her displeasure . " Tsemo is going away for a while , " she told Rulan . " I have given my permission . Be peaceful for these few days until he goes . Busy yourself with moving your goods tomorrow into your new court . " " If Tsemo goes , I go , " Rulan said . She stood very straight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Madame Wu stood as straight , her hands on her cane . " You do not go , " she said distinctly . " You will stay here with me . You have much to learn , and I will teach you . " Again she did not wait for a daughter-in-law to answer . She turned and went out of the court , and not once did she look back . " Ah , my sons ' wives , " she thought , " how troublesome they are to me ! Would that I had early taken little girls into my house and reared them to be sons ' wives and bent them to fit our need ! To bring strangers into the house to bear our grandsons is to bring in trouble . " She found herself longing for evening and for peace , when , with Brother Andre for guide , she could leave body behind and sally forth , soul bare , into the world . In the court she had left , Rulan looked at her young husband with surly suffering eyes . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered . " It was wholly my mother 's idea , " Tsemo said lightly . He threw back his head and smoothed his long forelock . She saw those pale hands of his and felt the pull at her heart for which she now hated herself . " I shall run away , " she said in the same sullen voice . He laughed . " Not with me  --  I would not dare to come home again . " " You are afraid of your mother ! " she cried . " I am , indeed , " he agreed . This easy agreement was his trick against her . Time and again heyielded the point and left her nothing to grasp for her weapon . " I would rather have no sons than have them afraid of me , " shedeclared . " Well , you have no sons , " he said in his tranquil voice . Her heart broke at the ancient taunt . Try as she could she could P182not free herself from its power . " Tsemo , do you really hate me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke , and he looked down into her face . " Why will you tear at me and wound me and give me no peace ? " he said between his teeth . " Peace from me ! " she cried . " No , only peace , " he said , " simple peace . " " Peace so you can forget me ! " she said passionately . " I know that is why you will have me angry at you , " he retorted . He laughed sourly . " You make me angry so that you can force my mind toward you for that , at least . " He had plucked truth out of her , truth she hid even from herself . Yes , when he had ceased to think of her day and night , when he grew careless after their marriage , she had forced anger on him to draw him back to her . She wanted suffering from him  --  pain , even , rather than nothing . She saw him turn his head away from her , and the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , " she thought . " I must rid myself somehow of love . It is too bitter for me . " It was strange that at this moment when she longed to be free of him she thought of Madame Wu . All impulse as she was , she ran past him pipe . " Mother ! " she cried , " let me go free , too ! " Madame Wu heard this cry like an echo of her own soul . But she did not reveal her consternation . She put down the pipe on the table and gazed at her tall daughter-in-law . " Calm yourself , " she said . " Sit down and smooth the hair out of your eyes . While I think of it , let me tell you never to wear that robe again . You ought always to wear gay colors . They will lighten your darkness . Now , how can I let you go free ? " " I want to go out of this house  --  away from Tsemo , " Rulan said . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stood , having heard nothing of what Madame Wu had said to her , and the two women looked at each other . " I told you Tsemo is going away , " Madame Wu said . " Of him you will be free . " " I want to be free of him forever , " Rulan cried . " I ought never to have married . I hate what I feel for him . I am a slave to it . He has sane as he wants me , not as I want to be . "   " Is he to blame for this ? " Madame Wu asked . " Let me go away , " Rulan repeated . Madame Wu unwillingly began again to like this strange angry girl . " Where will you go ? " she asked . " What is there for a woman outside her husband 's house ? Even if I free you from this house , can you be free ? A woman without a husband  --  she becomes despisedof all . Through man and child only is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with horror . " Tell me how to free my , self , " she whispered . Madame Wu felt a great welling pity for her . " Alas , my child , " she said gently , " I can not tell you , for I do not know . " " Have you never loved anybody ? " the girl urged . Madame Wu looked down and did not answer . She began to feel that Tsemo had somehow wronged this girl . But how could he know what she meant ? He had been only himself , and could he help it if this was not enough for the girl ? She began to perceive that she had been fortunate in not allowing herself to love Mr. Wu too well . At one time there had been some danger of it , when she was very young . But her own fastidiousness had been her guard . Rulan was not fastidious . " If you had a child , " she said at last , " you might be free of him . At least you divide your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compelled to give it . Or it might be , if you have no child , that you could undertake study , or painting , or some such thing . You must divide yourself , my child . You have allowed all your powers to flow in the deep narrow river . Now dig yourself canals and rivulets and drain off your love here and there . " " Forced labor , " Rulan said bitterly . " If need be , " Madame Wu said gently . " But it is your only way to peace . You will surely die otherwise . For he will hate you , I promise you . He is trembling on the verge of hatred now . Therefore have I commanded him to go away from you for a while . " Rulan wet her pale lips . " Are all men like him ? " she whispered . " Men are as like one another as minnows , " Madame Wu said in her pretty silvery voice . " It is when women discover it that they are free . " " Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrewdly . " Some trick of his looks , " Madame Wu said in the same pretty voice , " the way his eyebrows move , the turn of his mouth , the set of his shoulders in his coat , his hands  --  "   " How do you know ? " Rulan whispered aghast . Madame Wu laughed . " Heaven sets a hundred snares to carry on our kind , " she replied . She could not be angry at this girl . What was she but a poor trapped creature ? Now that she saw how pitiably well Rulan loved Tsemo , she forgave her everything . She put out her narrow hand and pulled Rulan 's hands apart and patted them one after the other . " No more unhappiness , " she said coaxingly . " I do not like anyone to be unhappy under our roof . See , I spend my life trying to make you all happy . What do you want , child , to make you happy here ? " Rulan could not but yield to the beautiful coaxing face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be pulled along until she stood like a child at Madame Wu 's knees . " Let him go , " Madame Wu said in her soothing way . " Do not weep when he goes . Help him to pack his boxes , and bid him good-by gaily , however your heart weeps . Sleep heartily at night and do not wake . Let him be sleepless , child , not you . " " But if I am sleepless without him ? " Rulan asked naively . Madame Wu laughed aloud , relishing this frankness . " Get up and take a walk in your court , " she said . " The night air is very cold now , and when you are cold your warm bed will put you to sleep , even though you lie down alone . " The two women looked steadily into each other 's eyes . Madame Wu discerned the young hot soul , trembling with distress , and all the fountains of her pity broke open . Some loyalty deeper than that to the Wu family reached out and poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a woman . " You are free when you gain back yourself , " Madame Wu said . " You can be as free within these walls as you could be in the whole world . And how could you be free if , however far you wander , you still carry inside yourself the constant thought of him ? See where you belong in the stream of life . Let it flow through you , cool and strong . l. ) o not dam it with your two hands , lest he break the dam and so escape you . Let him go free , and you will be free . " " I can not live without love from him , " Rulan faltered . " Then hang yourself tonight , " Madame Wu said calmly , " for I promise you he will not love you unless you let him first go free . Love only lives in freedom . " " I could be a slave if he loved me , " Rulan said . " You are not the slave , " Madame Wu exclaimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love . He feels it , he will not have it so . He must be free of you because you love him too much . Oh , foolish woman , how can I make you see how to be happy ? " Then Rulan fell at her knees . " I do see , " she sobbed . " I know what you mean  --  and  --  I am afraid to do it ! " But Madame Wu would not let her weep . " Get up -- get up , " she said and she stood and lifted Rulan and made her rise and stand on her feet . " If you are afraid , " she said sternly , " then I am finished with you . Never come back to me . I have no time for you . Yes , I will let you go out of the house forever . " Looking down at this exquisite , indomitable slender creature , Rulan felt her restless bitter heart grow still in her bosom . This solitary cool woman appeared now to be the only happy woman she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discontented , and her sisters quarrelsome and restless , as all Shanghai women are restless . But this Madame Wu was as still and deep as a pool in a mountain stream . " I will obey you , Our Mother , " she said humbly . When she had gone Madame Wu reflected with quiet astonishment at herself that she had sent two sons out of her house because of two young women , neither of whom she loved , and that upon herself she had taken this double burden . " I , who myself crave my freedom ! " she exclaimed . And , stupefied at her own contradiction , she gave herself over to Ying 's hands to be made ready for bed . " I can not explain myself , " Madame Wu said to Brother Andre the next day . She had told him of Tsemo 's going . " Is explanation necessary ? " Brother Andre asked with one of his smiles . She had often observed this smile . It began in the thicket of his eyebrows and beard like light beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's head , his whole size and bulk and hairiness , would once have terrified her . Now she was used to it . " What are you thinking about ? " he inquired in a strange and half-shy fashion . " You often say we are all kin on this earth , " she replied , " and yet how can you explain your own appearance ? " " What do you find strange in me ? " he asked , still in the halfshyvoice .   " You are too big , " she said calmly , " and too hairy . " " You can not explain yourself  --  perhaps you can explain me ? " Brother Andre retorted . The lights in the wood were very bright now . She saw glimmers of white teeth in the darkness of his beard and points of laughter-in the dark eyes . " I have read that foreigners arc hairy because they are nearer the animals , " she observed . " Perhaps , " he replied . He opened his great mouth and let out a roar of laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he lay alone on his bamboo pallet , he had thanked God that he had not met Madame Wu when she was a young girl . " I would not have answeredfor my soul , 0 God , " he said grimly through the darkness . But now he was master of his huge body and was only amused by her . " In that case , " he now said to Madame Wu , " would it not be true that , having made me first , God improved upon his original designin making you ? " Now she laughed too , and the deep roar and the delicate silvery laughter mingled together . Out in the court a bondmaid was washingMadame Wu 's fine undergarments while Ying sat beside her to tell her what to do . Ying caught the bondmaid 's upward wonderinglook . " Do not rub soap upon silk , you beggar 's bone ! " Ying cried , " and keep your eyes on your work . " But she wondered too how that dark tall priest could make Madame , her mistress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own wonder . For it was true that in spite of her troubles in the house Madame Wu was coming to some sort of secret exquisite bloom . She met each day with relish and joy . Her only impatience was with the tasks of the house , and yet she controlled her own impatience and did each task with firm self-discipline . But Ying , who knew every breath of change in her mistress , knew , too , that she had no interest any more in the house . She dared not think for one moment that this priest had an evil bond with Madame Wu . The lady was too rigorous for that . Besides , she was cooler than ever , more silvery , more clear in her look , more composed  --  and yet more gay . Ying watched her closely on one or two days when Brother Andre had been prevented from coming and had sent messages to tell her so , and Madame Wu was altogether indif-P187ferent . She sat as happily alone in her library as though her teacher were there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Wu family also , " she whispered , " Have you heard ? " " Heard what ? " Ying asked indignantly . " I do not listen to cats yowling . " " I suppose you know that while our mistress sits learning of a priest , our master is going to flower houses ? " " He is not , " Ying declared . She sat on a low bamboo stool , and she leaned over and slapped the maid on the cheek and her hand left a red mark . The girl 's eyes hlazed . Then she turned her other cheek . " Slap me again , " she said , " for it is true he goes and with old Kang , the two of them . What can you expect ? " Now Ying pretended that she had heard nothing , but the truth was she had heard a whisper of this before , although so great was the fear that all other servants had of her that they hushed themselveswhen she came into a room . " That old Kang , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mischief maker , " and she thought gloomily on the nature of all men , and how she would not put anythingbeyond even her own cook . In the long quiet room Madame Wu had forgotten her own house , She sat gazing at Brother Andre 's brown rugged face , and he , entrancedby her gaze , taught this soul as he had never taught another . It was so pellucid a soul , so wise and yet so young . She had lived in this house and had learned so much through her own living that she was ripe with understanding . Her mind was a crystal cup the workmanship complete , the cup only waiting to be filled . How could he help telling her everything he knew ? Into the beautifulcrystal vessel he poured all the learning that he had until now kept for his own possession , because until now none had cared to share it with him . He told her the history of the world , the rise o4 peoples and their fall , the birth of new nations . He told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explained to her the waves , of the air which carry man 's words and his music around the world " Have you the instrument for catching these words and this , music ? " she inquired today . " I have , " he said . " I made such an instrument myself . " " Will you bring it to me ? " she asked eagerly . He hesitated . " Alas , it is fixed with many wires into the wallsP188Can you  --  would you come to my poor house and see it ? " he asked in return . She pondered this . How could she go to a foreigner 's house , even though accompanied ? She felt suddenly shy . " Perhaps , " she said , and turned her head away . " Do not be disturbed , " he said . " There is nothing in me to disturbyou . The man in me is dead . God killed him . " With these strange words he went away , and she was comforted as she always was after he had gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half smiling , smoking her little pipe , her mind wandering over the world of which he told her . " I wonder if I shall ever go beyond this city , " she mused in her heart . " I wonder if I shall ever sail on those ships and fly on those wings . For the first time she felt sorrowful at the shortness of life . Forty years only , at the most , could be left to her . What could she do in forty years ? She had spent forty years already and had not stirred from her own doors . " What do I know even about my own city ? " she mused . " And here is our nation , set in the midst of these seas and mountains . " Thus the enchantment of the world took hold of Madame Wu . Day upon day she came and went among her family , smiling and unseeing . They gathered at meals , and she sat in her accustomed place among them and saw none of them while she looked at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was cleaning her mistress 's jewels . The day was in midwinter , and Madame Wu had set some lilies into a dish of pebbles on the table , and the sunlight chanced at that moment to fall through the latticed windows upon lilies and jewels . " Sec how alike they are , the jewels and the flowers , the pearls , the emeralds , the topaz , and the yellow and white and green of these flowers , " Madame Wu exclaimed . Ying looked up from a bracelet in her hands . " Lady , you are so quick to see such things , and it is strange you do not see what is happening in your house , " she said . " What do I not see ? " Madame Wu asked half guiltily . She thought of her two daughters-in-law . " Our lord , " Ying said . " What of him ? " Madame Wu asked quickly . " Flower houses , " Ying said shortly .  | " He would not ! " Madame Wu said . " He does , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , since many men do it , but what if he brings something into the house which should not be here ? " Madame Wu thought deeply for a moment . " Ask our Second Lady to come here , " she said . Ying rose , looking the bearer of important messages , and went away and Madame Wu took up her jewels and began to look at them . Every piece except the bracelets which her mother had given her at her wedding spoke of Mr. Wu . These jade ' earrings he had given her the morning after their wedding night to signify his pleasure in her . These emerald rings he had brought from a foreign shop in Shanghai , and she had never seen emeralds before . This diamond bird he had brought another time from Hong Kong , and she had not seen diamonds . The rubies he had brought from a distant province and the jade hair ornaments from Yunnan . There were small bits which had caught her own fancy when jewelers came to the house at her command . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of silver filigree and pale jade made her remember the night when the women had caught moths and impaledthem on the door . She sat turning a pin over and over in her hand . It was filigree from Canton , very fine and quivering with delicacy . The antennae were hair-fine silver wires tipped with pinpointsof jade , and they trembled as though the moth were alive . At this moment Ch'iuming came in . She was heavy with child now , and her face had changed . Her eyes were larger and her mouth more red . Madame Wu held out the moth pins . " I will give these to you , " she said . " I use them no more . " Ch'iuming put out her hand and took the pins and examined them silently . " They are too fine for me , " she said . " I would not know how to wear them . " " Nevertheless keep them , " Madame Wu said . She turned over the jewels in the box with her forefinger . She had the wish to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this she knew she must not . Then she saw two flowers made of rubies and pearls . The jewels were round and not polished too finely . " These too , " she said . " Take them . They will look well in your ears . I suppose he gives you jewels ? " " No , " Ch'iuming said slowly . " But I do not want jewels . " P190Madame Wu took her little pipe and filled it and puffed it twice and laid it down again . A soft morsel of ash fell out on the table , and Ch'iuming leaned forward and brushed it into her hand . " Now , " Madame Wu said , " does he go to flower houses ? " Ch'iuming 's face flushed red . " I hear he does , " she said simply . " But he does not tell me . " " Can you not see for yourself ? " Madame Wu inquired . " What is the measure of his feeling for you ? " Ch'iuming looked down . " It is toy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Because I can not love him . " These words she said with a sad firmness . Madame Wu heard them , and then to her amazement she felt a great pity for Mr. Wu . " Between you and me , " she said , " we have dealt him evil , I with my age , you with your youth . Have you tried to love him ? " Ch'iuming lifted her dark , honest eyes . " Oh , yes , I have , " she said simply . " Is it not my duty ? " " It is your duty , indeed , " Madame Wu retorted . " So I know it to be , " Ch'iuming said . Then she added with the same humble sadness , " I obey him in everything . That at least I do . " " Does he know you do not love him ? " Madame Wu asked next . " Yes , for he asked me and I told him , " Ch'iuming said . " Ah , alas , that you should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen if all women spoke so truthfully to men ? " " I am stupid , " Ch'iuming said . " So he goes to flower houses , " Madame Wu mused . Then she sighed heavily . " Well , there is no end to trouble between man and woman . When is the child to be born ? " " Next month , " Ch'iuming said . " Are you glad ? " Madame Wu asked her abruptly . Ch'iuming , whenever she did not speak , fell always into the same pose , her hands clasped loosely on her lap , her eyes downcast , her shoulders drooping . When she was spoken to her hands tightened and she lifted her eyelids . " It will give me something of my own in this house , " she said , and looked down again . It seemed to Madame Wu that there was nothing more to be learned from her . " Go back , " she said . " I will speak to him and see where his heart is . " Ch'iuming rose with her patient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment she came back again and held out her hand . Thep191jewels shone on her brown palm . " I forgot to thank you for these , " she said . " Do not thank me , " Madame Wu replied . " Wear them and that will be my thanks . " " I do thank you , Elder Sister , " Ch'iuming said and again she was gone . That day Madame Wu sent her excuses to Brother Andre , and in the late evening before the night meal she sent Ying to Mr. Wu to announce her coming . He received this message and himself came to her immediately . " Let me come to you , Mother of my sons , " he said courteously . She was surprised to see that he was thinner and less ruddy than he had been , and she blamed herself again . She rose and greeted him and they sat down , and the more she looked at him the more her own anxiety grew . He did not look well . His eyes , always so bright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were pale . " You look ill , " she said . " Are you ill ? " " Not at all , " he replied . " But you are not well , " she insisted . " Well enough , " he replied . " The Second Lady ? " she inquired . He put up his hand . " She does her best for me . " " But she is not good enough for you . " Mr. Wu looked embarrassed . " I tell you , Mother of my sons , it is difficult for a young woman . You see , I am not so young . " She decided to seize the truth by the neck . " But I hear you visit flower houses , " she said . He shrugged and did not look a whit ashamed . " I go with old Fang sometimes , yes , " he admitted . " You see , it is easier simply to buy women without expecting them to love . Well , there is no pretense . The difficult thing is this pretense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so love you . Now with this second one  --  I can not either love or not love  --  " He continued to rub his head and looked dazed . " It is better simply to go to a flower house . " " But next month your child is to be born , " she reminded him . " Yes , well , " he rubbed his head again in the puzzled fashion . " The strange thing is , I do not feel it is mine . After all , you and I , we have the four boys . " " It seems to me then that this Ch'iuming is no use in the house , " she said after a little time .  |p192He  rubbed his head again . " Well , no , perhaps she is not , " he agreed . " I think you have not treated her well , " she said severely . He looked apologetic . " I am very kind to her . " " You have given her no gifts , " she declared . He looked surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I forget her continually . " Madame Wu was impatient . " Tell me , what is it you want of a woman ? " He looked somewhat embarrassed . " What woman ? " he asked . " Any woman , " she said . Mr. Wu felt her impatience and , being anxious always to please her , he put his mind on the matter . " Well , " he said , " I  --  " He felt he had begun badly and so he began again . " It is not so much what I want of a woman . It is what I  --  want . That is to say , I like to laugh  --  you know that . I like to hear something interesting  --  you used to tell me many interesting things . And you know I used to laugh at many things you told me . Well , all that  --  " He trailed off with this vagueness . " I can not go on amusing you forever , " she said sharply . " No , of course not , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go to the flower houses . " " What happens there ? " Madame Wu asked . She was surprised to feel curiosity in herself . " Nothing much , " he said . " We usually have something to eat and drink . We gamble while the girls play lutes or something . " " Girls ? " she repeated . " How many are there ? " " Five  --  six  --  whoever is free , " he said . " Kang and I  --  Well , we are kindhearted and they usually  --  " His voice trailed off once more . " And then ? " she inquired . He began again with some effort . " Well , then , you see , the evening goes very quickly . The girls are full of stories and tricks . " He was unconsciously smiling . " And do you stay all night ? " she inquired . " Not usually , " he said evasively . She studied his bland face . There were lines in it , and she did not like them . The youthfulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sighed and felt her impatience increase . " Would you like to bring one of these flower girls into the house ? " she asked abruptly . " I would not approve it , but I ask your will . " P193He looked surprised . " Why should I ? " he asked . " You really go there just to play , " she declared . " Perhaps , " he agreed . " How childish you are ! " " I am not as clever as you , Ailien , " he said with humility . " I could never read books . And now there is not much I need to do . Liangmo manages everything . Even with Tsemo and Fengmo gone , he can manage . I am not much needed . " He paused , and then he said with the humility which somehow she could not endure , " If there is anything you think I should do , I will do it . I want to do anything I should do . " She had nothing to say . It was true that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , handsome and kind and willing and childlike , and she had no heart to reproach him . When they parted she saw with sadness that he was cheerful again because they had talked together . She knew that as long as she lived she could not be free from him . Through her body he had entered into her soul , too . It was not enough that she had never loved him . Love had nothing to do with responsibility . " Oh , Heaven , " Madame Wu cried in a sort of strange agony , " am I to be responsible forever for him ? " She felt the wings of her soul , poised and widespread , now droop and falter earthward again . BuT Mr. Wu went direct from Madame Wu to the flower house to which she had objected . He had first followed Mr. Kang there somewhat against his will and certainly against his conscience . Then he had dealt with both and had come off the victor . His will had yielded entirely so that now he looked forward to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion and temporary silence . Ch'iuming he did not understand . She was not as wise as Madame Wu , whom he steadfastly adored as a priest might adore the Kwanyin whom he daily served . Ch'iuming was neither goddess nor woman . When he treated her as a goddess , she was bewildered . Besides , she was not quite a goddess . When he treated her as a woman , he felt P194he shocked her , and then he was confused and could proceed no further . Matters had come to such a pass between them that he did not know how to treat her , and so he left her alone . The experience had made him more than ever adore Madame Wu who had been able , as he now perceived , to be alternately goddess and woman , but never the two at the same time . But , since she resolutely refused to return to being a woman , and was apparently to be continuallya goddess , he had been reduced to finding a woman elsewhere . This he had found in the person of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flowers on the Street of the Blind Lute Player . The house was an old one , outwardly a teahouse , but also a gambling place and a brothel . The girls were always clean and young and cheerful . Mr. Rang assured him that he had for years been a client there and had never found any other sort of girl in it . Moreover , the place made a policy of not being grasping . If a man wished only to look at a girl while he ate and drank , it was possible not to be corn . mitted further . If he wished her only as a companion for a guest , that too could be . Indeed , to purchase more took some arrangement , for there was always a waiting list of clients . But it had not been hard for Mr. Wu to ascend this list at once , thanks to his position as the head of a great family . Now he entered the gaily decorated hall with an air of a familiar and was greeted on all sides . The proprietor called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasmine that Mr. Wu is here . " Mr. Wu proceeded amiably to an inner room and was at once served with tea and then in a few minutes with wine and a bowl of small dumplings by way of light refreshments . He ate these , and before he was half through Jasmine came into the room . She had been perfuming her long black hair when she was called , and now she came in with it in two coils over her ears . Since she was named Jasmine , she used the same flower scent and made the most of it , so that the scent became her own , and she had usually one or two of those flowers tucked into the coils of her hair . Her face was powdered almost a pure white , and her lips were red and her eyes round and very dark . She was plump and her lips were always smiling . She came running in on her little feet and perched on the arm of Mr. Wu 's chair and rubbed her scented cheek against his . He pretended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am hungry , " she whimpered . He dipped his porcelain spoon into the dumpling P195soup and fed it to her gravely , and she leaned forward like a child to receive it . Between them in silence they finished the food , and he pushed his chair from the table and she slipped to his knee . " What have you been doing today ? " Mr. Wu inquired . She examined her scarlet fingernails . " Oh  --  waiting for you  --  that is all I do . " " I can not be here all the time , " Mr. Wu said . " I have business . I am a man of affairs . I have the shops and the markets and the lands all to superintend . They can do nothing without me . " " You work too hard , " she complained . " It seems to me your sons ought to help you . " " Oh , my sons , " he grumbled , " they think only of themselves and their own families . Two of them have actually gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries , but I can not trust everything to him . " He enjoyed the pressure of her round little body against his shoulder . He liked the jasmine scent of her hair . Even her breath was scented . He remembered Madame Wu 's question . Did he want to bring her into the house ? Left to himself , certainly it would be a pleasure , but he could not persuade himself to add to the house of his ancestors a flower girl . The shade of his father forbade it . As though she knew his thoughts , Jasmine nestled closer and slipped her arm about his neck . " I wish I could come and live with you , " she said . " I would be very good . I would not trouble any of the great ladies . I would stay by myself all the time until you came . " " No , no , " he said hastily . " I do n't want you there . I like to come out of the house and visit you here . If you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of it , and I would have nowhere to go for my own pleasure . A man must be himself somewhere . " She was quite ready for this . She had an old mother who had been a flower girl in her youth , and had taught her to take care of herself . " A concubine , if possible , " old Lotus had said , " but if not that , then a house of your own . " " Could n't you buy a little house for me , Mr. Wu ? " she asked . " I would never let any man come in but you , and I would wait for you all day and all night . Then you could be yourself whenever you liked . " Mr. Wu had already considered this possibility . He did not like the assurance with which his name was now called out when he came to this house of flowers . He was , after all , the head of the house of Wu and a man higher than any among the gentry of the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how was he to ask her for so large a sum as it would require to take a house for Jasmine ? " You see , my small flower , " he said tenderly , " my sons ' mother is a wonderful woman . She keeps the accounts . What would I tell her ifI wanted to take a house for you ? " " Could n't you sell a piece of your land and not tell her ? " Jasmineasked . She sat up and looked at him pleadingly . She had a childishlittle voice that went straight into his heart . " I have never deceived her , " Mr. Wu said , troubled . " Does she know about me ? " Jasmine asked in astonishment . " Approximately , " Mr. Wu replied . " What is approximately ? " Jasmine asked . " It means somewhat . " " How can she know somewhat ? " Jasmine asked again . " Either sheknows or she does n't know . " " Let us then say she knows , " Mr. Wu replied . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't . " Jasmine tried again . She hid her face on his shoulder . " I am afraidI have happiness in me , " she whispered . " That is why I want thehouse . I ca n't have a child here . " Mr. Wu was alarmed . He took her from his knee and set her on herfeet , and she stood there before him , her hands over her face . " Now , " he said sternly , " there were others before me . You were no virgin , young as you are . " She took her hands from her face . The powder was undisturbed . " But my amah can prove to you that there have been none since you came , and this is within the last three months . You came beforethat . " She turned away and wiped her eyes with the edges of her sleeves . " Never mind . " Her childish voice was sad . " It is my fate . Girls like me  --  sometimes it happens in spite of ourselves . Especially when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Had she insisted , had she demanded , he would have risen and goneaway perhaps never to return . But his heart was soft . " Now , " he said , " whether it is my fault or not , you know there areways of purging yourself . Here is something to help you . " He put his hand in his purse , but she would not take the money heheld out to her . She pushed his hand away with her two little ones . " No , please , " she said . " I will bear the child . I want to bear him . " " You must not , " Mr. Wu insisted . P197They were interrupted at this moment by loud cries from the outer room . " Mr. Wu , Mr. Wu ! " the proprietor was shouting . The door burst open . Mr. Wu saw his own servant , Peng Er . " Master , Master ! " Peng Er cried , " you are wanted at home . The Second Lady has hanged herself from the old pomegranate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muttered . He leaped to his feet and strode away , leaving jasmine in the middle of the floor looking after him and frowning with anger . The commotion of his own house rose over the walls of the compoundand met him on the street . Priests had been called , and they were beating their gongs and crying for the lost soul of Ch'iuming . He ran through the open gate where no one stood to watch and hastened into the Peony Court . There the priests were , and there the whole household had gathered to wail and to weep and to call Ch'iuming 's name . He pushed through them , and in the midst of them upon the flags of the court she lay . Madame Wu knelt beside her and held her head on her arm . But Ch'iuming 's pale face hung over Madame Wu 's arm as though she was wholly lifeless . " Is she dead ? " Mr. Wu shouted . " We can find no life in her , " Madame Wu replied . " I have sent for the foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not him ? " At this very moment Brother Andre appeared , and the crowd dividedbefore him like a sea before a wind . The other priests were silent in jealousy . In the center of this silence , Brother Andre fell to his knees and thrust a needle into Ch'iuming 's arm and held it there . " I do not ask what you do , " Madame Wu said to him . " I know whatever it is , it is wise . " " A stimulant , " Brother Andre said . " But it may be too late . " He put the needle away so quickly that no one saw it except Mr. and Mrs. Wu . But it was not too late . Ch'iuming 's lips quivered . While they watched , her eyelids fluttered . Madame Wu sighed . " Ah , she is alive . Then the child is alive . " " But why did she hang herself P " Mr. Wu exclaimed . " Let us not ask until she can tell us , " Madame Wu replied . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them well , Father of my sons . Let them think they were successful so that they will go away and we can have peace . " Mr. Wu obeyed her and called out to the priests and led them away to the outer court . The women of the family remained , the elderP198cousins to commend the priests , and Meng and Rulan and Linyi to gaze quietly down into the face of Ch'iuming , whom they scarcely knew even while she was here in their own house . She was of their generation and yet linked to the older ones , and they could not be free with her , and so they had forgotten her . But by this act she had brought herself nearer to them . She was unhappy , she did not want to belong to the elders . In each young woman 's heart an interest arose in Ch'iuming , and this interest was mingled with pity in Meng 's heart , with curiosity in Linyi 's , and with revolt in Rulan 's . Each determined in her own way to know Ch'iumingand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time for any of these feelings , for as Ch'iuming came to herself it became clear that her child was to be born too early . She must be carried in to her bed and the midwife sent for . These things were done , and Brother Andre was about to go away when Ch'iuming spoke . " Did I see the foreign priest ? " she whispered . " He is about to go away , " Madame Wu said . She stood by the bed of fecundity while the women servants made Ch'iuming ready for the birth . " Tell him to come here  --  only for a moment , " Ch'iuming begged . Madame Wu was surprised . She did not know that Ch'iuming knew the tall foreigner . But since the girl was still so near death , she did not dare deny her . She went herself and stayed Brother Andre as he was about to leave . " She asks for you , " she said . " For a moment come in . " So Brother Andre turned , and he stooped his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where Ch'iuming lay in the huge bed . Mr. Wu stayed behind . He was suddenly stiff with embarrassment . To what a pass had he brought the household ! He did not doubt that Ch'iuming had hung herself because of jasmine . In her silent way she had protested with her life . When Brother Andre leaned over the bedside Ch'iuming spoke , but in so faint a voice he could not hear her . He leaned closer over her , and these were the words he then heard : " If a girl is born , I give it to you when I die  --  It is only a found-ling . " " How can a foundling be born in this house ? " he inquired gently . " But I am only a foundling , " she said , " and this is the child of a foundling . " P199With that she closed her eyes and gave herself up to pain . He went away with a grave face and told no one what she had said , and so low was her voice that no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl was born to Ch'iuming , a creature so small that Madame Wu took her and wrapped her in a cotton fleece and put her into her bosom to keep her alive . Then she went quickly into her own courts , leaving Ch'iuming to the midwife and to Ying , and in her own room she put the child into her bed and lay down beside her to keep her warmed . A woman servant came in to see what was needed . " Heat bricks and bring them here , " Madame Kang said . " This child is a bud that must be carefully opened . " " Oh , Mistress , " the woman said , " why not let her die ? A girl  --  and what can she grow into but a sickly thing to make trouble in the house ? " " Obey me , " Madame Wu said . The woman went muttering away and Madame Wu looked at the little creature . She was still breathing . Two days later Brother Andre told Madame Wu of Ch'iuming 's strange request . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being too young , but she had swallowed a few drops of mother 's milk put into her mouth with a spoon . Ch'iuming 's milk had come , although she was too weak to speak . Even when Madame Wu told her that the child was alive , she had not answered . " Certainly the child is not a foundling , " Madame Wu said to Brother Andre , with dignity . " She has been born into our house . " " I knew you would say that , " he replied , " and you are right . But why does this young mother say she is a foundling ? " " She was , until she came here , " Madame Wu replied . She hesitated , and then to her own wonder she found herself telling Brother Andre what she had never told him , how it was she who had brought Ch'iuminginto this house . Brother Andre listened , his eyes downcast , his great hands clasped on his knees . She never saw those hands without wondering why they were so calloused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands so calloused ? " He was accustomed to her changes . " Because I till the land for the children 's food , " he said , He did not move his hands from under her gaze . P200She went on with her story , her eyes on his hands . " I suppose since you are a priest , you can not understand either man or woman , " she said when her whole story was told . " Being priest , I can understand both man and woman , " he said . " Then tell me what I have clone that is wrong . " She lifted her eyes from his hands to his face and wondered that out of all the world she had chosen to open her entire heart to a foreigner who had been born in some country across the sea whose waters and winds she would never know . He answered her : " You have not considered that man is not entirelyflesh , and that even such a man as your husband must be in communion with God . You have treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclaimed . " But I have thought of nothing but his wel-fare . " " You have considered only the filling of his stomach and the softnessof his bed , " Brother Andre said plainly . " And even worse than this , you have bought a young woman as you would buy a pound of pork . But a woman , any woman , is more than that , and of all women you should know it . You have been guilty of three sins . " " Guilty ? " she repeated . " You have despised your husband , you have held in contempt a sister woman , and you have considered yourself unique and above all women . These sins have disturbed your house . Without knowing why , your sons have been restless and their wives unhappy , and in spite of your plans no one is happy . What has been your purpose , Madame ? " Confronted by his clear calm eyes , she trembled . " Only to be free , " she faltered . " I thought , if I did my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you mean by freedom ? " he inquired . " Very little , " she said humbly . " Simply to be mistress of my own person and my own time . " " You ask a great deal for yourself , " he replied . " You ask every-thing . " She felt nearer to tears than she had felt in many years . He had shattered the calm core of her being , her sense of rightness in herself , and she was frightened . If in this house she , upon whom all had so long depended , had been wrong and was wrong , then what would happen to them all ?   " What shall I do ? " she asked in a small voice . " Forget your own self , " he said . " But all these years , " she urged , " I have so carefully fulfilled my duty . " " Always with the thought of your own freedom in your mind , " he said . She could not deny it . She sat motionless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Direct me , " she said at last . " Instead of your own freedom , think how you can free others , " he said gently . She lifted her head . " From yourself , " he said still gently . She had never been a religious woman , and now she looked at him in some doubt . " Are you speaking out of your foreign religion ? If son I can not understand it . " " I am not speaking out of a foreign religion , " he . said . " Do you want me to be a nun ? " she exclaimed . " I do not want you to be anything , " he replied tranquilly . He rose to his great height , smiled down at her according to his habit , and went away without farewell . This , which in another would have seemed rudeness , simply gave to Madame Wu the feeling that there was no break between this time they had spent together and the next time , whenever that would be . She did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor the pattern of the latticed windows was fixed in a lacework of shadows and sunshine . The air was still and cool , but the room was not cold . A great brazier of coals stood in front of the table set against the centerof the inner wall , and out of the coals , smothered with ashes , colorless quivering rays of heat shone in the air . Nothing , she reflected , was as easy as she had thought . Freedom was not a matter of arrangement . She had seen freedom hanging like a peach upon a tree . She had nurtured the tree , and when it bore she had seized upon the fruit and found it green . She sighed , and then she heard Ch'iuming 's little child cry in the next room , and she went to it and took it into her arms and carried it into the room and sat down by the brazier . Whether it was the warmth or whether it was the feeling of support of her arms , some comfort came into the child , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face .   " I do not love this child , " Madame Wu thought . " Perhaps I have never loved any child . Perhaps that is my trouble , that I have never been able to love anyone . " But it was like her that without love she held the child carefully , and when Ying came in and took her she superintended her feeding again and was even pleased that the child ate her food heartily . Watching this , she said to Ying , " Give me back the child and I will take her to her mother . She will live , this small woman , and she will hold her mother to life . " So a little later she carried the child in her own arms through the sunshine and into her old courts and into the room where Ch'iuming lay on the big bed whose curtains were still hung with the symbols of fecundity . Ch'iuming lay with her eyes closed and her lips pressed together . She was intensely pale . Upon the silk coverlet , her hands lay open and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When she came they had been rough and strong with work , but now they were thin and white . " Here is your child , " Madame Wu said gently . " She has eaten so well that she is strong enough to come and lie on your arm . " When Ch'iuming did not move , Madame Wu lifted her arm and put the child into its circle and covered it with the quilt . Ch'iuming 's arm tightened . She opened her eyes . " You must forgive me that I did not repay you with a son , " she said humbly . " Do I not know that sons and daughters alike come from Heaven ? " Madame Wu replied . " Besides , in these days daughters , too , are good . " Then she remembered what Brother Andre said , and she went on quickly , " You must not feel that you have a duty to me . You have none . " Ch'iuming looked surprised at this . " But why else am I here ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It has been shown me that I did you a great wrong , my sister . It is true that you were brought here as I might have bought a pound of pork . How could I dare so to behave toward a human being ? I see now that I had no thought for your soul . What can I do to make amends ? " She said this in her pretty voice , neither lifting nor deepening it , and Ch'iuming 's face grew frightened . " But where shall I go ? " she stammered . Madame Wu saw that Ch'iuming had altogether failed to under- P203stand her , and that she thought that she was being told courteously , in the way of the rich and the great , that she was useless and not wanted . " I do not want you to go anywhere , " Madame Wu said . " I am only saying that I have done wrong to you . Let me put it thus : If you had your own way , if there were no one to consider @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How can there be no one to consider ? " Ch'iuming asked , perplexed . " There is our lord and there is you . And beyond you two honorable ones , there is the whole family . " " Why did you ask the foreign priest to take your child if you died ? " Madame Wu asked . " I did not want to trouble you with a girl , " Ch'iuming said . " Why did you try to die before your destiny day ? " Madame Wu asked again . " Because Ying told me she saw from my shape that I would give birth to a girl , and so I said , in my heart , we will both go together and be no trouble to anybody . " " Death can be a trouble as well as life , " Madame Wu said . " Not mine , " Ch'iuming replied innocently , " for I am of no worth to anyone . " To this Madame Wu had no answer . She rose , feeling for the momententirely helpless . " Give up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ die , it would be a great trouble to bring up this child , and you know that I have never been one of those who think a female child can be allowed to die . " " You are good , " Ch'iuming said , and she closed her eyes again . The tears crept out from under her eyelids . This Madame Wu saw , but she saw also that Ch'iuming 's arm now held the child very tightly , and so she took it for a good sign and went away . When she was crossing the courtyard she met Mr. Wu coming in from the street . They came face to face without expecting it , and she perceived instantly that he had been doing something which she would not approve , for his face flushed and a light sweat broke out on his forehead . " Mother of my sons ! " he exclaimed . " I have just been in to see our Second Lady , " she said amiably . " We must think about her case . She tried to die because she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two of them would be a burden in the house . "   " How foolish ! " he exclaimed . " As if we were common people , who consider one mouth more or less ! " " I will turn back with you , " Madame Wu said . " I have need of your wisdom . " They went back together and came into the large square room where they had spent so many hours in their common life . Beyond them was the bedroom where Ch'iuming lay with her child on her arm , but there was no danger of their being overheard . Above them the roof rose into high beamed spaces and swallowed any human voice . " Now we have this life in our house , " Madame Wu said , " what shall we do with her , and the one she has brought ? For I see that she is not to your heart . Yet here she is . I must apologize to you . " Mr. Wu looked uncomfortable . He had put on one fur robe too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning , and he went easily hot in any discomfort , even in winter . " I feel ashamed that I  --  after your thoughtfulness  --  " he stammered . " Well , she is good enough . But you know how it is . Goodness is excellentin a woman . But  --  " " I was very selfish , " she said simply . She sat in her usual pose with her hands folded on her lap . She did not look at him . Instead she gazed thoughtfully at the shadows on the floor . They were now of the winter bamboo which stood about the sunlit open door , and the arrowy leaves danced in the wind . She thought of Brother Andre , and suddenly she understood what he had meant . She could never be free until she had offered herself up utterly , and this she could only do by taking upon herself the thing which she most hated . " I see my wrong , " she said , without lifting her eyes . " Let it all be as you wish . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will return . We will forget , you and I , these last months . " She waited for his welcoming cry , but it did not come . When the silence grew sharp she looked up and saw his ruddy face now streamingwith sweat . He laughed with misery when he saw her looking at him and snatched open his collar , and pulled out his silk handkerchief and wiped his face . " Had I known , " he gasped , " had I dreamed  --  " An ice-cold pressure crept into her heart . He did not want hero What she had heard was true . He had found someone else for himself . " Tell me about her , " she said gently . Halting and stammering , with grunts of embarrassed laughter , he P205told her that he wondered if he should not now put Jasmine into a separate house . She was young , she was childish . " I do not want to add to your cares under this roof , " he said . She opened her long and lovely eyes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she asked in her most silvery voice . " Let her come and live under your own roof . Why should your house be divided ? " He rose and went over to her and took her hand . It lay in his plump palm , cool and limp . " You are a good woman , " he said solemnly . " It is not given to every man to have what he wants and at the same time to live in peace under his own roof . " She smiled and took her hand away . But long after they had parted she was amazed at the coldness in the pleasure she had felt . For her to choose a woman to take her place was one thing . To have him choose a woman was quite another . She marveled at the tangle that life could make between a man and a woman . She had thought herself free of him because she did not love him . But she was not free of him if when she knew his love had ceased she could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She thought always and only of her self . " How shall I be rid of myself ? " she asked Brother Andre " Think only of others , " he replied . " Does that mean I am always to yield to others ? " she asked . " If not to yield means that you are thinking of yourself , you must yield , " he said . " My sons ' father wants to bring another woman into the house , " she said . " Am I to yield to that ? " " It was your sin that brought the first woman here , " he said . She was angry at this in her fashion . A gust of sharp temper flew like a sudden small whirlwind out of her heart . " Now you speak like a priest , " she said maliciously . " You can have no understanding of what it is to be compelled to yield your body to a man year after year , without your will . " She felt in herself a strange desire to make him share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " To give one 's delicate body to indelicate hands , to see lust grow hot and feel one 's own flesh grow cold  --  to feel the heart grow faint and the mind sick , and yet to be compelled , for the sake of peace in the house . " His face was pure and unchanged . " There are many ways in which the body may be offered up a sacrifice for the soul , " he said . P206She sighed . " Shall I allow this second woman to come in ? " " Is it not better to have her under this roof with your consent than under another without ? " he replied . " I never thought a foreign priest would give me such advice , " she said with new malice . She opened her book without further talk , and under his direction she studied the poetry of the I Icbrew Psalms . She was deeply moved as the hour went on by what she discerned they were . Here the humanheart cried out after that which it could worship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life and death had meaning because they were created and planned by Heaven ? " Is our Heaven your God , and is your God our Heaven ? " she inquired . " They are one and the same , " he replied . " But Little Sister Hsia told me they are not , " she retorted . " She always told us to believe on the one true God , and not in our Heaven . She declared them not the same . " " In a temple there are always a few foolish ones , " he said gently . " There is only one true God . He has many names . " " Then anywhere upon the round earth , by whatever seas , those who believe in any God believe in the One ? " she asked . " And so are brothers , " he said , agreeing . " And if I do not believe in any ? " she inquired willfully . " God is patient , " he said . " God waits . Is there not eternity ? " She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it did not begin in him , and it did not end in her . They seemed only to transmit it , from the ends of the earth to the ends of the earth . " Heaven is patient , " she repeated . " Heaven waits . " Upon these words they parted . Brother Andre tied his books into a worn black kerchief and put them under his arm . She stood at the door of the library watching him as he walked across the court . His great form was beginning to stoop , as though his grizzled head were a burden upon the vast shoulders . Or , she told herself , perhaps it was because more and more he walked with his eyes fixed upon the path just ahead of him . Seldom did he lift his head to see what lay at the end of the road . She turned and went back into the library as her habit was when the lessons were over . She sat sometimes for as much as an hour to fix in her mind the things which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had read together , to look at the pictures he had left , to consider the words he had spoken . But this day she had scarcely sat an hour when she heard loud voices shouting in the outer courtyards , and she lifted her head to listen . Whatever it was , Ying would bring her the message of it . In less than the framing of her thought she saw Ying come running into her court . She was wailing and crying and she threw her apron over her face and wept . Madame Wu rose at once , and the book she had been holding dropped to the floor . Something very evil had come about . She thought of Liangmo , her eldest son . But this morning he had left the house as usual . She thought of Mr. Wu . Then Ying was on the threshold . She pulled the apron from her face and cried out , " Alas  --  the foreign priest ! " " What of him ? " Madame Wu asked sharply . " He left here but a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street , " Ying cried . " His skull is cracked open ! " " Struck down ? " Madame Wu 's voice was an echo . " It is those young men , " Ying sobbed . " The Green Band  --  the evil ones ! They were robbing the moneylender 's shop , and the priest saw the moneylender crying and cursing Heaven , and he stopped to save him and the young men came out and beat him over the head , too . " Madame Wu had scarcely heard the name of the Green Band . But she knew that those were young ruffians who roamed the country roads and the city streets . The land steward had always on the bills an item , " For fee to the Green Band . " " Where is Brother Andre ? " she exclaimed . " They have carried him into his own house and he lies on his bed , but the gatekeeper is here and says he asks for you , " Ying said . " I must go , " Madame Wu said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will order the bearers , " Ying cried . " No , there is no time , " Madame Wu said . " I will take a ricksha at the gate . " All the house knew a few minutes later that Madame Wu had for the first time in her life gone to a place which was strange to her , the house of the foreign priest . She sat erect in the ricksha , and behind the runner 's back she said , " I will pay you double if you double your usual speed . " " Triple me and I will triple my speed , " he cried over his shoulder . P208Far behind her Ying came in a second ricksha , but for once MadameWu did not think of what people might say . She had the one thing in her mind , that she must somehow reach his side in time to hear his voice speak once more and give her direction for the rest of her life . So she stepped out at the plain unpainted wooden gate set in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within . An old woman waited , weeping . " Where is our elder brother ? " she asked . The old woman turned and led her into a low brick house , through an open door , across a court filled with crowding , sobbing children , into a room . There upon a narrow bamboo bed Brother Andre lay . Ragged men and women from the streets were standing about him . They parted to let Madame Wu come to his bedside and , as though he felt her presence , he opened his eyes . His head was rudely bandaged in a coarse white towel , and the blood was running from under it down his cheek and soaking the pillow under his head . " I am here , " she said . " Tell me what I must do . " For a long moment he could not speak . He was dying . She could see the emptiness at the bottom of his dark eyes , and then she saw his will gather there in light . His lips parted , his breast rose in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Feed my lambs , " he said distinctly . Then she saw death come . The breath ceased , the eyelids flickered , the will withdrew . His great body shuddered , and he flung out his hands so that they hung over the sides of the bed and struck upon the cold brick floor . She stooped and picked up his right hand , and a ragged man stepped forward and took up his left , and they stood holding these two hands . She stared across the body into the man 's eyes . He was nothing , nobody , a servant , a beggar . He looked at her timidly and put down Brother Andre 's hand gently on the stilled breast , and she laid the right one over it . The children came running into the room and swarmed about the bed that was now a bier , all crying and calling , " Father  --  father ! " She saw that they were all girls , the eldest not more than fifteen , and the older ones were carrying little ones who could not walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their little hands , and stroked his beard , and they took the edges of their coats and wiped the blood from his face , and they kept on crying .   " Who are you ? " she asked in a strange quiet voice . " We are his lambs , " they cried in a disorderly chorus . " Strays , " the ragged man said . " He picked the little ones up from outside the city wall where they are thrown . The big ones are runawayslaves . He took in anybody . " She wanted to weep alone and for herself because he was dead . But the children were flinging themselves upon him , their arms wrapping him . " Oh , he 's cold , " a little girl sobbed . The tears were shining on her cheeks . She held his hand to her wet cheek . " His hand is so cold . " Madame Wu stood immobile in the midst of this strange family . Then it occurred to her that she did not yet know all that had happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked in a low voice . The ragged man beat his breast . " It was I. I saw him fall . Everyone on the street was frightened . The Green Robbers ran when they saw him dying . The moneylender put up his shutters and went into his house . But I am only a beggar , and what have I to fear ? This foreign priest often gave me a little money , especially in winter . And sometimes he brought me home into this house at night and I slept here until morning , and he gave me food . " " You carried him here ! " she said . " These brother beggars and I , " he said . She saw half a dozen ragged fellows . " He is too big for one or two to carry . " She looked down on Brother Andre 's peaceful face . She had come , hoping for a few words for herself . Instead he had said , " Feed my lambs . " Here were all these children . She looked at them , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children they watched her , transferring their hopefulness from Brother Andre 's silent figure to her motionless but living frame . " What shall I do with you ? " she said uncertainly . " Lady , what did our father tell you to do ? " a thin little girl asked anxiously . She held a fat cheerful baby in her arms . Madame Wu could only answer the truth . " He said I was to feed you , " she said . The children looked at one another . The thin little girl shifted the baby to the other arm . " Have you enough food for us all ? " she asked gravely . " Yes , " Madame Wu said . Still she continued to stand , looking at the little girls .   " There are twenty of us , " the little thin girl said . " I am fifteen years old  --  at sixteen he provides for us . " " Provides for you ? " Madame Wu repeated . The old woman had come in now . " At sixteen he finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were speaking as if the big quiet figure on the bed was still alive . Madame Wu looked at Brother Andre . His eyes were closed , and his hands were folded on his breast . " Come away from this room , " she said abruptly . " All of you ! Leave him in peace . " They went out obediently , beggars and children and the old woman , and only she was left . At the door Ying stood stiffly . " Go away , Ying , " Madame Wu said . " I will stand outside the door , " Ying replied . Madame Wu closed the door . What she was doing would cause gossip . Why should a lady wish to be alone with a foreign priest even when he was dead ? She did not care . He was neither foreign nor a priest to her now . He was the only being she had ever met whom she worshiped . Old Gentleman had taught her much . But Old Gentleman had feared many things . Brother Andre feared no one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of him as a man when he was alive , but now that he was dead she saw him as a man lying dead . In his youth he must have been extremely beautiful . His great body lying outstretched before her had the proportions of majesty . His skin was pale and in death was growing translucently clear . Suddenly she recognized him . " You whom I love ! " she murmured in profound astonishment . This recognition she made , and in the instant she accepted it she felt her whole being change . Although she did not move , her body tingled , her blood stung her heart , and her brain was clear . Her whole frame grew light and strong . She lifted her head and looked about the room . The four walls stood , but she felt free and whole . Upon his bier the body lay as it had since he died , but now looking down upon it she knew that he had escaped it . She was skeptic to the soul . Not in years had she entered a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had cleansed her of the superstition common to women , and Old Gentleman had finished the work . She did not now believe in an unseen God , but she knew certainly that this man continued .   " Andre . " She said his name to him in a low clear voice , and never again would she call him brother . " You live in me . I will do my utmostto preserve your life . " The moment she had said these words peace welled up in her being . It was so profound , so quieting , so contenting , that for the first time in her life she knew that never before had she known what peace was . Standing motionless in the bare room before his shell , she felt happy . Nor was this happiness a trance . It was an energy which began to work in her mind and in her body . There were certain things which she must do that now became perfectly plain to her . His dead body must be buried , not with priests and prayers . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself would do . Then simply she would continue to do whatever he had been doing . She went tranquilly from the room and into the other room where Ying and the old woman , the beggars and the children were waiting . She sat down on one of the wooden chairs . " Now as to his funeral , " she said . " Did he leave any directions ? " They looked at one another . The children were awed and said nothing . The old woman sobbed and wiped her eyes with her apron . " Certainly he never thought of dying , " she exclaimed , " nor did we think of such a thing as his death . " " Does he have relatives anywhere ? " Madame Wu asked . " If so , I suppose we should send his body to them . " No one knew of relatives . He had simply come here an unknown number of years ago and had never gone away again . " Did he get letters ? " Madame Wu asked . " When he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He let them lie about unopened , and I took them after a while and sewed them into the children 's shoe soles . " " And did he never write letters ? " Madame Wu went on . " Never , " the old woman said . " And you , " she said to the beggar , " did he never speak to you ? " " Never of any who belonged to him , " the leader replied . " We spoke only of people in the city and the country round about who needed help in some fashion . " Madame Wu considered this . Andre belonged wholly to her . There was no other . She would buy a plain black coffin . As for the land , she would bury him in her own land . She thought of a favorite spot upon a certain hillside that circled some of the rice fields . There a P212gingko tree grew , very old , and she always rested in its shade when she went out to watch the spring planting . She rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave is dug . " The children and the old woman looked at her anxiously as she rose , and she understood their anxiety . What , they were all thinking , was to become of them ? " This house , " she said , looking about the bare rooms , " does it belong to him ? " The old woman shook her head . " It is a rented house , " she said , " and we got it very cheap because it is haunted . Nobody else wants to live in it because it is inhabited by weasels , who carry the spirit of evil ones . But evil spirits feared him , and here we have lived safely for very little cost . " " He owns nothing ? " she asked . " Nothing except two changes of garments . One he wore and one I washed . He has a few books and his cross . Once he had a very pretty image nailed to a wooden cross , and he hung it on the wall of his room above his bed . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never got another . He had a rosary , but one of the children played with it and the string broke , and he never put it together again . Some of the beads rolled away and were lost , and he said that he did not need it any more . " Madame Wu was looking about the room as the old woman talked . " What is in that black box ? " she asked , and pointed her middle finger . The old woman looked . " That is a magic voice box , " she said . " He used to listen to the voices in the night . " Madame Wu remembered that he had told her of it . She approached the box and put her ear against it and heard nothing . " It speaks for no one else , " the old woman explained . " Ah , then we will bury it with him , " Madame Wu said . " There is one more thing he possesses , and it is magic , too , " the old woman said hesitatingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where is it ? " Madame Wu asked . The old woman crawled under the bed and drew out a long wooden box . She opened it , and there lay an instrument like a pipe . " He held it to his right eye whenever the night was clear and he looked into Heaven , " she said . Madame Wu knew at once that this was his means of gazing at stars . " I will take that with me , " she decided . " And now bring his P213books to me , " she said , " and let his garments and the cross be buried with him . As for this house , let it be returned to the owner . Tell him I say it is exorcised and clear now of evil . He can rent it again at a good price . " All the children clustered about the old woman and listened in breathless silence and fear . Their home was gone . They had nothing left . Madame Wu smiled down on them . She understood with a tendernesswholly new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , all of you , and you too , Old Sister , you are to come to my own house and live . " A great sigh went over the children . They were safe . With the ease and confidence of childhood they accepted their new safety and immediatelybecame excited . " When  --  when  --  " they began to clamor . " I think you should stay here with him until tomorrow , " she said . " Then we will all go to the grave together . But you will not come back here . You will come home with me . " " Good heart , " the old woman sobbed , " kind good heart ! He knows  --  be sure he knows ! " Madame Wu smiled without answering this . " Have you rice enough for their meals ? " she asked . " They will need food today and tomorrow morning . Their noon meal they will have in my house . " " He always kept a day 's food in the house , " the old woman sobbed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Then tomorrow I will come back , " Madame Wu said . She let the children press against her for a moment , knowing that they were accustomed to cluster about him and feel his bodily presence , and so they needed the same reassurance from her . Then she said gently , " Until tomorrow , my little ones , " and she left the house where his body lay dead and went out , a different creature from the woman she had been when she came in . She went back to her own court and sat long alone with her changed self . She accepted Andre 's death . If he had lived there would most certainly have come the moment when she would have discoveredthat she loved him . There could then have been only one of two choices for her . She must have made excuses never to see him again , or she must have yielded up her soul to him and told him her love. , This she knew would have parted them . She sat awake and alone for hours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put her to bed . She did not want to lie in a bed . She wanted to sit , alive , alert , alone , searching out the whole of her new knowledge . She loved a man , a foreigner , a stranger , a man who had never once put out his hand to touch hers , whose touch would have been unthinkable . She smiled into the darkness after a long time . The house was dark and silent about her , but beside her a candle burned , and her heart was speaking aloud . " Had I put out my hand to you , " she said , " would you have been afraid of me ? " But she knew Andre was afraid of no one . There was that God of his . It occurred to Madame Wu that men 's gods were enemies to women . She felt jealousy for the first time in her life . " We have no gods of our own , " she reflected . But for women true gods were impossible . She pondered on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was continuallytalking of her god . But then , Little Sister Hsia had nothing else to talk about , neither husband nor children , neither friends nor family . In this emptiness she had gone out and found for herself God . No , the only true test of woman was whether , having all else , as men did , they rejected all and went and found a god . The women whom she knew best and had known best in her whole life , not one of them had truly sought God . Not one , that is , in the way that Andre had done , when as a young man he had put aside the woman he loved and the wealth he might have had and the fame from his learning , and had simply given his life to God . She paused in her musing to consider for a moment the woman whom Andre had loved in his youth and had put aside , loving lonelinessbetter . Young she must have been and beautiful doubtless . She felt more jealousy , not that Andre had loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman should have looked upon Andre when he was young and not yet a priest . " I should like to have seen him when he was a young giant , " MadameWu thought . She sat at perfect peace , in complete stillness , her hands folded one upon the other , and her rings gleaming softly on her fingers . Yes , Andre as a young man must have been a good sight for a woman . He was handsome even in his middle age , but young he must have been himself a god . Then she felt sorry for that woman whom he had rejected . Now she was married doubtless and perhaps she had many children , for women do not die because a man will not have them , but somewhere in her heart she still thought of Andre , P215with love or with hate . If she were a woman of little heart she would hate him , and if she were of great heart she had not blamed him and so she loved him still . Or perhaps she thought of him no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and past any feeling , as women can grow to be when their hearts and bodies have been too much used . It was the weakness of a woman that heart and body were knit together , warp and woof , and when the body was too much used the heart , too , became worn , unless it had love , such as she now felt towardAndre . Death had relieved her of his body . Had he lived they might have lost their souls in the snare of the flesh . She was surprised to feel at this moment a sudden rich flush of the blood into her vitals . " I am a woman in spite of everything , " she thought with some amusement . Even the thought of Andres great body could cause this enrichment in her being . How dangerous to peace had he been before her in the flesh ! She felt an impulse of gratitude toward those robbers of the Green Band who had removed such danger . Then , noticing through the door how exquisite the moonlight was upon her orchids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel to be glad that Andre 's eyes were closed . " It is not that I am glad you are dead , " she explained to him . " It is simply that you and I are both spared a great misery and so we can keep our great joy . Doubtless you know I love you . " As she murmured these words she was conscious of his perfect understanding . Nothing less could have given her so instant a sense of complete comfort and cheerfulness . She knew that for Andre to have violated his priesthood would have caused him as much pain as her own were she to violate the duty she had to her family . They would have preached renunciation to each other , but in order to practice this , it would have been necessary for them never to meet . Now no renunciation was necessary . She could think of him as much as she liked and without danger . " But of course I am changed , " she thought . She sat , still outwardly motionless , but wondering how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to discover herself . Her heart was changed . " I am a stranger now to myself , " she thought with some astonishment . " I do not know how I shall act or how I shall feel . " For an hour after this discovery she sat in the same motionless pose . " I have no knowledge of how I shall act , " she thought . " The springs of my being are different . I shall no longer live out of duty but out of love . " This was her discovery of herself through love . P216Again she felt the strange enrichment flow through her whole being , followed by serene content . It was at this moment she thought of the instrument for stars . She had ordered it brought home with her , and now it was in the library . She went and lifted it out of its box with difficulty , for it was heavy , and she set it up on three folding legs she found also in the box . Then she peered through it at Heaven outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of stars and the moon in its path . To her disappointment , although the night was clear , she saw nothing . This way and that she tried , but Heaven was sealed to her , and with a sigh she put the instrument away again . She had not the knowledge for it . " It belongs only to him , " she thought . " I will bury it with him , together with the box of voices from the night . " Upon this decision she went to her bed and slept . The funeral was like none that had ever taken place before in this city . Madame Wu could not let it be like a family burial . But she gave it honor as the funeral of her son 's tutor . The children were dressed in white cloth , unhemmed , and the beggars who had carried Brother Andre into his house demanded mourning for themselves . Madame Wu wore no outer mourning . Now , after some thought , before the funeral she had asked whether the few other foreigners in the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hsia should know , perhaps , and certainly the foreign doctor should know . Madame Wu had never seen this foreign doctor and did not want to see him now . She had heard that such doctors went always with knives in their hands , ready to cut any who were ill . Sometimes they were clever in cutting off tumors and excrescences , but often they killed people , and there was no redress against a foreign doctor as there was against one of their own who killed instead of healing . For this reason few of the people in the city went near the foreign doctor unless they were already sure of death . She sent a message by a manservant to the few foreigners in the city , and the man came back saying that he was told that Brother Andre was a stranger to them , not being of their religion , and they would not come . The end of it was that the funeral was as Madame Wu planned it . It took place not the next day as she had first thought , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made . Working night P217and day , the coffin maker finished it in two nights and the day between ; and then early in the morning before the city was astir , Madame Wu in her sedan chair headed the procession , which came on foot behind her and Andre in his coffin . She herself had seen to the lifting of his great body into the coffin . She stood while men lifted Andre into the coffin and herself put in the voice box and the instrument for stars before the lid was nailed down . She had carried the instrument here again to his house that it might be buried with him . Thus she stood , and she did not delay by sign or word the fitting of the heavy lid . She saw him sleeping , and she yearned over him and said , nothing , and then the lid went down and she saw him no more . Neither did she weep . Why should she reveal herself through weeping ? She heard the nails pounded into the wood and saw the ropes tied to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty casket , and they carried it out into the streets and through the city gate to the western hill , and now she led the way and others followed , and under the gingko tree the hill was ready to receive him . None spoke while the coffin was lowered into the cave made for it . The children cried and the old woman wailed , but Madame Wu stood motionless and silent , and the earth was filled into the cave and the mound made . In her heart for a moment was a hard dry knot of pain that she would see him no more except as he lived forever in her memory . When all was done , Madame Wu led the procession home again , and she led the children into her own gates , and from that day they were homeless no more . NEXT morning as she looked about the familiar room she knew that the world was exactly as it had been every other morning . Yet , instead of waking to weariness and a longing not to begin the day , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowed from a source in her which she had never had before . What she had felt for her husband in her youth had certainly been a kind of love . It was impossible not to have loved Mr. Wu when he was young . He had been too handsome , too healthy , too good-naturedP218not to have won her half-provoked affection and blood-longing . But that love had nothing to do with herself . It was as instinctive as the reflex of a muscle . The heart indeed was nothing but the central muscle in the body . This she knew . She had once watched her old grandfather take into his hands the still-living heart of a dead tiger , in the days when to eat a tiger heart was to absorb its strength . She remembered the scene as sharply as though it were now before her eyes . She was a little girl of eight , perhaps nine . The hilltnen had trapped the tiger and brought it snarling into the courtyard , caught in rope nets . They had all ' run out into the wintry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sight of them it had opened its wide red mouth and had hissed at them in hopeless enmity . The women had shrieked , but she had stood still , staring into its wild yellow eyes . As though it felt its power over her , the tiger had closed its jaws and stared back at her . She had taken one blind step forward when her grandfather shouted . A hillman leaped and plunged his dagger into the tiger 's heart . The knife ripped through the fur , and the beast sank back , The hillman lifted out the heart whole and still beating , and held it before her grandfather 's eyes . But what she felt in herself now for Andre had nothing to do with the beating heart . This love , quiet and strong , was sunlight at noon . She was warmed and strengthened by it , and made certain of herself . She had only to act out of the warmth and light , and what she did would be right . Love permeated her brain as well as her body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was with her because she loved him . The reticence of the body was gone . It was unnecessary . She who all her life had been skeptic to the bone , who had . smiled at priests and temple mummery , who had looked up to the sky and seen no gods , to whom the spirits of nature were only childish imaginations , she now was sure that Andre was alive and with her . " I loved him when he came and went in these courts , but I did not know it , " she thought . " I had to see his body dead before I knew how I love him . " And then , being a woman , she asked herself if he had loved her . At this question of returned love she felt her first loneliness . " Since I can not hear his voice , I shall never know , " she thought . She turned her head toward the court and missed the tread of his feet upon the stones . Then , as she listened , hearing nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw his face appear slowly P219against the dark curtain of her memory . His eyes were warm upon her , his bearded lips smiled , and the half-merry sagacity which was his usual look came before her so vividly that she smiled back at him . She could not hear his voice , but she felt suddenly assured that Andre did love her . Behind the walls of his priesthood , which kept him separated from her while he was alive , he had loved her . Now he was no longer priest , and the walls were gone . There was no reason why she should not summon him at any moment , no reason why he should not enter her mind without waiting for summons . His body was dead , and hers had become the means through which they could live together . It occurred to her that now she might have a new wisdom which alone she had never had . " How stupid I have been , " she reflected , gazing up into the blue curtains of her bed . " The men and women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have done ! " What she had done so selfishly was to try to free herself from them all by withdrawing herself . She had wanted them to be happy , each in his own fashion , but she had not wanted to be troubled with making them happy , nor had she been able to tell them how to be happy . Food and clothing she had provided , discipline and order she had maintained , and yet the whole house was in a turmoil and nobody was happy . She had been angry with them because they were not happy . This she now saw was completely foolish . At this moment Ying came into the room , looking very discontented . " Do you not get up this morning , Lady ? " she asked . Her voice was querulous . " It is a rainy day , " Madame Wu said , smiling . " How do you know , Lady ? " Ying inquired sourly . " You have not even drawn your curtains . " " I know by your voice , " Madame Wu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I never thought I should have to see a flower-house girl in our house , " Ying retorted , " nor the sons of the house out wandering over the earth and a concubine cast aside and still having to be fed . " " So the girl Jasmine is come ? " Madame Wu said . " She is in the back court waiting , " Ying replied . She busied herselfabout her mistress 's toilet table while she went on talking . " They asked me what to do with her . I do n't know what to do with her . " P220Ying 's underlip thrust itself out . " The girl says she 's expected . I told her I did not expect her . " Madame Wu got up out of bed and thrust her narrow feet into flower-embroidered slippers . " Did she come alone ? " she asked . " A snag-toothed old woman came with her and then went away in a hurry . Oh , she 's on our hands , " Ying said very sourly . Madame Wu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then she put on her silver-gray brocaded satin robe over soft white silk undergarments . Ying dressed her hair carefully , her underlip still sullen . " Fetch my breakfast , " Madame Wu commanded . She sat down a few moments later and ate it with appetite . She felt a new hunger even for food , and was amused . Had she not heard that love destroyed the appetite ? Then she remembered that it was only unrequited love that did so . " Andre loves me , " she thought in triumph . In less than half an hour she rose to go to the back court to see the girl Jasmine . " Shall I not bring her here , Lady ? " Ying inquired . " It will give her big thoughts if you go to her . " " No , " Madame Wu said calmly , " I will go to her . " She wished as few persons as possible now to enter her own court . Here let the spirit of Andre dwell undisturbed , she told herself . Then on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cling , as though hands held them to the marble . A new thought came into her mind . " But Andre never held himself back from anyone , " she thought . " He would have met this girl freely to discern what he could do for her . His spirit here will help me . " She turned to Ying . " You may bring her after all , " she said . So while Ying went she sat down . Anyone looking in through the gate would have seen her sitting , a slender silvery figure , her head bent , a smile upon her almond-pale face . But no one passed , and in a few moments Ying returned , marching ahead of a rosy plump short young girl . Thus Madame Wu looked up and saw Jasmine . She was at the same instant aware that this was the sort of woman whom she naturallymost disliked , a robust and earthy creature , coarse and passionate . She averted her eyes and felt her soul stagger between yesterday and today . Her dainty flesh shivered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There his face was P221again , dark upon the curtain of her memory . Gazing at his face , she began to ask the girl questions in a soft and gentle voice . Ying fell back a few paces and stood listening and staring . This was not at all Madame Wu 's usual silvery clear voice . There was no hardness in it . Yet it was not the voice in which Madame Wu habitually spoke to children . It was something new , this voice . " Tell me why you want to come here to live , " Madame Wu asked . Jasmine looked down at the stones under her feet . She wished she had put on her blue cotton jacket and trousers instead of her green satin ones . " I want to settle myself before the child is born , " she said . " Is there to be a child ? " Madame Wu asked . Jasmine lifted her head for one quick look at her . " Yes ! " she said loudly . " There is no child , " Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her lips to protest , and stared into Madame Wu 's eyes . They were fixed upon her with piercinglight , and she burst into tears . " So there is no child , " Madame Wu repeated . " Lady , we do n't have to keep her ! " Ying cried . Madame Wu put up her long narrow hand . " This is for me to decide , " she said . " Please go away , Ying . " " And leave you with this rotten egg ? " Ying demanded . " You may stand just outside the moon gate , " Madame Wu said . She waited for Ying to go , and then she motioned the girl to sit down on a porcelain garden seat . Jasmine sat down , rubbing her eyes with her knuckles and drawing her sobs back into her throat . Madame Wu began to speak . " You know , " she said to Jasmine , " it is a very grave thing to enter a man 's house , especially when there is a large and honorable family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruin all happiness here . Or you can come in and add happiness by your presence . All this depends on your true heart . If you come for rice and shelter , I beg you to tell me . I will promise you these . You may have them freely without having to buy them here with your body . " Jasmine looked shrewdly at Madame Wu . " Who gives a woman something for nothing ? " she asked . Madame Wu marveled at herself . Had this happened a month ago , she would have despised the girl 's coarseness . But now she understoodit .   " You have never had food or shelter freely , " she murmured . " It is hard for you to believe me . " " I believe nobody , " Jasmine said . She pulled a bright red silk handkerchief out of her bosom . One end of it was fastened to a button , but she twisted the other about her fingers . " Then you do come here for shelter , " Madame Wu said . Jasmine shook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she declared . She lifted her thick eyelids , and a sly look came into her round black eyes . " Other men have promised me shelter , " she said . " But you come here for something , " Madame Wu persisted . " Is it because there is honor in belonging to our family , even though you live in our back court ? " Jasmine 's face was suddenly scarlet under its powder . " I like the old head  --  " she muttered in the jargon of the street . Madame Wu knew she spoke of Mr. Wu , but she did not reprove her . Truth was stealing newborn out of the girl 's heart . " He is much older than you , child , " Madame Wu said . " I like old men , " the girl said , trembling . " Why do you tremble ? " Madame Wu asked . " You need not tremblebefore me . " " I have never known anyone who was noble , " the girl said , frightened . " He is very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Madame Wu asked . She would never have used the word noble for Mr. Wu . Impetuous , impatient , willful , stupid , good-natured sometimes , selfish always  --  these were all possible words for him , but not noble . " I mean  --  noble , " Jasmine said . She lifted her arm . " This bracelet , " she said . " It is solid gold . A young man would have given me a brass one with a coat of gold and sworn it was true . It would have lasted until he left me . But no , the old one gave me solid gold . " She bit it and showed the toothmarks to Madame Wu . " See ? " " Yes , it is gold , " Madame Wu agreed . " He is so patient , " the girl went on eagerly . " When I do n't feel well , he notices it  --  he does n't press me . Young men do n't care . They take what they want . But this old one always asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Madame Wu replied . This was not the Mr. Wu she had known . The girl sat down again and twisted the bracelet about her arm . " If I have no child  --  " she began .   " A child is not important , " Madame ' Wu said . Jasmine looked at her cornerwise while Madame Wu went on . " The important thing is , will you add happiness to this house or take it away ? " Jasmine lifted her head eagerly . " I will bring happiness , I promise you , Lady  --  " " Tomorrow I will decide , " Madame Wu said . She rose as she spoke , and Ying hurried into the court and led the girl away . When she was gone Madame Wu walked straight along a path of new sunlight that now fell across the stones into the doorway . The light dazed her , but her feet were warmed by it . " I did well , " she thought in some wonder at herself . " How did I know to do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasmine really loved Mr. Wu , that love , too , must be allowed . Did Mr. Wu also love Jasmine ? If so , then real happiness would be added to the house . All the unhappinessin homes came because there was not love . " When I have rested , " she said to Ying , who came in dusting her hands , " I will go to the courts of my sons ' father . " " Do , Lady , " Ying said . She looked more cheerful . " Perhaps you can persuade him to wisdom . We have already too many women in this house . " " Are you to stay ? " she had asked Jasmine while she led her away . " I do n't know , " Jasmine had faltered . " She said she 'd tell me to-morrow . " " Our Lady always makes up her mind quickly , " Ying said . She did not finish what she thought , that if her mistress did not say " yes " today , it would be " no " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had drawn the iron bar . " I go , Lady , and let him know , " she now said . The sparkle had come back into her impudent eyes . Madame Wu saw it , understood , and smiled . Madame Wu woke to her usual full consciousness , her heart serene . All her life she had struggled for calmness and serenity . She had made herself a prisoner inside the confines of her will , imposed upon her body . Thus her will had commanded her body to behave in certain ways at certain times , regardless of its repulsions and desires . She felt now that she need never again compel herself to anything . " Andre , " she said to herself , " it is strange , is it not , that you had to die before I knew you ? "   " Not strange , " the answering thought came into her mind . " There was my big body between us . You had to look at a face and at features with which I really had nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who actually were strangers to me . Even though I was willing to realize them as strangers and leave them , still I was held in their flesh . Now I am wholly myself . " " Andre , " she said to him within her , " should I still call you brother , perhaps ? " " It is no longer necessary to qualify our relationship . " So he answered in her heart . Madame Wu lay straight and exquisite in her bed . She was frightened by this conversation which was taking place entirely in her own mind . Skeptic that she was , she would have laughed at any supernatural appearance even of the one she loved . But there had been no appearance and no sound . The austere room was exactly as it had been when she closed her eyes to sleep . Simply within her brain she heard Andre 's voice answering her questions . It was perhapsno more than an obsession caused by his death and by her discoverythat she loved him . To have comprehended within a handful of seconds that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shake Heaven and earth . It was not surprising that the brain doubled upon itself in its confusion . She recalled that Andre had told her how thought was driven along the cells which composed the brain stuff . Her recognition of him , crashing into those cells , must doubtless have disturbed all the previous thought lines of her life . " I do not know what I shall be from now on , " she thought . She listened for the answering voice . Instead she suddenly remembered how he looked when he smiled . She saw light welling up through the deep darkness of his eyes , and she smiled back at him . Ying came into the room , looking alarmed . " The front court is full of the beggar children , " she said fretfully . " And the prostitute is sitting in the entrance hall again . She says you sent for her . " Madame Wu laughed . " I feel I could eat a roll of wheat bread this morning , " she remarked . Ying stared at her . " You look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's . You are not feverish ? " She came to the side of the huge bed and took Madame Wu 's little hand and held it to her cheek . " No fever , " Madame Wu said . " Nothing but health . " She withdrew her hand gently and threw back the silken quilt . P225Then , rising , she allowed Ying to wash and dress her . But she refusedthe gray silk robe Ying had put out for her . Instead she chose one of an old-rose color which the day before her fortieth birthday she had laid aside , thinking she would never wear such hues again . Today it was becoming to her as it had never been . The last time she had worn it she had thought it made her paleness sallow . But this morning it lent her color . " It was wrong of me to have put it away , " she thought as she looked at herself in the mirror . Her natural vanity stirred . " A pity he never saw me in this , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced at Ying , to see whether any of this had been seen . But Ying was folding the gray robe , sleeve to sleeve . Madame Wu walked into the library . In common sense today she should have felt her life tangled with unsolved problems . Twenty children waited in the court , the young prostitute sat in the entrance hall , and Mr. Wu was more than ever a responsibility . There were the newborn girl and her mother , Ch'iuming , and her own sons and their wives . But she had none of her usual shrinking from human beings . She now realized that for the first time in her life she dislikedno one . All her life she had struggled again her dislike of human beings . None had been wholly to her taste . Thus her mother she had disliked because of her ignorance and superstitions . Her father she had loved , or would have said she had , but she had dislikedhim , too , because his heart was far away and she could never come near him . And though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married him there were secrets of his person which she disliked . Even when she had shared his passion , she had been aware of shapes and odors , and she had felt violation in his touch even while she allowed it . Old Gentleman had been dear to her , but she was so delicately made that she could not forget what she disliked while she found what she liked . His heart was good , his intelligence clear , but his teeth were broken and his breath came foul . " If Andre had been alive when I found I loved him , I wonder if I could have  --  " Before she could frame the thought , another came to answer . " You see how wise is death ! It removes the body of a man and lets free his spirit . " " But if I were younger , " she reminded him , " could I have been satisfied only with your spirit ? " She looked down at the smooth gray tiles of the floor . Would it P226have been possible , when she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For of course Andre was a foreign man , a man from another country and of another blood . She tried to imagine him young and ardent as a man is ardent , and all her blood rose in strange anger . " Do n't ! " This cry burst into her mind . " No , I will not , " she promised . Ying came in with her breakfast and placed it upon the table in neat rows of dishes . Madame Wu took up her chopsticks . " Have the children in the court been fed ? " she asked . " Certainly not , Lady , " Ying said sternly . " No orders have been given for so much food . " " Then I give orders now , " Madame Wu said gently . " Let rice be cooked at once , and bread bought and tea made for their noon meal . " " It is lucky it is not raining , " Ying said . " We should be put to it if we had to take such people under our roof . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Madame ' Wu said . She was amazed to see Ying begin to cry and , with her blue coat to her eyes , run sobbing out of the room . " You are changed  --  you are changed , " she cried . But at noon she had great buckets of rice set in the court , and when Madame Wu went there it was to see the little girls eating happily and feeding the younger ones by pushing rice into their open mouths . The old woman who had been their caretaker rose , her cheeks full of rice , and cried out to the children that they must greet Madame Wu as their mother . " Now that your father has gone , I am your mother , " Madame Wu said , smiling . The orphan children looked at her with love , and suddenlyfor the first time in her life Madame Wu felt the true pangs of birth in her being . She felt her being divided and merge again with another nature far larger than her own . These children were Andre 's and hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering that the words could be hers . At the sound of her voice the children rushed to her to embraceher , to touch her , to lean against her . She looked down at them and saw their small lacks and defects as well as their beauty . But she felt no dislike . " Your father did the best he could for you , " she said , smiling , " but you need a mother , too . " She touched a sore red scar on a child 's cheek . " Does it still hurt ? " she asked . " A little , " the child replied .   " And how did you come by it ? " Madame Wu asked . The child hung her head . " My mistress held the end of her cigarette against me there  --  " " Oh , why ? " Madame Wu asked . " I was her slave  --  and I could n't move fast enough- - " the child replied . She put her hand into Madame Wu 's . " Will you give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to give me a name and then died too soon . All the others have names . " " They shall tell me their names , and then I shall know what to name you , " Madame Wu replied . One by one they repeated their names , and each name was a word spoken from Andre . Pity ; Faith ; Humility ; Grace ; Truth ; Mercy ; Light ; Song ; Star ; Moonbeam ; Sunbeam ; Dawn ; Joy ; Clarity  --  such were the names he had given the older ones . The younger ones he had called playful names . Kitten and Snowbird and Rosepetal and Acorn , Silver and Gold . " Because he said silver and gold had he none , " these two small creatures proclaimed , " until we came . " They all laughed at such nonsense . " He did make us laugh every day , " Gold said . She was a round little creature , and she clutched Silver by the hand . " Are you sisters ? " Madame Wu asked , smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Of course , " Madame Wu agreed . " I am stupid . " The scarred child pressed her close . " And my name ? " she asked . Madame Wu looked down into the tender face . The child was exquisite , a bud of a child , full of beauty to come . The name rose in Madame Wu 's mind . " I will call you Love , " she said . " I am Love , " the child repeated . By now the court was fringed with silent onlookers . The servants in the house had made one excuse and another to pass this way to stop and stare , but the children of the household and the lesser relativesmade no pretense of errands . They stood gaping at this new Madame Wu . At last jasmine , who had grown weary of waiting in the entrance hall , rose and came to the court herself , and behind her came her servant . Jasmine had braced herself to be very strong and to demand her rights as one who had within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of the stern proud lady whom she had expected to see , P228this morning she saw a gentle beautiful woman laughing in the midst of beggar children . Madame Wu looked up at the bustle behind the pillars of the veranda , and their eyes met . " You see I have many children , " Madame Wu said , smiling , " but I have not forgotten you . When I have planned where they are to sleep and play , I will talk with you . " She turned to the relatives . None of them were sons or sons ' wives . They were only old cousins and poor nephews who , having no shelter elsewhere , had returned to the ancestral house to find a corner here and a bed there . " Where shall we house my children ? " she asked gaily . " Our Sister , " an old widow answered , " if you are doing good deeds , let them be housed in the family temple . " Madame Wu had been without any anxiety whatever , but she simply had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted the widow 's words at once . " How wise you are , " she said gratefully . " No home could be better than our temple . There are courts to play in , and the pool and the fountain . The family gods will have something to do now . " She led the way as she spoke , and the children ran after her in the sunlight , and the old woman hobbled after them . In the very back of the Wu courts there was a large old temple , built by one of the women ancestors two hundred years before . She had desired to becomea nun after her husband died , and yet she did not wish to leave her home to live in a public temple . So she had built here within the shelter of the house walls a beautiful temple where she lived with the gods until she died nearly one hundred years old . Since then a priest had been appointed to care for the temple , none being allowed to serve who were under fifty years of age because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although skeptic , had nevertheless allowed the priest to continue and had maintained the temple , paying for the gilding of the gods once every ten years and once a year allowing a sum for incense . Such of the family as wished could worship here , and it was considered a benefit that women need not go to outside temples to worship and be perhaps exposed to lewd priests . To this temple she now led the children . She paused for one moment on the wide stone threshold . Two gate gods loomed above her , one black , one white . " But will these gods offend Andre ? " she asked herself . " His religionhad no gods like these . " P229She seemed to hear his mighty laughter , echoing among the painted beams high above the heads of the gods . She smiled in reply and , holding by the hand the child she had named Love , she stepped over the high wooden doorsteps and into the temple . The air was fragrant with incense and lilies . Incense burned before the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest , hearing footsteps , came running in from his kitchen . Ile had been burning grass for cooking of his meal , and his face and hands were sooty . He stared at the crowd of children and at Madame Wu . " I ambringing gifts , " she said . " Tell him your names , children . " One by one they called their names in their soft gay voices . " And this one , " Madame Wu ended , " is Love . They are all giftsfor the temple . " Now , the old priest had heard of what had happened . He took it that Madame Wu wished to do good deeds before Heaven and so he could not forbid it , however difficult it might be for him . He bowed and clasped his sooty hands and fell back against one god after another as he retreated before Madame Wu , who swept on into the temple , assigning rooms where until now only gods had stood silently gazing into the courts of the Wu family . " This room is for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Goddess of Mercy is here , and she will watch over you for me during the night . This room is for the big ones , because there is space for everybody , and you must help to keep it very clean . " Then she felt the child Love cling to her . " Let me come with you , " she begged Madame Wu . " I will wash your clothes and serve your food . I can do everything . " Madame Wu 's heart turned into warm flame . But she was just . She knew that Andre would not have showed favor to one above another . She shook her head . " You must stay and help the others , " she said . " That is what your father would have wished . " Then she knew it was not all justice . She wanted no one with her , to share her life with him . " Where shall we sleep , Our Mother ? " the children asked of MadameWu . " By night there will be beds , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And seeing them happy , she left them with the gods . P230Jasmine pursed her red mouth and looked hard at the corner of her brightly flowered silk kerchief . One corner of it was fastened to the glass button on her left shoulder , and it hung from this like a scarf . With the kerchief she concealed het face , or she played with it when she wished not to look at the one to whom she was talking . " It is hard for me to speak , " she said to Madame Wu . " Surely there is not much to say , " Madame Wu replied . " There is a great deal to say , " Jasmine said pertly . " If I have no child now , I will have . " She placed her hands on her belly . Madame Wu looked at her with interest . " You ought to be able to bear a very fat fine child , " she said . " You look strong . " Jasmine was taken back . " But what will my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What position do you want ? " Madame Wu asked . " I ought to be the third wife , " Jasmine said sharply . It was strange that so young and pretty a creature could be so sharp . But her round bright eyes , her straight small nose , her pink cheeks and little full mouth all grew sharp and bright together . " Why not ? " Madame Wu said amiably . " You do n't mind ? " Jasmine asked ' these words in a whisper . The sharpness went out of her face , and the lines of it softened . " Why should I mind ? " Madame Wu asked simply . " You mean I can live here  --  in this great house  --  and be called Third Lady  --  and when my child  --  " " I would not want any child of our house to be illegitimate , " Madame Wu said . " That would be unworthy of our name . You are the vessel that receives the seed . You are to be honored . " Jasmine stared at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in loud coarse sobs . " I thought you would hate me , " she gasped . " I made myself ready for your anger . Now I do n't know what to do . " " There is nothing you need to do , " Madame Wu said calmly . " I will have a maid lead you to your rooms . They are small , you know , only two , and they are to the left of my lord 's court . His Second Lady lives to the right . You need not meet . I will myself go now and tell my lord you are coming . " She hesitated , and then said with a delicate frankness , " You will find him very just . If he leaves his silver pipe upon your table it is his message . If he goes away with it in his hand , do not be angry . That is my own request in return for shelter . Bring no anger into our house . " P231She looked at the stolid old woman who had sat beside Jasmine all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is she your mother ? " The woman opened her mouth to speak , but Jasmine spoke first . " She belongs to the house from where I come . " " Let her go back to it , then , " Madame Wu said . She put her hand into her bosom and took out silver and put it on the table . It shone there so largely that the woman could only get up and bow again and again . But all was interrupted by Jasmine , who fell on her knees before Madame Wu and knocked her head on the floor . " They told me you were just , but now I know you are kind ! " Madame Wu 's cheeks flushed upward from her neck . " Had you come another day I might have been only angry , " she said honestly . " But today is different from all days before it . " She rose , not lifting the girl to her feet , and walked quickly out of the room . " I am a wicked woman , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women come into these courts . My own heart is full . " She paused , waiting for some answer to this . But there was no answer , unless the complete peace within her heart was answer . " Had I discovered you while you lived , " she said , " would there have been silence between us ? " Still he did not answer , and she smiled at his silence . Even as a spirit he was shy of love . The habits of his life held . The silence broke a moment later . As she stepped into the main court she saw three men standing there . They were decent-looking , well-dressed men , and they turned their backs as she came in and pretended not to see her , as though she were a young woman . It was a pleasant compliment , but she put it aside . " I am Madame Wu , " she said . " Is there anything you want here ? " They turned sidewise at this , and the eldest man , in great courtesy , answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wu whom we seek , " he said . " We are come to ask if the dead should not be somehow avenged . That Green Band is a danger to our whole town , but never before have they killed a man . It is true he was only a foreigner and a priest , but if they begin killing foreigners and priests today , they will be killing us tomorrow . Ought not the town to demand justice on behalf of the stranger ? If so , will Madame Wu make the accusation ? " There was a stir of protest in her mind . She saw Andre 's eyes , P232fiercely refusing vengeance , and she spoke instantly . " Certainly he would want no vengeance done for him , " she said . " He talked often of forgiving those who do not know what they do . But who are these robbers ? " " The worthless young men of the town , the adventurers , the ones who want to rise not through honest work , but through making others afraid of them , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men ? " she asked with wonder . The men laughed but without noise , in respect to her . " There are many in these days , " one said . " And why should there be ? " she asked . " The times are bad . " One of the other men spoke . He was a small withered man whose face was wrinkled but whose hair was still black . She stood there in the strong sunlight in her rose-colored robe , and there was admiration in the man 's eyes . But she was far beyond seeing it . She was wholly safe from any man 's admiration . " What makes the times bad ? " she asked . She knew well enough the times , but she asked . " Lady , you have lived behind these high walls , " the eldest man spoke again . " You can not know in what a turmoil the world is . The turmoil begins in the wickedness of foreign countries , where war continuallythreatens . None of us can escape . This turmoil makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to ancient ways which must soon change . They have no new ways to offer , and so , rejecting the old and delaying the new , they live without law . " She looked at the men . Doubtful though she might be of all else , of Andre 's mind she was sure . " He will take no vengeance , " she said . They bowed and went away . But she was troubled after they were gone . She walked on to find Mr. Wu , that she might see how his spirits were this day , and as she went she pondered what the men had said . Should she have sent her sons forth into these troubled times ? " Were I alone , " she thought , " I might be afraid . " But she was not alone . With this comfort she remembered that she had said she would announce Jasmine 's coming to Mr. Wu , and she went at once . She entered the moon gate and saw Mr. Wu poking into the earth of the peony terrace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore a lined robe of dark-blue satin , and he had put on his velvet shoes padded with silk . He was thinner than he had been . In his youth he had been full fleshed , and in his middle age nothing less than fat . Now , without his being slender , the inner fat was beginning to melt away , and his smooth brown skin was loosening . " Are you well , Father of my sons ? " she asked courteously . " Very well , Mother of my sons , " he replied , and went on prodding the earth . " You will ruin your pipe , " she remarked . " I am testing the roots of the peonies to see if they are firm , " he replied . " There has been so much rain that I fear their rotting . " " These terraces are well drained , " she said . " I had the tiles laid , you remember , the year Tsemo was born . We raised the height of the walls so that I could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Shall we sit outdoors or inside ? Better perhaps inside ? The winds are insidious . They curl about the ground and chill one 's feet . " She was amazed to perceive that she did not feel at all strange with Mr. Wu . Certainly she could not possibly have explained to him how she felt concerning Andre . He would have held her beside herself  --  a foreigner ? A priest ? A dead man ? She followed Mr. Wu into the main room , where the sunlight lay in a great square upon the tiles beside the open door . She felt toward him exactly as she always had . At this thought pity for Mr. Wu stirred her vitals . It was a piteous thing for him that she had not been able to love him . She had deprived this man of the fullness of life . Nothing that she had given him , neither her body nor her sons , could be reward enough for her unloving heart . Her only excuse was that she and Mr. Wu had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either , and she had done the best she could . But had she chosen him of her own free will , she could not have forgiven herself . Nothingcould recompense a man for the lack of love in the woman who was his wife . " Therefore somehow I must now give him love , " she thought . " I have just spoken to the girl jasmine , " she said calmly . She seated herself to the left of the table against the center wall of the room , and he took his usual seat at the right . So they had been wont to sit together through the evenings of their marriage , while they talked of the affairs in this house which belonged to them both . Mr. Wu busied himself with his pipe . She saw with her peculiar P234discernment that he was afraid of her . In other days this knowledge would have amused her . She had not disliked the fear that others had for her , accepting it as the due of her superiority . But now she was sad to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his plump hands . Where there was fear , no love could be . Andre had never feared her , nor did she fear him . She understood , with a strange pang that held no pain , that Mr. Wu had never really loved her , either , else he would not now be afraid of her . " Tell me how you feel toward this girl , " she said to Mr. Wu . At the gentleness of her voice he looked at her across the table , and she caught in his eyes a sort of shyness that she had never known was in him . " I know how this girl appears to you , " he said . " Of course she is inferior in every way . I can see that also . But I feel very sorry for her . What opportunity has she had , after all ? The story of her life is a sad one , poor child ! " " Tell me the story of her life , " Madame Wu said gently . The great house was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it . The walls were thick , and court led to court . In this wide room the heavy tables and chairs stood as they had stood for centuries , and they two human beings were only two in the long chain of men and women who had lived under the huge beams upholding the vast roof . But something new was here now . The order of the old life was broken . " Yes , certainly she is nothing unusual , this girl Jasmine . " Mr. Wu went on apologetically . " If she has won your love , " Madame ' Wu said with her strange new gentleness , " then she is unusual . " Mr. Wu looked startled . " Are you feeling well , Mother of my sons ? " he inquired . " Your voice sounds weaker than I remembered . " " I never felt stronger in my life , " Madame Wu replied . " Tell me more about this girl whom you love . " Mr. Wu hesitated . " I am not sure I love her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel toward her at all as I have ever felt toward you . I have no respect for her as I have for you . I do not admire her . She has no learning . I would not ask her advice about anything . " He felt more at ease when he saw Madame Wu 's face warmer than usual , and her eyes encouraging . She was not at all angry . " Your common sense is superb , " he said . " Shall I go on ? " " Please do , Father of my sons . Tell me how she affects you . Then perhaps I can help you to know whether you truly love her . "   " Why are you interested ? " he asked . " Put it that I feel I did you wrong in arranging for Ci'iuming 's coming , " she said . " You meant well , " he said courteously . " I acted selfishly , " she said , more gently still . It was the first time she had ever acknowledged herself wrong in anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There remains no one like you , " he told her with some of his old impetuosity . " I still say that had it not been for your fortieth birthday I would not have known there was another woman in the world . " She smiled again . " Alas , for women the choice is only between this fortieth birthday  --  or death . " Had she loved him , she would have chosen death rather than Jasmine in this house . " Do not mention death , " he said , still courteously . " Well , you ask me how this girl affects me . You know  --  she makes me feel strong . Yes , that is the effect she has on me . " " Strong ? " Madame Wu repeated . " She is so little , so ignorant , so weak , " Mr. Wu said . A thick soft smile crept about his lips . " No one has ever taken proper care of her . Really , she is a child . She has had no shelter . No one has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there are qualitiesin her heart . She is not , you understand , a creature of high intelligence . But she has deep emotions . She needs constant guidance . " Madame Wu listened to this with amazement . Never in her life had she heard Mr. Wu speak of anything except his own needs and desires . " You really love her ! " she exclaimed . There was admiration in her voice , and Mr. Wu responded to it proudly and modestly . " If what I have told you is love , then I do love her , " he replied . They had never been so near to each other as they now were . She had not known that he had this heart in him . He was made new , too . This perception filled her with astonishment . It was not a wonder that a man like Andre should have wakened love in her . But that this Jasmine , this common , rosy little street girl , this creature of ignorance and earthy innocence , should have roused in Mr. Wu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do not mind ? " Mr. Wu said . His face , turned toward her , was tender and pleading . " I rejoice , " she said quickly . P236They rose at the same instant and met in the middle of the sunlightupon the floor . Her warmth rushed out to him , and his replied . He seized her hands , and for that swift moment they were one , his eyes looking into hers . She longed to tell him why she rejoiced , and why they were so near . She longed for him to know that she under . stood this miracle in him that was love , whether it came through a great man or through a girl from a brothel . Priest or prostitute , the miracle was the same . It had reached her , hidden in her secret courts , and it had reached him in a flower house and had changed them both . But she knew that she could never make him understand the miracle . She must only help to make it complete for him . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Perhaps there is not , " she agreed , and gently she withdrew her hands from his . It was at this moment that Ying came upon them . According to her usual habit , she had first peeped around the corner of the door to see what they were doing . She was amazed and then delighted to see them holding hands . Surely this meant reconciliation and that the girl from the brothel would be sent away ! She stepped back and coughed , and then appeared again with her urgent message . " Lady , a man has come running at the gate to say that Madame Kang is in labor and it goes badly with her and Mr. Kang asks your immediate presence as her sister-friend . " Madame Wu rose at once from her chair , to which she had returnedat the cough . " Oh , Heaven , " she murmured , " is it so ! Did the man say what the trouble is ? " " The child refuses to be born , " Ying said dolefully . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go at once , " Madame Wu exclaimed . She made haste to the door and there stopped for an instant to speak again to Mr. Wu . " And you , Father of my sons , let down your heart and be at ease . The young girl shall come quietly into your court . I will myself silence all tongues . I ask only one thing  --  that Ch'iuming be allowed to leave . " " Indeed , I am quite willing for her to remain , " Mr. Wu said kindly . " She is very good , and where would she now go if you send her away ? " " I shall not send her away , " Madame Wu replied . " When I return I will decide her life . For the present , let her move into my own court . " She turned to Ying . " You hear what I say , Ying . Let it be so . " P237Ying by now was standing flat against the wall , clinging with her nails to the bricks . " Is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is now not that , " Madame Wu replied with sternness . " She is the choice of my lord . " With these words she made haste away and within a very few minutes she was seated in her sedan chair , lifted upon the shoulders of the bearers , and carried through the streets . " We borrow your light  --  we borrow your light  --  " the bearers chanted while they strode along and the crowd parted before the urgency of their cry . THE House of Kang was all in turmoil . This Madame Wu heard and saw the moment her sedan was lowered in the outer court . The young slave girls and the bondmaids were running everywhere , crying and reproving one another , and men servants stood silent and distraught . When the head steward saw Madame Wu he ran forward and , bowing , he begged her to come at once to the inner court . She followed him , and at the sight of her the confusion grew quiet . All eyes were fixed on her with fresh hope . Her wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house was trusted . " She reads many books , " one woman whispered to another . Out of these books , they hoped , she might know what to do . In the main room of the inner court Mr. Kang sat weeping . MadameWu had seen him often through many years , but never had she spoken a word to him nor heard his voice directed to her . They had bowed across rooms to each other , and at the weddings of Meng and Linyi they had bowed as outer relatives do . But she knew him only through her friend , his wife . Yet this meant she knew him very well . She knew what he liked to eat , how he liked duck seasoned with wine and garlic , and that he did not like limed eggs , and that he could eat seven pork-stuffed rolls at a meal , and that it took two catties of wine to make him drunk , and that when he was drunk he only went to sleep and was never fierce . She knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if any of them cried in his presence he sent it away . P238She knew that he left his slippers at his wife 's bedside every night , and when he did not it meant he was at a flower house and so his wife cried half the night through , and this made him angry . She knew that he had a black mole over his heart , which was a sign of long life , and she knew he suffered from wind in his bowels , and she knew that when storms blew from the north bringing sand from the deserts , his eyelids itched , and she knew that his cheeks broke into a red rash when he ate crabs but still he ate crabs . That is , Madame Wu knew everything about this man who sat with his fat hands on his knees weeping because his wife was ( lying . But of her he knew nothing exceptwhat all the town knew , that she had chosen a concubine for her husband when she was forty years old . He rose when he saw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round checks . " She is  --  is  --  " he began . " I know , " Madame Wu said , looking away from him . Again she would have marveled at her friend , that she could love this man , except now she knew how strange love could be . She moved quickly to the satin curtains that hung between this room and the bedroom . " I will go in at once , if you will allow me , " she said . " Go in  --  go in  --  save her life , " he blubbered . She went in quickly to Madame Kang 's bedroom . The smell of wasted blood was hot in the air . A lighted oil lamp flickered in the cavern of the great bed where she lay , and over her body an old woman bent . Two servant women hovered near , one at her foot and one at her head . Madame Wu brushed away the one at her head and looked down into the deathlike face of her friend . " Meichen , " she said softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered , " you 've come  --  " Her face wrinkled piteously . " I 'm dying  --  " Madame Wu had her friend 's wrist between her fingers . The pulsewas very faint indeed , and she did not answer this . " Stop pulling at the child , " she commanded the midwife . The old woman looked up . " But it is a boy ! " she cried . " Leave us alone , " Madame Wu commanded . " Go out , all of you . " She straightened her slender figure . All the women stared at her . " Do you take responsibility ? " the old midwife cried , and pursed her lips . " I take responsibility , " Madame Wu said . She stood waiting while they went out . Then in the stillness she P239leaned again over her friend . " Meichen , do you hear me ? " she asked clearly . Madame Kang 's eyes had closed , but now with great effort she opened them . She did not speak , but Madame Wu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You will lie here quietly while I go and fetch some broth for you to drink . You will drink it and you will rest . Then you will feel strong again . When you are strong I will help you give birth to the child . Between us it will be easy . " The eyelids flickered and closed . The faintest of smiles touched Madame Kang 's lips . Madame Wu covered her warmly and went into the other room . The midwife had gone away angry , but the servant women were there , pouring tea for Mr. Kang , fanning him , begging him to rest himself . They turned as she came in , but she did not speak to them . She spoke to Mr. Kang . " I need your help , " she told him . " Will she live ? " he cried at her . " If you help me , " she replied . " Anything , anything ! " " Hush . " She stopped his babbling . Then she commanded a servant , " Bring me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cow's-flesh broth we have ready and chicken broth and special fish soup . " " The fish soup , " she decided , " and put into it two spoonfuls of red sugar . Have it hot . " She turned again to Mr. Kang . " You are to bring it in  --  not one of the maids . " " But I  --  " he sputtered , " I assure you I am clumsy . " " You will bring it in , " she repeated . She went back again into the shadowy room , and once more she took Madame Kang 's wrist between her fingers . The pulse was as it had been , but not weaker . She stood waiting , and soon she heard Mr. Kang 's heavy footsteps tiptoeing into the room . In his two hands he held the jar of hot soup . " We will put the soup into the teapot , " she decided . Swiftly she emptied the tea into a brass spittoon and , taking the jar from him , she poured the soup into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Meichen , " she said , " you have only to swallow . " She tested theP240heat of the soup in her own mouth , and then she put the spout of the teapot to Madame Kang 's lips and allowed the soup to trickle into her mouth . Madame Kang did not open her eyes , but she swallowedagain and again as many as five or six times . " Now rest , " Madame Wu commanded . She did not speak to Mr. Kang . No , she kept him there standing , watching . She set the teapot on the table , and she turned back her satin sleeves and tied around her waist a towel that was hanging on a chair . He watched her , his eyes staring in horror . " I ought not to be present , " he whispered . But she motioned to him to come nearer , and in deep horror he obeyed her . He had begotten many children , but never had he seen what his begetting did . In carelessness and pleasure had he begotten . Madame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friend . " Meichen , " she said clearly , " give yourself no trouble . Allow your body to rest . I will work for you . " But in spite of her words , the moment she touched the sore flesh , Madame Kang groaned . Mr. Kang clapped his hands to his mouth and turned his head away . " Hold her hands , " Madame Wu said to him . " Give her your strength . " He could not disobey her . Her great eyes were fixed on him with stern power . He stepped forward and took his wife 's hands . And this , this alone , could have made Madame Kang open her eyes . She , feeling her hands in those she knew so well , opened her eyes . " You , " she gasped , " you  --  Father of my sons ! " At this moment of recognition Madame Wu slipped her strong narrow hands around the child , and Madame Kang screamed . Mr. Kang burst into sweat . He groaned and clenched his hands around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he muttered through his teeth , " I swear , I swear  --  " " Swear  --  nothing , " she gasped . " I am glad  --  your child . " " Children are nothing to me beside you , " he shouted . " If you die I will hang myself . " The sweat ran down his face . " Then you do  --  love me ? " Her voice was so faint , it came in such breaths , that for a moment Madame Wu was afraid of what she had undertaken . " Heart of my heart , " Mr. Kang was crying . " Do n't die  --  do n't die  --  "   " I wo n't die , " Madame Kang said aloud . At this moment Madame Wu moved the child out of her body . A gush of blood flowed but Madame Wu stanched it with handfuls of cotton that the midwife had put by the bed . Mr. Kang still clutched his wife 's hands . " Is it over ? " he mumbled . " All over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame Kang whispered . Madame Wu wrapped the small torn body in the towel she took from her waist . " The child is dead , " she said quietly , " but you two do not need this child . " " Certainly not , " Mr. Kang babbled . " Meichen , I beg you  --  no more children . Never , never , I promise you  --  " " Hush , " Madame Wu said sternly . " Make no promises you can not keep . " She felt the teapot and it was still hot . She put the spout to her friend 's lips . " Drink , " she said . " You have promised to live . " Madame Kang drank . Her eyes were closed again , but the pulse in her wrist , when Madame Wu felt it , was stronger by the least possible strength . Madame Wu motioned to Mr. Kang to loose his wife 's hands . " She must sleep , " she directed . " I will sit here beside her . Do you take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the dead child and put it into Mr. Kang 's arms , and he held it . " Let this child be the proof of what you have told her , " Madame Wu said . " Remember forever his weight in your arms . Remember that he died to save the life of his mother  --  for you . " " I will remember , " Mr. Kang promised . " I promise you I will re-member . " " Make no promises you can not keep , " Madame Wu said again . Through the day she sat there and through the night that followed . Servants brought her food and hot tea , but she allowed them to come only to the door . Mr. Kang came in to thank her and to look at his wife while she slept . For Madame Kang slept , not opening her eyes even when she drank hot broth . Into this broth Madame Wu put the herbs which thicken the blood so that it will not flow , and she put in the dust of certain molds which prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were not common knowledge . Meng and Linyi had come back to their mother , but even them she would not allow to enter this room . She let in only so much airP242through the window as she needed for her own breathing and for her friend 's , for the wind was cool and she did not want a brazier brought , lest charcoal fumes foul the air . Under her silken quilts Madame Kang slept , washed and clean and fed every hour or two with the medicines and the broth , and hour by hour she returned again to life . On the morning of the second day , when Madame Wu was certainof the pulse in her friend 's wrists , she left the room at last . Outsidethe door Mr. Kang still sat waiting alone . He had not washed himself , nor had he eaten or slept , and all pretense and courtesy and falsity had left him . He was tired and frightened and worn down to his true being . Madame Wu saw this and took pity on him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life to you , " Mr. Kang said , hanging his head . " Her life must not be put into this danger again , " Madame Wu said gently . " I promise  --  " Mr. Kang began , but Madame Wu put up her hand . " Can you keep that promise when she is well again ? " she asked . " And if you can , how will you keep it ? Ilave I brought her back to life only to be sad and sorrowful because you run hither and thither to flower houses ? Will it be any comfort to her that you spare her children only to sow wild seed elsewhere ? It is unfortunate that she loves you so much , unless you also love her . " " I do love her , " Mr. Kang protested . " But how much ? " Madame Wu pressed him . " Enough to make her life good ? " He stared at her , and she gazed back at him , her eyes very great and dark . " Better that she die if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calmly . " I will not make her sorrowful , " he said . His look faltered , he pulled his lip with his two fingers . " I did n't know  --  " he began . " I never thought  --  she never told me  --  " " What ? " Madame Wu asked . She knew , but for the good of his soul she forced him to say on . " I never knew about life , " he mumbled . " How hard it comes  --  it costs too much . " " Too much , " she agreed . " But she has loved you more than it cost . " " Has she suffered like this each time ? " he asked . " Like what ? " she pressed him again . " Near to death  --  "   " Birth for any woman is always near to death , " she replied . " Now for her it has become either birth or death . You must take your choice , . You can no longer have both . " He put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " lie muttered , " always  --  always  --  " She rose silently while he hid his eyes and went out of the room . She would never perhaps see him again . In their life men and women remained apart from each other , and she might never come into his presence . It was not necessary . This coarse simple man was now terrified by love , his own love for his wife . So Madame Wu went home , very tired and not a little sickened by all she had seen and done . To step again into her own court , clean and still , was to bathe her soul . Here Andre had been with her , here he had walked and talked . Could the communion she felt with him now have anything in common with the crude heart of Mr .. Kang and his love for his wife ? She went into the library and warmth wrapped her about . Ying had lit the brazier , and the heat from it shimmered above the coals . At the far window sunlight poured through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love in her own heart , she could not by any means have saved Meichen 's life . The horror of the flesh would have overwhelmed her , the smell of blood , the stench of death , the ugliness of Mr. King 's fat weeping face , the disgust of his thick body , the sordidness of his mind . But she knew that love had lifted her out of herself . Ying came in , scolding . " You , " she cried , " Lady , Lady  --  look at your coat  --  why , there 's blood on it  --  and you 're so pale  --  " She looked down at herself and saw blood on her satin garment She who was so fastidious now only murmured , " I forgot myself . " It must not be thought that Madame Wu understood fully the change that had taken place in her being . She felt , indeed , that she did not know from one moment to the next where her path lay . She had no plan . But she felt that she was walking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet in that path , all would be well with her . Should she step into the shadows on either side of the path , she would be lost . And the light that lit this path was her love for Andre . Did she need to know what step must next be taken , she had only to think of him and then she knew . Thus the next day when Ying brought her the little girl to whom P244Ch'iuming had given birth , she felt a great tenderness for the child . Through this child she had knit Ch'iuming , a stranger , into the house of Wu . Whereas before she had felt this child a new burden , and the whole matter of Ch'iuming nothing but a perplexity , now she felt that there was no burden and no perplexity . She must deal with both mother and child as Andre would have her do . " Where is Ch'iuming ? " she asked Ying . " She busies herself about the kitchen and the gardens , " Ying said . " Is she happy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy , " Ying replied . " We ought to send her away . It is bad luck to have a sad face everywhere . It curdles the milk in the breasts of the wet nurses and it makes the children fretful . " " Let Ch'iuming come here to me , " Madame Wu said . This was the next morning after she had been to Madame Kang 's . As soon as she had risen , she had sent a messenger to ask how her friend did , and good news had come back . Madame Kang had slept well through the night , the blood in her wounds had clotted without fresh flow , and this morning she had eaten a bowl of rice gruel mixed with red sugar . Now she slept again . The day was still and gray . Yesterday 's sunshine was gone , and the smell of mist from the river was in the air . Madame Wu sniffed it delicately into her nostrils . Near her in a basket bed the little girl lay playing with her hands . She lost them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over her tiny face . Then she saw them again as she waved them , and she stared at them and lost them again . Watching this play , Madame Wu laughed gently . " How small are our beginnings , " she thought . " So I once lay in a cradle  --  and Andre also . " She tried to imagine Andre a child , a little child , and she wondered about his mother . Doubtless the mother knew from the first what her son was , a man who blessed others through his life . Out of the gray and silent morning Ch'iuming came slipping between the great doors that were closed against the coldness . Madame Wu looked up as she came in . The girl looked a part of the morning mist , all gray and still and cold . Her pale face was closed , and her lips were pale and her eyelids pale and heavy over her dark eyes . " Look at this child of yours , " Madame Wu said . " She is making me laugh because she loses her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P245Ch'iuming came and stood beside the cradle and looked down , and Madame Wu saw she did not love the child . She was alien to her . Had it been another day , another time , Madame Wu would have refused to speak of it , or she would have turned her head away , dcGlaringto herself that it was not her affair whether this ignorant girl loved the child . But now she asked , " Can it be you do not love your own child ? " " I can not feel her mine , " Ch'iuming answered . " Yet you gave birth to her , " Madame Wu said . " It was against my will , " Ch'iuming said . The two women were silent , and each watched the unknowing child . In other days Madame Wu would have reproached the mother for not loving the child , but love was teaching her while she sat silent . Once , Andre had told her , there had been a child born of a young mother and an unknown father , and there had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still worshiped him as a god because he was born of love . " And why was the father unknown ? " she had asked . " Because the mother never spoke his name , " Andre had replied . " Who cared for and fed them ? " she had asked . " A good man , named Joseph , who worshiped them both and asked nothing for himself . " " And what became of the radiant child ? " she had asked . " He died a young man , but other men have never forgotten him , " Andre had replied . Remembering what he had said , she felt herself illumined . Why did Ch'iuming not love this child , except that she did not love the father , Mr. Wu ? And how did she know she did not love Mr. Wu except that she knew one whom she did love ? " Whom do you love ? " she asked Ch'iuming suddenly . She was not surprised to see the young woman 's face flush a bright red . Even her small ears grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and lied so plainly that Madame Wu laughed . " Now how can I believe you ? " she said . " Your cheeks and your very ears tell the truth . Are you afraid to let your lips speak it , too ? You do not love this child  --  that means you do not love the father . Well , let that be . Love can not be forced , love can not be coaxed and teased . It comes out of Heaven , unasked and unsought . Shall I blame you for that ? I know my wrong that I did . But when I brought you P246here , I myself did not understand love . I thought m and women could be mated like male and female in the beasts . Now I know that men and women hate each other when they are mated only as beasts . For we are not beasts . We can unite ourselves without a touch of the hands , or a look of the eyes . We can love even when the flesh is dead . It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such strange talk , so monstrous from Madame Wu , whose words were always plain and practical , that Ch'iuming could only look at her as though she looked at a ghost . But Madame Wu assuredly was no ghost . Her eyes were bright and her whole frame vigorous in spite of its delicacy . She had a new life of some sort , Ch'iuming could see . " Come , " Madame Wu said , " tell me the name in your heart . " " I die of shame , " Ch'iuming said . She folded the edge of her coat between her thumb and finger . " I will not let you die of shame , " Madame Wu said kindly . Thus persuaded , and with much hesitating and doubtfulness , Ch'iumingspoke a few words at a time . " You gave me  --  as concubine to the old one  --  but  --  " Here she stopped . " But there is someone else to whom you would rather have been given . " Madame Wu helped her so far , and Ch'iuming nodded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ch'iuming nodded again . " Is he one of my sons ? " Madame Wu asked . This time Ch'iuming looked up at her and began to weep . " It is Fengmo , " Madame Wu said and knew it was , and Ch'iuming went on weeping . What a tangle was here , what a confusion between men and women , Madame Wu told herself . This was all the fruit of her own stupidity , without love ! " Do not weep any more , " she said to Ch'iuming . " This is all my sin , and I must make amends somehow . But it is not clear to me yet what must be done . " At this Ch'iuming fell on her knees and put her head on her hands on the floor . " I said I should die of shame , " she murmured . " Let me die . There is no use for a creature like me . " " There is use for every creature , " Madame Wu replied and lifted Ch'iuming up . " I am glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is well for me to know . Now I beg you , wait patiently here in this house . Light will be given me , and I shall know what I ought to do forP247you . In the meantime , help me to care for the foundlings that I have taken . It will be of great use to me if you will care for them for me . They are here , and I have not enough time to look after them . " At the mention of them Ch'iuming wiped her eyes , " I will tend the foundlings , Lady , " she said . " Why not ? They are sisters of mine . " She stooped and lifted her child out of the cradle . " I will take this child with me  --  she is a foundling , too  --  orphan , I suppose , since her mother cannnot love her , poor toad . " Madame Wu did not answer . Where happiness could be found for Ch'iuming she did not know . Time must discover it . From the central courts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed into weeks and months . " Were I evil , " she thought one day , " I could be likened to a spider weaving my web around all these in our house . " A bird sang in the bamboos . Shc heard its unfamiliar voice and knew what it was . Twice a year the brown bulbul from India passed this way . Its voice was tuneful but harsh . It marked the coming of spring , and that was all . She mused on . " And how do I know that I am not evil ? How do I know that what I consider good is truly good ? " As was her habit she put this question to her memory of Andre . One day , she remembered very well , they had been sitting here in the library where she now sat , he on one side of the great carved table and she on the other , not opposite so that they had to look into each other 's faces , but with the table between and both facing the open doors into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , the air exceedinglyclear and the sunshine so strong that the colors in the stones that floored the court , usually gray , showed tints of blue and rose and veins of silver . Her orchids were blooming a dark purple . In the pool the goldfish darted and flung themselves against the sunbeams slantinginto the water . Andre had been telling her an ancient legend of the fall of man into evil . It came about , he said , by the hand of a woman , Eve , who gave man forbidden fruit . " And how was this woman to know that the fruit was forbidden ? " Madame Wu had inquired . " An evil spirit , in the shape of a serpent , whispered it to her , " Andre had said . " Why to her instead of to the man ? " she had next inquired .   " Because he knew that her mind and her heart were fixed not upon the man , but upon the pursuance of life , " he had replied . " The man 's mind and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dreaming that he possessed the woman and the garden . Why should he be tempted further ? He had all . But the woman could always be tempted by the thought of a better garden , a larger space , more to possess , because she knew that out of her body would come many more beings , and for them she plotted and planned . The woman thought not of herself , but of the many whom she would create . For their sake she was tempted . For their sake she will always be tempted . " She had looked at him . How well she remembered the profound and sad wisdom in his dark eyes ! " How is it you know women so well ? " she had asked . " Because I live alone , " he had replied . " Early I freed myself . " " And why did you free yourself ? " she asked . " Why did you removeyourself from the stream of life ? Do we not all belong in it ? Can it be right for any to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the months she had known him she had seen him in doubt . " You have put the one question which I have never been able to answer , " he had replied . " I freed myself first out of vanity . Yes , that I know and acknowledge . When I was like other men , about to marry and beget children , I thought myself loved by a woman . But God gave me a sight into human beings too quick for my own happiness . I saw her like Eve , planning for other human beings whom she was to create  --  with some small help from me , of course , but which nevertheless she would make in her own body . And I saw my small part , so brief a satisfaction of the flesh , and all my life then spent in digging and delving , like Adam , in order that our garden might be bigger and the fruits more rich . So I asked myselfif it was I she loved , and the answer was , perhaps  --  but only for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I said to myself , Shall I not rather serve God , who asks nothing of me except that I do justly and walk humbly before him ? ' On that day I became a priest . " " And have you been happy ? " she had asked him with a little malice . " I have possessed myself , " he had replied . . . . Now , alone in the library where nowadays she always sat because his presence was there , too , she pondered upon the man and the P249woman . The woman Eve , she considered , must not be blamed becauseinto her had been put the endless desire to carry on life . The man left to himself would never go further than himself . Ile had made the woman a part of himself , for his own use and pleasure . But she , in all her ignorance and innocence , used him in her endless creation of more life . Both were tools , but only the woman knew she was a tool and gave herself up co life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the difference between man and woman , even between you and me . " The air came in mild and soft as she sat alone , and no wind blew . A small blue-tailed lizard came out from the crevice between the brick wall and the stone floor , and lay basking in a bar of sunlight . She sat so still it thought her part of the room , and in its meager way it made merry , turning its flat head this way and that and frisking its bright tail . Its eyes were shining and empty . She did not move . It was good luck to have small harmless animals about a house . They felt the house eternal and made their home in it . She mused on , motionless while the lizard played . Such , then , was the unhappiness that lay between men and women . Man believed in his own individual meaning , but woman knew that she meant nothing for herself , except as she fulfilled her place in creating more life . And because men loved women as part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what must be created , this was the struggle that made man forever dissatisfied . He could not possess the woman because she was already possessed by a force larger than his own desire . Had she not created even him ? Perhaps for that he never forgave her , but hated her and fought her secretly , and dominated her and oppressed her and kept her locked in houses and her feet bound and her waist tied , and forbade her wages and skills and learning , and widowedher when he was dead , and burned her sometimes to ashes , pretending that it was her faithfulness that did it . Madame Wu laughed aloud at man and the lizard rushed into hiding . Once , when Andre had sat in the chair across from hers , she had said to him , " Is man all man and is woman all woman ? If so , they can never come together , since he lives for his own being and she lives for universal life , and these are opposite . " Andre had answered gravely enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that is , a part simply human , and neither male nor fe-  |p250male  . It is called the soul . It is unchanging and unchangeable . It can comprehend also the brain and its functions . " " But a woman 's brain is not the same as a man 's ? " she had asked . " It is the same only when it is freed from the needs of the flesh , " Andre had replied . " Thus a woman may use her brain only for her female duties , and a man may use his only in pursuing women for himself . But the brain is a tool , and it may be put to any use that the creature wishes . That I cut cabbages with a fine knife is not to say that I can not use that knife to carve an image of the Son of Man . If the Son of Man is in my heart , and within the vision of my soul 's sight , then I will use my tool , the brain , to make him clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue neither male nor female , " she had repeated . " It is so , " Andre had replied . " And what is the soul in its stuff ? " she had pressed him on . " It is that which we do not inherit from any other creature , " he had said . " It is that which gave me my own self , which shapes me a little different from all those who came before me , however like to them I am . It is that which is given to me for my own , a gift from God . " " And if I do not believe in God ? " she had inquired . " It does not matter whether you believe or not , " he had answered . " You can see for yourself that you are like no other in this world , and not only you , but the humblest and the least beautiful creature also has this precious residue . If you have it , you know it exists . It is enough to know that . Belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He knows that for belief we like to see with the eyes and hear with the ears , that we like to hold within our hands . So does the child also know only what its five senses can tell it . But other senses there are , and these develop as the being grows , and when they are fully developed we trust them as once we trusted only our senses . " Remembering these words of his , she looked across the table . The chair was empty , and she heard no voice . But his face was as clear to her with its grave smile , his voice as deep as ever she had seen or heard . " I only begin to understand , " she murmured . " But I do begin . And with my soul I thee love . " Was it not possible that there could be love and friendship between souls ? " It is possible , " she told him . P251Now , Madame Wu was a practical woman , and what she learned she put to use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were two disordered beings  --  that is , two who were not in right relat ion to the house and therefore to the universe . These two were Rulan and Linyi . Without haste , and allowing many days to pass , she nevertheless approached the day when she chose in her mind to speak with them , and first she would speak with Rulan , who was the elder . It had been many months since Tsemo and Fengmo had left the home . Letters came to Madame Wu regularly , for the two were good sons . These letters were addressed to their father and to her , and after she had read them first and pondered over them , she sent them to Mr. Wu . After he had read them , he sent them to Liangmo , who more and more was taking over all the duties of the lands and shops , in preparation for the day when he would be the head of the family , and he read them and then put them in the family records . From these letters Madame Wu had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . Fengmo had wished to go abroad to study . She had given her permission and had sent the money which he required . There was some haste , he said , for the ocean roads were closing because of approaching war , and were he not to be caught , he must set sail without taking the long inland journey back to his home . Had he been an only son Madame Wu would never have allowed this , but since she had so many sons , she did not press him to return before he went . He had set sail on a late winter day , he had crossed the seas in safety , and his letters now bore a strange postmark and stamp . These were American , but for this Madame Wu cared nothing . All outer countries were equally interesting and even alike to her , if they lay beyond the four seas . Fengmo pursued the studies which Andre had begun . Madame Wu was relieved to see that they had nothing to do with priesthood and religions . They had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Tsemo had not asked to cross the waters . Instead , he had gone to the capital and there had found a good place through his family 's wealth and influence . This did not amaze either Mr. Wu or Madame Wu herself , for however large her mind was , still it seemed only natural to her that everywhere the family should be known . Then Tsemo wrote the real reason why he had been so fortunate . Were there to come the war which threatened , the government would re- P252treat inland , and there it would depend very much on the highest citizens and their families , of whom in their province the Wu family was the greatest and most ancient . Tsemo was given much preference , therefore , and had to endure jealousy and envy and some malice from others who were put aside . But he was young and hard and drove his own way for himself . Madame Wu could not discover from his letters what he was . Fengmo she understood better . In his own way he was opening his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was growing into a man and , more than that , his own residue , as Andre had called it , was growing also . But Tsemo seemed possessed . What possessed him she did not know . The matter of Tsemo was hastened by the sudden news of attack by the East Ocean people that year on the coast . Madame Wu heard this , and she sent for newspapers , which she never read usually , to discover what had taken place . What she read was common enough in the history of the country . So other attacks had been made in many previous centuries by other peoples , and the nation had always stood . It would stand now , and she was not troubled . It was not likely that enemies would pierce the hundreds of miles inland to this province where the house of Wu had stood so long . But she was grateful to the past generations in the family that they had not yielded , as so many had , to new times , and so had not pressed toward the sea to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had built upon its ancestral lands and had remained there . Today they were safe . True , this enemy attacked also from the air . Yet there were no great cities near here , and it was not likely that the ignorant East Ocean people would know the name of one family above another . Madame Wu felt safe in her own house . But the attack forced a swift change , nevertheless . The government was moved inland , and Tsemo came with it . He wrote one day in the next early autumn that he would come home for ten or twelve days . With this letter , Madame Wu knew she must not delay the matter of Rulan . She sent for the young woman by Ying as messenger . Now , it is not to be supposed that in all these months Madame Wu had not seen her daughter-in-law . She had seen Rulan often . At the table she had seen her among the others , and at the usual festivals of spring and winter Rulan was there , always quiet and sober in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished some writing done for the records of the family and for the harvests , and P253she had called upon Rulan for this , because of them all Rulan brushed the clearest letters . She had been kind to her youngdaughter-in law at all times , and once she had even said , " It is well enough to have one daughter-in-law who is learned . " To this Rulan had replied with only a few necessary words of thanks . But at no time had Madame Wu drawn the girl out of her place in the family . Now , with Tsemo 's last letter in her hands , she knew the time had come . Rulan walked quietly through the courts . She no longer wore the hard leather shoes which she had brought with her from Shanghai . Instead she wore velvet ones , cloth-soled . Madame Wu did not hear her footsteps , and when the tall shadow fell across the floor she looked up in surprise . " Daughter , how softly you walk , " she exclaimed after greetings . " I put aside my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down , not sidewise , but squarely on her chair , which was against a sidewall and so was lower than the one Madame Wu used . They sat in the sitting room , not in the library . Madame Wu did not at once approach what was in her mind to say . Instead she said courteously , " It has been in my thoughts these several weeks to ask about your family in Shanghai . When the enemy attacked , did they escape ? " " My father took the household to Hong Kong , " Rulan replied . " Ah , a long way , " Madame Wu said kindly . " But not long enough , " Rulan said with some energy . " I have told my father so . " " You believe that the enemy will dare to attack so far ? " Madame Wu inquired . She could not but be impressed with the girl 's quickness . " It will be a long war , " Rulan replied . " Indeed ! " Madame Wu remarked . " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in preparation . " " Explain this to me , if you please , " Madame Wu said . The girl 's certainty amused her . So Rulan explained : " Mother , the East Ocean people have long been afraid , centuries afraid . And of what ? Of foreign attack . They have seen one country after another attacked and possessed . Out of the West have the conquerors come . Even when Genghis Khan came P254and conquered our nation , the East Ocean people began to be afraid . Then men came out of Portugal and Spain , out of Holland and France , and took countries for themselves . And England took India , and we have been all but taken , too , again and again , by these greedy Westerners . Why , ' thus the East Ocean people reason , should we be spared ? ' So out of fear they have set out to seize lands and peoples for their own , and we are their nearest neighbor . " This was monstrous talk for a young woman , and Madame Wu was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things . " Where did you get all this knowledge ? " Madame Wu asked . " Tsemo writes me every week , " Rulan said . Madame Wu felt her heart loosen with relief . She smiled . " You two , " she said , " are you good friends ' again ? " Rulan 's checks grew red . By nature she was pale , except for her crimson lips , and the flush was plain enough , but she did not turn her head away . " We agree wonderfully when we are not together , " she said . " As soon as he comes we will quarrel again  --  I know it . I have told him so . We both know it . " " But if you know it , " Madame Wu said with laughter , " can you not guard against it ? Which of you begins it first  --  you or he ? " In spite of her amusement she was pleased that the girl did not try to hide anything . " Neither of us knows , " Rulan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , in our letters , that whoever begins , the other will speak to stop it . But I have no faith in our ability . I know Tsemo 's temper . It comes up like thunder in the summer . Without reason it is there , and when he is angry , then I am angry . " She paused and frowned . She searched herself , and Madame Wu gave her time . She went on , " There is something in me which he hates . Now that is true . He says there is nothing , but there is . When we are parted he does not feel it . When we come together it is there . If I knew what it was I would take a knife and cut it out of myself . " " Perhaps it is not something which is there , but something which is not there , " Madame Wu said gently . Rulan lifted her head . Her eyes , which were her beauty , looked startled . " That I never thought of , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make it very hard . It would be easier to take something out of myself that I have than to put something in which I have not . "   " This need not be true , " Madame Wu told her . " It depends altogetheron your love for Tsemo . If you think of your marriage as something only for your two selves , well , then you must always quarrelunless you can determine to stay apart from each other . " " You mean  --  " Rulan said and could not finish . In the female part of her being she was very shy . " I do mean that , " Madame Wu said . She went on speaking out of a wisdom which she knew came to her from her own knowledge of love . Now she knew that between men and women there is no duty . There is only love  --  or no love . She reached for her silver pipe and began to fill it slowly . She did not look at her daughter-in-law for a while . Instead she gazed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this season . The bamboosfluttered their leaves like tassels in the slight wind . It was the sort of day that she and Andre had loved best because of its peace . " In the first place , you must know that neither of you owes anything to the other , " she began at last . Rulan interrupted her with surprise . " Mother , this is the strangest thing I ever did hear said from a mother-in-law to her son 's wife . " " I have learned it only recently , " Madame Wu said . She smiled with secret mischief . " Credit me , child , that I am still learning ! " She was pulling Rulan by the heart . The girl had come prepared for her mother-in-law 's anger and humbled to receive it . Now hope moved in her . It was not anger that she was to receive , but wisdom . She leaned forward like a tall lily waiting for rain . " Trouble between men and women always arises from the belief that there is some duty between them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given up that belief , the way becomes clear . Each has a duty only to himself . And how to himself ? Only to fulfill himself . If one is wholly fulfilled , the other is fulfilled also . " She paused , lit her pipe , smoked two puffs , and blew out the ash . Then she went on , " And why is this true ? Because , in the words of sages , The husband is not dear for the husband 's sake but for the self 's sake , and the wife is not dear to him for her sake , but for his own sake . ' It is when the one is happy that the other is happy , and it is the only happiness possible for both . " Rulan sat motionless , listening . Madame Wu went on , " As for procreation , it is a duty not to him nor to you . It is your common duty to our kind . Where you have made your mistake is that you have confused the bearing of children P256with your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confused Tsemo . That is why he is so easily angry with you . " " Mother , " Rulan begged her , " speak on to me . You are coming into the heart . " " You and Tsemo departed from the usual tradition , " Madame Wu said plainly . " You chose each other because you loved each other . This is dangerous because the chances of what may be called happinessare much lessened thereby . You and Tsemo thought only of yourselves , not of your children , not of your family , not of your duty to carry on your kind . You thought only of yourselves , as two beings separate from all others . But you arc not separate , except in a small part of yourselves . Now you are trying to force all your lives into that small part of yourselves . The begetting , conceiving , and bearing of your children , the living together in all ways of eating and sleeping and dressing and coming in and going out  --  all you are trying to force into that small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is crowded , and you are choking each other at your sources . You are too close . You will hate each other because that part of you which is you , yourselves  --  your residue , your soul  --  has no space left in which to breathe and to grow . " Now she looked at Rulan . The girl 's whole being was listening . " Separate yourself , my child , " she said . " Let him separate himself . Accept as a matter of course , as a duty to our kind , that you will bear children . They are not his children nor yours . They are the children of the race . Bear them as naturally as you breathe and eat and sleep and perform all your other functions as a physical creature . Begetting and conceiving have nothing to do with your souls . Do not test the measure of his love for you by the way in which he expresses his body 's heat . He is not thinking of you at those times . He is thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's passion differ from another 's ? It does not . And no more does one woman bear children differently from another . In such things we are all alike . Do not imagine that in this he or you is different from the commonest man and woman . " She paused , and a strange feeling of exhaustion came over her . " You make me feel that marriage is nothing , " Rulan said in a low voice . " I might as well have been married to anyone as to Tsemo . " Energy returned to Madame Wu . " I have not finished , " she said .. " In one sense , you are right . Any healthy young woman can marry any healthy young man and both can fulfill their duty to life . For P257this reason it is well that our old traditions be maintained . Older personscan certainly choose better for the race than the young ones can for themselves . Consider Liangmo and Meng  --  they are happy . But certainly they have not absolute happiness , as you and Tsetnu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their whole life . Ii angmo has no other ambition than to be a good husband and father . Neither of them asks more . For this it is best that the elders choose the two who are to marry , if the two are like Liangmo , and Meng . " " But we are not like them , " Rulan said with some heat . " You are not , " Madame Wu agreed . " You wish friendship and companionship between your two individual selves . Ah , you ask very much of marriage , my child . Marriage was not designed for this extra burden . " " What would we have done ? Lived without marriage ? " Rulan inquiredwithout meaning rudeness . " Perhaps  --  perhaps . " Madame Wu was surprised to hear herself say . " But that , too , is difficult , since you are man and woman and the body demands its own life . " She paused , searching for words which were never in her before , and she found them . " You and Tsemo are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then love each other , my child ! Life is too short for such love . Love one another and do not waste one hour in anger . Divide your love from your passion and let there be no confusion between the two . Some day , when the division is clear and established by habit , when your children are born and growing and your bodies are old , and passion gone , as , mercifully , it does go , you will know the best love of all . " She was suddenly intensely lonely for Andre , and the knowledge that never again would she look upon his living face pierced her with an agony she had not yet felt . She closed her eyes and endured the pain . Then after a while she felt Rulan take her hand and press it to her cheeks . She felt one warm cheek and then the other . But , still she did not open her eyes . " And in secret the woman has to lead , " she said . " In secret the woman always has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , and upon her alone . I warn you , my son will be of no help to you in making your marriage happy . " When she opened her eyes again the room was empty . Rulan had gone . P258That night when Ying undressed her for bed Madame Wu spoke , after silence so long and deep that Ying had not dared to break it with her usual chatter . " Ying ! " " Yes , Mistress ? " Ying looked into the mirror over Madame Wu 's head . She was brushing the long black silken hair that was only now beginning to show a few feathers of white at the temples . " I have a task for you . " " Yes , Mistress ? " " In less than a month my second son will come home . " " I know that , Mistress . We all know it . " " This is the task . Every night when you have finished with me , you are to go to my second son 's wife and do for her what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror , but Madame Wu did not smile back , She went on , not meeting Ying 's eyes . " You are to forget nothing that I used to do  --  the fragrant bath , the scenting of the seven orifices , the smoothing with oil , the perfume in the hair . " " I know , Lady . " Ying 's voice was warm and intimate . Then she stayed the brush . " What if she forbids me ? " she asked . " That one cares nothing for her beauty . " " She will not forbid you , " Madame Wu said . " She needs help , poor child , as all women need it . And she knows it now . " " Yes , Mistress , " Ying said . T SEMO came home on the fifth day of the ninth moon month . The news of his coming was brought by electric letter to the city and by foot-messenger to the house of Wu , and Mr. Wu himself took the letter to Madame Wu . He did not often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw him she knew that it had to do with one of the sons . He held out the sheet of paper . " Our second son comes home , " he said with his wide smile . She took the letter and read it and turned it over and over in her hands . It was the first time she had ever seen an electric letter . She knew , because once Andre had explained it , that the paper itself was not blown over the wires as she had imagined it . Not even words P259were spoken . Symbols were beaten upon a machine , and by these the messages were carried . " The drums of savages , beaten in the jungle , " she had remarked . " Much that man does is only the refinement of savagery , " he had replied . She recalled these words as she mused over the electric letter . " We must prepare a welcoming feast , " she said aloud . " I shall invite all my friends , " Mr. Wu declared . She proceeded to plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the shop clerks and the farm workers . " " Everythingeverything , " he declared in his large lordly manner . She looked at him from under her half-veiled eyes . He had returned to his old self . jasmine had done him good . He was reassured of his own worth . His failure with herself , for in his own way he had been mortified that she had rejected him , and his failure with Ch'iuming had done him harm . He was the sort of man who had constantly to feel himself successful with his women . How well she knew , who had for so many years made his success her duty ! But Ch'iuming was young and ignorant , and she had not understood these things , and Jasmine was , in the midst of all her falsity , sincere enough in this business by which she earned her rice and roof . Madame Wu felt her secret heart grow light , and also cool and scornful . She felt somewhat ashamed of such malice , although once she would have accepted it as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman without sin , " she had once told Andre . " That is , if I am to accept your measure of sin  --  the secret thought , the hiddenwish . Outer rectitude I can attain , but who can control the heart ? " " A few can also do it , " he had replied . " You are one of those few . " She knew that if she were to continue near him she must attain the heights where he lived . He would not come down to her . So now she spoke patiently with Mr. Wu , who was the father of her sons . " Let everything be as you wish . " He leaned forward , his hands on his fat knees , smiling . He lowered his voice to speak to her in confidence . " It may be you do not know that Tsemo is my favorite son . For that reason I have always been disturbed that his wife is an angry woman . Tsemo should have marriedsomeone soft and reasonable . " Madame Wu could not conceal all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . In her own ears she heard her voice too silvery P260sharp . " He is intelligent . Rulan is also intelligent . I find I think betterof her as time goes on . " Mr. Wu looked alarmed , as he always did at the mention of intelligence , and hastily he withdrew . " Well , well , " he said , in his usual voice , " I dare say you are right . Then will you arrange matters or shall I ? " " I will order what is to be within the house , and you shall invite the guests and decide the wines , " she said . They bowed and parted , and she knew as he went away that what had been between them was only of the flesh . He was repulsive to her . Yet had they not fulfilled the very duty of which she had spoken to Rulan ? They had carried on the family through their generation , they had fulfilled the instincts of their race , and they had freed themselvesfrom each other when this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had discovered for her the residue of her individual self , Jasmine had done the same for Mr. Wu . No ties had been broken , the house continued as before , and their position in it was the same . She felt the wisdom of bringing Jasmine under the roof , this roof wide enough for all of the least of the house of Wu . The supreme sin of giving birth to a nameless and illegitimate child would not be theirs . Jasmine 's children would have their place in the human order . She felt peace upon her as she proceeded to the day 's duty . She had no time today for herself . She sent for cook and steward and headwaiter , she sent for the cleaning maids and the seamstresses . The children'sclothes must be inspected , and those who needed new garmentsmust have them made . Yenmo , her youngest son , must come in from the country . " It is time , " she told the land steward , " that my fourth son return to the home . Affairs are now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Madame , this son will be the one to manage the land after you . Our eldest young lord does well in the shops , but the little fourth lord is made for the land . " Madame Wu had not seen her fourth son in many months , and now she felt some wonder in her about him . During the years of change from child to man all males were the same , she had always said . They needed only to be fed , to be taught the same things , to live much in the open air , to be kept away from gambling places and brothels and family dissensions . For this reason she had sent Yenmo into the country to live with country cousins and farmers . Now he must come back and let her take his measure .   " Prepare the two small rooms in my eldest son 's east court , " she commanded Ying . " They are full of boxes and waste now , and used by no one . Let them be furnished for Yenmo . They shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been placed near his father , but that she would not allow . Neither did she want him too near herself , this hearty lusty growing youth . But Liangmo and Meng would be kind to him , and the children would enjoy him . Thus everything was prepared . Last of all did Madame Wu herself inspect Rulan . It was the very day of the return . Tsemo would come sometime after midday , but none could tell when , for he must come by boat . It was a pity that the motorcar could not be sent for him , but the road was too narrow and the farmers cried to Heaven if its great wheels ran on their soil . It remained therefore in the special room by the gate where it was kept , a thing for wonder and amazement to all who saw it , but of little real use . Yet Mr. Wu would have felt himself very backward and old-fashioned had he not bought it , and it was comfort even to Tsemo to say carelessly in company , " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wu , very docile and even shy . She had put on a new robe of a clear dark red , and this firm color suited her pale skin and red mouth . Madame Wu approved its close cut , its length , and did not mention the shortness of the sleeves , since Rulan had beautiful arms and hands . She bade Ying open her jewel box and from it she selected a thick gold ring set with rubies . This ring she put on the middle finger of Rulan 's right hand , and Rulan lifted her hand to admire it . " I dislike rings usually , Mother , " she said , " but this one I like . " " It suits you , " Madame Wu replied , " and what suits a woman makes her beautiful . " Rulan had washed her hair freshly , but she had not oiled it and it lay on her shoulders as soft as unwound silk . Ying had cut its edge even and smooth . It was a very new fashion for young women to let their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . She would have complained had Meng copied it . But today she saw that the softnessset off Rulan 's face , and again she did not speak against it . Whatever made a woman more beautiful was to be accepted . " Open your mouth , " she commanded Rulan . The girl opened her mouth and Madame Wu peered into it . It was red and clean as a P262child 's , and the teeth were white and sound . From this mouth came a sweet fresh breath . She lifted the girl 's skirts and examined the inner garments . All were clean as snow , all scented , and prettily embroidered . She lifted the girl 's hands and smelled the palms . They were scented , and her hair was scented , and from her body came the delicatescent which once she herself had used . " You will do well enough , my child , " Madame Wu said kindly . " I find no fault with your body . I can not examine your heart and your mind  --  these you must examine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residue is what lasts . " " I have forgotten nothing you told me , " Rulan said solemnly . Now Tsemo was expected any time within four or five hours , but who could know that while all this was going on in the house of the Wu family he was approaching by sky and not by water ? Thus , instead of coming to the land by the river , he came down out of the sky and touched earth just outside the low wall on the south side of the town . When his superior officer in the capital had heard of his return home , the weight of the Wu family in that province was such that he had sent him with a government plane and pilot . The pilot was concerned when he dropped his passenger upon a field , with no one near to meet him . But Tsemo laughed at him . " This is my home town , " he said . " I can find my own way . " So the pilot took off again into the sky , and Tsemo walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went and askinghim how he came , and goggling and silenced by wonder when he said , " I came by empty air . " Children and idlers ran ahead to tell them at the house of Wu that the Second Lord was coming , but Tsemo walked in such long strong steps that he was very close behind . Thus Madame Wu and Rulan had barely heard the gateman 's wife , who had run in to gasp out her news , when Tsemo himself was at her heels . By right he should have gone first to his father , but be sure Liangmo had written him who was in his father 's courts , and he had no mind to see a strange woman before he saw his mother . Therefore he went first to Madame Wu and was confounded to see with her Rulan , his own wife . It was an awkward moment , for by old tradition he should not greet his wife before his mother . To his surprise Rulan helped him . She fell back gracefully and gave him time and space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This was Madame Wu 's greeting . P263She put out her hands and felt of his arms and his shoulders as mothers do . " You are thinner than you were but sounder , " she said . " Harder and healthier , " she added , looking at his ruddy fact . " I am well , " he said , " but very busy  --  indeed , busy half to death . And you , Mother , look well  --  better than when I went away . " This and more passed between them , and still Rulan stood waiting , and Tsemo wondered very much at this patience . It was not like her to be patient . To his further surprise , his mother now stepped back and put out her hand and took Rulan 's and drew her forward . " She has been very good , " Madame Wu said . " She has been obedient , and she has tried hard and done well . " Nothing could have pleased Tsemo so much as this commendation of his wife by his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ praise of what he had done . She had never praised Rulan before , and it had been one of the causes of his anger against Rulan that his mother had not praised her . This Madame Wu now understood . She saw the pleasure in his handsome face , in his free smile , in his brighteningeyes . He spoke a few words to Rulan , cool as such words should be in the presence of the older generation . " Ah  --  you are well ? " " Thank you , I am well  --  and you ? " These were the few words they spoke with their lips , but their eyes said more . For Rulan lifted her eyes to his , and he saw her more nearly beautiful than he had ever seen her , the red cloth of her gown close fitting about her neck and-lending depth to her golden pallor . He withdrew his eyes and turned to his mother , stammering and blushing . " Mother , thank you very much for taking time to teach her  --  for taking time to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My son , at last I will say , You have chosen well : " She saw tears come into Rulan 's eyes , and a tenderness she had never known before filled her being . How helpless were the young and in spite of all their bravery , how needy of the old to approve them ! " Be tender to the young , they did not ask to be born , " Andre had once said to her . She remembered it well , for on that day she had been angry with Fengmo because he came late . " Nor did I ask to be born , " she had retorted . He had looked at her with that large deep gaze of his . " Ah , because you have suffered is the one reason why you should never make P264others suffer , " he had said . " Only the small and the mean retaliate for pain . You , Madame , are too high for it . " She had accepted this in silence , swallowing anger . He had gone on , escaping from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering , " he had mused , " if it does not teach us , who are the strong , to prevent it for others ? We are shown what it is , we taste the bitterness , in order to stir us to the will to cast it out of the world . Else this earth itself is hell . " Now , remembering his words , she felt an immeasurable longing to make these two happy in her house . She took Rulan 's hand and Tsemo 's hand and clasped them together . " Your duty to me is done , my son , " she said . " Take her to your own courts and spend your next half-hour with her alone . It will be ' time enough then to go and greet your father . " She watched them go away , hand still in hand , and sat down , smiled , and smoked her silver pipe awhile . For the next ten days the house was a turmoil of feasting . Every relative near and far wished to see Tsemo and talk with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the removal of the seat of government inland and what he thought the price of rice would be as a consequence of the disturbances , and whether the foreign white people would fight with the East Ocean dwarfs or against them . No one thought of defeat by the enemy . The only question was whether there should be the open resistance of arms or the secret resistance of time . Tsemo , being young , was for open resistance . Mr. Wu , knowing nothing of such things , followed his mind . But Madame Wu , sitting among the family , listening , smoking her little pipe , saying nothing except to direct a child to be taken out to make water , or to be put to bed to sleep , or bidding a servant be quiet in filling the tea bowls , or some such thing , knew that for herself she believed that only by secret resistance of time could they overcome this enemy as they had overcome all others . In her own mind she did not favor allowing foreign peoples to come in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his blood without asking much in return ? It was beyond justice to give without getting , outside the family . But she kept silence . Here she was only a woman , although the most respected under the roof . Long ago in that freedom which she had known only with Andre , they had argued human nature .   " You believe in God and I believe in justice , " she had declared . " You struggle toward one and I toward the other . " " They are the same , " he had declared . Today , sitting among her family , she felt deeply lonely . Here Andre had never come and could not come . " Those foreigners , " she said suddenly to Tsemo , " if they come here on our soil can we drive them out again ? " " We can only think of the present , day by day , " he declared . " That is not the way of our people , " she replied . " We have always thought in hundreds of years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " we can drive them all out . " " In this residue of the individual creature , " she had once asked Andre , " are there color and tradition and nationality and enmity ? " " No , " he had replied . " There are only stages of development . At all levels , you will find souls from among all peoples . " " Then why , " she had asked , " is there war among people and among nations ? " " Wars , " he had replied , " come between those of the lowest levels . In any nation observe how few actually join in war , how unwillingly they fight , with how little heart ! It is the undeveloped who love war . " She pondered these things while Tsemo talked briskly of regimentsand tanks and bombing planes and all these things which for her had no meaning . At last she forgot herself and yawned so loudly that everyone turned to look at her , and she laughed . " You must forgive me , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war do not interest me . " She rose , and Ying hastened to her side and , nodding and smiling her farewells , she returned to her own courts . On the eleventh day Tsemo went away . The airplane returned for him , and this time a great conclave of people from the house and the town gathered to see him fly up . Madame Wu was not one of these . All that he had said during these ten days had fatigued her very much . She felt that it was only folly for a young man to spend his life at these matters of war and death . There was no value here , either for the family or for himself . Life was the triumphant force , and the answer to enemy and to death was life and more life . But when she said this he was impatient with her . " Mother , " he cried , " you do not understand . " At this universal cry of youth she had smiled and returned to silence . She bade him good-by sweetly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
