( See Cover ) Above the Potomac on a hill southeast of Georgetown , not far from where the new national Capitol was abuilding , black-thatched , hot-eyed Lieut . Colonel William Ward Burrows , Commandant of the U. S. <P> Marine Corps , sat at his desk . Above the high scarlet collar surmounting golden epaulets , the Commandant 's face was stern . Through the open window came the shouts and murmurs of the camp-the Marines ' first headquarters camp in Washington . He set down the date- " Sept. 22 , 1800 . " Over rough paper the quill began to scratch : " Lt. Henry Caldwell " Sir : Yesterday the Secretary told me that he understood one of the Lieutenants of the Navy had struck you . ... I can only say that a blow ought never to be forgiven and without you wipe away this Insult offered to the Marine Corps you can not expect to join our officers . . . . <P> I have wrote to Capt . Carmick , who is at Boston , to call on you &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will take care of you , but do n't let me see you ' till you have wip 'd away this Disgrace . ... On board the Ganges about 12 Mos. ago , Lt. Gale was struck by an Officer of the Navy . The Capt . took no notice of the Business and Gale got no satisfaction on the cruise ; the moment he arrived he call 'd the Lieut , out and shot him ; afterwards Politeness was restored . " Few days later " the Business " was settled to Colonel Burrows ' satisfaction : Lieut . Jewitt of the Navy made public apology for his hasty blow . A month later , on Nov. 10 , 1800 , the Corps celebrated its twenty-fifth birthday . <P> This week in Tientsin , in Portsmouth , N. H. , in Cavite and Shanghai , at Alaska , Guantanamo Bay , there will be parades , radio speeches and assorted red fire . Thus the Marine Corps will celebrate its 165th birthday . Since it was founded , the Marine Corps has had only 17 commandants ; the head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 15th successor : crop-headed , broad-chinned Major General Thomas Holcomb , spectacled veteran of more than 40 years ' service . Burrows ' command was only a few hundred men , armed with muzzle-loading muskets . <P> Tommy Holcomb 's Corps musters close to 40,000 , includes a small , well-integrated army ( the Fleet Marine Force ) equipped with tanks , airplanes , machine guns , artillery . But in Holcomb 's day , as in Burrows ' , the Marines still insist on restoring Politeness .
