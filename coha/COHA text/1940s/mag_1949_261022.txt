Aboard an airliner winging its bumpy way over Texas one day in 1941 , the pale-faced little stewardess felt too sick to serve dinner . Hustling , bustling Passenger James Kirby Dobbs , then joint owner of 46 food shops scattered through twelve states and an old hand at doing things for himself , quickly volunteered to serve . But one look at the unpalatable food made Dobbs queasy himself . Then &; there he decided that he could put up better meals to serve aloft than the airlines . <P> To prove his point , Dobbs bought an airport restaurant back home in Memphis . Before long , his reputation for tasty , packaged plane meals enabled him to branch out to airports in 21 other cities , begin catering to 16 U.S. airlines . In San Antonio this week , he opens his newest airport restaurant , serving such Dobbs delicacies as rainbow trout cooked in almond sauce , and baked potatoes kept hot in metal foil . This year Jimmy Dobbs , 55 , expects his airport restaurant gross to exceed $5,000,000 , net $300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the food business since he was twelve ( when he sold peanuts &; popcorn ) , Jimmy Dobbs had long considered it something of a sideline . His big business has been selling cars . A crack salesman at 26 , when he made $13,000 a year , he borrowed $20,000 from his boss and teamed up with a hard-headed engineer , Horace H. Hull , to form a Memphis Ford agency . <P> By cutting costs to the bone and cutting employees in on profits , Dobbs and Hull made their Ford agency the world 's largest ( they branched out to eight other cities ) and made themselves millionaires . Says Dobbs : " It 's all profit sharing . The more your employees make , the more you make yourself . " Each month , as soon as enough cash had been taken in to cover overhead , Dobbs told his salesmen to cut profits to $1 a car , if necessary to get sales , because the $1 was all profit . <P> Bums for Lunch . By 1934 , things were going so well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But not long after they bought into the Toddle Houses food shops , a Southern restaurant chain , they got in a fight with other directors who opposed their system of employee profit sharing . So Hull and Dobbs set up Toddle-like restaurants in non-Toddle cities . <P> When Toddle Houses located competing restaurants near Dobbs Houses and started a price war , Jimmy Dobbs hammered back . He rounded up the smelliest bums he could find and sent them to Toddle Houses to eat during rush hours . By 1941 , Toddle Houses had enough . It bought the 46 Dobbs Houses for $500,000 . Hull decided to concentrate on car selling ( the company will gross more than $50 million this year , net $2,500,000 ) , and Dobbs moved into the airports . <P> Over a Barrel . Jimmy Dobbs knew he could not depend on air traffic alone to support his restaurants . So he tricked them out in local color ( his Atlanta restaurant is decorated with Uncle Remus murals and has a Negro " Uncle Remus " doorman perched on a cotton bale outside ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his tables . <P> Scornful of high-priced chefs ( " they 'll get you over a barrel for money and when they leave they take their recipes with them " ) , Dobbs turns out cooking instructions which are so detailed that almost anyone , including himself , can make his dishes .
