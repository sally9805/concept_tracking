In medicine , as in other fields , spring is the time for laurels . Last week two outstanding medical scientists got theirs , with some berries attached . <P> Glycogen . The $5,000 annual award of the Sugar Research Foundation went to Austrian-born Dr. Carl Cori of Washington University Medical School , St. Louis . Pale , tall Dr. Cori , 51 , specializes in sugar , the basic fuel of human metabolism . For 20 years he has traced the progress of sugar through the body , watched it turn into glycogen ( animal starch ) , measured how much glycogen is stored in the muscles and liver . <P> Cori 's most important work throws light on the mysterious action of insulin . A shot of insulin allows a diabetic to use up sugar as a normal person does . But if insulin is added to sugar in a test tube , nothing happens . Why ? Apparently the body furnishes other substances to effect the reaction . Dr. Cori has found some of these substances and has learned how they work . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foundation ) to get the idea that he knows the whole story of sugar . If he did , he could answer a question that stumps all medicos : just how does sugar fuel the body 's metabolism ? <P> Grisein . The $5,000 Passano Foundation Award ( kicked in by Williams &; Wilkins of Baltimore , medical publishers ) went to Russian-born Dr. Selman Abraham Waksman , 59 , microbiologist of Rutgers and the New Jersey Agricultural Station . Dr. Waksman is certainly a leading U.S.-authority on antibiotics . His best-known discovery ( 1945 ) was streptomycin , the antibiotic which has shown most promise in the fight against tuberculosis . Early this year he persuaded his favorite mold ( Actinomyces griseus ) to produce another antibiotic ( TIME , Feb. 10 ) . The new one , " grisein , " teams up efficiently with streptomycin ( in the test tube ) to fight a variety of stubborn bacteria .
