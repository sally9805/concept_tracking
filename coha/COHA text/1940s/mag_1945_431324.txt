 | HIGH LIGHT of a naval officer 's career comes when he is skipper of his own fighting ship in time of war . This certainly proved true in my case. * The captain of the ship is master of every man aboard and every plank and intricate mechanism ? the tools to make his ship the best in the fleet . It was my privilege to command the U. S. aircraft carrier Princeton , which was lost on October 24 , 1944 , in the Battle for Leyte Gulf . Princeton Fought in Every Major Battle During her active life of 17 months , the Princeton steamed approximately 150,000 sea miles , an average of nearly 300 a day . She took part in every major naval engagement in that period . Her pilots knocked down 186 Jap planes in aerial combat and destroyed uncounted others on enemy airfields . Her antiaircraft guns accounted for seven more . And in her sweeps from the Gilberts to the Philippines and from the South Pacific to the Ryukyus , at Japan 's very doorstep , she sank or crippled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many Pacific islands . Truly our ship , in her short career , made a name for herself that will live long in naval annals . The Princeton began life on the ways as a light cruiser . Early in the war the Navy desperately needed more flattops ; so flight decks were added to nine cruiser hulls and the Independence-class light carrier was born . Princeton was the second of these ( page 215 ) . Our ship , about half the tonnage of a big Essex-class carrier , carried only one squadron each of fighters and torpedo bombers . But she had plenty of speed . Built by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation at Camden , New jersey , she was christened by Mrs. Harold Dodds , wife of the President of Princeton University , in honor of the Battle of Princeton , January 3 , 1777 , which followed George Washington 's recrossing of the Delaware .

The shakedown was followed by the trip to the Pacific , where the Princeton operated until her loss . The Princeton began her active war career in the assault and occupation of Baker Island , in August and September , 1943 . Thus she entered the greatest ocean war in naval history just as our team started its relentless march across the Central Pacific to Japan . Air resistance in the Baker area was negligible , and our fighter and bomber pilots obtained valuable combat experience at practically no cost . In all her air strikes and battles against the Japs , Princeton operated as a unit in the " Big Show ' ' ? our fast task force composed of many carriers supported by new battleships , cruisers , and destroyers . This phase of our Pacific war was a welcome change from the days I knew before the Battle of Midway . Then only a handful of cruisers and destroyers supported one or two carriers . We depended largely upon surprise to get close . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1943 , the picture was changed .

' After Baker Island was occupied , the Princeton participated in air strikes on Tarawa and Makin , in the Gilberts , in September , 1943 . This operation was a softening process , designed to wipe out Jap aircraft and destroy ground facilities , thus paving the way for the landings later . November found the globe-trotting Princeton , after a quick trip back to Pearl Harbor , way out in the South Pacific , making air strikes on Buka , Bonis , and Rabaul , in Admiral Halsey 's domain ( map , 210-211 ) . These were the first carrier air strikes on the strong Jap * For his services in command of the U.S.S.

Returning to Eniwetok , we devoted the remainder of the month to supporting our troops until Jap resistance ceased . When things got slack , I went down to the information center to listen to the radio . It was fascinating to hear the ground forces talking to each other in combat . A tank commander would shout against the static of gunfire , " Look out for that Jap gun on the right ! " Or an aviator would tell a pal what he had hit . It was like listening to an Army-Navy football game , but much more exciting . The wonderful teamwork among the air , sea , and ground forces was strikingly brought out by these radio conversations . 192 The National Gec  | Off Eniwetok the ship had her first birthday , February 25 , 1944 .

Once in a while , when a pilot came back with an exciting story , I had him tell it over the loud-speaker while it was fresh in his mind . Majuro , a Future Vacation Isle Following Eniwetok , we proceeded to our new anchorage at Majuro for rest and upkeep . This beautiful large lagoon , surrounded by coconut islets , was taken over without a fight from the Japs . Majuro served as the fleet 's main base for the Marianas and Palau campaigns . Someday it may be an attractive stopover for air travelers across the Pacific . We arranged boat trips to the islands for the officers and men . Under the coconut palms we set up beer stands . All hands enjoyed the swimming and beer parties .

Working together , Army and Navy landbased planes searched ahead of the fleet to keep our progress hidden . Although we were deep in Jap territory , they succeeded splendidly , for we were not detected until the late afternoon before our first attack on Palau . Then some Jap torpedo and bomber planes came out , but were disposed of by our fighters and ships ' AA batteries . Our strikes at the Carolines continued for three successive days , inflicting severe damage . Our ships suffered no casualties . We returned to base , first to Majuro and then to Espiritu Santo , in the South Pacific . Again there was a short period for rest , recreation , training , and refitting . About this time General MacArthur was ready to advance west along the northern coast of New Guinea to Hollandia . We supported his operation with air strikes before , during , and after the landings of American and Australian troops .

Pilots of Air Group 23 , the main offensive weapon of the Princeton , had now been aboard for well over a year and had flown many combat missions . Under the able leadership of Comdr . H. L.

So the Princeton returned to Pearl Harbor for replacements and minor repairs . At dinner in the wardroom we feted our veteran pilots , wishing them Godspeed and happy landings . Princetonians of Hawaii . including Governor Ingram M. Stainback. came aboard to dine the night we welcomed our new pilots . Air Group 27 under command of Lt. Comdr . E. WI .

Searchlights Save Pilots in Darkness Since the fighting was at extreme range , our planes returned long after dark with precious little fuel . To aid pilots in spotting their carriers and " getting down " quickly , security rules were broken and ships ' searchlights turned on . Though we were lighted up like Christmas trees and could be seen for miles , no Jap attacks developed . But many pilots were saved a dunking , guided by the friendly beams to " landing fields " floating in the Philippine Sea . Many others , forced down " in the drink " out of gas , were picked up by our destroyers . Next , the Princeton gave air support for the occupation of Guam and Tinian , which followed Saipan .

Again we softened up Jap troops and installations prior to occupation by our ground forces . We steamed west and on September 9 initiated the first carrier air strikes on the Philippines. * We started with Mindanao and proceeded up the chain of islands through the Visayas ( central Philippines ) and on to Luzon and Manila . These attacks stopped the flow of Jap planes to Palau , and also to Morotai , where troops under General MacArthur landed simultaneously with ours on Peleliu in the Palaus . Then the Princeton backtracked to the Palaus to give air support for the actual landings there . * See " Mindanao , on the Road to Tokyo , " November , 1944 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both by Frederick Simpich , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , March , 1945.  | On September 21 and 22 we were again off the Philippines . Our pilots made the first fighter sweep over Manila and did an excellent job . They knocked down 38 enemy planes with the loss of only one , but its pilot , Lt. W. E. Lamb , USN , was not missing for long . On one of these strikes , Lieutenant Lamb , the executive officer of our fighter squadron , made a forced landing in Lake Taal , 35 miles south of Manila , after Jap AA fire had damaged his engine . Later this resourceful pilot showed up at Pearl Harbor and gave an interesting account of his visit with friendly guerrillas on Jap-held Luzon and his rescue by an American submarine .

However , even along its edge we experienced high winds and rough seas , with green water breaking over even the largest ships .

On the Princeton the planes had to be secured with additional lines , and activities on the tossic : . slippery , wind-swept flight deck were limite to essentials . At Ulithi Capt . John M.

History Made in Battle for Leyte Gulf As we know , the Japs threw everything they could against us to dislodge our troops from Leyte . When information showed that the entire remaining Jap Fleet was approaching , all our carrier task groups were alerted . On October 24 the great sea Battle for Leyte Gulf began . Our 7th and 3d Fleets took on successfully everything the Japs had to offer . This battle will go down as one of the most decisive victories in history . Dawn on the 24th found our carrier task group within easy air range , east of Manila . Princeton 's main job was to send a fighter sweep over the capital . Then we were to stand by with an attack group of fully gassed and loaded torpedoplanes , with fighter escort , for a strike at important Jap naval units , or shipping in Manila Bay . As was usual when we expected strong Jap opposition , our fire hoses were run out in the hangar and on the flight deck , and the crew fed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7:50 , when a large group of enemy aircraft was reported approaching from the direction of Manila , with a second group about 15 miles behind . There were between 75 to 100 Jap planes . On the Princeton we " scrambled " our remaining Hellcats , and these , with fighters from other carriers , lost no time in closing the Japs . I ca n't speak too highly of their superb work that morning . They completely disorganized the Japs and shot down most of their planes . Later , when the story could be pieced together , we discovered that Princeton pilots shot down 36 planes while losing but one . Princeton Hit in Her Achilles Heel Suddenly , at 9:38 , a Princeton lookout detected a single Jap plane making a shallow dive on our ship from sharp on the port bow . Because of the low clouds , we had only this brief warning . Our guns , and those of other ships in company , took the Jap under fire . I started to maneuver , but there was not sufficient time ( page 214 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet . It hit the Princeton forward of the after elevator and slightly to port of the center line of the ship . The plane passed on aft and was brought down by fighters , but too late to do us any good .  | From where I stood on the bridge , the hole the flight deck appeared so small it seemed -. ardly possible that major damage had been done . I visualized slapping on a patch in a hurry and resuming operations . I must admit it hurt to see my ship injured by a Jap bomb . It was as if I had been wounded myself . But the Jap bomb had hit the Princeton in her Achilles heel . It put out of action the after fire-fighting system , and it also passed right through the gas tank of a torpedoplane in the hangar , spreading the fire instantly to ethers . It exploded between the hangar and the deck below . Flames shot down engineering spaces aft , and back into the hangar . Smoke was intense from the start , not only in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spaces forward . Very soon ft was billowing up from the sides of the ship , flowing aft , and making the stern untenable for personnel there . Heat and smoke forced these men to jump overboard . Circling destroyers picked them up . At the time of the hit we were making 24 knots . I asked the chief engineer if he wanted to slow , but he said it was not necessary . The engineering plant was all right , except that conditions were fast becoming bad for personnel . Very soon gas tanks of other planes began exploding , freeing more gasoline . Ammunition in the guns , plus a reserve stored in the hangar , started popping . All this added to the inferno . I slowed to 18 knots and began getting personnel out of the lower spaces before they were overcome by heat and smoke . As the wounded Princeton was retarding his task group , Rear Adm . F. C : Sherman soon left us to conduct air strikes , but detached the cruiser Reno and three destroyers to assist us . Explosions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Torpedoes in the burning planes let go with a mighty roar . The first blew out the after elevator . Shortly after , another mighty blast buckled the flight deck , leaving holes in it . From my control station in the " island " ( bridge tower ) I could see the smoke and raging fire down in the hangar . Soon the forward elevator was blown out , and hot smoke pouring up into the island drove us to the flight deck . These terrible explosions were always accompanied by flying fragments , which caused many casualties . There were some even on the bridge . Before leaving my control station I told the chief engineer to secure below and passed the word over the announcing system , " All hands topside ! " I had turned the ship 60 ? to the right of the wind , which was blowing about 17 knots . The smoke and fire then drew aft on the slowed until we were dead in the water .

Seeing our heavy explosions , Admiral Sherman dispatched the cruiser Birmingham and another destroyer to our assistance . From then on we had two cruisers and four destroyers to render aid . Destroyer Irwin Rescues Hundreds About 10:10 the Irwin came alongside to port , the windward side ( page 191 ) . We lowered the seriously wounded directly to her forecastle . Many men abandoned ship by lines dangling from the Princeton . Others jumped , then swam to the Irwin or to life rafts thrown in the water . A few caught between the two hulls even swam under the destroyer and were hauled out on her other side . The Irwin did a grand job playing fire hoses into the forward part of our hangar and in recovering personnel . She took on between 600 and 700 of our survivors . Men were packed on her decks like sardines . Soon we lost fire-main pressure forward . Then the Princeton had only her emergency equipment left . Jap planes were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But during the eight hours we fought to save the Princeton , though we were only 125 miles from Manila , we suffered no direct attack . At 10:55 the Birmingham came alongside to port forward , the Irwin making way , to give us additional fire hoses ( page 215 ) . Shortly the Reno , too , came alongside , but she could not remain because of the dense smoke and heat . The Birmingham gradually shifted aft as we forced the fire back . Her hoses were led over to the Princeton and manned by our fire fighters . In addition , she sent volunteers to assist . The destroyer Morrison secured to our leeward , or starboard , side and passed us two hoses . The seas and wind caused much motion between the ships . Rolling against the Princeton , the Morrison suffered severe damage when her superstructure struck the stacks and overhang of our flight deck . But she hung on doggedly and gave splendid help .

Moreover , our fires were not out yet and we were still within easy reach of Jap aircraft and submarines . So with sorrow the Reno fired torpedoes into the Princeton and she sank into the Philippine Sea with a last great explosion which lit the darkening skies for miles around .
