In a gaunt , grimy London suburb last week George Johnson Armstrong died by hanging , the first Briton executed as a traitor in World War II . A 39-year-old ship 's engineer , he was charged with offering his services as a spy to the German Consul in Boston . With him were hung three alien spies . Another Briton , a woman , sentenced to hang at the same time , had her sentence commuted to 14 years imprisonment .
