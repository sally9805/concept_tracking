Said the Tokyo newspaper Miyako last week : " It no longer is a crazy dream to expect a great war with Japan , Germany , Italy and Soviet Russia on one side and the United States , Great Britain and China on the other . " Other newspapers echoed the thought . The war , they said , would begin before June . <P> This warning was based on sound reasoning from known facts . Everybody knew that Japan was beginning to act on its neutrality pact with Russia by intensifying its war against China , by preparing a force-supported diplomatic drive against U.S. , British and Dutch interests throughout the Far East ( see col. j ) . This week the drive began . The Osaka Maimchi accused the U.S. , Britain , China , British India , Australia and The Netherlands East Indies of pooling their military and naval resources to maintain the status quo in the Far East . Australia 's Minister for External Affairs Sir Frederick Stewart , the first to deny this , called it " a piece of deliberate propaganda . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Hitlerian campaign against " encirclement . " Its object : Singapore . <P> All the East stirred restlessly , like a monster aroused from an age-old sleep , as new conquerors threatened the age-old dominion of Britain . To an appeal from the London Times to end his civil-disobedience campaign in view of Britain 's growing peril , Mohandas K. Gandhi replied curtly that the campaign " must continue at all costs . " In Iran tension increased with the fear that Russia was preparing to drive toward the Persian Gulf . In Iraq Nazi plotters had already unsettled Britain 's hold ( see p. 37 ) , and Nazi Schemester Franz von Papen appeared to have cowed Turkey into some sort of agreement with the Axis . Egypt awaited a fresh Nazi drive . Object : Suez . <P> In Western Europe , Germany marched toward bloodless victories . With no fear of British reprisals , Unoccupied France turned over a sizable part of its shipping to help get the Germans to North Africa ( see p. 23 ) . Adolf Hitler sent a note to Chief of State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Cabinet . Against U.S. Ambassador Alexander Wilbourne Weddell 's warning that the U.S. would do its utmost for Britain , Spain 's newspapers started an Axis-inspired campaign against Portugal , hinted that Spain would soon join the Axis . Object : Gibraltar . <P> In London Prime Minister Winston Churchill asked Australia 's Prime Minister Robert Gordon Menzies to postpone his trip to the U.S. and remain for a conference of Dominion leaders : New Zealand 's Prime Minister Peter Fraser , on his way to London , South Africa 's Jan Christiaan Smuts and Canada 's William Lyon Mackenzie King , if they could leave their problems at home . The long-awaited Axis drive against the bastions of British sea power , the drive to capture the subject countries of the British Empire and to isolate the English-speaking ones , had begun in earnest .
