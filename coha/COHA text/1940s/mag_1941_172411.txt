( See Cover ) <P> In a small house in Buenos Aires ' Calle Juncal last week a bustling blonde housekeeper dusted provincial furniture , straightened somber religious pictures , made an old-fashioned brass bed . Icy rains had brought autumn to Argentina , and the master of the house in the Calle Juncal , Ramon S. Castillo , was moving in from his suburban quinta in Martinez beside the Rio de la Plata . In the domed Palacio del Congreso , Acting President Castillo 's political housekeepers were similarly occupied . They swept out the debris of one of the most extraordinary sessions any legislative body had ever held , made ready for the opening of a new session of Congress this month . At this session Acting President Castillo must make a decision that will vitally affect Argentina , the U.S. and the world : which world to join in World War II . <P> If Britain fell , Argentines knew that they must choose between Germany and the U.S. But Argentines also knew that the decision could not wait until the war was decided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; more un comfortable pressure on Argentina to choose - and choose now . <P> Most of Argentina 's fellow American republics thought Axis ships should be seized and had seized as many as they could . Bases were wanted by the U.S. throughout Latin America and most of the Latin-American republics were willing to make bases available . But Argentina had not yet decided to seize ships . Argentina had not yet decided to yield bases for hemisphere defense . With not much trust in the good intentions of any great power , Germany , Britain or the U.S. , Argentina was trying to be neutral in an almost totally unneutral world . Acting President Castillo said so again last week : " Argentina will continue to maintain neutrality in the European war . " It was significant that the No. 1 Argentine should refer to the World War as European . Replied U.S. Ambassador Nor man Armour ( in a speech to the Buenos Aires English Club ) : " Between those who destroy the law and those who observe it there is no admissible neutrality . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In no free country was the economic outlook bleaker or the contrast sharper between what the nation wanted and what it had . <P> Ships and Sheep . Turning the problem over in his mind as he sat at his desk in the Casa Rosada , * Ramn Castillo had only to look out of the window to see one miserable aspect of it : Buenos Aires har bor , once South America 's busiest port , almost deserted of shipping , with 18 German and Italian vessels lying at anchor as reminders of the pressure on him . Once an average of 150 ships a day put into Buenos Aires . Now there are about 26 a week . Of 400,000 tons of meat which Britain contracted for six months ago , Britain has been able to move only some 75,000 tons so far . In Patagonia , where storage space is already crammed to capacity , 1,500,000 head of sheep can not be slaughtered because there are no ships to take the mutton away . Yet soon they must be slaughtered anyway , to keep the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
