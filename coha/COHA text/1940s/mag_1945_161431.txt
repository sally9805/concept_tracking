The age of light metals is still far off . But last week there were new and gleaming heralds of its approach . <P> The Aluminum Co. of America announced that it has commissioned Manhattan 's George G. Sharp &; Co. to design a 7,780-ton , all-aluminum vessel ; Manhattan 's Gibbs &; Cox , Inc. , who designed the Liberty ships , will draw plans for a 10,280 tonner . Alcoa will build the one it likes , use it to haul bauxite from its mines in Moengo and Paranam , Dutch Guiana , to the U.S. for processing . But the primary purpose is to open up a vast new market for aluminum . Alcoa already has its foot in this door . <P> American President Lines , Ltd. is having two 608-ft. , 585-passenger liners built with aluminum superstructures , using 98,877 pounds of aluminum ; massive ( 60-ft. ) smokestacks on three passenger vessels being built for the Mississippi Shipping Co. will be of aluminum . <P> Hollywood Pin-Up . In going after the big buyers , Alcoa was not neglecting little markets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clothespin . Its inventors were two neighbors in Van Nuys , Calif. , who got tired of hearing their wives grumble about ersatz clothespins . Alcoa helped them perfect the pin , licensed them to use its color process , " Alumilite , " at a nominal royalty . Del E. Webb , contractor and co-owner of the New York Yankees , financed them . Last week , the Del E. Webb Products Co. was busy shipping out 80,000 pins a day , expects to use 2,500,000 pounds of aluminum a year . <P> Needed : 300 More . Magnesium , Alcoa 's competitor for light-metal markets , was not far behind . Dow Chemical 's white-haired president , Dr. Willard Herbert Dow , had a showcase of 23 magnesium items ready for the market . Among them : <P> A 12-lb. wheelbarrow . <P> Chicago 's Atlas Tool &; Engine Co. is making cigaret lighters . <P> In Saginaw , Mich. , L. Richmond &; Sons is making a 16-ft. , 60-lb. canoe . <P> Dow Chemical will put out an unsinkable 12-ft. , 70-lb. rowboat this spring . Also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motor . <P> This help for small businessmen on the part of Alcoa and Dow Chemical was not all pure altruism . They were both uncomfortably aware of the $1 billion in U.S.-owned aluminum and magnesium plants , and , in particular , the talk of government subsidies to keep the aluminum plants competing with Alcoa . To Alcoa 's mind this talk could best be silenced by creating a demand big enough to use all the metal the plants could turn out . It could turn the trick , if it could find a few hundred gadgets like its clothespin.
