Syncopation ( RKO-Radio ) is Hollywood 's stoutest attempt to date to tell the story of U.S. popular music and how it grew . Unfortunately , the story , as gangling , forthright Director William Dieterle sees it , is too big for its breeches . Instead of illuminating , it interferes with the Grade-A presentation of a score of melodies , lovingly culled from the past 35 years of U.S. dance music . <P> They are Copenhagen and Jazz Me Blues , Milenberg Joys and Sugar Foot Stomp ; a pleasant new tune ( Falling Star ) which shines brightly in the mellow orbit of Songstress Connie Boswell ; spirituals from the Hall Johnson Negro Choir ; a jitterbug jam session by instrumentalists Benny Goodman , Harry James , Gene Krupa and others-etc . <P> Overwhelmed by an embarrassment of riches , Director Dieterle had to make many an embarrassing choice . He chose to emphasize the blues songs " about broken lives and broken dreams " - the Negroes ' " trouble music . " That meant New Orleans ' famed Basin Street and its U.S. equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1907 with the removal to Chicago of Adolphe Menjou , his piano-playing daughter ( Bonita Granville ) and her blues-singing mammy ( Jessie Grayson ) . <P> Although Bonita manages to introduce her New Orleans mood music to Chicago , to marry a young man with a horn ( Jackie Cooper ) and follow him through to the triumph of the modern dance band , story and music never get together . There is too much history to be got over . Furthermore , Miss Granville neither looks nor acts like a hot pianist . <P> But Mammy Grayson croons a pair of standout melodies ( Goin ' To Chicago and Only Worry For a Pillow ) , and the picture 's other Negro artists are first-rate- especially a young Negro boy with a trumpet , knee-deep in Bach at a New Orleans music academy . He loathes the formalized Bach exercises , wants to play his kind of music . After a few bars he does , riding away , loud and low , right out of the academy . <P> Juke Girl ( Warner ) is the kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is crowded with automobiles and trucks . For years the Warners have surpassed all Hollywood studios in their obsession with the output of Detroit 's motormakers . They have shot them coming &; going , leaving &; arriving , doing this &; that , until the automobile has become a kind of Warner trade-mark-a shiny substitute for the legitimate stage 's entrance and exit doors . This fine feeling for mechanics is hard on Juke Girl , which is supposed to be about juke girls. * It turns the picture into a cross-country road race , with itinerant laborers hurrying their cars to the Florida fruit and vegetable country , packers hurrying their picked produce to market , etc. , etc . The result is a kind of minor East Coast Grapes of Wrath . <P> Lost in the dust of this hurrying traffic are Juke Girl Ann Sheridan and her profession . Instead of working at it , she has to spend most of her time avoiding Richard Whorf , who runs with the labor-bait-ing packinghouse gang , and patching up Ronald Reagan , who likes the pickers . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the pickers beat the packers .
