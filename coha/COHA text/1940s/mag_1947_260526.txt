The rightist Government of Premier Demetrios Maximos had been in power seven months . Careful research showed that in the English language there have been hardly any utterances complimentary to it . In the rich , rollicking Russian language there was ample invective ( which was only natural ) . The Greek language did not count much in the Greek situation , but for what it was worth , three highly articulate Greeks stood up last week and spoke . The upshot : Maximos was out . <P> The dissenting Greeks were Sophocles Venizelos , George Papandreou and Panayotis Kanellopoulos , the only middle-of-the-road ministers in the Maximos Cabinet . They demanded larger liberal representation in the Government . Maximos refused . The three resigned . King Paul then asked Foreign Minister Constantin ( " Dino " ) Tsaldaris , a Royalist and Maximos ' chief political prop , to form a new Cabinet . Tsaldaris asked aging Liberal Leader Themistocles Sophoulis to join the new Cabinet , offered the Liberals an equal share of portfolios with the Royalists ( even though the Liberals are a minority ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tsaldaris , calmly and coolly chewing cigars , kept on trying . Meanwhile , the old Government ( in power till a new one could be formed ) alerted police and army formations against renewed Communist guerrilla attacks . <P> Dino Tsaldaris was just back from consultations in Washington . He knew very well that the U.S. , long dissatisfied with the corruption and inefficiency of the Maximos Cabinet , was glad to see it fall . The U.S. wanted not merely an anti-Communist Government in Greece , but one that would offer the people , through positive , democratic policies , their desperately wanted share of bread and freedom . <P> It was hard to say , in any language , that Dino was the man to fill that bill .
