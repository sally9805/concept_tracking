txt Seven months ago the President appointed a special commission , headed by William H. Davis , to recommend procedure for the settlement of labor disputes in the Government 's atomic energy plants . The Commission 's proposals , which have now been submitted to the President , follow the general philosophy of the Railway Labor Act of 1926 . Under the plan outlined by the Commission the President would name a three-man panel whose function it would be to adjust labor-management controversies against the background of a " broad code of conduct " outlined by the Commission . The panel would step in and assume jurisdiction in disputes which threatened to interrupt the country 's atomic energy prpgram . In such cases unions and management would be required to agree to maintain production so long as the panel was in charge of the situation and for an additional thirty days thereafter . Since the recommendations of the President 's Commission come under the heading of dealing with the prevention of work stoppages in a special and very vital area , it may be asked where they fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ national emergency " strikes . The Taft-Hartley Act authorizes the President to seek an injunction in such cases to prevent a strike or a lockout , as the case may be , or its continuance . The Administration 's own bill , now pending in Congress , follows much the same pattern as that just proposed for use in the labor sphere of atomic energy . There would be a thirty-day " armistice " pending investigation by a board of inquiry . The latter would recommend a basis of settlement which would be enforceable only through the pressure of public opinion . Does this plan of the Davis Commission represent a happy alternative to the machinery of the present law ? an alternative that could be relied upon to prevent work stoppages , for example , in coal mining and transportation , and to do so without reliance on compulsory arbitration , injunctions , or the possibility that it would culminate in a public confession of failure ? We do not see any basis for such a conclusion . The panel system and cooling-off period , with an emergency board empowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or may not be workable in the field of atomic energy . But even if it should be that would by no means justify the conclusion that it would be similarly effective in emergency labor disputes in other areas . The very fact that the President decided that special machinery was needed to deal with the labor aspects of atomic energy development would serve to underscore the special nature of this problem if it were n't otherwise obvious . Public opinion being what it is , it must be clear that the recommendations of a Presidentially appointed fact-finding body in the atomic industry would have all the force of compulsory arbitration . On the other hand , John L. Lewis , as head of the coal miners , has shown that he is contemptuous of public opinion and the public interest , even in wartime , and President Truman has on two separate occasions found that the railroad brotherhoods would not hesitate to ignore the recommendations of Presidential fact-finding boards and gall a nation-wide strike when deci  --  Ions of such boards went against hem . Injunctions and government leizure have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the chips were down . When Mr. Truman asserted in his veto message that the procedure under the Taft-Hartley Act was apt to end in " confession of failure , ? he meant , presumably , that if agreement was not obtained while - the injunction was in force the only recourse left was to fall back on Congress to legislate additional powers . But what about the plan just proposed by the Davis Commission ? If no settlement is achieved during the cooling-off period what happens ? Full responsibility would then be thrown back upon the Atomic Energy Commission , which would be expected to go to Congress for help in precisely the same way . The long-run solution might well prove to be the injunction . For it is well to bear in mind that although the Administration did not mention the injunction in its own proposed labor bill , it explained the omission not by renouncing that device but on the ground that it already possessed the power to invoke it in an emergency .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
