PART NINE rnriw Frlilac. , Derenther 22 , In I I. Lieutenant Colonel Ralph , Major Brown and I returned to Paris about 7:00 this evening . Ralph , " Brownie " and I left last Monday , December 18 , and stopped first at Verdun to see Col. Francis V. Fitzgerald . In the War Room there were red arrows indicating the depth of the penetration through our lines , and there was an atmosphere around the 12th Army Group Headquarters which reminded me of the Kasserine . The Germans had dropped many paratroopers behind our lines , many in American uniforms , and other enemy troops were infiltrated in captured jeeps . Road blocks had been established to check all movements . I had a breakfast date with General Patton at 7:45 the next morning , but my jeep was held up by heavy road movement , and we were five minutes late . General Patton had eaten and gone to his headquarters , but had left his aide:Major Stiller , an old friend df mine from African days , to eat with rne , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awhile for General Patton to finish , and ultimately he strode down the corridor past the door of his aide 's office . I called out , " Hello , General . " He replied , " Hi , Butch . " That was my interview . From the staff I heard of Patton 's comment when he heard of the German push . " Fine , " he said . " We should open up and let ' em all the way to Paris . Then we 'll saw ' em off at the base . " I visited the War Room and found the Germans still advancing in the Ardennes , but learned that Devers ' Group was taking over a major part of the 3rd Army 's front while Patton was quickly moving divisions toward Luxemburg in an effort to pinch off the Germans on the south flank . Tonight at dinner I met three friends who had just returned from Bastogne where they had unwittingly driven into the battle . They were Lee Dayton and two Red Cross girls , Margaret Morin and Mollie Ford , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Aywaille in Belgium they had spent a night in a hotel with rooms facing the main street over which American convoys of trucks pounded toward the battle throughout the night . In the early dawn a convoy stopped and a deep Southern voice had been heard to call out , " Men , douse your lights . From here on , go as quietly as possible . We are getting close to the active battle area . " A Negro voice came out of the darkness , " My friends , Ah hate wah , Sistie hates wah , Buzzie hates wah  --  we all hate wah . Ah 'll never send you boys ovahseas . But we ah ovahseas , and we ah goin ' ovah de top . " Amidst nervous idughter from darkened trucks , the voice trailed apologetically off into the song Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones as the convoy moved on . Dayton said that he had heard on his trip that Field Marshal Montgomery had been given command of the U. S. 1st and 9th armies because of the seriousness of the Ardennes battle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out to Versailles and saw Ike today . He is a prisoner of our security police and is thoroughly but helplessly irritated by t he restriction on his moves . There are all sorts of guards , some with machine guns , around the house , and he has to travel to and from the office led and at times followed by an armed guard in a jeep . The reason for the restriction is that information had been received from intelligence officers of Hodges ' 1st Army who had made prisoner a German officer at Liege the night of Decemher 19 . He was one of a group of English-speaking krauts who had infiltrated through Allied lines in American uniform , driving an American jeep and carrying American identification papers . The leader of this group , which specializes in kidnaping and assassination of high personages , is a character named Skorzeny , who , reputedly , rescued Mussolini . He is said to have passed t hrough our lines with about 60 of his men and has the mission of killing the Supreme Commander and other high-level officers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landed in the U. S. 1st Army 's area . Many of them were captured , but some are still at large . Those in uniform are not wearing dog tags , but all carry explosives and have a new type of hand grenade discharged from a pistol. , Ike 's office was serene . Outside , through the high French windows , the snow was falling and the setting seemed appropriate for the approaching Christ . mas . Ike was as calm as he ever is , and , except for the irritation caused by his confinement , was cheerful and optimistic . Over all , he felt the situation was well in hand ; that there was no need for alarm ; that he and his senior commanders had taken prompt steps to meet what he figured was the Germans ' dying thrust , and if we would all be patient and the Lord would give us some good flying weather , all would be well and we would probably emerge with a tactical victory . He added that it is easier and less costly to us to kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in concrete fortifications in the Siegfried Line , and the more we can kill in their present offensive , the fewer we will have to dig out pillbox by pillbox . As to the command of the 1st and 9th U. S.1 armies having been given to Field Marshal Montgomery , I suggested that the news was all over the place and that an announcement should be authorized to prevent further speculation . London papers were vaguely hinting at Monty 's new responsibility and inferring that when the Americans got in trouble , Monty had come to the rescue . Ike felt that such inferences were deplorable from the standpoint of Allied relationships , but his decision to give Monty temporary command of the two American armies was dictated by the exigencies of the battle . If we were to be so generous as to tell the German high command that Monty commanded on the northern flank of the bulge and Bradley on the southern , the Germans , being familiar with Monty 's and Bradley 's different types of fighting , would be greatly pleased to have the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ment could be announced later but not now . Paris . Christ mam Day . 19.11 . General Ike 's most : Leering present was the knowledge coming from General Marshall that the President had sent a message to Stalin of the Supreme Commander 's desire to send a qualified staff officer to Moscow to exchange information essential to our mutual efforts . The President has assured Stalin that the Belgian situation is not bad , but the time had arrived to discuss the next moves . The Combined Chiefs also cabled approval of the mission . Christmas is not a holiday for General Ike . The fighting is intense in the bulge , and at Bastogne the 101st Airborne is putting up an epic fight . They are receiving supplies and ammunition by aircraft and gliders , and so far have repelled all enemy attacks . The 4th Armored Division of Patton 's Army is now only 2 1.4 miles away . Paris , Tuesday , December 211. 1944 . Monty reported continuing heavy enemy pressure on the " west " flank of the let U. S. Army . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at present take the offensive , and the initiative could not be wrested from the Germans until Monty had more troops . Paris , Monday , January 1 , 1943 . The Supreme Commander went by train for a conference with Field Marshal Montgomery at his tactical headquarters last Wednesday . After discussing the current battle , the Field Marshal sought continuing control by himself of all forces to be engaged in the northern thrust toward the Ruhr . Monty suggested that for best results he should be given operational control over Bradley 's Army Group . He declared that if there is not one-man control of the battle command , we would fail again . General Ike informed Monty that he could not agree that one Army Group commander should fight his own battle and give orders to another Army Group commander . The plan for the advance to the Ruhr envisaged the placement of one complete U. S. Army under Montgomery 's command , which General Ike considered militarily necessary and believed also that it reflected his confidence in the Field Marshal . The Supreme Commander knew that because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to devote himself to tasks assigned him , he would carry on . Frank and friendly counsel by the Field Marshal was appreciated , but General Ike was disturbed by Monty 's predictions of failure unless his exact recommendations of command were met . General Ike hoped there was not being developed an unbridgeable gulf of convictions between them that would require settlement by the Combined Chiefs , as the debate and confusion which would follow would damage the good will and devotion to the common cause which have made this Allied force unique in history . Monty responded , sympathetic with the great burden of responsibility which the Supreme Commander was forced to bear , and said that whatever the decision , he can be relied upon completely . The rumblings in the press , particularly in London , have now grown to a roar of demand that there be a British deputy commander for all of General Ilte 's ground forces . The implication is clearly given that General Ike , as much as he is respected , has undertaken too much of a task himself . General Marshall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advising him against any such arrangement . On the American side of the Atlantic , General Marshall said , " You are doing a grand job and go on and give them hell . " Purls , Tuesday . .1 y 9. 1945 . The British Chiefs of Stall are proposing to the Combined Chiefs that General Ike be called upon for a report as to his plan of campaign following the elimination of the bulge . Representatives of the British Chiefs have discussed with General Marshall the advisability of a single commander for ground operations , and the opinion has been expressed that . General Ike has too many other pressing duties and that , therefore , a more concentrated direction of ground operations is required . General Marshall asked for the Supreme Commander 's views and added his own opinion that the British proposal stems from the Prime Minister 's recent visit to France and of Field Marshal Montgomery 's evident pressure to get a larger command . Paris . Thursday , January N. 19-15 . Monty . has sent a letter to General Bradley , now that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anticipating that the 1st and 9th U. S. armies soon will he returning to Bradley 's command , saying what a great honor it has been for the Field Marshal to command American troops and how well they have done . He had found it a great pleasure to work with Hodges and Simpson and said the corps commanders , particularly Gerow , Collins and Ridgway , had been magnificent . Paris . Wedinotidny. .1 y 17. 1915 . General Ike now feels that at last every commander , including his military superiors , understands what he means when he says we must secure a decent line on which to station defensive forces if we are to permit the greatest possible concentration of our forthcoming offensives . He has directed General Devers to clean out the Colmar pocket and to get a line on the Rhine south of the Siegfried Line . When this is accomplished , the whole Alsace-Lorraine plain can be turned over to the French forces , allowing Patch 's 7th Army to take over the line up to the Moselle , thus permitting greater strength to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tentative target date for his operation to close up to the Rhine in the north and , as be has had some weeks of strenuous activity , he is returning to England for a few days of rest . Sheet Main . Saturday , January 27 , mar , . Jim Gault phoned me that General Ike wanted me to come to dinner Thursday night because Harry Hopkins would be there , and the General thought I would like to see him . Arriving early , I was told by Ike that Harry had expressed a desire to speak to him privately , so I might assist at an appropriate moment in helping create the opportunity for the private talk . Hopkins arrived . After pleasant greetings , he told of his visit in London , where he spent three nights with the Prime Minister . The night before , the Prime Minister had given a fatherly lecture to Mr. Eden on I he art and science of making a speech to the House of Commons . In the course of the admonition , the Prime Minister , according to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes . They should he flagrantly waved in the face of the M. P. 's each time be made a point . Then he should proceed to the next . He should obviously study his notes , taking as much time as necessary " two or three minutes , if you feel like it . " He added that the speaker should not lounge against the rostrum , but rather , should stand well behind it and pace his remarks with forward and backward steps . The Prime Minister said he had had special glasses made which permitted him to see his notes five feet away . He advised Eden to patronize the same oculist . Added theatrical effect could be obtained if Mr. Eden then would scowl at the audience . The meeting of the Combined Chiefs of Staff is to take place in Malta start-Mg about the 29th , and the President is on his way by cruiser and is touching at Gibraltar on the 28th . This information was developed when Harry tipped off Ike that he was certain the Prime Minister would ask the President , probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as Alexander be present at the Malta meeting . Ike had emphasized that he had his hands full with a long front , with not only defensive action to manage but an impending offensive to get under way . Harry said that he would be pleased to communicate to the President Ike 's desire not to attend , but the President , because of radio silence of his ship , would probably not reply until he reached Gibraltar . In any event , the trip would upset Ike 's plan because he was already committed to confer with General Marshall at Marseille on the 27th , and later expected to go to the forward area , presumably to see Monty . Harry said the big issue at Malta will be the Pacific versus the European war . It will develop between General Marshall , whose heart is in completing the war against Germany first and with all possible support , and Admiral King , who , in the tradition of the Navy , has his heart in the Pacific . Harry said that he was thoroughly convinced that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lot with Ike and would speak to the President at the earliest opportunity to comb the armed services for more men , as well as to allocate more men and material to this theater . Harry spoke also of his concern about postwar management in Germany . He said the military would do its usual good job of policing , " getting the water turned on , " stopping the sniping , and , in general , restoring law and order , but that , after all , the conduct of affairs in Germany should be by men who are of the liberal school . He was fearful that officers with previous connections with big corporations , particularly those having previous business connections with the Germans , might be more interested in reviving commercial life than would be desirable . Ike and Jim Gault left by train last night for Marseille , where General Marshall and party are to be met . Paris . Sunday , .1 y 28. 19-15 . General Ike returned today from seeing General Marshall and party at Ch ? - teau Valmante , near Marseille @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is firmly against appointment of a Ground Commander in Chief , the topic that is expected to be considered by the Combined Chiefs at their meeting starting tomorrow in Malta . Beetle is attending it , and both General Ike and General Marshall feel it would be unwise for the Supreme Commander to leave the battle at this juncture . Paris . Tuesday .. 1 30 , 1015 . The British Chiefs of Staff have interpreted General Ike 's plans as meaning that after closing to the Rhine in the north , he will make no attempt to force a crossing of the river even in the north until all the area west of the Rhine has been swept clear of the Germans . General Ike has told Beetle to tell the Combined Chiefs for him that the Rhine crossings will be made in the north just as soon as the operation is feasible and without waiting to close to the Rhine throughout its length . Paris . Monday , February 5. 1043 . SHAEF G-3 has prepared for the PRD to make public a summary of the German offensive in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day : " If the Panzer Grenadiers fail now , they will have had the last word from their Fiihrer . " Rundstedt apparently saw the effort in its true light , for he said , " This is an all-out gamble . " Hitler planned to reach the Meuse in two days and Antwerp in three weeks , and he thought be would cut off 38 Allied divisions , as well as deny the Allies the use of the vital port at Antwerp . In December and January , the enemy casualties in the west , where the principal fighting was in the Ardennes , amounted to 220,000 , of which 110,000 were prisoners of war . In the two months , the Germans lost 1450 tanks and assault guns , as well as thousands of motor vehicles of all kinds . Hitler 's vaunted Ardennes offensive is described by G-3 as a complete defeat for the enemy and , summarizing , it is pointed out that the Germans have lost since June 6 , 860,000 prisoners of war to this Allied force , and their killed and long-term wounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They have lost in tanks and assault guns enough to refit 15 Panzer divisions twice over . It is stated that Allied ground losses are but a fraction of this . Paris , Sunday , February II , 1915 . The battle for the Roer River dams , which began three months ago , ended yesterday when the 1st U. S. Army gained control of Schwammanuel Dam . The Yanks found it intact , although the gates below it were blown by the Germans , thus raising the Roer River three feet at Dtiren . Gen. Fred Anderson , Deputy to Spaatz , has said that if the Ground Forces did n't take Germany by June , the Germans ' present rate of production of jet and rocket planes would make it impossible for our great armadas of 1000 bombers , with 800 escorts , to continue to bomb Germany without losses that might make the bombings militarily unprofitable . Paris . Tue.day , February 20.19 15 . I saw the Supreme Commander today and enjoyed some very fine Virginia ham sent him by some admirer at home . Monty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the month , has reported that his attacks southeast between the Maas and Rhine are going well , and that the enemy will find it increasingly difficult to stand up to the pressure . Ike was in a jubilant mood and rubbed his lucky coins as he talked about the prospect for favorable weather and release , so far as he was concerned , from the strain of waiting for action to begin . He gets terribly impatient during periods such as he has just undergone , but occasionally takes some cheer from the fact that the Germans are in a much worse position and , consequently , he never loses his optimism . began worrying about commitments he might have made to Stalin the night before . He telephoned the Russian Premier and , as the story goes , informed him that anything that had been said that committed the British Empire in any manner should be forgotten . Stalin had replied , " Do n't worry , the interpreter has already been shot . " Shad Forward . I Iteimsl . Monday , February 26 , 1915 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Saturday , February 24 , at the Scribe Hotel in Paris . It was his first press conference since November , and one which had been tentatively set two or three times , only to be postponed because of calls to the field . By Saturday , however , the big push of the 9th and let armies had been under way since the previous morning at 3:30 , and reports indicated satisfactory progress . Ike talked for perhaps an hour , first giving a general statement of developments since he had last talked to them and of the current offensive . When the conference finished , Ike motioned in my direction to follow him , which I did quickly . When I caught up with him in the correspondents ' workroom , be said he wanted Steve . By the time I got Steve out of the crowd  --  there being perhaps 200 in the room  --  Ike had had to hurry along because the growing throng was crowding his departure from the Scribe . He said he had wanted to know from Steve what he thought of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he knew we would stop at Reims on our forthcoming trip . Later , when I got through the crowd to Steve , I asked him the question . He deliberated and said : " It was the most magnificent performance of any man at a press conference that I have ever seen . He knows his facts , he speaks freely and frankly , and he has a sense of humor , he has poise , and he had command . " The correspondents were struck by Ike 's appearance of fitness . One asked his weight . Ike said he did not know , as he had n't weighed recently ; he only judged his weight by the tightness of his belt , and lately had felt a tightening . He drew a laugh when he said he had not been afraid during the breakthrough , until two weeks later when he read the American newspapers . Sheet Forward , ( Fleimsl . Sunday . ? dare 's 11. 1915 . I have spent several nights at Ike 's house this week . He is in fine fettle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside Friday and Saturday . His consumption of Westerns is amazing . Colonel Gault was in England and his return has been delayed also by a cold . There has been time for good old-fashioned gossip sessions . It was after 5:00 Wednesday when I had finished at the office , and by 7:30 I was at Ike 's house in Reims . He had several of the Airborne Commanders , including I , Lt. Gen. Matthew B. Ridgway , Maj. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor and Maj. Gen. James Gavin as guests . They all looked superbly fit and keen in every way . We had just sat down at dinner and Ike had said he did n't particularly care for the soup , when - Henry Clay " answered the phone in the next room . It was for the Supreme Commander , who excused himself , and we soon heard his voice saying , " Brad , that 's wonderful . " There was a pause , and then he continued , " Sure , get right on across with everything you 've got . It 's the best break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planners . Sure , go on , Brad , and I 'll give you everything we got to hold that bridgehead . We 'll make good use of it , even if the terrain is n't too good . . . " It 's wonderful ! Congratulations . " While Ike was talking , the Airborne Generals were all ears , as indeed was I. When Ike sat down again at the head of the table , he said , " Hodges got a bridge at Remagen and already has troops across . " Bradley had wanted to be sure it was O.K. to exploit and , as usual , they were in quick and complete agreement . Now that it looked as if we might have a break at Remagen of exactly the kind which Ike has been playing for , I told him correspondents are asking when and how we will cover Berlin . I asked him if he planned to take the city . He said the capture of Berlin in itself would not lead to a general collapse of the Nazi regime , but the loss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans ' will to resist because of its far greater effect on Germany 's capacity to continue the war . Last night we had a grand time . Tooey Spaatz brought over his guitar and we bad three enlisted Wac 's who do amateur entertaining . Two played the piano and banged out all the old tunes and some new ones . Tooey accompanied Ike , and the singing was so good that everyone got into it . Ike led i the basso profundos and really got into the whole swing of things again  --  the first I 've seen him really enjoy himself since the Lord knows when . He is back at the office today running the war with a new zip . Last week while Ike was on his trip up front. , he had flown in an L5 from a small field , about 9 miles from Cologne , to Namur . The take-off was in a snowstorm , but just as the plane was airborne , a German artillery shell struck about 100 yards away . I had read about this in Stars and Stripes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said such stories make the troops feel that the only reason he goes up front is to get his name in the paper . Paris . Tarralay , March 13. 1915 . Steve Early and I had dinner last night with General Spaatz , and be had both of us at poker . We were engrossed in the game when Maj. Sally Bagby , Tooey 's aide , came in . She said she had just heard over the radio part of a list of promotions to full General , but had only caught those of Clark and Bradley . I knew that Tooey bad been strongly recommended by Ike , so , of course , I could n't say anything . The game went on quietly , each of us wondering . Then Sally returned and said she had heard on the Allied Forces Network that Bradley 's aide was quoted as saying , " It 's a well-deserved promotion . " This gave all of us a chuckle , for what aide would say anything else ? Then Sally went off to work the telephone , calling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called London . Presently she returned and said , " General , sir , I just want to say that it is a well-deserved promotion . " We all congratulated Tooey , who immediately sent for champagne and turned to me and said , " Come on and deal . " The game went on with the new four-star General contributing just as we ordinary people do . Paris , Friday , March 16. 19 I 5- Will Lang , of Time , came to see me at the Express Building today to deliver a message from Sgt. Bill Mauldin , the cartoonist of Stars and Stripes in the Mediterranean , whose stuff in recent weeks has been running in Stars and Stripes it ) France . A couple of weeks ago , Sgt. Bill Estatt had brought Mauldin to see me about a crisis in his life , General Patton had written to Stars and Stripes saying that if Mauldin 's cartoons continued to be carried , the paper would be barred from circulation in the 3rd Army area . Patton objected to the unkempt appearance of soldiers as portrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are slovenly , dirty and unshaven . Mauldin , who had been wounded in combat , thought his characters faithfully represented the front-line soldiers , although his experience has been largely in Sicily and Italy . I told Mauldin that both he and Patton were trying to win the war , and , with this common denominator , they ought to be able to settle their differences . Would n't Mauldin like to talk it out with Patton eye to eye ? Mauldin quaked , but said he would think it over . He came back later and said he had mustered up his courage , and if I 'd make the appointment , he would go to 3rd Army headquarters and see " Old Blood and Guts " himself . I immediately put in a phone call to Patton 's headquarters . I located him in the office of Maj. Gen. Everett Hughes . His first answer to my suggestion was : That fellow 's a bad influence on the Army , and if he comes into Third Army area , I 'll throw him in jail for thirty days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas for winning the war and that Mauldin 's stuff was popular with the soldiers . If General Patton could explain his objections to Mauldin in person , perhaps there could be a meeting of their minds leading to delousing of the characters . General Patton thought this was a reasonable approach and said to send Mauldin along and he would see him at 3rd Army headquarters . Mauldin , of course , heard my end of the conversation . I told him that when he went . to Patton 's office , to make certain that his uniform was neat and tidy and that he was in proper dress for the 3rd Army area , where helmets are mandatory . He must stand at attention and salute smartly . If he did less , the interview was doomed to failure . Now Will Lang reports that . he saw Mauldin after the interview , and since Bill was returning to Rome , be wanted Lang to report to me ; the gist of which was that Mauldin was convinced he had not changed General Patton 's opinion nor had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was simply a case of " no hits , no runs , one error " on my part . Perin . Salarday . March 2S. 1915 . At the Scribe this morning correspondents were chuckling that with Monty 's obvious preparation for crossing the Rhine in the north , about which there have been numerous stories of smoke screens to hide activities of his troops and the massing of strength in that area , Patton had slipped around right end . He is across the Rhine . His 3rd Army troops quietly crossed in small boats in the darkness Thursday night . With our Remagen bridgehead enlarged and Patton across farther up the Rhine , Monty crossing the river today with great strength , Hitler 's hordes should be seeing the beginning of something more than " the beginning of the end . " I find that General Ike has notified the Combined Chiefs that the recent victories west of the Rhine have resulted as planned in destruction of a large proportion of the enemy forces on the Western Front . He did n't wish to appear overoptimistic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present situation presents opportunities for which all have struggled and which now must be seized boldly . The dash and daring in the 1st and 3rd Army sectors got us two bridgeheads cheaply , and these can be consolidated and exploited rapidly to support a major thrust which will assist Monty 's operation in the north . Paris , Monday . March 26. 19-15 . News is very good just now , and despite Ike 's feeling that there will be long guerrilla warfare after the German armies are beaten , I am beginning to be optimistic again  --  I 'm hunching that Patton will get to Berlin first . We have been thinking the Russians will beat us in , but I have told the boys to dust off our Berlin plans . General Ike has agreed to have a press conference at the Scribe tomorrow . Many of the correspondents had n't seen the Forward Headquarters , so I tried to work out a scheme of sending them to Reims by train to have the press conference at the Supreme Commander 's office and to return them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not popular . because the correspondents ca n't risk being away from the center of news at the Scribe when news is breaking so rapidly . Wednesday , March 211 , 19 15 . The press conference yesterday was a peach . Then last night Ike and I had a pleasant bull session at the Raphael . Ike 's stopping over with me was in the nature of an experiment , I having told him he could stay there without attracting attention , and this proved to be correct . Although Pierre , the obliging manager of the Raphael , assigned the Supreme Commander the " ambassador 's suite " on the fourth floor , 1 had arranged for use of a small bedroom opening off my living room , and it was here the Supreme Commander slept . // din to get together . I hope I see Patton before he sees the magazine . Ike was in an expansive mood at lunch today and , as usual , tossed bouquets of credit in all directions . Monty had done a fine job crossing the Rhine , and always could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our latest spectacular successes , in which elements of the U. S. let Army had advanced northward almost to Paderborn , Hodges , he thought , had been the spearhead and the scintillating star . Before that , Hodges ' drive southeast from Cologne and the capture of Remagen bridge had excited the admiration of the Supreme Commander , who felt that the 1st Army 's assignment had been perhaps the most difficult of any U. S. formation . General Ike said he would like very much to see Hodges get credit in the United States for his great work , but as an Allied Commander he is always embarrassed himself or might create embarrassment to others , if he publicly singles out any one commander on the whole front for particular commendation . Not only Hodges ' but Bradley 's magnificent contribution in this campaign , General Ike advised , should be painted in more brilliant colors . Bradley has never held back and never once has " paused to regroup " when he saw an opportunity to advance . General Ike praised his energy , common sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bradley , the Supreme Commander did not want to be misunderstood as depreciating the accomplishments of other Army commanders , because all , he felt , have performed in the finest fashion . Patton , being colorful and audacious , drew the headlines in the American press , while Monty , likewise colorful and always " good copy , " led the parade of black type in England . Simpson had performed most creditably , and Devers and Patch have played their roles superbly . However , Ike was trying to place in proper perspective the contribution of Hodges and Bradley , who , he felt , seemingly are overlooked by correspondents and headline writers at home . Thuroday . April 5. 15 15 . General Alexander has had a nibble from intermediaries who say Kesselring wants to quit in Italy . After some preliminary talks , he notified the Combined Chiefs ; told them the development of the intrigue , and appraised the approach as apparently sincere . The Russians evidently were not notified and had protested . The story at SHAEF headquarters is n't too clear to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it seems while so-called agents of Kesselring were approaching Alexander 's staff , other German agents were feeding information to the Russians that the western Allies were about to make a separate peace . The inference is that the Germans were thus seeking a separate peace with the Russians . Stalin bluntly told the story to the President and the Prime Minister , and the President has sent a hot wire to Stalin asking , in effect : What kind of an ally do you think we are ? The upshot is that if there are any other approaches from German emissaries seeking peace , we are to notify the Russians immediately , so they can have a responsible representative present at any and all discussions .
