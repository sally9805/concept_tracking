Army &; Navy doctors , still stuck over seas , griped when they heard a rumor ( only partially true ) that 1,600 men who had just got their medical educations free under the armed forces ' training programs had been discharged without having to serve at all . ( The overseas doctors had hoped that the 1,600 new doctors would relieve some of them . ) <P> Forty-one doctors at the A.A.F. Regional Hospital at Camp Truax , Wis. , griped that they were " political prisoners of war , " unnecessary to the Army , necessary to their civilian patients . <P> Most uniformed doctors feel like griping - and yet they may be the lucky ones . Thus far , the doctors who have come home have found trouble. * Some typical troubles reported last week : <P> In New York City , an ex-major , his family and his medical supplies were evicted onto a Brooklyn sidewalk to make room for a new tenant . An ex-commander lives and practices in a furnished room while he looks for home and office space . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $3,000 a year , if he would pay a bonus of $6,000 cash . A Greek doctor ( one of the ten or so who serve New York 's 60,000 Greeks ) can not practice because the only places he can find have no water and need perhaps $3,000 in repairs to be paid by the tenant . He advises doctors in the Army to stay there . Only 100 of the city 's 500 returned dentists have found anywhere to practice . <P> In Chicago , the Daily News last week printed 328 addresses of returned doctors to help their patients find them . Most of the addresses were homes . Dr. John J. Dwyer 1 ) found his old apartment house no longer available for doctors ' offices ; 2 ) learned that a former medical building was now full of lawyers and optometrists ; 3 ) made an architect laugh when he suggested remodeling a store ; 4 ) made a contractor laugh when he suggested buying and fixing up a building for doctors ' offices ; 5 ) wound up in a dentist 's tiny storeroom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an approximate one-third of the service doctors would like to settle down in California after the war . San Francisco is trying to shoo the outlanders away . <P> <P> * The Army has already dismissed 16,400 of its 45,000 doctors , has released 3,800 of its 15,000 dentists .
