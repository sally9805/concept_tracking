txt Faced with a vividly developing war situation in Europe , representatives of the six largest Protestant church denominations in Massachusetts were today urged to throw their entire might to the side of the Allies " in the name of Christianity and democracy . " It appeared there was considerable inclination to follow this course ; for the pacifism which has so tightly cloaked these churches , particularly during the past two decades , seemed to be fast evaporatihg , at least among the 1,500 lay and clergyman delegates here today . Giving voice to this trend was Dr. Stanley High , writer , who said his own views had changed from the pacificism of the post world-war period . Makes Appeal In an address before the opening session of the State 's first interdenominational convention , meetin in the Municipal Auditorium , De High appealed frankly to his listeners to scrap all pacifist views and resist firmly and promptly the aggressions of the three totalitarian governments , Germany , Italy , and Russia . While the question of the churches ' attitude toward the war appeared prominently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it is officially titled , many other topics of social , political , and religious significance were scheduled for consideration by the religious delegates . One on which great unity has been evidenced , according to the Rev. Dr. Frank Jennings , Executive Secretary of the Massachusdtts Council of Churches , which sponsored the convention , is the gambling situation . Protestant clergymen feel very strongly that the pari-mutuel betting law should be repealed , Dr. Jennings declared . Other subjects to come before the inter-church convention include week-day religious education , marriage and the home . the college student and the future leadership of the church , .4. : enurch and war relief , the church ii , world of economic change , social aspects of the alcohol problem , and religion and health . Unity of Churches The inter-church convention is an evidence of the unity of the Protestant churches , in the view of Dr. Jennings . It has been made possible by the willingness of the six denominations to hold their denominational meetings on the same day and in the same city for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Congregational , Protestant Episcopal , Methodist , Presbyterian , ' and Unitarian conferences are being held here simultaneously today and tomorrow , and delegates from all of them are joining in inter-church meetings in the Municipal Auditorium . Previously , the only interdenominational meetings in this State were those of the Massachusetts Council of Churches , a relatively small group , Speakers at this morning 's in- ter-church session included besides Dr. High , the Rev. Dr. Richard Roberts , formerly moderator of the United Church of Canada and now Professor at Pine Hill Divinity School , Halifax , N. S. , the Rev. Dr. Horace F. Holton , of Brockton , and the Rev. Dr. Thomas S. Roy , of Worcester , President of the Council of Churches , who presided . Dr. High declared that out of the confusion of world events , a few things now are plain : ( 1 ) That all totalitarianisms are alike , ( 2 ) that " nothing like the total war , a war against a whole people , has been seen since Genghis Khan and Tamerlane , " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , and ( 4 ) that " whether we like it or not , we 're a part of this war . " " Generals may debate physical frontiers but , ideological frontiers are not a matter of debate , " he said . " Fifth Column " " We 've already been invaded by an ideological army . The " Fifth Column " is working here , in Latin America , and in IVIxico . If Hitler wins , though we remain physically safe , we will be spiritually imperilled . " Dr. High named as the " one issue of the ideological conflict " the emphasis placed , alike by Christianity and democracy , on the individual . To defend the individual from complete absorption in the state , he affirmed , is " Christian tesponsibility , " the fulfillment of wh , ch is morthy of " physical sacrifice . " Attacking the principal imcifist arguments , the speaker asserted that " more is involiied in the war than the machinations of armaments makers and ' big ousmess. ' "        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
