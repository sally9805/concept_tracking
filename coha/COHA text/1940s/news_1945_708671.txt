txt CHURCHILL WILLING TO LEAVE CAMPAIGN FOR BIG 3 MEETING Making Pleas for Backing , He Says He May Go Before Election July 5 WIFE WOULD SEEK VOTES Speeches to His Constituents on Tour in Rain Stress Firmness on Policy By CLIFTON DANIEL By Wireless to THE NEW YORK TIMES . LOUGHTON , England , May 26 ? Opening his campaign for re-election to Parliament immediately after appointing a new Cabinet , Prime Minister Winston Churchill told the workers , farmers and villagers of his constituency today that he might leave the country for another Big Three meeting before the general election July 5 . Standing bareheaded in the rain on the back seat of an open touring car beside the thin granite shaft of the little memorial on the Loughton village green , he said that he had informed President Truman , with whom he was " in constant and cordial relations , " that the election " must not be allowed in any way to delay for even one day a meeting between the th heads of government . " Empressing the hope that his candidacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his wife , who sat smiling beside him underneath a brown umbrella , would represent him in the constituency and " answer all your awkward questions . " " We wo n't let you down , Winnie , " somebody shouted from the crowd . Appeal to All Is Seen Since Mr. Churchill as the prospective Conservative . party candidate for the Woodford constituency is not yet opposed by anyone , his words could be interpreted as an appeal to the whole nation . Delivered the day after Joseph E. Davies ' arrival in London for dia1 cussions leading to another threepower conference , Mr. Churchill 's statement belied the earlier presumption that he would not leave Britain during the campaign . At that , his statement was almost lost to the world when the microphone he was using went dead . It began functioning again just in time . Mr. Churchill 's tour was not elaborate like the campaign trip of an American candidate for President . It was more like a member of Congress ' swing around his district . Although he is Prime Minister , Mr. Churchill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His reappointment as Prime Minister depends upon his party 's winning a majority again in the House of Commons . In less than an hour he drove from London to the Woodford constituency , a part of his former Epping constituency , which had been cut in two . He wore his familiar " John Bull " bowler hat and a gray overcoat with a small patch in front where it apparently had been burned by a cigar ash . He traveled between stops in a limousine to ward off the cold rain and spoke at each of eight places along the road from the rear of a small touring car . Crowds Are Enthusiastic It was obvious that if he were the Conservative candidate in all the 640 constituencies in the British Isles his election would be a landslide . At every halt crowds gave three orderly British cheers , " Hip , hip , hooray " three times , and , sang " For he 's a jolly good fel-1 low . " From a passing bus the conductor shouted " Good old Winniel " Outside the Working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drops dripping off their noses and their V-E Day flags sopping wet . At Chigwell Mr. Churchill ate roast beef and Yorkshire pudding at The King 's Head , a roadside inn , once called The Maypole , where Charles Dickens wrote " Barnaby Rudge . " Mr. Churchill dictated to his secretary and took a rest while a patient crowd , several times larger than the village population of 500 , waited at the railway station with their babies and dogs . Mr. Churchill did not kiss any babies until he made an unscheduled stop at a children 's tea party in Wanstead . Descending from the Olympus of 10 Downing Street , the Prime Minister took the plain people into his confidence On state affairs and at the same time showed friendly concern for their own small problems . He expressed regret that the Labor and Liberal party Ministers had left the government to fight the election but said , " It is my duty to carry on with the strong line of policy to which we have pledged ourselves . " Denies " Rush Election " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , referring to Labor 's charges against him . " Most of the elections we have fought have been seventeen days , but this one has to be rushed through in forty . " That brought a laugh . He accepted the label of " caretaker government " for the new Cabinet he formed last night to replace the former coalition , saying that it would " take care of all the interests of Britain at home and abroad . " He praised his constituents for their fortitude under attack by rocket bombs , many of which , falling short of London , landed in Essex , northeast of the capital . To housewives he announced that for all his concern with world affairs he was " giving more personal attention to fish , " which the country needs to make up the cut in the meat ration . When one man asked about the food shortage , the Prime Minister replied , " I have not come here to promise beer and skittles. "               @ @ @ @ @ @
