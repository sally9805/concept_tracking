A onetime Army Air Forces chaplain , now . back in his pastorate , last week told his parishioners how a year in the Army had changed his thinking . Wrote the Rev. Jule Ayers , 33 , in a letter to the 850 members of Wilkes-Barre , Pa. ' s First Presbyterian Church : <P> " Having been . a chaplain in the Army to a unit composed of Catholics , Protestants and Jews , I have become more interested in the ties which unite men spiritually than in the influences which divide them . Thus , I am determined to be known in my community as a minister of God first , a Protestant second , and a Presbyterian third . . . . I am desirous of having the fullest measure of fellowship attainable with Jews and Catholics . . . . <P> " Because there is always an enthusiastic response to dynamic religion in the Army , I want my church to express a faith and a fellowship which is vital and transforming . . . . I shall preach more expository sermons than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pastoral calling I shall spend more time contacting men . I shall reach them at their work . I need them . They need the Church . . . . <P> " I am going to have a more Bible-centered program than I have had previously . I want young people to know God through an understanding of the Scriptures . In the Army , when I observed Protestants and Catholics engaged in discussions on matters of belief , I found that the Protestants appeared at a disadvantage . Profiting by this fact , I want my church to know why it is Protestant , what are the distinctive tenets of the Protestant branch of the Christian Church , and how indigenous and basic Protestantism is to the genius of the Christian faith .
