The true story of the U.S.S. Kearny , which was torpedoed but not sunk three weeks ago , was told from a hospital cot after she arrived at Reykjavik , Iceland , by Ensign Henry Lyman , of Ponkapog , Mass. : <P> The Kearny was on escort duty , westbound . She received a signal to leave her convoy and go to the assistance of another convoy , which was being attacked by U-boats . They reached the convoy late in the afternoon . The attack had apparently ceased . <P> The scattered convoy reformed and sailed into what Ensign Lyman called " as black a night as I 've ever seen . " Out of the blackness came a second submarine assault . <P> " They started to fire torpedoes and we dropped depth charges to drive them off . The submarines were probably on the surface with their decks awash and their engines cut , so we could n't hear them . One tanker was afire and sinking . A corvette was trying to pick up survivors . Somehow a U-boat had maneuvered between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> " The U-boat fired three torpedoes at us . One went off the bow , one went off stern and the third hit us on the starboard side at the forward engine room . " <P> The destroyer was swinging hard to port at the time of the hit . Ensign Lyman heard a terrible roar as the warhead bit through the Kearny 's armor . The explosion killed seven men stationed in the forward boiler room on the steaming watch . Its force ripped up through the deck , wrecked the starboard wing of the bridge , knocked the forward stack back and broke the siren cord so that its shrill yowl could not be shut off . Four others disappeared , probably blown overboard . <P> " We could n't hear a damned thing on the bridge because of the siren . We looked over the side to see whether the engines were still turning over or whether she was settling . It was a matter of minutes before she started to move forward . " The explosion broke the bridge 's control of the engine room and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steer from the second conning station . . . . We had no compass working and the helmsman steered by the flag-that is , he watched the flag to see which way the wind was blowing . " Ensign Lyman and enlisted men tried to fire rockets , but two missed fire and they finally resorted to a Very pistol . Star shells burst to the south and flames from three burning tankers lit the seascape . <P> The chief engineer and what was left of his crew at once began " repairing flooded fuel lines and working down there in the dark and danger . " They put out an electrical fire , bolstered a buckling bulkhead . <P> Thanks to her construction and the tenacity of her men , the Kearny limped safely to port . " Everyone , " said Ensign Lyman , " just did his job-and two or three more . If I am torpedoed again I hope I have this crew with me. "
