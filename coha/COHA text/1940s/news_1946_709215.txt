txt Flour millers , who supply your baker with the main raw material for your daily loaf of bread . are running out of wheat and do n't know what to do about it . Actually . there 's plenty of this grain around the country since last year 's harvest produced a record 1.150 million bushels . But farmers are holding on to much of their wheat . They 're convinced they 'll eventually get a higher price than the present level : wheat brings $1.79 a bushel in Chicago ; that by the way , is 94% above 1941 . This shortage of wheat in the millers ' hands is in its early stages , but a Wall Street Journal survey of half a dozen key points shows the kind of trouble that 's ahead . Bad Situation in Texas From Texas . for example , comes word that all flour mills of Dallas . Fort Worth , Sherman . Waco and other cities of that southwestern state are running short of wheat and many are only operating part-time . Large flour mills in the Buffalo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operate through the winter . Smaller mills may have to close within 45 days for lack of gram . Kansas City mills are producing at capacity but they are reluctant to sell flour because they can not replace the wheat they 're processing . These mills are in the heart of the wheat country . Not since the first World War , say the millers there , have they seen such a shortage of cash wheat . In other areas millers report that the shortage is the worst in history . Atlanta flour millers say " so far , so good " on both quality and quantity of wheat but they anticipate that within a couple of weeks supplies will shrink rapidly . The situation seems pretty much the same everywhere . It has led the Millers ' National Federation to send a delegation to Washington to devise some means of prying wheat loose from the farmers . Concludes the Federation : " The more anyone thinks about the problem of wheat supply for the mills for the remainder of this crop year , the more he must be convinced that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat to move from the farm . " Millers , meantime , are resorting to some Unusual techniques to get wheat . One Buffalo miller explained : You ca n't buy any wheat unless you have something to barter back in return . " Sometimes it becomes double or triple sold two cars of bran in trade for the right to buy a car of soybean meal . This , in turn , was sold to a man who sold the miller five cars of corn . The corn went to a buyer who repaid the favor by selling the miller 20,000 bushels of wheat . Barter , direct or indirect , enters almost every purchase of wheat . Wheat middlings , which the millers used to sell to feed manufacturers , go back to the elevator man now as a matter of course . A miller has to offer two cars of middlings to get a car of soybean meal , which is currency among all the elevator men who have gone into making mixed feeds . In some cases this barter business backfires on the elevator man who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The millers wo n't ship a car of flour to the elevator man until the elevator man assures him of two cars of wheat . One of the loudest wails of the DallasFort Worth millers grows out of the Government 's requisitioning 15 months ago of most North Texas stocks of corn for refiners ' use . The millers say if they had that corn today , they could pry a lot of wheat out of ' farmers . They accuse Kansas City candy manufacturers of coming into their district with $100-acar bribes to buy cash corn . More Barter Business Millers , in their frantic search for wheat to replace their dwindling stocks , are finding the nominal ceilings of less and less value in protecting their price margins , although they agree there is n't much outright or flagrant black-marketing . The first thing they encountered . when the squeeze began to tighten in November , was a demand that merchandising charges , such as the cost of moving wheat into cars or into elevators , he added to ceiling prices . Permissible charges , in some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the farmer is demanding that the miller buy the wheat and take title to it today , and leave it on the farm until April or May . At one cent a bushel a month for storage , this amounts to $4,000 on 100,000 bushels of wheat from January to May . In some instances , the farmer has borrowed from the C.C.C . on wheat , and the . Government also is paying him storage at the same rate . On May 1 , be will hand the miller 's money to the C.C.C. , and put an $8,000 bonus for storage charges in his pocket . The extreme shortage of wheat being Marketed has produced another wrinkle on the Chicago Board of Trade . Hard pressed to meet their flour sales agreements , millers are obtaining cash wheat by selling May wheat futures at a discount of three to Ave cents bushel . They 're doing this despite the fact that the May contract has been tightly wedged against the ceiling of $1.8012 and there are no offerings . The millers are taking quite a chance because they must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . Grain traders already are talking about what sort of penalties may be imposed on millers caught short next May . Normally the Board of Trade penalizes such short sellers who ca n't deliver grain by making them pay the buyer a few cents a bushel . It is suggested that in the case of the May wheat futures situation they might have to contribute as much as five cents a bushel , Quality Holds Up Quality of flour so far has held up well . But Buffalo millers report they may have to stop making their highest grade household flour . Harking back to World War I experience , millers generally are prepared to quit selling branded flour if the - quality declines . They will sell unbranded flour , to avoid losing the good will that attaches to their present high-quality brands . Special-purpose flours  --  cake flour , pancake and other self-rising flours and biscuit mixes ? are disappearing from the market . Millers seeking soft-flour wheat from the Pacific Coast are paying prices that figure as much as 20 cents above the delivered ceilings on which their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One in Pittsburgh said the yeast took hold of his latest batch of flour as if it were so much chalk . American bakers have long been accustomed to excellent flour milling . All they have had to do is to look at the brand on a bag of flour and know exactly its ? content of protein and gluten , and exactly how fast it would work through their automatic machinery . Now bakers roust return to sniffing , hefting and poking the rising dough and to the other precautions their fathers took . This is n't expected to hurt the quality of their product . Housewives will also get by nicely even If the grade of flour goes down a little . The addmilk , stir and pop-in-the-oven type of baking already feels the supply pinch . May Disrupt Relief Program Flour millers say that the lag in movement of wheat from the farms , even if it does n't bring an actual shortage of bread , is already disrupting our export program of flour and wheat for ? relief , Domestic and foreign production requirements from July 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured at 300 million 100-pound sacks of flour . This is more than the industry has ever shown itself capable of grinding ; the record month . October , 1945 , saw total production of 24,805,407 bags . The record year was 1944-45. with 271,251,007 sacks . Every day'a shutdown by even one mill moves production farther below the 300-million-sack goal . Although the United States Government would like to see 225 million bushels of wheat or the equivalent in flour ) exported to hungry , war-ravaged countries in the first half of 1946 , exporters say it is n't possible . Even if plenty of wheat were available , port facilities would be able to handle only about - 29 million bushels a month , or 174 million bushels by July 1 , But the wheat is n't available for shipment now . Only yesterday Portugal asked for offers on 481,000 bushels but exporters refused the business . Several millers around the country have been agitating for having the C.C.C . call loans on 55 million bushels of stored wheat . due to be either surrendered or redeemed before April 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says there will be no increase in wheat ceilings , the farmers wo n't gain anything by holding the wheat three more months . Secretary Anderson knows the farmer 's answer to that one . It was expressed in wartime , when a similar " foreclosure " on corn loans swelled corn supply at a critical time . Farm organizations said then that the seizure of loan stocks headed off a price rise which they had coming to them and which they would have got if terms of the corn loan had been respected .
