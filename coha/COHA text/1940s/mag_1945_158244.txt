The Allied campaign in western Burma reached an anticlimax . For more than two miserable , rain-soaked years , British and Indian troops had tried to reach Akyab. malarial island port well down the coast toward Rangoon . Now they looked upon it from Foul Point , across four miles of treacherous water , and steeled themselves for a tough amphibious operation . <P> Last year Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten 's Southeast Asia Command had been denied landing craft because of more urgent needs in Europe , but now at last there were enough to permit an assault on Akyab . It was elaborately prepared , with landings scheduled at three points . The assault troops were to be British Commandos and units of the 25th Indian Division , part of the XV Indian Army Corps under Lieut . General Sir Alexander Frank Philip Christison , who studies birds between campaigns . <P> A gas-engined bird stole this show : Group Captain W. D. David landed an R.A.F. liaison plane at one of Akyab 's eight airstrips , found that the Japs had left on New Year 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The assault troops landed as planned ; but they found no enemy to assail . Akyab was theirs , with a harbor 20 ft. deep and a system of airfields from which the Eastern Air Command could bomb Rangoon ( 320 miles to the southeast ) in preparation for bigger amphibious moves . <P> Akyab would be of no direct value in the campaign for Mandalay ; it is separated from the Irrawaddy valley by 10,000-ft. mountains . But its capture frees about 50,000 British and Indian troops for the drive on Rangoon and , afterward , Singapore . <P> Meanwhile the Allied campaign to cut a way through northern Burma to southwest China neared its climax . In midweek . Chinese troops which had driven from the Salween River , in Yunnan Province , captured Wanting , one of the last two Japanese strongpoints on the best road between Myitkyina and Ynnan . The last remaining enemy strongpoint then was Namhkam , already under artillery fire from Lieut . General Daniel I. Sultan 's Chinese and U.S. forces working the opposite way , from Bhamo . The gap was narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lashed back , retook Wanting . They would be pushed out again , but they may have delayed the transit of the first convoy over the new Ledo-Burma Road by another weary weel or two .
