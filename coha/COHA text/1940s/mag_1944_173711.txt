MANPOWER <P> The best fighting ages are from 18 to 26 . The average age of the U.S. Army is now 27 . <P> Selective Service is now about 100,000 men behind in its schedule of Army inductions . By latest estimate , to make up that deficit and to fill scheduled quotas , SS must draft 1,008,000 men by July 1 . <P> To provide requisite youthful stamina , at least 250,000 of those men must be taken from the 1,185,000 aged 18-26 now deferred as key workers in war industry and agriculture . <P> An estimated 1,000,000 of the 3,623,000 men now classified 4-F are contributing nothing whatever to the war effort . <P> Last week Washington manpower officials began to put these facts together and try to make some sense out of them . <P> It was high time . Since Feb. 26 , when President Roosevelt announced that the armed services would take almost every able-bodied U.S. male aged 18-26 , Washington has been more topsy-turvy than ever . Representatives of industry after industry have streamed into town to wail that they could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were drafted . Officials of Army , Navy , War Manpower Commission , Selective Service , WPB , ODT , Petroleum Administration for War , et al , have been scrambling away at cross-purposes or behind each other 's backs , trying to get favored treatment for their industrial wards . <P> Last week the squabbling got organized , by formation under WMC of an inter-agency Committee on Manpower Claimants . First job of the CMC was to decide which industries rate deferments . By week 's end CMC had settled on five : aircraft , landing craft , rubber , rockets , radar . Competition was still fierce , since it is planned to defer a maximum of only 75,000 men . Once the industries are agreed on , the next job will be to list the most critical plants within each industry . Final selection of workers to be deferred will be left to plant bosses , local and State draft officials . The SS boss , Major General Lewis B. Hershey , insisted that the placing of an industry or plant on the critical list emphatically does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draft-exempt . The demand for fighting men will be met even at the cost of some loss in war production . For , as General Hershey wapsodized in his monthly Selective Service bulletin : " Warriors win wars with weapons ; but weapons will not win wars without warriors to wield them . " <P> The other half of the pattern which began to emerge from the manpower muddle was a belated equivalent of War I 's " work or fight " order . First proposed last October by Connecticut 's Representative Clare Boothe Luce , the replacement of drafted war workers by noncontributing 4-Fs was now suddenly endorsed by General Hershey , Secretary of War Stimson , Under Secretary Robert Patterson and Assistant Secretary of the Navy Ralph Bard . The Army &; Navy would still like a National Service Act , which is politically impossible to get . They fall back on Congresswoman Luce 's bill . Some dopesters thought it unnecessary , thought a public listing of 4-F idlers and nonessential workers would do the trick . Others proposed to hold the threat of induction in Army " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs . Another plan would include 38-to-45-year-olds , as well as 4-Fs , in the program .
