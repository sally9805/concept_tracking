txt DEWEY HITS DELAY ON PLEA FOR POWER FROM ST . LAWRENCE He Intimates Truman Holds Up State 's Application to Press Congress on Seaway Project SAYS PLANTS ARE CRIPPLED Shortage of Current Reduces Output and Deprives Workers of Jobs , Governor Asserts By LEO EGAN Special to Tin NEW YORE Tams . ALBANY , Dec. ** delay in advancing New York 's application to proceed with the development of St. Lawrence River hydro-electric power was characterized as " entirely inexcusable " today by Gov . Thomas E. Dewey . By inference , he accused President Truman of holding up the application to increase pressure for Congressional action on the proposed St. Lawrence Seaway . At a news conference following a meeting with the members of the State Power Authority , Governor Dewey reported that the state now had a serious power shortage and ' that rising prices of coal and labor were making electrical power more expensive . " New York State is suffering heavily right now , " he explained . " More than a year ago seventy industrial plants in western New York had their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ September of this year the largest up-state electrical utility had to reduce power to all users of more than 1,000 kilowatts by 15 per cent . Loss of Jobs Stressed " This is affecting production and ! is causing unemployment . This morning we learned that the production of aluminum is gravely affected and that in February a Niagara Falls plant will have to cut down at the rate of 40,000.000 pounds of aluminum a year for lack of power . " Elimination of the plant , he added , would be a blow to defense production and also to the produc- ! tion of kitchen utensils . It would also deprive 1,000 men of work within the next few weeks . " The Federal Government is sitting on New York State 's application and it has been sitting too long , " Mr. Dewey went on . " The New York Powi'r Authority filed ! its application with the Federal Power Commission on July 16 for approval of plans to go ahead with the Province of Ontario . " There has been no action on it yet . " According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be developed in the International Rapids part of the St. Lawrence even more than New York . " I understand the reason this application is being sat on , " Mr. Dewey explained . " ig because the Administration is once again going to submit the St. Lawrence Seaway to Congress . " The Governor said he had long been on record in favor of the seaway but that he believed the dispute over the project , which has been going on for thirty-four years , should not be allowed to hold up power development any longer . Failure to proceed with the hydro-electric development since the joint executive agreement between Canada and the United States was // reached in 1941 already had resulted in the loss of $623,000,000 worth of electric power or enough to have paid the entire cost of the project and lei a $160,000,000 surplus , Mr. Dewey estimated . According to his figures 12,600 , - 000,000 kilowatts of hydro-electric power can be generated annually in the International Rapids section of the St. Lawrence . Half of th1r would be allocated to New York State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share is just under 30 per cent of the total 1945 production of electrical energy in the state , according to Power Authority figures . It is almost half the up-state production .
