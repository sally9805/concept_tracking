" For some the end of the war in Europe will mean joyous reunion , but for many more it will mean a new period of sacrifice and anxiety . " With that warning last week the War Department opened its top secret files and told what it intends to do with its gigantic Army of 8,300,000 men . <P> The Army will be reduced . To provide " all the strength we believe we can deploy effectively against Japan , " and to maintain training and supply in the U.S. , the War Department plans to get down to a strength of 7,000,000 by year 's end . Some 400,000 of these will be employed as occupation troops , serving in the newly activated Fifteenth Army of Lieut . Gen eral Leonard T. Gerow . <P> The Lucky Ones . Counting on replacements from Selective Service , the Army was able to make this estimate : after V-E day it will be able to discharge 2,000,000 men . <P> These-the lucky ones marked for " joyous reunions " - will be : 1 ) the physically unfit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been overseas but have been in " a long time , " and 3 ) some 1,300,000 troops now overseas who have had " extended and arduous service . " <P> But even for these men , reunion may be a long way off . Reason : ships will be needed to move other men and supplies to the Pacific . It takes 15 Liberty ships to move the equipment of one armored division . There are 70 divisions in Europe , not to speak of hundreds of thousands of corps troops , supply and medical troops , etc . After World War I , when the Army &; Navy both could concentrate on the job , it took a year to bring back 2,000,000 men . <P> All the Army could promise was that it would do its best . Converted cargo and grain ships will be pressed into a shuttle service ; passenger ships and transports will be used ; 800 transport planes , capable of flying back 50,000 men a month , have also been set aside for the job . But it will be a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . <P> Who Will They Be ? Nevertheless , millions of wives and sweethearts could dream and hope . Who would be the chosen 1,300,000 ? <P> In picking them the Army will embark on a ticklish and complex business . About half will come from the European Theater , a third from the Pacific . Most of the others-luckiest of all-are already in the U.S. , home on rotation . <P> A point system ( TIME , Sept. 18 ) will be the basis for release . Soldiers will get credits for length of service , records in combat , decorations , wounds , etc. , children or other dependents . Point values had not been announced at week 's end . When they are announced , soldiers can figure up their scores . In general , those with top scores will get priority , although the Army is going to hang on to some-points notwithstanding-because of their special skills . <P> SNAFU &; FIFO . The War Department knew full well that the system would provoke plenty of G.I. gripes , home-front anguish and trouble for the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kin demanding to know why Joe ca n't come home . Congressmen themselves , breathing the air of victory , are causing the Army anxiety with their new eagerness to move in on things .
