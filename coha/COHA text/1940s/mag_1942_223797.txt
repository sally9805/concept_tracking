In its 19-year history , Philadelphia 's Hedgerow Theater has garnered as much glory as any community playhouse in the U.S. Its director , disheveled , 49-year-old Jasper Deeter , is hopelessly stage-mad but brilliantly stage-minded . He has built up a permanent company who get no salary ( only board &; lodging on a comfortable farm ) , receive no billing ( yet often turn down good paying offers ) . Indifferent to commercial success Hedgerow is content to pioneer with unknown playwrights and to pay tribute to great ones-Shakespeare , Molire , Shaw . <P> Last week glory went out the window while notoriety came in at the door . It has been over two years a-coming , ever since Director Deeter read one script he could not handle . That script was the Selective Service Act . Deeter realized that most of his actors would be caught in the draft . Five of his men were conscientious objectors , but to Deeter their consciences seemed to mean less than their contribution to art . The life of Hedgerow was threatened , and with it the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to President Roosevelt , characterizing Hedgerow as " a work of national importance " and requesting a blanket exemption for his group . The President turned the letter over to the Adjutant General 's office , which curtly told Deeter that nobody could change the will of Congress . <P> The draft came . The five conscientious objectors were all classified IA . ( A sixth man took his chances , was put in 4-F . ) Hedgerow besought the draft board to defer its IAs because of their importance : Morgan Smedley , " in charge of the ushering , parking and patrolling staff " ; David Metcalf , " an institution builder " ; George Ebeling , " importantly placed on the direction committee . " They got nowhere . Hedgerow wrote to Major General Hershey . It appealed to Paul V. McNutt of the War Manpower Commission . It implored Eleanor Roosevelt to do something . They still got nowhere . <P> Fortnight ago , having worked ineffectually behind the scenes , Hedgerow spoke its lines from the center of the stage . To influential citizens all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " change the minds " of draft officials . No replies were announced , but the Philadelphia papers last week loosed on Hedgerow a flood of sarcasm and censure for getting too big for its Army boots . <P> At just that moment one of the conshies , 26-year-old Russian-born Michael De Beausset ( who played Major Swindon in Shaw 's The Devil 's Disciple ) , was due to turn up for induction . Instead he wrote the Army a letter : " As I explained to my draft board , I like the United States of America . But my sentiments would hamper the war effort . " He was promptly arrested as a draft-dodger.
