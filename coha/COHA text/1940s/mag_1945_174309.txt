Through the smoke the Russians could see the great Gothic tower of Knigsberg 's Schloss . For nearly seven centuries the Schloss ( castle ) had stood as a symbol of Prussianism . There the Teutonic Order had been nurtured . The tower reared 277 feet , a monument to the Junker caste that was the heart and mind of German militarism . <P> Last week the Third White Russian Army of young ( 37 ) General Ivan Chernyakhovsky rolled up to Knigsberg 's suburbs on two sides . From four miles out the Russians could hear the blasts as the Germans set off demolition charges , destroyed whole sections of the city ( normal pop . 320,000 ) . <P> In less than two weeks General Chernyakhovsky and Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky had done what Russian armies in 1914 failed to do : clamp a bear hug on the province of East Prussia . Chernyakhovsky had struck from the east and north , Rokossovsky from the southeast . They ripped through historic forests , the hunting grounds of the Kaisers , through cities rich in Prussian military lore-Tilsit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of its speed , the Russian victory seemed easy . It had not been . East Prussians fought with Teutonic fury . There , if anywhere , the Germans had girded well for a last-ditch battle . Every settlement was a little fortress , every house a gun post . The Germans threw in everything : crack troops , Volksstrmer , trainees , inhabitants of towns , the largest number of buzz bombs yet rocketed against the Russians . <P> Shortening the Line . But Russian power would not be denied . By this week the Red Armies had accomplished what no Junker could have believed possible . Rokossovsky , striking swiftly , enveloped the Germans with the bear 's left arm . It reached the Baltic 43 miles southwest of Knigsberg , enfolded Elbing , created a pocket 85 miles deep . The Russians had done another impossible : they had broken through the " impregnable " German defenses in the Masurian Lakes area , had narrowed the pocket to an average width of 40 miles . Inside was what remained of a Wehrmacht force of some 200,000 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in furious counterattacks . There was little future for them if they succeeded . The arm that enclosed them was an inner envelopment by this week . Rokossovsky had developed a similar encircling sweep , aimed at Danzig and the German Baltic coast . <P> By sealing off the East Prussian flank to their main drives toward the Reich proper , the Russians already had a victory of the first magnitude . If they could complete the liquidation of the pocket as speedily , the victory would be even greater . It would shorten the Russian line by some 300 miles , release thousands of Red Army troops , might provide first-rate ports for Russian supplies . <P> None of this would be easy . There was every indication that the Germans would try to hold Knigsberg , Elbing , Danzig , Gdynia from the Russians-as they were denying Lorient , Saint-Nazaire , Bordeaux to the Allies in the west .
