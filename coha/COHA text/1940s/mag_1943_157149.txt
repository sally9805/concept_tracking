What food do soldiers like , what do they eat because they have to ? To find the answer to this and many another delicate dietetic question , the Army detailed Master Sergeant Horace Scherwin and 50 other enlisted men . In a twelve-month they examined meals served to 2,474,362 men in 500 Army mess halls , measured the contents of countless garbage cans , clocked eating habits . By last week they were able to report that the U.S. soldier : <P> &gt; Likes hot dogs better than any other meat , dislikes soup . <P> &gt; Likes mashed potatoes , dislikes Army fried potatoes ( 35% uneaten ) . &gt; Likes fruit and gelatin desserts better than pie . <P> Likes coffee weak , prefers cocoa to coffee . <P> &gt; Next to frankfurters the soldier likes baked ham . Then roast veal and sausage . Fifteen per cent of all roast beef , bacon and cold cuts goes back to the kitchen , 25% of liver . Never strong for green vegetables , the soldier especially detests kale . He likes baked potatoes next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are top favorites , canned fruits next . Pies trail fruit salad and gelatins . Least popular : puddings . <P> &gt;For breakfast the soldier prefers dry to cooked cereals , eats 87% of the prunes served him , 82% of the scrambled eggs , drinks 71% of the coffee . Most eating is done at noon , 92% as much is done at breakfast , only 68% as much at evening . There is little dawdling at table . Breakfast takes about 18 minutes , noon dinner 19 , supper 17 . <P> &gt;Weather has a strong influence on the soldier 's appetite . On cold , brisk days he wants 6% more than in moderate weather , 12% less on a hot day . After a day on the rifle range he eats 5% more than after a day in barracks , more during overcast weather than clear . <P> &gt; If the soldier pitches in at once , he eats 2% more than if he must wait , according to Army custom , until all have lined up at their places . He eats more if an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5% more food is consumed . The soldier averages 5 lb. of food a day . ( Civilian average : 4 lb . ) Cost averages 56 per man a day . <P> Results . Scherwin 's survey , made on orders from Major General Edmund B. Gregory , Quartermaster General , recommended that cooks cease preparing meals to feed the number of men at the morning roll call . He found absenteeism at dinner and supper often ran as high as 20% . Reasons : mild illness , eating at post exchanges , anxiety to get away early on leave . By allowing for absentees , the Army hopes to cut $119,000,000 from its annual food bill , which in 1943 will be about $1,250,000,000 . Other savings may be made by eliminating wastage that Scherwin uncovered , but the chief gain will be that the soldier will get more of the food he likes , less of such items as kale and liver .
