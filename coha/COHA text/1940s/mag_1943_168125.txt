One of the Pacific Coast 's most striking artists got blackballed last fortnight by the streamlined and businesslike Los Angeles County Museum . He promptly raised a willywaw , of the sort that gets pictures talked about . The man who raised the rumpus is Hilaire Hiler , whose great sleek murals of subsea fauna and the oceanic origins of life are a feature of San Francisco 's handsome public bathing pavilion in Aquatic Park ( TIME , Feb. 6 , 1939 ) . <P> Hiler had submitted vivid canvases of a nautilus , a purple flower and an iceberg to the Los Angeles Museum 's fourth annual showing of local artists . His primitivist father , 77-year-old Meyer Hiler , had also offered work . When the Museum 's sole juror , Director Roland McKinney , turned the Hilers down , Hilaire wrote : <P> " ' . . . I will confine myself herein to saying again that I can not accept the illegitimate judgment of colleagues to whom I never delegated the mission of appreciating my work . . . . ' This . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter written by Painter Paul Czanne over three quarters of a century ago . Apparently things are not much improved . " <P> In rebuttal , Director McKinney offered only silence . <P> Paris or Bust . The Hilers will probably get along . They have been doing so for some time . If they can not speak with any great eloquence for themselves , their work speaks for them with widening effect . Large , gregarious Hilaire was born 44 years ago in St. Paul . He went to the University of Pennsylvania , majored in finance at the insistence of Papa ( longtime notions seller and theatrical agent ) , flunked out after two years . Informed by two Philadelphia art schools that he could never learn to draw , he taught himself the piano and the saxophone , thought he would support himself as a Paris art student by jazz playing . But he was forcibly removed from a Europe-bound freighter by Papa 's private detectives . <P> Eventually , however , he made it .

Back in Paris , Hiler was manager , host , musician and barman at the famed Jockey , Left Bank hot spot owned by Jockey Milton Henry 's wealthy widow . One night in her cups Proprietress Henry ejected a Negro who proved to be a Senegalese prince and member of the Chamber of Deputies . Next day the Jockey was padlocked . Hiler reopened it , invited every Negro in Paris to the reopening . <P> Cafs and Costumes . Hiler held his first Paris one-man show of paintings in 1923 , his first in the U.S. two years later . . But Parisians knew Hiler best as a bar and nightclub decorator ( the Jungle , the Grand Duke , the Manitou ) , as a cafe lounger with Ezra Pound , Ernest Hemingway , Man Ray . When nearly blind James Joyce could not see a drawing Hiler made of the writer 's head , Hiler did another in thick charcoal which Joyce could follow with his fingers .
