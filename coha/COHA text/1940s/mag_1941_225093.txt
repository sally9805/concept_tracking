The heaviest submarine in the world was ready to go back into action . Capitalne de Corvette Louis Blaison told his countrymen by short-wave radio last week that his vessel would soon again " seek out the enemy . " <P> His vessel is the huge Surcouf , which has been in Portsmouth , N.H. for repairs for two months . On the surface , the Surcouf displaces 2,880 tons , more than twice as much as the sunk destroyer Reuben James ( 1,193 tons ) . Submerged , she displaces 4,304 tons . She can cruise 12,000 miles-more than two complete round trips from Plymouth , Mass , to Plymouth , England . She is so big that she carries a seaplane in a hangar aft of her turret . <P> Most of the Surcouf 's crew left her in a British port when France fell , and chose to return home . Captain Blaison last week told how he had got her back in service : " With a small nucleus of veteran submarine men , we built up a crew ; we transformed fishermen into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soldiers into mechanics . . . . "
