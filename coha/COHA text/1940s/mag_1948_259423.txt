Once a week for 81 years ( wartime excepted ) , the reigning wits of Punch have met in an elegant office at London 's 10 Bouverie Street to eat , drink beer , make puns , argue politics and carve their initials in the dining table . Last week , at the famed Punch Round Table , the ghosts of onetime Punchinellos Tennyson , Thackeray and Mark Lemon might have quit the premises in disgust . For the first time in its history , the venerable humor magazine was to have an editor who was an artist instead of a writer . <P> But Punch 's well-ensconced readers would not be startled from their armchairs : they had chuckled over the cartoons of rotund Cyril Kenneth Bird , 61 , for years . As art editor , Bird , a jolly , crinkly little man , has been responsible for much of the streamlining of Punch in recent years . He had worked under quiet and gracious Editor Edmund George Valpy Knox* ( " Evoe " to his readers ) , who was now retiring at 67 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Day . <P> Punch readers know Bird as " Fougasse , " the signature on his sophisticated , economically limned cartoons . Trained as a civil engineer , he went to Gallipoli as a sapper with the Royal Engineers in World War I. One day he stepped on a German land mine ( a type called the fougasse ) , and was all but killed . He was bedridden for four years with a broken back ; and started to draw . A correspondence-school art teacher sent one of his drawings to Punch , which has been gobbling his work ever since . <P> Punch now sells 176,000 copies a week , higher than prewar but a shade under the 1947 record of 184,000 . Any change Bird makes will be gradual ; he does n't want to lose an old reader to gain a new one . He brushes off inquiries about his plans : " Nothing is ever planned on Punch ' ' he chuckles . " It just happens . " <P> <P> * Elder brother of Msgr . Ronald Knox , mystery-story writer and Catholic Bible translator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
