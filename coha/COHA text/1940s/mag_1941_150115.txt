Hearst is buying again . For years chief Hearst news told of papers suspended , properties merged , treasures sold . Turn of the tide was signaled last week when the New York Journal &; American stepped out to buy a membership in Associated Press ( from the waning Brooklyn Eagle ) . Other recent signs of the turn : Hearst 's Journal &; American and Baltimore News-Post have just taken on United Press , Hearst 's New York radio station WINS has just stepped up its wattage from 1,000 to 50,000.
