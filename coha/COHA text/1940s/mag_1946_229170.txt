For years the world would remember-perhaps with honor , perhaps with shame - the final scene . The empty dock with its bare wooden benches had looked vast and strange . An almost intimate solemnity , unbroken even by the mundane presence of photographers , had pervaded the packed courtroom . The brittle silence had given way to the firm , clear voice of Lord Justice Sir Geoffrey Lawrence ( pronouncing eleven times : " . . . death by hanging " ) and to the noise of a paneled door , eleven times closing behind a condemned man . The occasion had lifted the eleven men from past bravado and past cowardice alike . <P> But last week , as the condemned awaited the judgment 's execution , their composure , and that of some of the nations which judged them , began to crack . <P> " Men against Death .

It was perhaps typical of the world 's comparative ethics that the heaviest twinges of conscience were experienced in the U.S. and Britain . <P> Conspicuous Disparity . Thoughtful people throughout the Western World realized that not merely eleven wretched lives were at stake , but Western democracy 's moral position in the inevitable trials of history . Their doubts about Nurnberg 's justice were perhaps best summed up by two British publications . Said London 's Economist :
