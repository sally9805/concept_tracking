Abide with us : for it is toward evening , and the day is far spent . - St . Luke 24 : 29 <P> These words , spoken by the disciples at Emmaus , rang in the mind of the Rev. Henry Francis Lyte . All his life long the gentle English Methodist had hoped to leave something behind him to testify to the glory of God . Though his books of poems* were well enough received , Lyte feared that they would not long survive him . In 1847 , when he was 54 , he felt that his life was almost over . Consumption and asthma , from which he had suffered for more than half his years , would not leave him much more time . <P> During these last days the moment came that he had always hoped for . The result was one of the best known hymns in the English language : Abide with me ! Fast falls the eventide ; The darkness deepens : Lord , with me abide ! When other helpers fail , and comforts flee , Help of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hundred years these words have been sung , + or spoken , or whispered by men &; women in time of need . The words were sung while the Titanic was sinking and on the beaches of Dunkirk . In World War I , Nurse Edith Cavell repeated the hymn as she faced the firing squad . It has often been heard in prison camps , and it has sounded faintly through the wreckage of caved-in mines : <P> Swift to its close ebbs out life 's little day ; Earth 's joys grow dim , its glories pass away ; Change and decay in all around I see ; 0 Thou who changest not , abide with me ! <P> This Sunday in England 's Westminster Abbey , under the statue dedicated to Methodism 's hymn-writing founders , John and Charles Wesley , a memorial tablet will be unveiled to Henry Francis Lyte . And in almost every country throughout the world Christians will celebrate the centenary of his death and of the composition of his long-lived hymn . <P> Hold Thou Thy Cross before my closing eyes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skies ; Heaven 's morning breaks , and earth 's vain shadows flee : In life , in death , 0 Lord , abide with me ! <P> * One of them , the hymn Praise , my Soul , the King of Heaven , has been selected by Princess Elizabeth as the opening hymn at her wedding . + To the tune composed by William Henry Monk , first musical editor of the Church of England 's Hymns Ancient and Modern .
