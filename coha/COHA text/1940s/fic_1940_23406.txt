412 , Ntlial'e SHADOW OF A GIRL A STORY BY E. B. ASHTON ccinn , " I said , " let 's get married . " j " Remember Dunya ? " Jill asked in her lightest voice . " Poor kid . Wonder what happened to her . " " I do n't care , " I said . " I do n't know who you 're talking about . " " Why , Tommy , " she laughed . " You wo n't forget her if you live to be a hundred . " " No , " I said . Jill was shaking her hair and I wanted to run the pale flood through my fingers . Remember Dunya ? Every day , every night . We were at Angelo 's on Forty-sixth Street , with me freshly shaven and Jill looking lovelier than ever , and with us , between us , was Dunya ? from Przadniedz , or some other unspeakable place which the papers said was now " in flames from aerial bombardment . " Maybe Dunya was dead . We both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead she was thousands of miles away , but when I was with Jill I never felt we were alone . Whither we went went Dunya . " I do n't even know what she looked like any more , " I said casually . Jill snapped at me . " Need a description ? " and when I did not answer she went on , " Popeyed . Skin like leather . Going to lose her figure pretty soon  --  but perhaps you like that . " " Do n't , honey . Please do n't . " Angelo came himself to bring us zuppa Inglese , and to ask me what I thought of the war . I said to hell with the war . Angelo showed his teeth ; he thought so too . Jill smiled and we ate and talked fast and looked away from each other . I thought grimly of everyone spreading the news of how much in love we were and how utterly happy . But the real story was not of Jill and me . It was Dunya 's , all of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland . I met her in Zoppot . If you do n't know Zoppot you have missed something . It is next door to Danzig , in what was once Free City territory , two jumps away from Gdynia where I was checking shipments of U. S. oil . I used to make the jumps about twice a week . After hours Gdynia ? " the up-and-coming gateway to Poland " ? was a sorry dump , but Zoppot was fast and loose . One night I hit the casino for a few Danziger gulden and went down the boulevard to spend them in one of the bars , and stopped at the sight of a team of horses wedged in between the cars that were lining the curbs . They stood before one of the shoddier joints , harnessed to what is known as a panje cart  --  the Polish version of a station wagon . On the cart , slack rein in hand , sat a girl . I looked at her curiously  --  it was an odd time and place for a girl to be sitting alone on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as if I were trespassing on posted property and she out of kindness was not calling the police . I went into the bar and had drinks with a blonde who said she was Hungarian . After a while the customers began cutting up and I felt an international riot brewing and left . I had been inside for an hour , but the girl on the cart was still there . She was looking ahead , seeming unconscious of the rising noise inside . I passed her , and suddenly she spoke , in a careful English : I was an American , was I not ? Had I seen a tall , bald gentleman in the bar , in riding clothes , probably not quite sober ? I knew which one she meant a huge , burly fellow with a red face and iron-gray hair , roaring drunk , who had played the leader of the Polish faction . I said I had seen him and waited for her to say more , but she just sat and scowled . Behind the door the noise grew . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The big one was last . He shook his fists at the place and turned , and in stepping back sat abruptly down on the pavement . His friends sought to help him up , and then the girl was out of the cart and ran over and took him away from them . They grinned , and when she saw that she blew up . Dragging the big one along , she blazed away in a stream of rapid Polish , too fast for me to follow , but her meaning was plain and the men stood round like sheep . When she had the drunk in the cart he slumped back and went to sleep . She got in beside him and seized the reins without looking at the others , and then I heard her talking English again : " I am Dunya Barowska . This , " pointing her chin at the snoring hulk at her side , " is my father , Stanislas Barowski . " She nodded to me , clicked her tongue , and the horses pulled away . I went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed at the story and told me what I had seen was a routine performance . Pan Barowski was an important Pole ; one of the farmers who had been settled by Warsaw on former German estates in the Corridor . He was a smart , powerful man when he was sober . His wife was dead ; Dunya was his only child . Every time he went ona spree she tagged along , waiting outside to drive him home when he was no longer able to hold the reins . In the bar they thought he 'd be back soon . I went there night after night ; it was a week until the big man came in . I rushed out and , sure enough , there was the girl on the cart . She laughed aloud when I greeted her . I asked her to go to some other place with me , her father would n't come out yet for a while ; but she shook her head . I climbed on the seat beside her and we talked while old Stanislas gol plastered . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he stumbled out on the street . I saw a lot of Dunya from then on . She drove up on the pier with her ponies and came to my office and made me explain shipping charts to her and bills of lading . She wanted to know everything ; Poland had to be trained to new methods so the Germans would no longer sneer at " polnische Wirtschaft . " Her English was clear and precise ; she had gone to the Danzig Lyceum , she said sadly ; it was too bad that so many things could be learned well only in the German schools . But Poland was young , she said ; soon Polish schools would be even better than German ones . She wanted me to quit my job and teach Poles to ship oil . I laughed at her and said there were plenty of Poles who knew the business as well as I did , but she said no matter , Poland could n't have too many good men . When she talked of Poland her eyes widened and her voice caught in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought . I found it amusing , then . I had heard of the patriotism of Polish women . I was playing a game with myself now over Dunya : who would win , Poland or I ? I thought it was in the bag until the Germans took up the cry for Danzig . I had a lovely time before then anyway . We drove in the panje cart up along the river to Barowski 's farm , and she told me the Polish names of the villages , laughing when I tried to guess how they were spelled and never was right . She took me out on the fields to meet her father , and was proud when the hands on seeing her did not pull their caps as most Polish peasants do . " I broke them of it , " she explained . " We all work for Poland ; why should they salute me ? " I could have told her a reason but she would not have understood . She said , " Out here I 'm no lady . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dunya told him who I was . He asked her , " You like him ? " and when she nodded he shook hands with inc . " If she likes you you 're all right . She 's a fine girl , " he said with a proud grin , " too fine for an old soak like me . " The girl gazed at him with a starry-eyed affection . He was Poland for her ; to me he looked as old farmers do anywhere . But Dunya had little of the farmer 's daughter . When she came to see me we always wound up in Zoppot . She looked a lot better than the imitation French cocottes there or the German girls from Danzig . I used to take her dancing  --  five-o'clock tea at the Promenade . She loved it but she would not go out with me at night . I thought that was funny too , that a girl who would sit at all hours alone before any dive , waiting for her old man to get tight enough to be thrown out should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never gave in either . But in other ways she soon showed me it was not for patriotic reasons alone that she wanted me to stay  --  until the Germans took up the cry for Danzig . I never talked politics with her because I thought all those squabbles could be settled easily with some good will on both sides , and when I once said that to her it was days before she spoke to me again . But I hated to watch her getting more and more troubled . Crazy rumors were flying through the town , and people slowly began to believe in war . Dunya 's mind was on it all the time , frightened one minute and full of heroics the next . One day I saw her father with his head bandaged , and when I asked her if he 'd been stewed again , she saidno , he had been quite sober . Later I heard in the bar that old Stan had been on the wrong end of a Nazi-Pole argument . I felt sorry for Dunya . I told her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a grateful look but said no , I must n't . And then , out of a clear sky , she was talking about Jill . It seemed she knew a lovely American girl who just then was traveling in Poland . She had known her for a long time . They wrote to each other . She never told me the girl 's name , only talked about " her American . " But the girl appeared to be tall , blonde , and beautiful ; she had been everywhere and was incredibly smart . When the war came she would go home by way of Gdynia . I must see that I 'd be leaving on the same boat , Dunya said . She was quite sure her friend and I would hit it off well . In fact , she seemed to be sure her friend and I were really made for each other . She did not say so in so many words , but that was the idea and I was quick to resent it . It is an odd thing about men 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastime , something to chase the boredom of the place ; but when she tried to talk me into another girl I saw right off how much more she had come to mean . She did arouse my curiosity about the other and I was looking forward to meeting her , but I was n't going to be inveigled into any blind date while I still had Dunya . Only , by then , she was drawing away from me . We were together as often , and as intensely , but it was she now who did n't much seem to mind that we should come to the parting of our ways . She was sorry ; she was fond of me , but I was an American ; if war came to Poland I should have to go . And war , it was becoming more clear every day , would come to Poland . It was a blazing summer afternoon when Dunya came to my office and I had a cable to show her , from New York , ordering me home . " Good , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like hell , " I said . " Now I can do what you said I ought to do  --  quit and show your boys here how to ship oil . " She shook her head . " No need to know that now . All we must know now is how to fight . About that you can teach us nothing . " We sat in the panje cart and she drove through town at a walk toward the Hela dunes . We did not go to Zoppot any more . The Nazis were running Zoppot and they knew Stan Barowski 's girl . " The Sobieski is sailing on Saturday , " Dunya said . " I think my American will be on it . " I said I was n't sailing Saturday . " But you must . Your company has cabled you to come back . " " They can whistle for me , " I said . She asked , " What would you do here ? This will not be your war . You 're American  --  as she is . " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about fighting . " I was talking rot and I knew it . I suddenly wondered if she might have been goading me into it on purpose . I was no soldier . Moreover , she no longer wanted me there . She had grown far away from me . I was a useless object that could only be in the way . We sat on a high dune and she looked at the waters with a fierce pride . " They want to take it from us . " It sounded as if she herself owned the Baltic Sea . She said , " You must take the Sobieski . It may be the last boat , and the captain is an old friend ; I like you to sail on his ship . When you see my American you 'll know where you belong . " All right , I thought , have it your way . Her precious Poland did n't mean marbles to me . She was all that held me , and she did n't want me there . She did not even come on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had written Dunya from Warsaw and in her letter had made remarks about Poland ; Dunya did not want to see her again . She asked me not to talk of her to the girl ; I should act as if I had neverseen Dunya Barowska . She wanted my word on it . I could n't see why , but I promised . She had been with me the night before ? crying and clinging to me with the passion of a lost soul , and then taking leave with a disinterested chill that made me furious . In the afternoon she brought the panje cart to drive me down . She drove sitting erect , with the reins held up to her chin , in the don't-touch-me manner she had had when we first met . I wanted to kiss her before going up the gangplank but she averted her face . And on the boat the first thing I saw was Jill . It hit me so hard that I could n't help staring at her  --  and she looked back , first puzzled and then smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rail too to look down at the pier for Dunya , who stood with her eyes wandering until she saw me above . I noticed Jill watching Dunya , but the Polish girl gave her no glance . She kept waving to me until the ship moved from the pier . The last I saw of her was a head held high on squared shoulders to keep the Sobieski 's deck in sight as she pulled out . I went at once to pay my respects to the captain . He greeted me warmly : any friend of Miss Barowska 's was a friend of his . When I asked who was the blonde girl I had seen on deck , the old sailor chuckled . " Miss McLeish , I suppose . Miss Gillian McLeish . From your country . " Gillian . It would be a blow if she was n't Dunya 's American . For the first time I wondered how Dunya had ever thought I 'd find the girl , not knowing her name and not being supposed to use Dunya 's . The description @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board came close . It had to be Gillian . The captain introduced us on the first night out . She came from Warsaw , after a trip through the Balkans , and she was worried about her Polish friends if war came . She never mentioned Dunya , although I tried to lead up to it many times , and I kept my promise and did not ask her straight out . I told her there was no use getting all upset by the war scare ; I thought the Poles could take care of themselves all right . In any case , there was nothing we could do . It was a mess that should make us appreciate the old U. S. A. Jill laughed reproachfully . " I wish I could see it that way . I ca n't get the poor people out of my mind . " War came on our second day on the Atlantic . We woke up to the news that Poland was being invaded . The ship became a madhouse . People cluttering round the wireless room , and swarming over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horror in their gaze . The crew went about their business with grim faces . I did not see Jill until noon ; she was calmer than she had been when everything was still uncertain . I sat up on deck with her the rest of the day , trying to cheer her up , and once in a while she would laugh at a joke and then check herself as if she had done wrong . But she said she was glad I was there and that night she kissed me . The next day we were both at the captain 's table for dinner , and I looked him up first and told him of Dunya 's wish . He assured me gravely that he would n't mention her . He kept watching Jill throughout the meal and I was afraid every time she looked at me that he might take offense in Dunya 's behalf ; some of those old Poles have queer ideas . But it was evident that he approved of Jill . He told pointless stories to her in the most courtly manner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he invited her to come up on the bridge later to see how it was done . I did not see her any more that night . In the morning she came to my deck chair with excitement in her eyes . She sat down ncxt to me and , without looking at me , said , " You knew Dunya . " I said nothing and she asked , " Why did you leave her ? " " She asked me to , " I said . " That 's no reason , " said Jill . " She is the most wonderful person in the world . " She rose , and her handbag opened and out fell a letter . I picked it up for her ; it was Dunya 's writing . When we came to New York the war was a week old and the Poles were beaten . The Corridor was cut and overrun by the Germans . Gdynia was holding out and apparently being bombed and shelled day and night , but the land around it was in the hands of the Germans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have worked if it had n't been for Jill ; she brought the subject up again and again , asking about the other , how long I 'd known her , how she had been , what she had said about her , Jill . Soon I was cursing the captain for telling her not so much because Dunya had not wanted it but because Jill now talked of nothing else . Her interest in the Polish girl was insatiable and , I thought , morbid . It gave me pleasure to tell her that Dunya had been hurt by something she , Jill , had written from Warsaw but she only smiled . By then I had fallen for her like a ton of bricks . I had to laugh at my doubts of Dunya 's premonition ; it certainly did look as though we were made for each other . We knew a lot of the same people in New York ; they gave us a fine time . We were the first of the war refugees ; it was new and exciting to make a fuss over us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in trouble , were going to find it harder to get any sympathy . Jill ate it up . She laughed at what attentions were heaped upon her , shaking them off like a puppy that has got wet . She lived by herself  --  her family was in California  --  and since I had received a vacation from the firm we were together all the time . I was crazy about her . I had been around ; but she was the loveliest thing that had ever happened to me , and I only wished she would n't talk so much about Dunya . I wanted to be done with Dunya . I had liked her , sure , but after all she had given me the gate . I had even said I 'd stay there and fight for Poland . If a girl was too wrapped up in Poland to have a thought left for me , I could n't be blamed for putting her out of my mind . I wanted to think of nobody but Jill . But Jill would n't have it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have you seen the papers ? Gdynia is holding out ; do you think she 's there ? " " What would she think of us , having a good time while they 're being bombed ? " When I asked her to stop worrying about Dunya she had an answer ready : " You have n't read her letter . " The blasted letter was preying on her mind . She was always carrying it round with her , making cryptic remarks about it , using it to tantalize me instead of getting rid of it for good and all . I asked her to let me read it and she refused curtly , and once I made a grab at it over a table , planning to tear it up or throw it away , and she almost broke my wrist with a spoon and said icily , " I would thank you not to do that again . " " Honey , " I said , " I wo n't read it but will you please get that paper out of our lives ? " " That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Never mind . She kicked me out . " " Yes , " Jill said unhappily , " right into my lap . " She laughed . " Ungrateful wretch . Do n't you even think it was nice of her ? " " Damned nice , " I said , and for the moment everything was all right . Not for long though . I knew Jill talked of Dunya only to see what I 'd say . I would upbraid her for imagining things ; when she looked at me once I would know it was no good . Instead of forgetting Dunya , I had forgotten my frustration at her hands . I caught myself in comparisons ; Jill usually came out on top but there was no getting rid of the Polish girl . She always seemed to be waiting round the corner , tense , intent , way above mere romance ; I began to see how old Stanislas must have felt , when he tried to have some fun in the MAGAZINE bars of Zoppot and always knew that outside his daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " One hundred thousand dead , " screamed the headlines . Poor old Stan , she probably had made him get himself killed already . Wild-eyed idealists always got people killed . But then I saw the Zoppot Promenade again , and a pretty young thing who was dancing with me with her eyes closed , the way to-day pretty young things dance the world over . Her eyes were closed but they were n't wild under the white lids . They had not even been wild when the change had come , the inquisitive child turned a bright flame in a cool shell . Once I brought myself to tell Jill that Dunya was nothing to me , but I could n't meet her eyes . I implored Jill to marry me . She said , " I 'd love to , darling  --  if you could keep your vow . " " What vow ? " " The one you make when you marry . About forsaking all others , " The worst part was that neither of us was thinking of the real Dunya any more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it would have been quite possible to make inquiries for people in the seized areas but we never thought of that . Jill was often talking now as if she hated Dunya , and at those times I had to force myself to keep quiet . She would sit there reviling Dunya , with her eyes fixed on mine to watch me give myself away . Jill always looked angelic even when she was spewing billingsgate . Once when she was through I asked her what I could do to prove how wrong she was about everything . She shrugged her shoulders and said she would n't know . I should ask my Polish wench for another letter . We kept going about together , doing the town . We usually were the center of a gay crowd , and there was a hellish irony in the fact that just when our friends were all talking about our bliss we were growing apart fast . We both knew it . Jill also seemed to know why , but I did n't . It struck me that when we were talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mind . Dunya , I thought , must have changed much between the times Jill and I knew her , but Jill would not give me any details of their friendship . To her Dunya was a rival . She refused to see that the girl had never cared for me or she would n't have dropped me as she did , for an illusion . Jill said Dunya was after me even now . I called her crazy . We were growing apart , but the thought of Dunya was like a chain snapping us back , never letting its get loose completely . One evening Jill came to me in a tender mood . She could be soft and sweet as a kitten when she wanted to , talking in a small voice that made you want to sweep her off the ground and take care of her , even though you knew she was in no need of protection . She put her hand in mine and it was hours until I remembered Dunya . The thought of her came as a shock just when Jill was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands through her hair and in my mind was Dunya . Jill was hardly gone when I saw her bag on a chair . I grabbed it and startedto run after her , and then stopped and thought , fingering the smooth leather . Dunya 's letter would be in there . It was at the bottom of what stood between Jill and me . If I took the letter and burned it I might lose Jill , but if we went on like this I 'd lose her anyway . We could n't go on like this . I could stand it no longer . Stealing letters was not a nice thing to do but I was past caring about nicety . If the letter was gone , perhaps Jill and I should be free . I locked the door before I opened the bag . The letter was the only thing in it . No powder , no money , no lipstick  --  nothing but the letter . That was why Jill did n't come back for it . The letter was short , in huge script on blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know you and I never shall , but I give you my lover to keep him from our fate which will be terrible . I pretended to grow cold to him , to make him go away , and to help him forget me I invented you . If you , a girl like the friend I made up for him , are on his ship you will be given this letter . Thomas is waiting to fall in love with you . I pray to God and His Holy Mother that you may love him as I do . Dunya Barowska. "
