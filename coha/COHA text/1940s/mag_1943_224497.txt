Cromwell , having sued Doris Duke for divorce in New Jersey and having been sued in return in Nevada , got an injunction forbidding her temporarily to go on with her suit , which was scheduled to come up in court this week . <P> He charged that she had moved to Reno to " perpetrate a fraud on the New Jersey and Nevada courts " - that is , not to become a Nevadan but just to become an exwife . <P> Carol of Rumania , now of Mexico , prevented from broadcasting to the U.S. by the Office of Censorship at the last minute ( " Owing to considerations that we are not at liberty to disclose " ) , held a press conference and got a few sentiments off his chest .

Under a monarchy you have just one large , happy family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .
