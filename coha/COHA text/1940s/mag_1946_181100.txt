Most Alaskans have never seen a Secretary of the Interior close up , but they can visualize him instantly . He is a thin , watery-blooded , myopic creature who spends most of his time throwing messages from Alaskans into an incinerator , but occasionally he rings up the Army or Navy and gives them a few hundred more square miles of good territorial land . <P> On the other hand , most Secretaries of the Interior get a feverish feeling that they know too much about Alaska ( Harold Ickes was there on his honeymoon , never went back ) . Alaska 's 586,400 square miles are occupied by only 72,524 people , 32,458 of them tuberculosis-ridden natives . It is rich , but its riches do it little good ; its basic industries , salmon fishing and canning and gold mining , are owned in absentia . It has more coal than Pennsylvania , endless miles of virgin timber , many waterpower sites , but they can not be marketed . <P> " The Lord . " Harry Truman 's energetic , new 38-year-old Secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed into a C-54 fortnight ago , set out to get a close-up look at the land none of his predecessors had understood . At his first stop , Fairbanks , the modern hub of the old , interior gold fields , he became aware of the Territory 's attitude toward bureaucratic Government . He was greeted by a sign which read : " Welcome Lord of Alaska . " But Alaskans soon began to change their tune . <P> Huge , husky ( 242 Ibs. , 6 ft. 3 in . ) Cap Krug looked like an Alaskan himself when he got into a wool shirt . He flew across the Arctic Circle to Point Barrow , ate whale meat , and walked through a litter of walrus heads to duck into native shacks . He surprised his guides by landing two-foot rainbow trout in the Kenai River . He also listened-and listened . Everywhere he went-Fairbanks , Point Barrow , Anchorage , Seward , Juneau , Ketchikan , Sitka , Metla Katla-Alaskans who had always wanted to tell the Secretary of the Interior what they thought of the Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rates . Alaskans had scores of grievances . They wanted roads-one overall-clad woman dramatized the request by tramping in to see the Secretary , announcing she had left her tractor mired to the carburetor two miles outside of town . Gold operators complained that the Army hired their help away . Hundreds asked for release of Government lands , an end to restrictions which discourage homesteading . Alaska was in terrible need of hospitals , particularly tuberculosis hospitals . And there was always the subject of high freight rates . <P> Krug did not always agree . He bluntly asked citizens of Ketchikan to " face reality , " said he could get little money from Congress until Alaska got some of its own by local taxation . He was less than enthusiastic about the gold industry , which dredges up gold to be sold to the Government at an artificial $35 an ounce and is then carefully reburied in Treasury vaults . <P> But before he left the territory , Cap Krug announced the release of 18 million acres of Government land , much of it freed by narrowing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He also surprised many an old settler by advocating statehood ( Alaskans will vote on the question on Oct. 8 ) and the construction of a railroad through Canada to the " outside .
