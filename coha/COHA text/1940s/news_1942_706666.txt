txt Spurred by labor difficulties caused by shortages of raw materials , the War Manpower Commission is working on a plan to make it possible to draft , freeze or transfer labor in accordance with the demands of the situation . Already some shipyard employes have been thrown out of work in Los Angeles by materials shortages while , on the other hand , the rush of miners from the copper mines to the higher pay and better working conditions in shipyards and in construction jobs is hampering the production of copper . In England labor is now subject to the draft . Coal miners , for instance , have recently been sent back to the-mines at lower wages than they were getting in other occupations . Canada has frozen all agricultural laborers in their jobs . Whether such drastic measures will be adopted here is not known . But Secretary Wickard has let it be known that he thinks skilled farm labor should be left on the farms . Measures seeking the same ends by other means have been under consideration . Agreements between factories that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been obtained and labor-management committees are about to be set up , one of the duties of which will be to see that such agreements are enforced . The idea is that when the applicant for a job in a shipyard turns out to be a copper miner , his application will be turned down . On the other hand , if too great a disparity between the wages of copper miners and shipbuilders is found to exist the matter will be referred to the WLB for adjustment . Also under consideration is the // WEIGH LABOR DRAFT TO MEET SHORTAGES // establishment of " flying squads " of Workers with scarce skills who could be shifted here and there as the occasion demands , or broken up to form the nuclei of skilled forces in different plants . But to cope with the expected shutdowns caused by raw materials ' shortages it is believed that something more is needed . These shut-1 downs are being caused not only by overall shortages of certain basic or strategic materials but by the " balancing " of production to see that such items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes , airplane engines and propellers move at the same rate of speed . British System May Be Used War Manpower officials said they were already in a position to deal with such situations where both plants concerned were in the Same city . But where they were not it would not be feasible to shift labor quickly unless the system of separation and transport allowances instituted in England wera put into effect here . It is believed that the institution of such a system will be part of the manpower allocation plan which the Manpower Commission is now considering . That the material shortage will throw large numbers out of work is not believed by the Manpower Commission or the WPB . A board spokesman said that not more than twenty or thirty such shutdowns or serious slowdowns had occurred . By December , it is believed by the Manpower Commission , 17,500 , - 000 workers will be employed in war production as compared with 20,500,000 in other production . By December of 1943 it is estimated that 20,000,000 workers will be engaged in war production against 19,100,000 not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was 7,100,000 in 1940 and 3,800,000 in December , 1941 , will have shrunk , it is estimated , to 2,400,000 next December and 2,000,000 by December , 1943 . Of this 2,000,000 are expected to be in the class of " unemployables. " -
