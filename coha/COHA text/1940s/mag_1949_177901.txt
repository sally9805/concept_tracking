Edinburgh 's International Festival of Music and Drama was three years old , and finally big enough to be spanked . Last week , with this season 's final performances , the critics ' hairbrushes were flying . <P> Rather timidly , the Observer 's Drama Critic Ivor Brown complained that the festival " is finding problems in its own success . " There was , he thought , too much cultural plum pudding crammed into three weeks , leaving some customers with a stomachache . <P> The New Statesman and Nation 's Desmond Shawe-Taylor wore a **27;1050;TOOLONG look : " The grumble that events are too many and the day too crowded is merely frivolous . . . More serious is the complaint that this festival has no natural focal point , as Salzburg has in Mozart , Bayreuth in Wagner , and Aldeburgh in Britten ; this is true and perhaps a pity . . . but what sort of festival could be constructed out of purely Scottish material . . . ? " <P> Negligible Bit . The hardest wallops came in the Sunday Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gruff old ( 80 ) Ernest Newman first wanted to know " What is a festival 's work ? " Is its virtue , he asked , " a quality inherent in it " or does its virtue come " merely from the fact that on a particular day a piece is performed some hundreds of miles from where we live ? " <P> What nettled the doyen of British critics most was a performance of Rossini 's Semiramide Overture by the Berlin Philharmonic under Sir John Barbirolli . " No really musical person , " groused Newman , " would leave his comfortable home . . . specifically to hear this . . . But bring , at great expense , a German orchestra all the way from Berlin to play this negligible bit of Italian music in the capital of Scotland , and an English conductor all the way from Manchester to conduct it , and apparently it becomes , by some magical transformation . . . a ' festival ' work and we trudge all the way to Edinburgh to hear it . " In short , wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too marked lowering of the festival standard . . . this year is that some of the performances have been far better than the music . " <P> Important Point . Lean , tired-eyed Festival Manager Rudolf Bing could hardly deny the charges . But neither did he see any reason to plead guilty . Said he with a sigh : " You do n't come to Edinburgh to hear Brahms 's Second Symphony . If you 're the type who goes to a festival , you 've heard it . But you do come to hear the Royal Philharmonic under Beecham , or the Berlin , or the Vienna Philharmonic , or the Concertgebouw . It seems to me that what is played here is less important than who plays it . Whatever he thinks of it , the festival-goer certainly gets a good idea of the state of orchestra-playing in Europe and what 's doing in the theater . Is n't that what a festival is for ? "
