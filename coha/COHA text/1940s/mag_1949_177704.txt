THE BISMARCK EPISODE ( 219 pp. ) - Captain Russell Grenfell - Macmillan ( $3 ) . <P> It was the Bismarck , all right . There , in Grimstad Fiord on the Norwegian coast , lay the new Nazi 50,000-ton battle-wagon-bigger and tougher than any British battleship afloat . The British Admiralty had been worrying about the German giant for months ; now that she had slipped away from her Baltic anchorage , the Home Fleet would have a crack at her at last . When Flying Officer Suckling photographed the Bismarck from his Spitfire on a May afternoon in 1941 , he touched off the greatest sea hunt in naval history . <P> The Bismarck Episode is a retired British naval officer 's remarkably lucid account of the pursuit , cornering and sinking of the pride of Hitler 's navy . An author of less background might have pulled out all the stops and wallowed happily but confusingly in the story 's drama . Author Grenfell , * veteran of 30 years ' service , including the Jutland and Dardanelles actions in World War I , sticks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which fought like fury when she was finally cornered , did not want to fight at all . Her escort was the powerful heavy cruiser Prinz Eugen , but they had no destroyer screen and could expect no help from the rest of the German fleet . Their task was to hit Allied shipping and run . In foul weather , the Bismarck and her cruiser escort slipped out of Grimstad Fiord before British bombers could be put to work on them . Admiral Sir John Tovey , commander of the Home Fleet , ordered every available ship deployed to bring them to battle . Then , on the evening of May 23 , as the cruiser Suffolk hugged the mist between Iceland and Greenland , Able Seaman Newell let out a hail from , starboard . There , 14,000 yards away , were the Bismarck and the Prinz Eugen . The Suffolk ducked back into the fog in a hurry ( the Bismarck 's guns had a range of 40,000 yards ) , then gingerly shadowed the big ship by radar through the night until the British battle cruiser Hood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . What happened next shocked British witnesses and was soon to shock the world . One minute the swift battle cruiser Hood , biggest ship of the English fleet , was methodically firing from her 15-inch guns as she closed with the enemy . Two or three minutes later , she had sunk from sight . At around 25,000 yards , the Bismarck had sent the Hood down with only five or six salvoes . With another dozen or so , she drove the Prince of Wales out of action and got clean away .
