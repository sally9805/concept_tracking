FIVE-AND-TEN , as an American institution , ? tme to a quiet end on November 13 , 19:35 . The occasion was a meeting of the hoard of directors of the F. W. Woolworth Co . The action they took was designed to engineer the company into merchandising more profitable than the price-restricted field of five-and-ten . One of them formally recited : " Resolved , that the selling-price limit of twenty cents on merchandise be discontinued . " Competitive stores , unhampered by the once talismanic five-and-ten-cent price limits , were flourishing . Only one of the old fellows who had made their fortunes in five-and-ten stores while once-proud department-store owners from coast to coast had been growing less rich , remained on the hoard  --  C. S. Woolworth .. Even he had been persuaded , at least in part , by the experimental raising of the ceiling from ten cents to twenty . The test had revealed the old limit for what it had become  --  a commercial strtit jacket . So , the resolution was adopted , and five-and-ten was started on its way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rountry trader 's chicken wagon , the dry-goods store , and other outmoded devices of corn coerce .

Deyo , who started in the basement of a Knox store , is the aggressive president of Woolworth 's . Charles Sumner Woolworth , chairman of the hoard  --  he 's eighty-three now ? gazed ahead . If his eyes wavered to the portrait against the wall at his left , he was accused by Brother Frank , blue eyes above a white mustache that seemed aquiver with resentful speech : a glance to the right would meet an accusation from a portrait likeness of Seymour Knox : or , farther down , from poor old ( ' arson Peck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

Uri quest innately , " Aye ! " But two directors were women . None remembers hearing their Vtliellti in the clamor of " ayes " that ended five-and-ten . They were Frank Woolworth 's daughters . A third had died tragically before her Only child , Barbara Ilutton , had become big enough to drive this corporation 's executives half frantic with problems in public relations caused by her extravagances , her antics in romance  --  first a prince , and next n count , and so on . One of Barbara 's aunts , Mrs. Helena Woolworth McCann  --  she died in 193S  --  had gone to this meeting , the chances are , from sortie cruise aboard her yacht , But as au infant , adored by her parents , Lena Woolworth , tucked out of drafts beneath a counter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday-evening rush of customers after five-cent bargains . Under that nursery arrangement , Lena 's mother could wait 011 customers , most of whom , in those days , were shabby . But neither then nor in the years when Lena was being put to sleep with fairy tales did anyone suppose there was such a fairy-story ilnality iu five-and-ten as would multiply one cheap-John store . one set of tawdry counters into a chain numbering more than 2S34 , with counters which , in line , might reach 22S miles out toward the moon . The Royal Touch MHE other woman director  --  Mrs , 1 Jessie Woolworth Donahue  --  as she sat through this trying session of the hoard , might have toyed with a famous necklace , the Romanoff emeralds ; she owns them right enough . But it was Lena whose eyes were saddened , even startled , as the directors voiced approval , Strength seemed to gu out of her . They had settled this issue in a chamber appropriate for nabobs of India . Nabobs indeed I Why , most of these directors are fellows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or any other rare jewel , in the presence of some ten-cent knickknack which had revealed to their peculiar understanding its exciting quality as a good Woolworth item . Like British admirals , Woolworth store managers start young . They oblige each other to retire on the December thirty-first following their sixtieth birthdays . They run the business  --  not any pampered kin of Barbara Hutton . The beams of the ceiling in their directors ' room are opulently gilded and painted , bemuse Frank Woolworth had wanted them so . His taste , not theirs , had prescribed the covering of the walls with figured red damask fit for a French king 's bedchamber . His eyes had approved the red in the heavy folds of draperies that hang to the floor from valance boards over windows two dozen floors above Broadway . No clashing color in that richness ; just tones of red  --  the cherry and the carmine identified with nearly every Woolworth store in half a dozen " It was on my table the last time I saw it , " Mrs. Chapman replied . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your possession , Mrs. Chapman . As you know . " That gun was unsealed when it was handed to me , " she said curtly . " The other gun in the party is still sealed . " " When was the last time you saw this gun , Mrs. Chapman ? " " I do n't recall . It was here last night . I do n't remember seeing it this morning . It may have been here . " I was looking at Steve Grant . His head was raised ; he was staring straight ahead of him across the room , his face suddenly pale , his eyes almost desperate . I turned my head . Cecily 's door had opened so silently that not one of us except Steve had heard or seen it . She was standing there , her face above her white flannel dressing gown whiter by far than the flannel , her red-gold hair a halo of sleep-rumpled curls , her eyes dark amber wells . She was lovelier than I 'd ! Continuea to work . Nevertheless , when Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recapture some of the emotion of that cold March morning in 1873 . He had stood beside his mother holding a lantern as the father and elder brother mounted the seat of the pung and made themselves snug from waists to feet under blankets odorous of horse , and steamy . Behind the men , the open wagon body was filled with barrels of potatoes . On the seat between them was a bundle of Frank 's extra clothing . In his hand , for safety , was his one extravagant possession , a flute that he had bought by mail . Mom was sniffling , and less determined , now that Franky was going to " have his chance . " Sum held the lantern high , and then waved it as the horses , breathing out frost smoke , piffled his brother into the morning darkness . They shouted " Good-by , Franky ! " Great Bend was just waking up . At Dan MeNeill 's general store , a smoked-up lantern was making a pumpkin-sized hole of yellow light in the darkness . Thereaf ter , for five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stayed alive , Charles Sumner Woolworth worked on as a farm hand to fill his brother 's place . But Frank worked hard too . In his great days later on , he tried to suppose himself into a queer magnificence of eryptesthesia through the Napoleonic souvenirs with which he kept himself surrounded . But he had moments in which he fed his vanity by measuring the distance he had traveled as a self-made man . Among others who heard him hark back to his first day in the Watertown store of Augsbury &; Moore was B. C. Forbes , who wrote about Woolworth in his vivid hook , Men Who are Making America . The first one Woolworth had encountered as he came into the store near the middle of the morning was Augsbury , a dignified merchant . " Bub , do n't they wear any collars in your neighborhood ? " " No . " " No neckties either ? " " No . " " Is that flannel shirt the best you have to wear ? " His voice was kindly , " Yes , sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and get a white shirt and a collar and tie before you begin work . " ever seen her , but quite terrible in a way , too  --  like an avenging angel , almost , it seemed to me . Fle ? grandmother turned abruptly . So did the chief ranger and Colonel Primrose . Cecily 's eyes were fixed on the blue glittering steel . " My grandmother is n't tolling the truth , " she said , very quietly . " She knows that gun was n't here this morning . She gave it to Steve Grant last night . I heard her say , ' Take this thing and have it sealed before somebody puts a hole in George Pelham 's head . ' " The momentary silence that punctuated those last cool , awful words was broken abruptly by her grandmother 's grim voice : " You 're wrong . Cecily . I said , ' Take this damned thing and have it sealed , before I put a hole in George Pelham 's head . ' If you 're going to repeat things you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Al ter Woolworth returned , improved , Augsbury went to eat . As Woolworth related his experience to Mr. Forbes , " Nobody told me what to do . I hung around , feeling foolish . . . The clerks stared at me and sneered at me . . When most of the clerks had gone to dinner  --  lunch . as we call it nowadays  --  in came an old farmer and said to me : ' Young man , I want a spool of thread . ' I did n't know where they kept the thread , so I went over to Mr. Moore , who was busy at his desk , and asked him . " ' Right in front of your nose , young man , ' he snapped , without looking up from his writing . " I pulled out a drawer directly in front of me , and sure enough found it full of spools of thread . " ' I want Number Forty , ' the farmer said- " I never knew till that moment that thread had a number . I fumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not find it . 1 appealed to Mr. Moore . " ' Certainly ! Bight in the drawer in front of you , ' he said , quite sharply . ; I had to tell him : ' I ca n't find any . ' " ' Just as I expected , ' he said testily as he got down from his desk and showed me the right kind of thread . Ile immediately returned to his desk. - But the transaction was not rimsp/cto . To learn the price , he had to appeal to Moore again : and again when the farmer handed him a ten-cent shinplaster to pay for the eight-cent piece of merchandise . By nightfall , Frank Woolworth had learned some of the store system  --  how to make out a ticket ; how to wrap a package . But the new man at Augshury &; Moore 's spent most of his days . performing tasks beneath the dignity of other employees . He began each day with it broom , sweeping wet sawdust from the back of the store to the front door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust the stock . The show windows must be washed  --  and lie was the one to wash them , The only times 110 tended store were in those periods when most of the others had gone to dinner . Repeatedly , Moore lost patience with the clumsy blond farmer and audibly wished him back in the barnyard . Nevertheless , the lir ? picked up a little trade , because of Great Bend folks coming to patronize their neighbor , Woolworth . One was Minor Merrill , supervisor of the township which ineludisd Great Bend . Ile had a calico sample . Mrs. Merrill needed yards of it , and Woolworth yanked at the bolt until calico was cascading ruinously from counter to floor . Moore shrieked , " Stop ! " and came himself to wait upon the customer . Nevertheless , there was an earnestness and a good humor in Woolworth 's temperament which slowly earned for him something of Moore 's better nature . One Friday afternoon , Moore , without perceptibly raising his eyes from his hooks , said , " Woolworth , take all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As Woolworth started off , he called after him , " When you 've clone that , trim it over . " Woolworth 's blue eyes shone . This was real store work : it was responsibility . Long past . midnight he was still working on the window . He had helped himself to bolts of fabric and taken other wares from stock . In the morning , Mr. Moore slopped outside for long minutes , during which Woolworth pushed his broom in longer sweeps . Presently , Moore entered , but made no comment on the window . However , from that time on , the show windows of Augsburg S. Moore were Woolworth 's to dress almost without interference . Plot for Horatio Alger After three months . 1 I mire paid him $3.50 a week , as agreed : after six months  --  in the business depression of ' 73 ? he was raised to $4.00 ; in year to $4.50 , and shortly thereafter to $6.00 a week . That winter he had bought an overcoat , and on Easter morning in 1874 he walked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it curly-brimmed plug hat . however , at . his boardinghouse other boarders had fun at his expense . Despairing of any mastery over the flute , he bought a violin . He practiced on it earnestly . Unhappily , he possessed no sense of pitch and never could carry a tune . Edgar C. Emerson . later a justice of the Supreme Court of New York , was a fellow hoarder . " We never thought he 'd amount to anything , " he said one time , and that was the consensus in Watertown . F. W. Barrett. , head clerk in Augsbury &; Moore 's , was getting thirteen dollars a week . Barrett and Mrs. A. E. Coons , the principal saleswoman , did much to help Woolworth learn storekeeping . Woolworth on six dollars a week was going with a girl . She was a young Canadian named . Jennie Creighton , who had come to Watertown to make her living as a seamstress , and was living with a cousin . She was often homesick for her eight motherless brothers and sisters and her lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lake in Piston , Ontario ; beyond question , poor folks . But this Jennie Creighton was a lovely girl ; she had blue eyes and light yellow hair . Whenever she came into the store for thread or notions . Frank waited .111 her , talking , whispering , even though old Moore scowled at them . Watertown had been transformed for both . They were in love , and simply lived for Sundays , when they might he together . On other days real courting was out of the question . The store opened al seven ; it closed fourteen hours later , at nine o'clock . Woolworth had been in the store two and a half years when two jobs better than his became openings in Watertown . Head Clerk Barrett resigned , and so did the senior clerk of the rival dry-goods store of A. Bushnell ? Co . His name was Golding . The clerks were moving westward , to Port Iluron , Michigan , as partners in a new venture , a ninety-nine-cent store . One had opened in Watertown and was doing well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augsbury 's interest in the firm , which had become Moore &; Smith . Woolworth 's employers liked him well enough , but as a salesman he was considered not to be in Barrett 's class ; indeed , he was not so capable as Mrs. Coons , although he could dress windows and counters . Everyone agreed about his talent for fixing up a store , but . he lacked the energy with which he had been charged when he first came from the farm . Really , he was not well . It may be supposed that Woolworth had diseovered there was no immediate prospect of advancement for him at Moore &; Smith 's , because he applied to Bushnell for Golding 's place . Observing- the lack of design in the Bushnell show window and the disorder on the store 's counters gave him confidence . He could work a great change in this place . He asked Bushnell for tell /Whirs a week , and , to his amazement , he was hired at that figure . Gne of the obligations of the new position required him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burglars . Bushnell entrusted him with a revolver and he had a companion in the person of Harry Moody , a seventeen-year-old cheek boy . The two slept on cots , glad to be saving room rent . If they dreamed down in that musty pit , it is unlikely they ever dreamed of anything so fantastic as the commercial adventures they would share in the years ahead . Unhappily , Woolworth , who was thin and frequently had a cold , was a great disappointment to Bushnell . One day the proprietor beckoned and went into the cellar . Woolworth followed . When they were seated on the cots , Bushnell spoke . " Woolworth , I 've got boys who sell more goods than you ; boys I pay six dollars . " It was futile to remind Bushnell that he was the town 's best window dresser . Bushnell was old-fashioned , he lacked imagination , but he was the boss . It was settled that Woolworth might slay on at eight dollars a week . The clerk accepted the situation , but wrote a sad , hopeless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message of love and encouragement . She ended with this assurance , " Some day , my son , you 'll be a rich man . " He tried to have faith in the prophecy , but the long hours of confinement , possibly the dampness of that cellar bedroom , and certainly the frustration represented by the cut from ten dollars to eight dollars a week , had drained vitality out of the thin young man . When a doctor said he was too ill to work , he gave up his connection with A. Bushnell &; Co. and went hack to the farm , sick in mind and body . Loyal Jennie Creighton wrote regularly to Frank and visited the farm when she could . As spring and his mother 's wonderful care brought color of courage to his cheeks , he began to plan a different future . Would Miss Creighton become a farmer 's wife ? She would , gladly . So , on , tune II , 1876 , they were married in the park-n ! ' the farmhouse . The voting couple were literally penniless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kitchen and a bedroom . The groom had found a house and a. piece of ground  --  four acres  --  for which a discouraged owner would accept .3900 worth of promises . After signing a note for $300 , and giving a mortgage for $600 , Frank and . Jennie were proprietors and moved in . They were convinced they could make a healthful living raising chickens and selling eggs . But hens require time to adjust themselves to strange surroundings . Woolworth planted potatoes , some garden truck , and his parents were generous . The couple managed to live , but only a few of the hens laid . Woolworth developed a lasting distaste for chickens . in October they were excited by a letter from W. H. Moore . He offered Frank ten dollars a week to return to the store and take charge of dressing up the windows . Ten dollars ! Jennie made the decision . This young wife of twenty-two said : " Frank , you go back to the store . I 'll take care of the chickens till we get a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind the counter at Moore &; Smith 's . That night he slept in his old bed at the boardinghouse . The Lure of a Bargain Each fortnight . during a miserable year Woolworth returned to Jennie for a Sunday haunted by the ticking of the clock . Facing another winter and deciding it was intolerable , they accepted a neighbor 's offer to trade a secondhand sewing machine for the flock of chickens , and a tenant was found for the place . After all , the couple had little choice . Jennie could hardly stay alone in the country when she was expecting a baby early in the spring . Frank 's father moved their few possessions into Watertown , to a. one-story wing of a two-stony frame dwelling . They wondered if such happiness could last . In the middle of the winter , bad news ea-me . They went to Great Bend as swiftly as a livery-stable horse and sleigh could take them . They were beside Frank 's mother 's bed when she died , February 15 , 1878 . She was only forty-seven . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overwhelmed her husband . Charles Sumner Woolworth was determined to break from the farm , and Frank induced Moore to hire his brother . A housekeeper was engaged to look after the boys ' father . On Saturday nights thereafter three Woolworths were behind the counters of Moore &; Smith 's store . Jennie was glad to help when trade was brisk . In the year after his return , Woolworth accumulated savings of lifty dollars . There would have been more but for the necessity to contribute fifty dollars to his father . That sorrowful winter the excitement of the five-cent-counter craze first touched Watertown . Golding was its advance agent . The former Bushnell clerk came East on a buying trip and stopped in Watertown to greet old friends . He and Barrett , he said , were succeeding . In Moore &; Smith 's , delivering greetings to his partner 's friends , he addressed himself to Moore . " How 's business ? " " Slow . I 've seldom seen it worse . " " You ought to make trade . " " ow , please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storekeeper a long time . Who was Golding to patronize him ? " I low ! Why , Mr. Moore , you ought to run sonic cut-rate bargains . " Bargains , he explained , were the life of a ninety-nine-cent store . Moore and Woolworth knew about ninety-nine-cent stores . The one in Watertown was where their young errand boy , Fred Kirby , had worked before coming to Moore &; Smith 's , But then Golding spoke about it special kind of bargainfive-cent bargains , which had a strong lure for country folks and town folks , too , as had been demonstrated in Michigan . A season or two before , a traveling salesman named Bennett , representing ( Continued on Page 84 ) ( Continued from Page 821 a New York jobbing house , Spelman Brothers , had gone through his Michigan territory offering job lots of handkerchiefs at . a special price to those who would take a due proportion of other Live-cent merchandise . The customary price of the handkerchiefs at retail was twenty-five cents . But these were offered , for now forgotten circumstances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse suspicions . flow could twentyfive-cent handkerchiefs he sold for live cents ? In Port I Tu ron , one merchant experimented , but only on condition that Spelmau Brothers take back any unsold goods . Ills sale had been a wonderful success , according to Golding . . During the buying mood created by such an obvious bargain as twentyfive-cent handkerchiefs at five cents , the fortunate merchant hail unloaded stacks of goods that had stood on his shelves too long . As long as he lived , Frank Woolworth could offer no other , no better explanation of the start of the five-cent fad in Watertown. lie remembered always that Moore had been slow to act . Actually he did nothing until he made his customary buying trip to New York in August . At that time he went to Spelman Brothers and plunged . He bought 8100 worth of five-cent merchandise in which these jobbers had begun to specialize , seemingly . Their five-cent goods included tin pans , washbasins , thimbles , watch keys , combs , book straps , steel pens , safety pins , soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooks . The packing cases from Spelman Brothers were put off at the railroad station a week before the opening of the county fair . The arranging of these goods for display was Woolworth 's task . In the rear of the store were some sewing tables , two feet wide and five feet long . Two tables were . arranged in line to form a counter in the store aisle . A placard above the display bore this legend : ANY ARTICLE ON THIS COUNTER FIVE CENTS The opening of the county fair began a great day for Moore &; Smith . As things turned out , it was just about the greatest day in the life of Frank Woolworth . The square was crowded by folks , all of whom had at least a little money . This money , according to an old-fashioned phrase which still has plenty of meaning , was burning holes in their pockets . On a holiday they wanted to spend . Almost greedily they peeked themselves around the aisle exhibit of five-cent goods . I fere they could slake their buying thirst cheaply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hare , but customers stood around asking for more of the nickel bargains . Moore wrote a telegram to Spelman Brothers , asking for the rush shipment of a duplicate order . Woolworth took the telegram and rushed out . The Western Union was on the third floor of the same building . Years afterward , Mrs. Coons used to laugh as she reminded Woolworth how they had listened to his feet making hallways echo as he pounded up the wooden stairs , two at a time . The five-cent-counter craze spread in upstate New York like a grass fire . It crossed county lines , infected other states , and would have spread farther and faster , except for a curious weakness in the scheme . There could be no doubt about the power of a counter laden with five-cent merchandise to excite people of small means who were exposed to its fascination . Nevertheless , this power was sometimes quick to wear itself out . Many alive in Watertown today can remember the original excitement caused by the five-cent craze . Woolworth 's employer expanded his business by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even individual peddlers . In that time one farmer came to Moore &; Smith 's , bought fifty dollars ' worth of live-cent items and carted this merchandise to Adams Center , where he placed the goods on display in his barn . Then he distributed circulars . In three days he came to Moore to place another order . It is not surprising that Frank Woolworth found this situation an excuse for hope of becoming proprietor of a store . Moore was encouraging . He was convinced that a store devoted strictly to five-cent goods would thrive , if carefully managed . " How much money ought a man to have to open such a store , Mr. Moore ? " " You could do it with three hundred dollars . " Woolworth went to see his most prosperous kinsman , his uncle , Allion McBrier . McBrier 's attitude toward the venture may be summed up in a word : " No . " Woolworth made several vain attempts to borrow , before he dared appeal to Moore to allow him credit for a stock of five-cent goods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ location . It was a bitterly cold day , late in . January , 1879 , when Woolworth left . Watertown , valise in hand , to scout the country for a store site . A prejudice was widespread . Partially it was caused by the shoddy goods which had been unloaded during the five-centbargain-counter excitement . Some of it was owing to fly-by-night adventurers who were accustomed to vanish when the rent was due . Woolworth was convinced his best ehance would be in a community where the scheme had not been exploited . He believed there was a fundamental merchandising force in the idea , though he did not pretend to understand it . However , after deciding against Rome , he went on to Utica , four times as big as Watertown . He found that Utica people were untouched by the five-centcounter fad . So , for hours , he tramped in the shopping center , his feet . numb with cold . The most tempting vacancy was in Bleer'ker Street , near Genesee , a store chamber with a frontage of only thirteen feet . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the rear wall . It was ugly from litter and neglect , lout out in front was a sign , To LET . Woolworth persuaded the landlord to excuse him from signing a lease and talked him into allowing thirty days , if necessary , in which to produce the first month 's rental , thirty-five dollars . He carefully avoided mention of a five-cent store . He simply said he was going to sell notions and general merchandise . He wrote a telegram asking Moore to reserve certain goods for his account . At that point he was racked by fears . Suppose he failed ? He and Jennie would he Sunk in debt for years , maybe to the end of their lives . He walked back and forth in front of the telegraph office many times before he mustered the confidence to file the message . On true train , riding hack to Watertown , seated close to a. pot-bellied stove , he became really gay and brave , rehearsing the manner in which he would break the news to Jennie . But at Watertown he went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock . Each item and its cost per gross was entered in a. book which he treasured to the end of his life . What follows is the list or that stock and the wholesale price , by the gross : 00 That brief catalogue , includes just about everything it was believed possible to sell in a , five-cent bargain store in that time . Most of it was poor stuff , scorned by good merchants . The First Customer When he had signed a note for $315 , he went home to Jennie and their baby , Lena . There was little time for any celebration . He returned to the store to help pack hitt goods . He labeled the crates himself and then returned to Utica . There , he scrubbed his store and put it in order himself during several weeks . For eight dollars he had counters made of plain pine boards . These other items are listed in a table of expenses preserved in his first ledger : The daybook , cashbook and ledger each cost sixty cents ; twenty and one half pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Watertown , $7. ? 3 ; 2000 handbills , $7.50 . Be hired a boy to distribute these , announcing his Grand Opening for eight o'clock on the evening of Saturday , February 22 , 1879 . His and Jennie 's savings had dwindled perilously , but he risked more , spending three dollars in a final splurge . This money paid for a sign which read , THE GnnA'r FIVE CENT STORE . The legend was his own invention , and it thrilled him to the core . On the evening before his scheduled opening , there was a knock at his store door . A woman was peering through the glass . " The store is n't open , madam . " " I know what I want . I 've read your circulars . I want . a five-cent fire shovel . " She was the first customer , and he served her without premonition of the vast tide of humanity which was to follow her . However , The Great Five Cent Store attracted little attention on Saturday night . When he closed up , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an even nine dollars . Monday 's business was better , 8-11.22 . He advertised for a clerk and invested ten cents in a money bag . Thursday he opened a bank account . On March fourth he sent Moore &; Smith $100 to apply on his indebtedness . On a Sunday in mid-March , Frank Woolworth gaily entered the little house in Watertown , and when Jennie was embracing him he drew about her shoulders a fine surprise , a fur dolman for which he had paid forty-five dollars . This was a tremendous stun . He was limiting his living expenses strictly to five dollars a week . They made fine plans , but in a few weeks business became so poor that Woolworth knew lie would have to close , or be closed by his creditors .
