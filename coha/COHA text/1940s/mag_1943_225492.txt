He hopes to have a trained staff and enough freedom from censorship to provide swift , sure coverage of the next peace conference . <P> " If they are talking about the Danube Valley and disposing of the rights and happiness of the people there , " Murrow wants to put his Danube Valley man on the air and " tell the world what the greybeards are talking about .
