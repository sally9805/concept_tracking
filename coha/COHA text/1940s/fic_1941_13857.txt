An elderly , absent-minded and very small COLONEL of the Army is seated at a desk , looking over two medical examination reports . On a bench are two serious MEN who are waiting patiently , in anxious silence . The COLONEL studies one report , then the other , glancing at the TWO MEN , and whistling softly . When the TWO MEN begin to whistle softly too , the COLONEL speaks . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Ernest Hughman . BOTH MEN get up . They look at one another , shake hands . The ELDER of the two steps to the desk . ERNEST ( At the desk ) At your service . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN ( Surprised ) Are you Ernest Hughman ? ERNEST I am . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN This report says you are in perfect physical condition . ERNEST That is a good thing to know . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN ( Absently ) Yes , it is . ( Cheerfully ) It is n't often that a man of your age  --  and profession  --  is in such excellent health . ( Pause ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 3 ERNEST I 'm afraid not , for being an actor I have always enjoyed a casual life , so to speak . On the other hand , acting is like having a hundred lives to live , instead of one . By the time a disease reaches one of the lives , the actor is off to another , and the disease is deserted . Perhaps that is why my health is good . ( Laughing ) I 'm only guessing of course . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Of course . And yet there seems to be something to what you say . I notice you have been in the theatre a good many years . ERNEST Since I was twenty-two . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Your age is forty-four . ( Figuring ) Hence you 've been in the theatre exactly twenty-two years . ( Pause ) I have been in the Military the greater part of my life . How did you happen to choose the theatre as your profession ? ERNEST ( Amused ) I entered the theatre because I am a show-off . I hope to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUGHMAN And your brother on the bench , how does it happen that he  --  ? ERNEST The man on the bench is not my brother . Except of course figuratively . It 's true we have the same family name , but that is only a coincidence . To make the coincidence still more baffling the given names of his father and mother are the same as the given names of mine . That is , Joseph and Mary  --  but of course those are common Christian names . We are both Catholics , we were both born in New York City , we come from practically the same class : the proud poor . His given name is August , mine Ernest . His age thirty-three , mine forty-four . His profession law , mine acting . We are brothers of course , as all men are . p. 4 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Yes . ( Smiling ) One of those things . You even look alike . ERNEST What 's more , he is a single child , and I am a single child . He is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this War , it is not very likely we would ever have met . He is an orphan from his third year , brought up in a Catholic orphanage , and I am an orphan from my seventh year , brought up in a Catholic orphanage . The same orphanage , I might point out : St. Dominic 's , on East 97th Street . I ran away from the orphanage to go on the stage before he was installed there . We met an hour ago when we came here to enlist . Being ten years his senior , and a man who has lived a careless life , I was afraid we might be separated after meeting at last . Now , I feel easier . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I 'm afraid you are going to be separated . ( AUGUST HUGHMAN stands ) Yes . I regret very much , August Hughman , that your application for enlistment must be rejected . AUGUST I do n't understand . I 'm in perfect health . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Yes , I believe you are , except for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ HUGHMAN Your right ear is deaf . And the eardrum is punctured . Place your left hand over your left ear and it is unlikely that you will be able to hear anything . p. 5 AUGUST ( Placing his left hand over his left ear ) I do n't believe it . Will you speak , please , so that I may listen with my right ear ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN If you do not hear , you must not pretend that you do . Can you hear ? ( Pause ) I say , can you hear ? AUGUST ( Brings his hand down from his left ear ) I had no idea the ear was totally deaf . ( Cheerfully ) But surely one good ear is as good as two . Surely you are not going to turn me away simply because my right ear is deaf . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Punctured , and deaf . Unfortunately , your left ear is partially deaf , too . There is no telling when it will become totally deaf . ( Pause , earnestly ) How did you happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm curious about such things . I have never been able to understand exactly how or why I entered the Military . It is not my field at all . When you decided to become a lawyer , did you know what you were doing ? AUGUST Not at all . A man has little choice . My friend entered the theatre because he wanted to show-off . He is now enlisting in the Army in order to go on showing-off . Whereas I do not know why I chose law as my career , or why I am eager to enlist in the Army now . I would like to believe , however , that my reasons are sensible and perhaps unselfish . The truth is , I am sorry to say , I do not know why I want to be in the Army , except that I am tired of law , tired of being on the outside of such an enormous thing as the War , and a little tired of myself . Yes , that 's the truth . I gave up my practice two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I have more money to spend on a comfortable life than I could ever manage to spend in thirty years . I am a little bored with the whole business of law and  --  yes , of life . And that is not a good thing . I believe I look for this experience of War to give my life purpose and meaning , and to restore me to a joyous feeling about mankind and myself . I even look forward to the worst : I do not mean that I want to be dead . On the contrary , I want to be alive . I have only once wanted to be dead , and that was when I was three years old  --  when I was installed in the orphanage . But as death is a difficult thing to achieve  --  the most difficult of all , I suppose  --  I want it to be achieved  --  if need be  --  for me  --  by the world , by circumstances over which I have no control  --  by inevitable accident , in other words . It simplifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can honestly feel is satisfactory  --  not an evasion of responsibility to myself exactly , but at the same time not too personal an event either , as death would be if I died in bed from disease or while standing in line at a movie from boredom . I do not like the idea of going back  --  one ear totally deaf , the other half-deaf  --  to try to achieve a decent life , with no help from the world or the circumstances of it . I do n't know how to get out of it , that 's all . Surely you can find a place for me in the Army ? ( The COLONEL shakes his head several times slowly ) I could stay beside my friend . He could listen for me . ( To ERNEST ) You would n't mind very much , would you ? p. 6 ERNEST ( To the COLONEL ) I promise to listen for him . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I know , and I wish I could let the defect pass unnoticed , but I ca n't . It might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might , for instance , be killed , and it might be very important for his hearing to be sharp and sound  --  and then what ? Suppose the destiny of a whole squad depended on his hearing ? Or a whole company ? Or perhaps even a battalion or a regiment ? No , we can not afford to risk so many lives on one man 's hearing . I can not tell you how sorry I am . AUGUST ( Eagerly , almost desperately . Kneeling ) The accept me as an office worker . I have no taste for private life any longer . Unless I am permitted to enter the Army , in one capacity or another , my life is ended . I have no fancy for cities , or for the goings on in them . I want War . I dislike melodramatics , even though I am a lawyer and have pleaded many cases in a melodramatic style of speech , but I ask you on my knees to let me enter the Army . It is a matter of life and death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not satisfy your request . ( Pause ) When you decided to become a lawyer , did n't you believe you might like to be something else , too , perhaps ? I am extremely curious about such things . Did n't you think you might like to be a doctor , too , for instance ? p. 7 AUGUST ( Getting off his knees ) No , sir . I have never wanted to be a doctor . As a matter of fact . I dislike doctors  --  all of them . This is a ridiculous way to feel about them , but it is the way I feel . I think of them as murderers , although they spend their time trying to save lives . ( Earnestly , suddenly going to his knees again ) Please forget that I am deaf in one ear . Let me go into the Army with my friend . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN It is no use . Regulations are regulations , no matter how unjust or unreasonable they may seem . In this case , I myself would say they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dried  --  as I believe you are the kind of man to make a good soldier . You are intelligent and have no romantic notions about the War , and as far as I can tell you have no desire to save civilization . But unfortunately there is nothing I can do . Absolutely nothing . Your right ear is deaf . ( Eagerly ) How did that ear go deaf ? AUGUST ( Getting off his knees ) It was boxed by a Sister at the orphanage the day I was taken there . It 's been out of commission ever since . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Why did the Sister box your ear ? AUGUST I 'm not sure , but it was probably because she was irritated with herself . Of course I was no help to her at all . I do not imagine that I charmed her with a cheerful personality or a contagious joyousness . I was bewildered and unhappy , and wanted to be dead . That is to say , I believed I wanted to be dead . I did n't understand anything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes imagines he wants to be dead . That is , if he 's three years old . If he 's thirty-three , he can see the absurdity of such an impulse , but at the same time he can also see the still greater absurdity of just dragging along with himself . Which is the way it is with me now . I hoped being in the Army would simplify the dragging . ( Pause , beginning to go to his knees ) Then , I 'm not wanted ? p. 8 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I 'm sorry . ERNEST ( Lifting AUGUST to his feet ) You need n't be so down in the mouth about it . I 'm going , and I 'll keep in touch with you . It 's not as if both of us were turned down  --  or accepted . ( To the COLONEL ) Now , what about me ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Everything is in order . As you are a man of the theatre  --  and as the Army is in need of entertainment for the maintenance of morale  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the field of the theatre . ERNEST I beg your pardon ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN We try as far as possible to assign every man to the field for which he is most fitted . You are an actor . Naturally , we like to feel that you will continue as an actor . ERNEST Do n't worry , I shall act all right . But not on any such trifling stage as that of a theatre . If you do n't mind , let me have a uniform , a gun , and the Army Regulations , the same as anybody else . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN You mean you wish to go into the Infantry ? ERNEST Yes . I wish to be a soldier . A foot soldier . I am quite flattered that my health is so good . I would like to test it with some sound , regulated living , as against the vagrant , unregulated living which I have enjoyed so far . p. 9 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Are you sure you would not rather continue as an actor ? We shall not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply that we need more actors than soldiers . ERNEST I am quite sure that I would rather be a plain soldier . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Then it shall be so . ( Sincerely ) But can you tell me the reason for your decision ? I am endlessly curious about how men make the decisions they make . ERNEST I have always wanted the biggest part in any play . The biggest part in this play is the soldier . The anonymous man . The one among the many . The unknown man . If killed , he is sometimes called The Unknown Soldier . A moment ago you wished to know why I chose acting as my career . I believe I can answer that question more fully now . I chose acting as my career in order to enlist in the Army at the age of forty-four as a common soldier . ( Pause ) This is one of the proudest , one of the happiest moments of my life . I am at last to act for the only audience worth bothering about : myself and God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , my half , and in all probability the other half will soon approve of me , too . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Such a casual and wholesome attitude toward soldiering should not be allowed to go to waste in a performance directed to so limited an audience . p. 10 ERNEST Limited ? ( Pause ) Well , perhaps . But I think you will agree it is not too limited . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I will tell you honestly , sir , that I am tempted to draft your talent into the theatre of the Armed Forces , because it is so needed . We have sickened our men with lies . No soldier in the field has time to think about what he is doing . He has a job to do , he tries to do it to the best of his ability at the time and under the circumstances . He knows it is a dangerous job and he knows he may be stopped at any moment . And that is where we have failed him . We have tried to tell him that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERNEST Men live in vain . There is no other way for them to die . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Precisely . If you were to go before soldiers in a play made out of the way you feel , I know it would do them more good than the kindnesses which a confused propaganda and public forces on them . The men do not believe the lies . It is time somebody told them the truth in a decent way  --  as you feel the truth for yourself . Before I grant your wish to enter the Army as a foot soldier , may I appeal to you as an actor  --  not as a patriot , not as anything but an honest actor  --  to abandon your wish to be entertained by the circumstance of war , and to adopt a policy of being both entertained and entertaining to others ? I will not say that you owe it to your country , because you have already offered your person to your country , for your own reasons  --  but I believe I can say that you owe it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a proud and sensible one . p. 11 ERNEST I 'm tempted , sir , but I must remain as I am and have always been : that is irresponsible  --  a man with no serious purpose . To seek to entertain the endangered , other than myself , is too much for me . I am sorry that I can not with a cheerful heart accept your offer . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I understand . I will not urge you any further . The Infantry , then . ERNEST Thank you , sir . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN It 's been pleasant chatting with you . ( To AUGUST ) And with you , sir . I am sorry you are not to go with your friend . AUGUST I ca n't understand what difference it can possibly make that my right ear is deaf . What is there to hear , anyway ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Nothing , for the most part , but a regulation is a regulation . Good luck to both of you . I hope we shall all survive the War . I hope we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon be won  --  by us . ERNEST ( Shaking the COLONEL 'S hand ) It 's won already . It is not simply that we are Americans , but also , sir , that there is art in us  --  and in spite of everything a certain amount of purity , besides . It is not that we are more right than the enemy , for every man is right in his heart  --  it is simply that we have the best manners . The War is won , since we do not hate anybody and want the enemy , after the War , to have his modest share of what we shall have after the War . That is to say , his modest share of nothing  --  or at least nothing worth one man 's murder . And if I may , sir , the War is won because I , an actor , as irresponsible a member of society as ever breathed , have been found in body , at the age of forty-four , sound and undamaged by a careless , casual life ; because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am proud of it all , without believing for a moment that any of it means anything . But I am an actor and I love the stage . ( To AUGUST ) Let us at least have supper together , and if you like  --  and if I may  --  let us each enjoy the company of an actress . p. 12 AUGUST The company of an actress ? ERNEST Yes . There is nothing more confusing  --  or more refreshing . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Excuse me . My wife passed on quite a number of years ago , and  --  ERNEST By all means . I know just the actress . You will be delighted . She is ripe , but there is still much pretending of greenness in her . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I would like to ask her simply how it happened that she became an actress . ERNEST I know , and I know the incredible answer she will give . You will be most impressed . AUGUST ( Softly ) I can hear every word you say . ERNEST Come along . What 's better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and an actress apiece ? ( To the COLONEL ) Your name , sir ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN It is Hughman , too , the same as yours . ( To AUGUST ) And yours , sir . ( Smiling ) It never occurred to me that I might be the father of one or another of you , or both . I am hardly a man of imagination . My given name is Joseph . AUGUST Joseph Hughman ? Then , sir , as you have the name of my own father , who died as a young man when I was three , forget the regulations of the Army , and let me go with my brother into the Infantry , so that tonight we may enjoy the world as equals and good members of the same family , with women of the stage to fascinate or confuse us . ( Pause , with great sincerity , getting on his knees ) I beg of you , sir  --  forget the regulations . p. 13 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN How unfortunate that I am unable to satisfy your wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be killed before I was thirty , and here I am going on sixty , with nothing better understood than at twenty , or even ten . I can not help you , sir . I ask you to forgive me . AUGUST ( Getting up . To ERNEST ) Then I had better say goodbye , and go home . The actress will bring me no enjoyment . I would only bore her , and she would only bore me . ERNEST Not the actress I have in mind for you . She is a queen . AUGUST A queen ? ERNEST Of the only true family of queens : burlesque . If she bores you , brother , you deserve to be bored . Besides , she has read a book and will speak to you of various meanings , with pleasant parts of her body in every meaning . AUGUST Even so , I do n't want a woman for the architecture of her , or for the reading she 's done , but for the foolishness of it . What good will her parts be to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joyous absurdity to hers ? I do not like to discuss ideas with bodies . Therefore , if we are to enjoy the night , let me be rid here of all ideas . Let me be a body , and then let the body go out and eat and drink , enjoy its weight and warmth with the weight and warmth of the body made by God to go with it . ( To the COLONEL ) I am embarrassed that I must keep appealing to you , but I am a dead man if I am not allowed to become , with all other men , only a body . I beg of you , sir . p. 14 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN If it were up to me as a person , your wish would have been granted long ago , but in the Military you must understand that I am not a person , I am a piece of machinery which performs routine work , according to regulations . I do not know why I ever went into the Military . It is not my field at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I made , now that I am unable to let you live as you wish to live . AUGUST ( Shaking the COLONEL 'S hand ) I shall appeal to you no more . If I were my own lawyer , pleading my own case , and my client too , I should not know , as client , whether it were the case that was hopeless or the lawyer . In the courts of New York I have done better . Murderers have been transformed into saints by my pleading ; thieving corporations have become benefactors of the poor ; cheap lies have been turned into noble truths , but for myself I am no lawyer at all . ( To ERNEST ) Good-bye . It will be best for me to begin at the beginning again , for I have a whole life to live over . ( He shakes ERNEST 'S hand ) Good luck . ( He turns to go . ) ERNEST Wait . This is too sad . There is not this much sadness in the whole body of things , let alone in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the better ear , and therefore go my way , as I wish . Even if it were unkind and rude to ask you once again , come along with us tonight . p. 15 AUGUST ( Tapping his right ear ) My ear is deaf . ERNEST It 's nothing . When the left ear is deaf with the right , thank God for the silence . In the meantime , you are my brother , and he is our father . We are without wives . I am of the theatre and a number of my friends are women of the stage . There is no tribe more suitable for us , and no night more suitable for the fun of them . Come along , brother . ( To the COLONEL ) Come along , father . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Thank you , my boy . I am an old man , bred in the Military , and fed up . Dull , dull , and no excuse for it , after all . p. 16 Act 1 , Scene 2 Scene II ERNEST and AUGUST HUGHMAN , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large table in a Hungarian Restaurant on 87th Street in New York . With them are THREE ACTRESSES : BECKY , very young and beautiful for AUGUST , since he is the youngest of the men ; STELLA , not quite so young or beautiful , for ERNEST ; and ELINORE , who is probably in her early fifties , for the COLONEL . At a nearby table is another COUPLE . There is a middle-aged WAITER . There is also a GYPSY TRIO : piano , fiddle and cimbalom . The music is going , and the WAITER is singing in Hungarian . There is a YOUNG WOMAN , dark and a little lonely-looking , who is wearing a gypsy fortune-teller 's costume . She is standing by , waiting for somebody to have his fortune told . When the music ends , ERNEST gets to his feet , applauding , and then speaks . ERNEST My friends : a toast to the War . ( He lifts his glass . EVERYBODY at his table stands . He looks toward the other COUPLE at the nearby table ) In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the War . ( They stand . The MAN cries , " Pl ! Pl Szent-Gyorgyi ! " ) You do not like the War ? SZENT-GYORGYI Hate war ! ERNEST Why ? SZENT-GYORGYI War kill ! p. 17 ERNEST Waiter , fill his glass . ( To PL ) Drink a toast , my friend . ( The WAITER fills PL 'S glass ) Why are you unhappy ? SZENT-GYORGYI Tirty year ago I come from Hon-gary . ERNEST Ah , you weep for the years gone by . A toast to the good man 's lost years . What is your name , my friend ? SZENT-GYORGYI Pl . Pl Szent-Gyorgyi , same as my fodder . ERNEST A toast to Pl Szent-Gyorgyi , and to his fodder Pl Szent-Gyorgyi  --  and to my fodder , Pl Szent-Gyorgyi . ( Swiftly ; to PL ) It was my own father 's name , too . Pl ! Pl Szent-Gyorgyi . A toast , ladies and gentlemen  --  to the thirty years of Pl Szent-Gyorgyi . Everybody drink . ( EVERYBODY drinks . ) SZENT-GYORGYI Pl Szent-Gyorgyi  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Hon-gary . ( Laughing ) Tirty years more , I go back . ( He begins to weep . He looks at ERNEST ) Anoder toast to Pl Szent-Gyorgyi  --  you bet . Big fellow , fight like Christian man , kill tree Turks one hand . ( Shows his broad shoulders and powerful arms ) Pl  --  you bet . Szent-Gyorgyi , from Hon-gary . Drink champagne . Everybody drink to good Christian man . ( EVERYBODY drinks ) Hofe ! Hofe ! ( He sits down. ) p. 18 ERNEST Orchestra ! Play a song for Pl ! ( To PL ) What song will it be , Pl ? SZENT-GYORGYI Pragnienie , Pragnienie ! VIOLINIST Pragnienie , Pragnienie . He begins to fiddle , and the other MUSICIANS join him in lively sorrowful song . While it is playing PL gets up drunkenly and begins to dance . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Dancing ) Pragnienie ! You know ? Homesick . ( To WAITER ) Myslonky , myslonky . ( Tapping his forehead ) Tinking  --  tirty years tinking . ERNEST What do you think , Pl ? SZENT-GYORGYI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Take my fodder , take my modder , take my brodder , take my sister . Zlodziej ! Zlodziej ! AUGUST He calls Death , whom he does not love , and yet he calls as though Death were a woman . BECKY ( Leaning over and kissing him ) You 're sweet . AUGUST Sweet ? BECKY You 're sweet to say what you said . It 's wonderful to be able to say things like that . Am I wonderful , too ? p. 19 AUGUST You are ! SZENT-GYORGYI Zlodziej , zlodziej ! Smierc , smierc ! AUGUST Do you hear him ? Listen , listen . SZENT-GYORGYI Zlodziej ! Smierc ! ( He smiles , comes to the table , and speaks to ERNEST ) You know smierc ? ERNEST Only in English , I 'm afraid . SZENT-GYORGYI In English , same ting , smierc ! AUGUST ( To ELINORE ) He means Death . I can tell from the smile . ELINORE Death ? Why would he smile about Death ? AUGUST He 's told us . He 's a Christian man . BECKY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Nodding wisely , looking about , gesturing at everything ) Smierc . You know ? ERNEST Yes , I believe I do . SZENT-GYORGYI You know black horse ?

( He sighs drunkenly ) I doan know . Hofe , hofe . Pragnienie ! Homesick . ( He staggers over to his table , kisses his WOMAN on the lips , sits down , buries his head on his arms. ) p. 20 AUGUST He is a man of decent sorrows . BECKY You 're sweet . AUGUST ( To ERNEST ) You said she had read a book . She keeps telling me I 'm sweet . Of what book is that the message ? ERNEST Becky , be intelligent for my friend . BECKY He 's sweet . AUGUST You see ? I 've heard her say nothing else . I have never before been told that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 're sweeter than anybody . AUGUST ( To ERNEST ) What does she mean ? ERNEST We 'll go soon , Becky . We 'll go when they close . ( To the COLONEL and his WOMAN ) We 'll all go . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Yes , my son . I do n't know why I ever went into the Military . ( To his woman , ELINORE ) It 's not my field at all , you know . And now it 's too late to do anything about it . You see , I did n't know . I was too young . I thought I would be killed before I got to be thirty , but I was n't . There was a little skirmish in Honduras  --  two natives stole pigs  --  and I had to go after them with a squad of men . We had to wade after them through swamps . One of the men turned and shouted at us . He called us names . I did not know what the names were , but I did not like his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called a name . There was nothing else to do . I gave the order . Ready  --  aim  --  fire ! Twelve men fired as one . Twelve men  --  but he got away . We never did catch him . I never knew his name , or his friend 's name , or what he called us . When we got back we were tired and muddy , and some native women came and asked if we wished to be refreshed . Yes , that 's exactly how they put it  --  great big women , with big faces . They knew we had waded through the swamps , in the heat . They knew we were tired . It 's not my field at all . I have never before known people like yourself , and these other two young women . And the man who came from Hungary thirty years ago . p. 21 ELINORE You look like a military man . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN I 'm not at all , though . Not at all . It was a boyish escapade , nothing more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got back the native women came and asked if we wished to be refreshed . ELINORE What were they selling ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Oranges . It was only that we 'd been away from home so long . Otherwise we would n't have talked to them , even . They speak very little English anyway , and we would n't have talked to them . ELINORE I see nothing wrong in selling oranges . ( Suddenly ) Ernest , I ca n't believe you 're going off to be a soldier . I think it 's most mysterious . And look at poor Stella , speechless and broken-hearted about the whole thing . Absolutely speechless . STELLA I 'm drunk . A cup of coffee and I 'll be as bright as ever . ELINORE But you are broken-hearted about Ernest , are n't you ? I know I am . STELLA Ernest ? Who 's Ernest ? ( Looking around , finding ERNEST 'S face ) Oh , yes . Good Lord , why should I be broken-hearted about him ? He 's only showing-off . He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part for him to act . p. 22 AUGUST I can hear every word . And they say I 'm half-deaf . I can hear everything everybody says . BECKY You 're sweet . STELLA Why should I be broken-hearted about Ernest going off to be a soldier ? He 'll only come back with a scratch on his nose , prettier than ever . Wo n't you , darling ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Excuse me , dear girl , he 's not going out to a little skirmish . It is not going to be the way it was in Honduras with nothing more than two pig-thieves to chase . This is a real War . You may as well know he may be killed at any moment  --  any moment , dear girl . STELLA I do n't believe it . I simply do n't believe anything can kill Ernest . It 's simply out of the question . AUGUST I can hear everything you say . It 's all nonsense . ( To STELLA ) Excuse me . I hope you are right . STELLA Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know him better than anybody here . He will not be killed . He simply will not be killed . Why , who would want to kill a man like that , who has nothing but comical thoughts for everybody ? I have never known anybody to dislike him , except for a moment  --  and then only women , and only for a moment . Who in the world would want to kill Ernest ? p. 23 AUGUST I hear every word you say . I 'm sure nobody in the world would want to kill him  --  nobody . STELLA Now , Ernest , would you want to kill anybody ? Anybody at all ? ERNEST No . Not even accidentally . STELLA You see ? He is not going to be a soldier at all . AUGUST I hear every word . With only one ear , and that ear half-deaf , I hear everything . BECKY You 're sweet . AUGUST I speak poorly , but there is no sweetness in it . ( To STELLA ) If he is killed , he will not know who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know who it is he has killed . BECKY You 're very sweet to say that . AUGUST ( To the COLONEL ) You have made a mistake to put him in the Infantry and leave me out . It ought to be the other way around . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN My dear boy , a regulation is a regulation . AUGUST ( With anger ) It 's nonsense . BECKY You 're sweet . AUGUST Just a moment , Becky . ( To the COLONEL ) If I can hear as well as anyone , what difference does it make if I hear with only one ear , instead of two ? I hear everything . I have been listening all night . I heard everything . I heard things you did not hear , sir , and things he did not hear , either . Do you remember when Pl Szent-Gyorgyi was dancing ? Well , did you hear the woman at his table ? Did you hear her , any of you ? No , you did n't . Your ears are not deaf , but you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to herself saying three times  --  yes , exactly three times  --  Pl , Pl , Pl ! p. 24 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Well , of course . What else would the poor woman say ? He is her husband or lover , and he is unhappy , in spite of her , so unhappy that he must get up and dance in public . Well , then , what else would she say ? You did not hear her , my boy . You saw her . You knew what she was saying . You did not hear it , I assure you . You scarcely hear anything I am saying . You see it . You know the nature of it from the expression of my face and the tone of my voice . Well , noises  --  military noises  --  have neither expressions nor tones . You might be killed . AUGUST I suppose he might n't just because he 's not deaf . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN He might , too . ELINORE Poor , poor Ernest . STELLA Do n't be silly . He 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What then ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN What then ? Why , nothing . AUGUST Nothing ! Every man must have a funeral , and it ought to be a decent one , Christian or otherwise . ERNEST I would like a nice funeral all right . AUGUST That is the least any man is entitled to . Mourners , appropriate music , ashes to ashes , and all the rest of it . What about his funeral ? p. 25 COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Every effort is made to give every man a decent burial , but of course there is scarcely time for anything elaborate , or even whole-hearted . If there is time , someone says a prayer , and everybody gets a grave . ERNEST Oh , that 'll never do for me , sir . I am an actor . I would expect a theatrical funeral . Everything traditional to begin with , and after the routine things , then a good many more , according to my own inclinations . AUGUST What would you prefer , after the traditional rites ? ERNEST Well , naturally I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind , by anybody . I would like the kind of weeping we had tonight from Pl Szent-Gyorgyi . Yes , I would like him to be at my funeral . He should be paid to mourn . He may not remember me . If so , he should be paid . If he does remember me , and is sincerely grieved , then of course he will not wish to be paid . I would like others to mourn  --  any who have a talent for it . AUGUST I will look for Pl , in the event  --  ERNEST Then , too , I would like Becky to work . AUGUST Work ? ERNEST Yes , of course . Her best costume , her best routine , and the proper lighting . p. 26 AUGUST I 'm afraid I do n't understand . I 'm not of the theatre . ERNEST I would like Becky to dance at my funeral . BECKY ( To ERNEST ) You 're sweet , too . ERNEST You 'll do it , wo n't you , Becky ? BECKY I 'll do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of so much clothes . ( She turns to the VIOLINIST ) Orchestra , Melancholy Baby ! ERNEST Not now , Becky . At my funeral . BECKY Clothes make me sweat . I stink when I sweat . I 'll work now . Orchestra , Melancholy Baby ! Lower those lights ! I want to work ! ERNEST Not now , darling . BECKY I 'm tired of clothes . I look lousy in clothes . People never know what I really look like in clothes . They think I 'm anybody  --  and I 'm not . ( She takes off her coat and reveals that she 's not . ) ERNEST ( Helping her back into her chair ) Of course you 're not . BECKY You 're sweet . You 're almost as sweet as him . p. 27 ERNEST Now , what else do I want ? Well , I want a funeral march . Then I want plenty of food and drinks for everybody . Some low comedy . Becky can get three of the boys from the Gayety . STELLA ( Scoffing ) Stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Only a certain number are killed , and you may not be among the unlucky ones . STELLA Of course he wo n't be killed . Why , who in the world would want to kill Ernest ? ERNEST I 'll call the fortune-teller . She 'll tell us if I 'm to be killed . ( He stands ) Gypsy Girl ! GYPSY GIRL You want me ? ERNEST Please . ( The GYPSY GIRL comes over to the table ) Sit down , Miss . ( She sits down ) Now . Tell my fortune . GYPSY GIRL ( Shuffling a deck of cards ) These are fortune-telling cards . They tell the truth . I will shuffle them carefully . Then I will cut them seven times  --  to the lucky card , or the unlucky card , whichever is the truth . Then let him whose fortune is to be told shut his eyes . Let him hold his eyes shut , and let him think about his life . ( ERNEST has shut his eyes ) Now . Here are the cards . Take one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERNEST takes a card and places it face down on the table ) Now , that is your first card . There will be three . But the first card  --  that is your card . The card of your life . I hope it is good , for the cards tell the truth . In my family the cards have told the truth for three hundred years  --  for my mother , for her mother , and for many more of our mothers . They have always told the truth . You must not be afraid of the truth , whatever it is . For whatever it is , it is the truth . If it is bad , then fill your glass and drink . ( She puts a finger on the card ) That is your card  --  your life . I will turn it over . Let your eyes be clear and unafraid upon it , whatever it is . Do not be proud if it is good . Do not be afraid if it is bad . Whatever it is , that is what it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with your own hand and with your own eyes closed . Now , I will turn the card over . It will tell the truth . Do not let your eyes blink . ( She turns the card over . EVERYBODY looks at the card. ) p. 28 AUGUST ( Excited ) What card is it ? I can not see . I can hear everything , but I can not see . GYPSY GIRL ( Holding the card aloft ) This is the card . From thirty-two cards , this is the card you have taken with your own hand , with your own eyes closed . Do not be afraid . AUGUST But what card is it ? What does it mean ? GYPSY GIRL There were thirty-one other cards to take . Some good , some bad , but every one of them true . Joy , Sadness , Marriage , Misfortune , Letter , Children , Hope , Money , Sickness , Longing , Falsity , News , Jealousy , Ideas , Enemy  --  and so on . But this is your card . AUGUST Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does the card mean ? GYPSY GIRL This is the card of Death . See ? There is Death in its white robe . Death  --  or , as Pl says , Smierc . It is the same in any language . It is the same no matter what the word is . Death or Halal or Tod or Morte or Muerte or Smierc or Smrt  --  it is the same , and it is the truth . This is your card , selected with your own hand , with your own eyes closed . Do not be angry , it is no use . Do not laugh at the cards , for they tell the truth . Now , take another card . ( ERNEST takes a card ) Now , one more . That is all . Three altogether . ( ERNEST takes another card . The GYPSY turns over one of the cards ) This card is Gayety . That is a very strange card to go with Death , but it is the truth . The cards do not deceive us . Two cards : Death and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turns the card over ) Yes , it is the truth . There they are . The third card is the Priest . There he is in his robe , in the church . That is all . Death , Gayety , and the Priest . Do you understand ? p. 29 ERNEST Yes , I believe I do . GYPSY GIRL You are not angry ? ERNEST ( Drinking ) Not the least . The cards have told me what I know . GYPSY GIRL You have known you shall die ? ERNEST I have known it all my life . GYPSY GIRL Have you known it shall be soon ? ERNEST I am celebrating tonight the acceptance of my enlistment into the Army , in the Infantry . GYPSY GIRL You wish to die ? ERNEST Not at all , but at the same time I do not particularly wish not to die . I am forty-four years old . I have been an actor twenty-two years . I have appeared in every kind of play ever written , and now I have found it impossible to resist appearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War as a play ? ERNEST Yes , I do . GYPSY GIRL This card  --  Gayety . I do not understand it well . Can you tell me what it means ? ERNEST You are a poor fortune-teller . GYPSY GIRL It is not often that I tell the fortune of one like you . My fee is fifty cents , but for you it is nothing . I will not take any money . Only a sip of wine , to drink to you . What is the meaning of this card  --  Gayety ? p. 30 ERNEST I am not a fortune-teller , but I believe it means that I shall have a happy funeral . ( To the WAITER ) A glass , please , for the Gypsy Girl . A glass is placed on the table . ERNEST pours champagne into it . The GYPSY GIRL looks at him seriously and lifts the glass . GYPSY GIRL I drink to you  --  happy man ! ( She drinks and throws the empty glass suddenly to the floor , breaking it ) What I shall tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , as I am a fortune-teller , and my mother was a fortune-teller before me , and her mother before her  --  three hundred years . When you die , as you shall , and soon  --  well , you shall not die . It is not in the cards , but it is the truth . I do not know how it is truth , but there is no fear in you , and if there is no fear in a man , how can he die ? It is impossible . ERNEST It is ? Well , thank you . GYPSY GIRL You will not die . I do not ask people if they want their fortunes told . I am going now , but if any of you wants to know the truth , then look at me , and I will understand . ( She waits a moment , EVERYBODY looks down , except BECKY , who looks at her in a drunken , sweet stupor ) You are looking at me , but you do not need to have your fortune told . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . p. 31 BECKY You 're sweet . ( The GYPSY GIRL goes . ) AUGUST I heard every word , every whisper . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Sitting up suddenly and looking around , speaking softly ) Smierc , smierc ! ERNEST Orchestra , play a song for Pl Szent-Gyorgyi ! SZENT-GYORGYI ( Shouting gaily ) Pragniene , Pragniene ! ( The orchestra begins to play . ) ERNEST ( Lifting his glass ) @x It is early nightfall of a day three months later . AUGUST is standing in darkness at the window of his Sutton Place apartment , looking down at the river . A key in the door is heard . AUGUST does not stir . BECKY comes in . AUGUST turns . BECKY goes to him and kisses him . AUGUST What have you done to your hair ? BECKY ( Removing her hat ) Combed it down , that 's all ! I got a letter from a man who said my hair should be combed down , because I am Esther . You know . Esther , of the Bible . Is he right ? Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man ? BECKY He did n't sign his name . He just said I ought to comb it down . ( Opening her handbag ) Here 's the letter . Do you want to read it ? AUGUST You read it . BECKY Well , it 's very sweet . ( Reading ) Miss Becky , Gayety Theatre , New York . Dear Miss Becky : Last night I saw you take off your clothes at the Gayety . You are very beautiful , but there was something wrong when all your clothes were off . I did n't know what it was , but I have been thinking about it , and now I know . As your hair is very black , and your body very white , your hair should not be combed up on your head . It should fall straight down on your shoulders . You are Esther , of the Bible . Comb your hair down , Miss Becky , so that everyone who sees you will know who you are . I am a Christian and once preached the Gospel , but now I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worship . I am almost ninety and very unhappy about the War . Over and over again I told them from the pulpit to watch out , but they would not listen to me . I have written letters to everybody , just as Paul of the New Testament did , but nobody answers my letters . I am from the Bible , too , and my letters are part of it , but nobody answers them . I do n't know how Paul got his letters into the Bible . I have written letters to the Jews telling them how to live , but they do not answer me . I have also written letters to the Christians and to the Unbelievers . There are really no Unbelievers of course , because not believing is only another kind of believing . I am still in good health and pray every night for the mercy of God to reach the hearts of men . My great grandson , a boy of twenty named Philip , was killed in the War three months ago . I miss him very much because a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby , not a soldier , and now where is he ? Well , Miss Becky , I thank you for being Esther , but I will not sign my name because I am an old man and do not want you for myself , as some old men do . I am glad you are so beautiful , though , because it is necessary for women to be beautiful if there is ever going to be any goodness in this evil old world . Yours truly , A Christian . ( Pause ) Is he crazy ? p. 33 AUGUST No man is crazy who lives to be almost ninety and then goes to the Gayety to worship . BECKY I did n't think he was crazy . ( Pause ) There were a lot of soldiers at the matinee . I threw kisses to them . They liked me very much . I kept looking for Ernest , but I did n't see him . Every time I see a soldier I think he might be Ernest . AUGUST He 'll be here soon . BECKY ( After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been waiting for him since six o'clock . He wired that he would be here between six and eight . BECKY I ca n't believe we have n't seen him since the night we all went to the Hungarian Restaurant . ( Pause ) I was pretty drunk that night . Did I do anything wrong ? AUGUST No , you did n't . I do n't think it 's possible for you to do anything wrong . BECKY ( Removing clothes , as if she were working ) You are n't sorry you 're in love with me , are you ? AUGUST I 'm not sorry  --  I 'm amazed . BECKY I 'm not sorry I 'm in love with you , either , and I guess I 'm amazed too . Three months ago if anybody told me a man like you would fall in love with a girl like me , and I would fall in love with him  --  well , I would have told him he was crazy . ( Continuing , after a pause ) What 's the matter ? Have I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Pause , suddenly ) I want you to telephone the Gayety immediately . BECKY What for ? AUGUST Well , Ernest is going to be here soon , and I thought we would spend the night together , the same as we did three months ago . We might even go to the Hungarian Restaurant . BECKY I 've got two more shows . I wo n't be through till half-past eleven . AUGUST I want you to telephone the Gayety and tell them you 're not going back . BECKY Why ? AUGUST Well  --  ( Pause . He looks at her strangely ) I have n't asked you to give up your job  --  because  --  Well , I wo n't ask you now , either  --  Well , this is very awkward . If you 'll be my wife , then I would like to ask you not to go back to the Gayety . BECKY You do n't have to ask me to be your wife to ask me not to go back to the Gayety . You can just ask me not to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , if you want to ask me . AUGUST No , I want you to be my wife . BECKY ( Almost all of her clothes removed ) But I 've lived here three months , anyway . I got up the next day and wanted to go away , but you yourself told me to stay . If you asked me then not to go back to the Gayety , I would n't have gone back . You do n't have to ask me to be your wife just to ask me not to go back to the Gayety. p. 35 AUGUST I want you to be my wife . Do you want to be my wife ? BECKY Yes . AUGUST ( Pause ) If you know , will you tell me why ? Please try to tell me exactly why , no matter how foolish the reason may be . BECKY ( After a moment of eager and honest thinking , she shrugs her shoulders ) I guess I do n't know why . AUGUST It is not impossible , then , that we were meant for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I love you ? AUGUST No . It is simply the custom to pretend that people who love one another love only one another . It is seldom suggested that a man 's love for a woman is actually a celebration of his love for all things . BECKY Like the Fourth of July ? AUGUST Or Christmas . BECKY ( Sincerely ) Well , I do n't care . ( Long pause ) I love you . AUGUST What do you mean ? BECKY I love you . ( Pause. ) p. 36 AUGUST ( Looking at her curiously ) What are you trying to tell me ? BECKY I was n't going to  --  But if we 're going to be together for good  --  well  --  ( Long pause . ) AUGUST Are you sure ? I have n't learned to live , how shall I instruct another ? BECKY I was afraid you 'd be angry , but I do n't care . There are better things than knowing how to do them  --  ( Pause ) Well , I mean  --  AUGUST ( Swiftly ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling faintly ) This is most ridiculous  --  and awe-inspiring . But why have n't you told me ? BECKY I was n't sure , but now I am , and I 'm going to have my fun . AUGUST Fun ? But it 's written of woman : In sorrow shall you bring forth . BECKY I do n't care what 's written . If you knew what I know , or feel what I feel , you 'd know that that sorrow for me is fun . ( Pause )  --  If you 're not angry . AUGUST A good father is never angry at his infant 's closest parent , or critical of his infant 's first home , since it is the only home provided in the beginning . My infant 's found as sweet a place to start as any infant ever found . ( He holds her by the shoulders , at arm 's length ) Now , whether I like it or not  --  and perhaps I shall like it  --  I am turned from the end of things to the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve , for I have not yet learned anything about the end of things  --  but one thing 's sure : A man should have a decent birth , a happy funeral , and in between a life both pleasant and honorable. p. 37 BECKY I do n't know how a man can have a happy funeral when he 's dead , or a decent birth when he 's too little to know the difference . AUGUST One thing 's sure  --  ( Pause , suddenly ) What did you say ? BECKY I said how can you have a decent birth when you 're too little to know the difference ? How can you have a happy funeral when you 're dead ? AUGUST ( Almost amazed ) Yes , that 's what I thought you said . BECKY I 'll go telephone the Gayety . ( She goes . ) AUGUST spends a few minutes at the piano , tapping one key many times , and then another . The door-chime sounds . BECKY runs to the door , which is not seen . The door is heard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around one another . ERNEST is in the uniform of a private . AUGUST ( Happily ) How are you ? ERNEST I 've lost ten pounds . I 've forgotten most of art . But , by God , I feel all right  --  a little doggy , as boys turned loose from Reform School must feel . I want a woman . I want a good table . I want good drink . I want everything  --  quick ! ( Pause ) That 's how I feel . ( He kisses BECKY 'S cheek . He turns to AUGUST ) What 's this girl doing here ? p. 38 AUGUST Well  --  ( Almost embarrassed ) We 're to be  --  ( Noticing ERNEST 'S closeness to BECKY ) We 're married . ERNEST ( Pushing BECKY away pleasantly ) Away from me , then ! I 've told you how I feel . ( To AUGUST ) Good boy ! I 'm glad I brought you together . AUGUST And I 'm grateful that you did . You have no idea what 's happened to me . ERNEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! One last kiss . ( To AUGUST ) I never saw a wife for myself in any girl until another did . Becky might have been mine , you know . ( He kisses her ) This is the end . ( He looks at BOTH of them , delighted ) You go well together . I would never have believed it but you do . ( To BECKY ) Have you leaned a good deal from this man ? How is your way of speech now ? Has it improved ? Say something , so I may judge . BECKY You 're sweet . ERNEST ( Happily ) She 's the same , thank God . It 's good to see you both , and better still to see you together . ( He sits down , a little weary , looks at the floor . After a moment he speaks softly ) I 'm tired . p. 39 AUGUST ( Pouring a drink ) Well , have a drink . ERNEST Yes  --  thanks . ( Suddenly ) Now , for God 's sake , do n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( He takes the drink from AUGUST ; gulps a good deal of it ) Let 's say it 's the night it was three months ago , and take it from there . AUGUST Yes , of course . I was hoping we 'd get the others , too , and go to the Hungarian Restaurant  --  ( ERNEST looks at AUGUST curiously , as if he were remembering the restaurant but not too pleasantly ) We have n't been there since that night , waiting for you to return . ERNEST ( Smiling again , standing ) Now I feel fine . Yes , that 's what we 'll do . I wish to God we could change clothes for awhile , though . AUGUST Clothes ? ERNEST Yes  --  this stuff 's too heavy for an actor . It 's not cloth , it 's iron . AUGUST Iron ? ERNEST On my word , after one day of it the body is locked , and then all the rest of it is locked , too . Locked in iron . ( Pleasantly ) Shall we go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 40 BECKY I ca n't go now . AUGUST Why ? BECKY I telephoned the Gayety , and they begged me to do the last two shows , too . If it was n't Saturday , it would be all right , but it 's Saturday . They begged me to do the last two shows and I could n't refuse . ( Pause ) Could I ? AUGUST No , of course not . But get in a cab after the last show and come to the Hungarian Restaurant . BECKY ( She kisses AUGUST ) I thought you 'd be angry . AUGUST ( Gently ) I am angry , but not at you . BECKY I 'll see you at the Hungarian Restaurant . ( BECKY goes . ERNEST turns to AUGUST . ) ERNEST What are you angry about ? AUGUST I have no right to be happier than you , or in different clothes . ERNEST But you 're not happier than I. He sits at the piano , suddenly tired again . AUGUST watches him curiously , moving toward the window . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , while AUGUST listens . ERNEST I 'll tell you what I 've learned . It is n't much , and I 'm sure it is n't going to be useful to anybody , but I think I 'd better tell you just the same . Death begins with helplessness , and it 's impossible to joke about . In the Army everybody is helpless and grim . Death is a lousy idea from which there is no escape . The idea is made out of imprisonment and weariness . It is impossible for any man to joke about Death while he is imprisoned and weary , for he is Death itself , or life desperately in need of rest and refreshment . It is horrible to need refreshment and not to get it . The idea of Death is no fun at all to me because I 'm too tired to see straight , and can not know when I shall be able to rest again . If I were refreshed the idea of Death would be refreshing and I could no more fear it than I could fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm scared to death of it . It 's not funny at all , and I ca n't wait for the War to end , so I can learn to love Death again , if I live that long . ( Slight pause ) That is what I 've learned . p. 41 p. 42 Act 2 , Scene 2 Scene II The Hungarian Restaurant , a little before midnight . Everything is exactly as it had been three months ago , including the presence of PL SZENT-GYORGYI and his WOMAN . The GYPSY TRIO is playing the same song , the PEOPLE are all the same , everything is the same  --  except that BECKY is not there yet . When the music ends , once again ERNEST gets to his feet , applauding . ERNEST ( Happily ) My friends  --  a toast . Let us drink to the War no more . Let us drink instead to the Peace . ( He lifts his drink . EVERYBODY at his table stands : COLONEL HUGHMAN , his woman ELINORE , ERNEST 'S woman STELLA , and AUGUST . ERNEST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is again drunk ) My friend , in the name of Love , let us stand . ( PL and his WOMAN stand , holding their glasses . Suddenly , the same as last time , PL shouts with grief ) Ho ! Saint George ! Do you still weep ? Save it , I beg of you , for my funeral ! Do not cry now , Pl . This is not the time for it . SZENT-GYORGYI Smierc  --  smierc . The GYPSY GIRL comes to the table and looks at ERNEST curiously . ERNEST You have not forgotten , have you ? Poor Pl has forgotten . While I am still alive , he forgets . How will he remember when I am dead ? p. 43 SZENT-GYORGYI Pl no forget . Pl remember  --  ha ha ! Smierc . Ho ha  --  ha ha ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ha ! Smierc . Smierc ! GYPSY GIRL The cards do not lie , and yet  --  ERNEST Oh , I shall die , but please do n't hurry me . GYPSY GIRL No , no  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shall not embarrass the cards . GYPSY GIRL ( A little excited ) No , no . You did not take the card of Death . The cards do not lie . You did not take it . Someone else took it . It was taken with your own hand , with your own eyes closed  --  but it was not for you , for I know these things , and my mother before me knew them . ERNEST Of course I took the card . It was not other . I am satisfied , and there is no place in fortune-telling for courtesy . Smierc it was , and Smierc it remains . Now , our toast  --  to the Peace . ( They ALL drink , including the GYPSY GIRL . ) GYPSY GIRL I drink with you to the Peace , but I know these things , and I do not speak from courtesy . You did not take the card . AUGUST Who took it ? ERNEST ( To AUGUST , objecting ) Sit down , sit down . If you want your fortune told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AUGUST ( Sitting down ) I want my fortune told . GYPSY GIRL ( Sits down and shuffles the deck of cards ) The cards tell the truth . I shuffle them carefully , and cut them seven times  --  to the lucky card , or to the one which is not lucky , whichever is the truth . Then let him whose fortune is to be told shut his eyes . ( AUGUST shuts his eyes ) Let him think about his life . ( She holds out the deck of cards to AUGUST ) Now , here are the cards . Take one and place it down on the table . ( AUGUST takes a card and places it face down on the table ) Now , that is your card . There will be two more , but that is the card of your life , and the truth . Now , open your eyes . ( AUGUST opens his eyes ) I will turn the card over . It will tell the truth . ( She turns the card over , and EVERYBODY looks at it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holding the card aloft ) This is the card . It is the card of Gayety . It is not the best card of all , but it is almost the best . Take another card . ( AUGUST takes another card ) Now , one more , and that is all . ( AUGUST takes a third card . The GYPSY GIRL turns over the second card ) This is your second card . It is good , also . This is the card of the Priest , but as Gayety is your first card , the Priest following Gayety is for marriage or baptism . Now , this is your third card . ( She turns over the third card ) This is the card of Death , but as it is in its proper place , you will live well and long . In the end all men die , but it is better to die in the end than in the beginning , and you will die in the end , after living . First a happy life , marriage and children and baptisms , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is your fortune , sir . My fee is fifty cents . p. 45 AUGUST ( Handing her a coin ) Now ! Are you sure I took the cards ? GYPSY GIRL Of course . I saw you with my own eyes , and everyone here saw you . AUGUST And the three cards are the same three which he took three months ago , drawing them from the deck in a different order ? Is that right ? Do you remember ? GYPSY GIRL ( Thinking ) Yes . Yes , they are the same cards . The order of his taking was Death , then Gayety , then the Priest , but that order is not the same as this order . That order means Death at the beginning  --  heedlessly , with no care , with Gayety  --  then the Priest for burial . Three in numbers is not many , but in combinations , three is all  --  but first one is all , and then three tells how one shall become all . It is always Death , but three tells how it shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( Simply ) I did not take the cards . GYPSY GIRL Of course you took them . AUGUST No . ( Of ERNEST ) He took them , and three months ago I took the cards , and he did not . GYPSY GIRL You are brothers perhaps . A brother does not like to see his brother die . The cards tell the truth , and do not know brothers . p. 46 AUGUST Of course the cards tell the truth . Everything tells the truth . Lies tell the truth . ( He points ) Pl tells the truth . The violin tells the truth . There are no lies to tell . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Shouting ) Pl Szent-Gyorgyi ! ( He gestures in a circle at everything . ) AUGUST Pl , what is the truth ? SZENT-GYORGYI Ha  --  ha ! What is the truth ? Ho ha  --  ha ha ! You know . You do not need to ask Pl . AUGUST Tell us , Pl . What is the truth ? SZENT-GYORGYI ( Almost sobbing again ) I do not like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robber . ( He sits down ) Dirty robber ! AUGUST ( Anxiously , worried , suddenly impatiently ) For God 's sake , what 's happened to her ? It 's after twelve . Where is she ? ( The GYPSY GIRL goes back to her place . ) ERNEST She 'll be here . ( Pause ) Orchestra ! A song for my friend , my brother . A happy song for a happy man . SZENT-GYORGYI Pragnienie , Pragnienie ! p. 47 ERNEST Yes , Pragnienie  --  that 's it ! Thank you , Pl . You live a steady life . Smierc , zlodziej , and Pragnienie  --  you have a fine group of three . ( The orchestra begins to play the song ) That 's it , that 's it ! ( To AUGUST ) She 'll be here . Why are you so fretful ? She 's been alone in this city all her life . She was not lost and not in danger when you did not even know she lived . What is it ? AUGUST ( Excited ) I must tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . I do n't know how to feel . ERNEST What is it , man ? AUGUST She is with child . Can you believe such a thing ? Yes . ( He gets up suddenly ) I am going out to look for her . Something 's happened . ERNEST ( Grabbing him by the shoulders ) Sit down , man . Nothing 's happened , but something will happen if you go looking for her . She 'll be here . ( AUGUST sits down ) Now , fill your glass and drink . AUGUST ( Almost furious ) I tell you she 's with child . It 's not the same when that 's how it is . It 's altogether different . ( He drinks untidily , excited ) It 's the most awe-inspiring thing that 's ever happened to me . I 'm stunned every minute . I 've got to see her . After tonight I 'll not let her out of my sight . Every man 's entitled to a decent birth . How do I know where she is ? The infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it now ? p. 48 ERNEST ( Laughing ) It 's seventeen minutes after twelve . ( He stands ) My friends , another toast . Let us stand proudly and drink the best toast of all . ( EVERYBODY stands ) Let us drink to  --  the Infant ! ( They ALL drink , AUGUST spilling some of his drink ) Let us drink to the Infant again ! ( They ALL drink . ) SZENT-GYORGYI Baby ? ERNEST Baby is the word for a certain kind of young woman . We drink to the Infant ! SZENT-GYORGYI Ho ha  --  ha ha ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ha ! Baby , O Baby , Baby ! ( He kisses his WOMAN . EVERYBODY sits down . ) AUGUST Let me go out into the street at least . Let me at least be there to welcome her . ERNEST You 're excited . You might slip and fall , or knock somebody down who is innocent and does not know what 's happened . Sit down . She 'll be here . Music and dancing . PL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a BURLESQUE COMIC , in baggy pants , stands in the doorway . AUGUST Who 's that ? Where is she ? Two more BURLESQUE COMICS come in , and with them is BECKY . p. 49 ERNEST ( With relief ) There she is , man . For God 's sake , you had me frightened.AUGUST gets up and walks toward BECKY . p. 50 Act 2 , Scene 3 Scene III It is a little after two in the morning and everything is still the same , except that everybody has had more to drink . The GYPSY VIOLINIST is putting his violin back into its case . The PIANIST is yawning sleepily . The PLAYER OF THE CIMBALOM is covering the instrument . PL is asleep on his folded arms . His WOMAN is standing over him . Every now and then she taps him gently on the shoulder . The WAITER is standing politely in a corner . The GYPSY GIRL is the least changed . She appears to be still troubled about ERNEST and the three cards he selected three months ago : Death , Gayety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his woman , STELLA , looks at him sleepily . AUGUST and BECKY have their arms around one another . COLONEL HUGHMAN is holding the hand of his woman , ELINORE . The THREE BURLESQUE COMICS sit quietly . The THREE GYPSY MUSICIANS put on their hats and coats , and , bowing , leave the restaurant . PAL 'S WOMAN ( Whispering ) Pl , Pl ! He does not answer . She taps him gently on the shoulder . The WAITER takes off his white coat and puts on his street coat and his hat . He turns off several of the strong lights . ERNEST What 's this ? What 's this ? WAITER ( Politely ) It 's closing time , sir . p. 51 ERNEST Closing time ? But we are all so peaceful at last . Surely you 're not asking us to go ? WAITER Oh , no , sir . You may stay as long as you like , but the restaurant is closed . The door is locked . We can not serve anything more to drink , but there is food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will put up again if you wish , although it is the custom to dim them when we are closed . ERNEST We will abide by the custom . WAITER The watchman is in the kitchen , and will stay all night . He is a simple man , by name Kochanek , and a good cook . ERNEST Kochanek ? WAITER He will come when you call . He will let you out when you wish to go . ( Pause , smiling ) May I say goodnight , sir ? I thank you for remembering our humble place , and I wish you good fortune . ERNEST I thank you , sir . Goodnight . WAITER ( Bowing ) Goodnight . ( To the OTHERS , bowing ) Goodnight . EVERYBODY bows , and one of the BURLESQUE COMICS gets to his feet to make a real bow , his face very serious and sad . The WAITER goes to PL , and without a moment 's hesitation , almost shouts at him , shaking him . p. 52 WAITER ( Speaking in Hungarian ) Pl , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up now ! ( PL looks up , in a stupor . The WAITER very kindly slaps him awake ) Awake , now  --  awake , Pl Szent-Gyorgyi ! ( PL smiles ) That 's it  --  that 's it ! ( The WAITER turns to the OTHER , and speaks in English ) Excuse me . We are friends from boyhood , from the same town in Hungary  --  almost brothers . His wife is my sister . Every night it is like this . He sits and drinks , then goes to sleep . I wake him up and together we go home . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Listens , smiling ) You bet  --  Pl Szent-Gyorgyi ! That 's me ! Christian man . ( He gets up proudly and spreads himself out . He is almost a giant ) Ho ha  --  ha ! ha ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ha ! You bet . ( He stretches ) Pl  --  ( He spreads his arms out , and embraces his WOMAN and the WAITER in one big embrace , and kisses them BOTH ) Hey  --  my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ! I love you ! ( He squeezes his WOMAN and his friend ) Ho ha  --  Szent-Gyorgyi , Christian man  --  ! ( He releases the WOMAN and the WAITER. ) p. 53 WAITER ( The WAITER turns to the OTHERS ) He is the strongest man I know . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Putting on his overcoat ) You bet . ( He comes over to ERNEST ; looks at him strangely , smiling ) You soldier now . ( He kisses ERNEST on the forehead ) Good-bye , my friend ! ERNEST Good-bye , Pl . PL puts his arms around his WOMAN and the WAITER , and together they go . SZENT-GYORGYI Soldier die quick , soldier die good ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ! Soldier die best , ha , ha , ha , ha ! There is a strange silence now , for a moment , ERNEST watches the GYPSY GIRL , who is standing in her place , as if the evening were just beginning . ERNEST ( Calling ) Kochanek  --  Kochanek ! KOCHANEK ( An old man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is smiling pleasantly ) I am Kochanek . ( He bows . ) ERNEST ( Standing ) I called only to see who Kochanek is , and to have Kochanek see who we are . I am Ernest Hughman . ( KOCHANEK nods ) These others are friends . Thank you for coming . ( He sits down , after bowing . KOCHANEK bows , smiling , and returns to the kitchen . ERNEST looks again at the GYPSY GIRL . At last he speaks to her ) What is it ? p. 54 GYPSY GIRL ( Eagerly ) Thank you , sir . I could not speak until spoken to , as that is the rule of my family , but I have been waiting for your permission , and I would have waited all night . ERNEST ( Pleasantly ) But what is it ? You should be home now asleep . It is no pleasure to stand so long . GYPSY GIRL I do not live for pleasure . I live for the truth . ( She moves to the table , with her cards in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not displeased . Please sit down . GYPSY GIRL Thank you . I 'll stand . It is no good to doubt the cards . It is wrong to challenge their truth , but I can not help it . ( Pause ) Will you take your card again ? ERNEST Of course , of course , if you wish . GYPSY GIRL But you must not believe the cards are foolish . They are old and wise , but they are not foolish . It is not right for me to ask you to take your card twice , for no man lives twice , or dies twice . He is born once , and that is the truth of it . He dies once , and that is the end of it . But I am troubled . I am even frightened of what I am doing . I would be humiliated if the truth were told twice . But I do doubt the truth told you by the cards . I do not believe it was you who took the card of Death . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe it was you . Now , even if I am to be humiliated will you take your card again ? I have warned myself  --  but I do not warn you , as this taking is for me only  --  that if you take the card of Death again , if the truth has been the truth  --  well , then I shall not know what to do , as I have lived by the truth of the cards all my life , and hope to die by it . p. 55 ERNEST Do not be uneasy . I do not scoff at any faith , least of all yours , but surely it will be impossible for me to take the same card out of thirty-two twice . GYPSY GIRL For you , I hope it will be impossible , no matter how I shall be humiliated . I hope you do not take the card of Death again . ERNEST I do n't see how I can . It is one of thirty-two . GYPSY GIRL Here . ( She places all of the cards face-up on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thirty-two cards , each with its own name and picture . Only one of them is the card of Death . Here it is . ( She holds it up ) I will put it among the others , and shuffle them all . ( She shuffles the cards ) Now , I will cut them seven times . ( She cuts the cards ) Now , this time do not close your eyes . Look at the cards , and then take one . There will be only one  --  the first . I do not care about the other two . Only one  --  the truth . ( Almost frightened ) Take one , when you are ready . ERNEST ( Looks at the cards , smiling . He reaches out and draws one out a little , then changes his mind ) No , not that one . ( He draws another out ) Nor this one . ( He touches a card , and draws it out swiftly , hitting it down face-up on the table ) This is the one ! EVERYBODY looks at the card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ERNEST curiously , and then at each of the OTHERS . p. 56 GYPSY GIRL ( Softly ) I 'm sorry . Please forgive me . I 'll go home now . ( She turns to go , moving awkwardly . ) ERNEST ( Gently ) You 've left your cards . GYPSY GIRL I do not want them any more . They tell the truth , they tell it well , but I do not want them . ( Softly ) I 'm sorry . Please forgive me . I had no right . ( She goes . ) EVERYBODY sits quietly . One of the BURLESQUE COMICS lifts the card and looks at it . He speaks seriously . GAYETY-COMIC We used to do a sketch with a gypsy girl , and three comics asking to have their fortunes told . Of course what they wanted to know about was life , not death . Would they have a beautiful woman ? Would they have money ? Would they go on a journey ? And so on . We used a regular deck of fortune-telling cards . Something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took . It was only part of the business of the act , to make the people laugh . We each drew one card . At first it did n't make any difference what card it happened to be , but after six or seven performances we got to asking each other what card we had drawn , and then on the last day we got to watching each other 's cards . In twenty-one performances I did n't draw the card of Death once  --  not once . I even wanted to draw it , after awhile . I just wanted to see if I could draw it , but I never did , even though , in the act , I was always the first to take a card . I just could n't draw the card of Death . The three of us were Will Jackson , Sad Joe Hill , and myself . I drew first , Will Jackson second , and Sad Joe Hill third . By the time we got around to watching each other 's cards there were three performances to go . Sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Death three times in a row . He was n't an old man . He was about forty-five , ten years younger than I am , now . He died three days later . That 's the truth , and none of us believe his dying had anything to do with the fortune-telling act , but all the same we never used the act again . I remember the pictures on the cards . They were a good deal like the pictures on these cards , and the picture on the card of Death was exactly like the picture on this card . It was one of those things , but we never used the act again . ( To ERNEST ) I 'd like to tear this card up . Do you mind ? p. 57 ERNEST ( Pleasantly ) Thank you for asking . I 'd like to keep the card , for I drew it from the deck twice . ( Happily ) Wake up , wake up ! You are all too pleased with one another , too happy , or too unhappy ! ( EVERYBODY comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! We 've still a bottle or two . It 's still night , and this is still living . Now  --  this card  --  look at it . ( He shows it around ) Do you see ? It is my card . ( He puts the card in his pocket ) I am not given to the cult of unhappiness , I am not a bitter man , I do not speak in double tongues , I tell you honestly and plainly  --  I am proud of my card . It 's meaning is that I shall die . I shall . If I shall die soon or late is no matter , for I shall not know how soon it was or how late . I leave the city this morning . When it is light again , I shall be among the weary warriors again . After that , I do not know . ( Of AUGUST ) My friend here , my brother , happy at last and soon to be a father  --  for which I thank God  --  will be informed of my death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired of this night , and want our beds . Before we get up and go , I ask a favor of you . No , I charge you with this : to give me a funeral , and a happy one . I will not have any sorrow among you , but if it pleases our friend Pl Szent-Gyorgyi to weep for me , then let him , for he is a strong man , a Christian , and a man with a gift for weeping . ( Pause ) Do you understand ? p. 58 AUGUST How can we have a funeral for you  --  any kind of a funeral  --  when you will not be at the funeral ? ERNEST I do not ask a funeral for my body . I ask a funeral for me  --  Ernest Hughman  --  actor . Myself , but not my body . I charge you with this . You can not refuse . AUGUST But what shall be buried if the body is not there ? ERNEST Bury the casket , and see that it is a handsome one . AUGUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk as that ? ERNEST I am not drunk at all . But here ! Let 's you and I and the Colonel have another glass . ( He pours ) Let us stand and solemnly swear that if I am killed , you will provide me with a happy funeral . Now , let us drink on it . ( They touch glasses and drink ) I am deeply grateful to you . ( Of the COMICS ) These good men , who make people laugh , will perform at my funeral . AUGUST But what will lie in the casket ? ERNEST A living man  --  what else ? It 's to be a happy funeral . You are my brother , and we are of one size  --  when the telegram comes  --  make all arrangements immediately  --  and lie in the casket for me , in formal clothes . Sit up when you please , have a drink , instruct the mourners , the speech-makers or the players . I want music , food , drink , dancing , playing , speeches , mourning , and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course not with you in it . With nothing in it . You must not humor me . You must swear that you will do it , and then you must do it  --  and just as I have said . ( To AUGUST ) Do you swear it ? p. 59 AUGUST ( Shaking his hand ) I do . ERNEST ( Filling his lungs proudly , looking around , smiling ) I thank you , and return now to the War . ( He calls out happily ) Kochanek  --  Kochanek ! ( KOCHANEK appears ) We are ready to go , my friend . KOCHANEK Yes , sir  --  follow me . EVERYBODY follows KOCHANEK and ERNEST , moving slowly . Suddenly the YOUNGEST BURLESQUE COMIC comes back to the table and looks at the cards . He lifts one , then the other , then a good many . Then he puts them all together , shuffles them , cuts them seven times , then very ceremoniously takes a card . He looks at it , is obviously pleased with it , and decides to take another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . They are all wonderful . He puts his three cards back into the deck , puts the deck in his pocket and goes , but as he goes he allows himself to trip and fall in the burlesque comedy manner . He gets right up and goes on. @x It is six months later , and the happy funeral is taking place in the Hungarian Restaurant on a platform which has been built for the purpose . On the platform is a handsome casket , and one of the BURLESQUE COMICS , in the costume of a Priest . On a table are plates of food , bottles , glasses , bowls , and so on . Around the table and near it are many people : PL SZENT-GYORGYI , his WOMAN , COLONEL HUGHMAN , his woman ELINORE , the other TWO BURLESQUE COMICS , in costume : one as Death , the other as Gayety  --  clown , or jester ; the late ERNEST HUGHMAN 'S woman STELLA ; and AUGUST himself , in formal clothes , walking about nervously . The GYPSY TRIO is playing Pragnienie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in loneliness . The WAITER is serving everybody . DEATH-COMIC ( Opening and closing a book , and rolling out a yo-yo ) My friends , I do not have to tell you the reason for this happy occasion . We have all read the telegram . Ernest Hughman is gone , and in accordance with his own wishes we are here to celebrate his exit . August Hughman , his friend  --  his brother almost  --  is here , and in his person , in the absence of the person of his brother , shall occupy the casket when the ceremony begins . Unfortunately August Hughman 's wife Becky  --  whom we all know and love  --  is not here , having been called away last night three minutes after the arrival of the telegram . She was called away by one who is also not here in person , but shall be any minute now . I refer to a man ( or woman ) we do not know yet  --  one who is still unknown , in person , even to his own mother , and more so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we celebrate the departure of a man we all know , and love , we also celebrate the arrival of one we do not yet know , but love just the same . We are out of touch with the friend who has gone , but we are not altogether out of touch with the friend who is coming in  --  or out , as the case may be . We do not know about these things and the man gone may be the one who is arriving , while the one coming in may be the one who is leaving . It is the custom on an occasion such as this for everybody to cry , even though  --  if the circumstance is a sorrowful one , and we are not sure that it is or is not  --  the man who should be most saddened by it is the one who is dead ; but he can not enjoy the sorrow , or whatever is right and fitting for him to enjoy , or not . Therefore , since the man himself is not here to be sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be sorry , and insofar as it is in our natures to be happily inclined we must be so inclined now , and if possible more so inclined than ever . The only two men who might tell us whether it is sad or joyous to leave here , or to arrive , are speechless , and yet they alone have departed and arrived  --  or will arrive soon . We respect their silence humbly , and do not urge them to try to break it , since if they did we might be confused . That is to say , if they broke their silence and told us what we do not know , we might be so pleased to have once arrived as to find leaving unbearable , or so displeased as to wish to leave immediately . But fortunately both of our friends are speechless , one permanently , the other temporarily , and we are grateful to them for it . If departure is an occasion for sorrow , then arrival is also an occasion for sorrow  --  but we have decided among ourselves  --  even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world  --  that this is not an occasion for sorrow , but an occasion for happiness , and therefore arrival is also an occasion for happiness . However , if there are any here who wish to weep  --  for any reason  --  their tears will be accepted with gratitude . It is not necessary for them to weep only for the man gone  --  they shall not be asked why they weep , and it will not matter if they do so because he has gone , and not they ; or because they shall some day go ; or because they enjoy weeping ; or because it is all so confusing . Any kind of mourning will be gratefully accepted , as it is a kind of happiness for the mourner . Now , it is not my purpose to tire you with talk , but to set the stage , so to speak , for the ceremony itself . First , more food and drink for each of you  --  but with music . ( The GYPSY TRIO begins playing , and EVERYBODY eats and drinks happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The time has come for the casket to be occupied . ( Calling ) Mr. Hughman  --  the casket ! p. 61 AUGUST ( Confused , worried ) The casket ? It 's there beside you . DEATH-COMIC Yes , but the time has come for the casket to be occupied . AUGUST Occupied ? DEATH-COMIC Yes , you are to lie in the casket for everyone to see , and after that you are to sit up and watch the celebration , or to instruct the players and the speakers . AUGUST Is it time already ? I do n't know what 's happened . Is she all right ? Is the Infant all right ? DEATH-COMIC We are in touch , and shall be promptly informed . This is the immediate matter . Will you lie down in the casket , please , so that we may proceed ? AUGUST ( Going onto the platform ) I must be informed promptly . I can not just lie in the casket forever . ( He stands in the opening of the casket , then wiggles himself into it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately . DEATH-COMIC You shall be told . Now , please lie down , so that everyone may walk to the casket , look at you , and pass by . AUGUST I would like no dawdling , please , and no questions , if possible . DEATH-COMIC You must be gracious , even though you are on the verge of becoming a father . It is not our intention to tell anyone how he shall enjoy this celebration . Please lie down . p. 62 AUGUST It is very warm in here . DEATH-COMIC It is furnished better than most homes . Lie down , please . AUGUST Very well . ( He lies down and disappears . ) DEATH-COMIC Now , then . The time has come to look into the casket . We have all done so before , and we have always been shocked that what has been in it has been dead , not alive . Now , we shall not be shocked , for while the house is warm and narrow , the man who inhabits it is himself warmer and a little narrower . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime tonight he shall take it off  --  and perhaps a bath . Now , then , one at a time , please  --  come up and look into the casket . It is now occupied . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN ( Goes up onto the platform to the casket , stands looking down into it ) You do not look as well as many I have seen . AUGUST ( Sitting up ) Why should I look well ? My wife is about to become a mother . I am about to become a father . Between the two of us , another is about to come along and breathe . But will he breathe ? That 's the question . Will the Infant breathe ? All infants have done so . They have all waited until the right moment and then they have breathed , but suppose this one does not breathe ? Suppose he changes his mind ? Suppose he refuses to take a breath ? What then ? Where am I , then ? Where is she ? And where is the Infant ? p. 63 COLONEL JOSEPH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need n't fret about that . Why would n't he breathe ? AUGUST I am a stubborn man , and once when I was angry I did not eat for a week . I was seven years old , and refused to eat . Suppose the Infant comes along angry and decides he does n't want any part of it ? I 'm a stubborn man , and he 's my son . Suppose he decides he would much rather stay put ? What then ? Where am I ? COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN My son , the Infant will breathe . He wo n't know any better . He will burst into tears the moment he feels the cold pressure of air upon his skin , and the swift rush of open space upon his ear-drums . Once he starts bawling , he 'll be breathing , and then it 's all over  --  he 's born , he 's here , he 's alive , and God love him , he 's human . AUGUST Suppose he chooses not to cry ? Suppose he decides it 's all nonsense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bother ? He might , you know . I 'm a stubborn man and never saw much sense to it  --  until now  --  and now the only thing I want is for him to burst into tears , so I can burst into tears , too  --  and be glad . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN Lie down , lie down  --  he 'll burst into tears all right . I did and you did , and who would n't ? Just lie down and rest . He 's not going to be the first man to enter the world . There have been other entrances . Lie down  --  you do not look well  --  but you are alive , I 'll say that . AUGUST lies down , the COLONEL moves away , and steps down from the platform . The late Ernest Hughman 's woman , STELLA , now steps to the casket and looks down . She looks long and painfully , then begins to cry . AUGUST sits up . p. 64 AUGUST Stella ! What are you crying about ? I 'm the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain  --  the Infant 's the one who 's supposed to cry . What are you crying about ? STELLA It is so beautiful , so beautiful ! AUGUST Beautiful ? What 's beautiful about it ? Have you ever been a mother ? No . Have you ever been a father ? No . Then how can you cry ? How can you say it 's beautiful ? STELLA I do n't know  --  but it is , it is . I have never seen anything so beautiful . You look beautiful . AUGUST I look beautiful . STELLA Yes , you look like Ernest , ten years ago . I remember him in Hamlet . You look exactly as he looked then . He was younger , and the best Hamlet of all  --  everybody said so . He was so beautiful and troubled  --  and he said his lines so clearly . Lie down again so I can see him as he was then , ten years younger , and full of Hamlet 's brooding , just as you are . Please lie down again . ( AUGUST @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bursts into tears again , shaking her head from side to side ) It 's so beautiful ! I was twenty-three then , and he was thirty-three . ( AUGUST sits up and looks at her ) They said my Ophelia was the best ever , too . It was only ten years ago . p. 65 AUGUST Stella , you 're a woman ! You understand such things . It 's in your blood . How is she ? Is she all right ? Is she going to be able to make it all right ? STELLA ( Weeping ) Everybody died in Hamlet , and now  --  ( She is overcome . ) AUGUST Stella , how is she ? Is she going to be all right ? ( Shout- ing to the PRIEST-COMIC ) Has no word come ? Is the Infant breathing ? DEATH-COMIC Be patient  --  be patient ! A man is not made in a moment . His making takes as long as the making of a mountain of rock . He is not to be rushed , but will come along in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be patient . We 'll bring you the news when it comes . AUGUST Stella , you 're a woman . How is she ? STELLA Lie down and let me have one last look at Ernest in Hamlet . Farewell , farewell ! She almost forces AUGUST down . She looks at him tenderly , turns away , sobbing , moves along , and then steps down off the platform . The next to come to the casket is the BURLESQUE COMIC who represents Death . He is dressed in Death 's white robe , but he acts like what he is : a burlesque comic . DEATH-COMIC What 's this ? A man ? What happened , fellow  --  died ? p. 66 AUGUST ( Sitting up ) Not yet , but I 've got a good start . Have you ever been a father ? DEATH-COMIC I ? A father . I 've been Father and Mother , both . AUGUST ( Shouting ) Has no word come ? Is there no message yet ? DEATH-COMIC Message ? ( He raps his knuckles on the casket ) There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raps ) Hear that ? Wood  --  all wood , and good for ten years , if the man inside could count them . AUGUST I 've got to know what 's happened Is he breathing yet ? That 's the question . DEATH-COMIC If it 's breathing you want to hear , hear this . ( He breathes deeply , holds it , then exhales ) There 's breathing for you . Inhale . ( He inhales ) Exhale . ( He exhales ) I 've a cold in my lungs , but even so I still breathe . AUGUST Not you , the Infant , the Infant ! DEATH-COMIC I was the Infant . I was the Infant in my day , and breathed , and having breathed breathe still . Listen . ( He breathes fast and furious ) Have you heard better breathing ? That is my best breathing , and it is still the Infant doing it . Lie down now , fellow , lie down . AUGUST lies down . The DEATH-COMIC passes by and steps down off the platform . The next to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She nods to AUGUST politely . He sits up . p. 67 AUGUST Why do you greet me ? ELINORE ( Cheerfully , as if it were a game at a pleasant party ) Oh , I know you 're not dead . I was n't born yesterday , you know . AUGUST I know , I know , and I wish the Infant had been . ELINORE Why , it 's as plain as the nose on your face that you 're not dead . Who ever heard of a dead man sitting up and talking ? AUGUST Who said I was dead ? I 'm simply waiting for the Infant , that 's all . ELINORE But it 's all so simple , I do n't see how you expect to fool anyone . But why is n't Ernest here ? AUGUST He could n't come . ELINORE ( Laughing ) Oh , nonsense . Why is n't Ernest here ? AUGUST ( Shouting ) Somebody tell the woman why Ernest is n't here . What I want to know is why the Infant is n't here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ma'am , because he 's there . ELINORE Where ? DEATH-COMIC Wherever they go when they go , and where that is I do n't know . p. 68 ELINORE He was a soldier , I know , but they give them furloughs , do n't they ? DEATH-COMIC If they find them , and if there 's time , they do . ELINORE Is Ernest lost ? DEATH-COMIC The telegram does n't say . It only says he 's dead . ELINORE Dead ? What do you mean ? DEATH-COMIC He 's dead , and I do n't know what I mean . ELINORE Why , what in the world are you talking about ? DEATH-COMIC I do n't know , Ma'am . ELINORE ( Gaily , delighted ) This is such fun , and so original . But you 're not dead ! AUGUST ( Bitterly ) How do you know ? ELINORE ( Laughing ) I know , I know . One can tell . Anybody could get into a casket  --  I could myself  --  you 're not dead . AUGUST Have you ever been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling , would n't it ? Ask me no questions  --  ( She laughs gaily )  --  and I 'll tell you no lies . ( Seriously , in her own fine way ) But I do wish Ernest would stop his hiding and come and enjoy the fun . ( To the PRIEST-COMIC ) Where is the boy ? p. 69 DEATH-COMIC It is not a question of where , Ma'am , but what . And the answer to that is not worth giving . ELINORE What is he ? What is Ernest ? Why , everyone knows he 's an actor . DEATH-COMIC And where does he act ? ELINORE Ernest has appeared in New York , Boston , Philadelphia , Baltimore , Chicago , San Francisco , and dozens of other cities . He acts where his play is , or goes . DEATH-COMIC And where is his play ? Where has it gone ? ELINORE He left the theatre for a moment , to enlist in the Army . COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN ( Seriously ) My dear , Ernest was killed . This is his funeral , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELINORE ( Laughing , then stopping ) I do n't understand . AUGUST ( To the PRIEST-COMIC ) Show her the telegram . ( The PRIEST-COMIC goes to ELINORE quickly with the telegram . ) ELINORE ( Holding the telegram but not reading it ) What does this mean ? p. 70 DEATH-COMIC This  --  this piece of paper  --  is the Official Announcement of the man 's death . Official  --  and final ! There . Read the words .  --  Killed in action . ELINORE Killed in action ? What sort of action ? DEATH-COMIC Soldier action , I suppose , although , as he was an actor , it might have been the action of acting . He might have been bowing at the time . The announcement does not give details . It simply says , in Biblical language , that he was killed in action three weeks ago . ELINORE Ernest ? DEATH-COMIC Ernest was his name alive , Ernest it is dead . ( He takes the telegram , goes and stands behind the pulpit with the book on it , the toy horn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every now and then he bounces . ) ELINORE ( Sincerely troubled ) I 'm sure I enjoy the spirit of this pleasant party , but  --  ( Her voice cracks )  --  I 'm afraid you are not playing fair . You are withholding something from me . What is it ? AUGUST ( Impatiently ) Ernest is dead . We are withholding nothing . You are withholding . He 's dead , and unless I die of worry first , I am about to become a father . p. 71 ELINORE ( Her lips trembling ) You mean Ernest is actually dead ? AUGUST As actually as actually can be . ELINORE ( She looks around , tears in her eyes ) I think you 're all horrid . I despise every one of you  --  to carry on in such a fashion . ( She begins to cry ) I 'm ashamed of myself , laughing at a time like this . You 've tricked me . I did n't know , I did n't know . ( Pathetically ) I 'm going to faint . DEATH-COMIC ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The DEATH-COMIC rushes onto the platform and stands behind ELINORE , with his arms open , ready to catch her . She turns and gives him a dirty look . ELINORE ( With anger ) Go away , you silly thing ! Do n't stand behind me  --  with your arms open . You are from burlesque , but I am from the theatre . How dare you stand behind me ? DEATH-COMIC What 's this ? I come to catch her as she falls . She turns and mocks my kind intention . ( Politely ) Will you faint , Madam ? ELINORE I 'll box your ears !  --  that 's what I 'll do if you try any of your low comic tricks on me . Your theatre and mine are as far apart as hell and heaven , and your play and mine are as different as sin and innocence . Now , go away  --  go away  --  do n't tease me any more . ( To AUGUST ) I am ashamed of you  --  ashamed ! To sit in such a place when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but you especially . p. 72 AUGUST It was his own wish . He made me swear to give this funeral . I received the telegram last right . I did n't know he would be killed  --  I believed he would n't  --  and I did n't know when the telegram would come  --  but I had given my word . The telegram came exactly when the Infant began his coming . If I had known the two were to happen together , I would not have promised . How can I be happy  --  when I am here for him , not for myself , and should be where the Infant 's coming in , and where its mother is allowing him  --  or , I hope  --  urging him to come in ? ( To the PRIEST-COMIC ) No word yet ? DEATH-COMIC Soon , now , soon ! I 've told you . It takes time . ( To ELINORE ) Madam , you are holding up the parade . Look , and pass by , as the custom is . ELINORE I despise you all ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poor sweet Ernest ! COLONEL JOSEPH HUGHMAN ( The COLONEL helps her down from the platform ) Now , now ! You must n't take it hard , for after all he died for you and me . ELINORE ( Bitterly ) I do n't care ! I do n't care what he died for ! You 're all swine , and I 'm going to faint ( She faints into the COLONEL 'S arms . He drags her away. ) p. 73 DEATH-COMIC ( Working the yo-yo ) All right , now , let 's keep it moving . Let the next mourner move along . Hurry , now . ( To AUGUST ) And you , sir , lie down . The next person to come up onto the platform is PL SZENTGYORGYI . He looks into the casket at AUGUST , then stretches himself out , getting very big . SZENT-GYORGYI Zlodziej , zlodziej ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ha ! ( He becomes limp with sorrow , and grows almost small , looking into the casket , fascinated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almost shouting ) Pl Szent-Gyorgyi lift him ! ( He reaches into the casket and lifts AUGUST up ) Christian man no die . Pl lift him up ! AUGUST No , no , Pl ! I must stay here until the ceremony is over . SZENT-GYORGYI No  --  no ! Pl fight smierc . Nobody die if Pl fight . ( He tugs at AUGUST . ) AUGUST Take him away  --  take him away ! The THREE COMICS fall on PL , who struggles with them . His WOMAN hurries to him . He stops struggling to look at her . PAL 'S WOMAN ( Softly ) Pl ! , Pl ! PL nods several times sadly . The COMICS release him . He puts his arms around his WOMAN and the DEATH-COMIC . AUGUST lies down in the casket and disappears . PL moves with the other two closer to the casket , and looks down a good long time . Then he looks at his wife , then at the DEATH-COMIC , then back into the casket , then at his wife . He kisses her on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him on the forehead . p. 74 DEATH-COMIC What 's this ? A kiss ? SZENT-GYORGYI ( Releasing his WOMAN and the DEATH-COMIC , turning to the ORCHESTRA ) Pragnienie , Pragnienie ! ( The music begins immediately , and PL dances ) Ho ha  --  ha ha ha ! Christian man no die ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ha ! ( He suddenly takes his WOMAN by the hand and they dance together . He then holds his free hand out to the DEATH-COMIC , who takes his hand and joins the dance ) Ho ha  --  ha ha ! Pragnienie , Pragnienie ! Woman  --  my friend ! Smierc  --  my friend ! Woman  --  I love ! Smierc  --  I love ! Ho ha  --  ha ha ! ( The music stops . The dance ends . The DEATH-COMIC goes off with PL 'S WOMAN for a drink . PL turns to AUGUST ) How you feel ? AUGUST I 'm worried , Pl ! Nothing like this has ever happened to me before . I 'd feel fine if I knew the Infant were breathing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know anything . They 've sent no message . I do n't know how I feel . I 've never been a father before , and they wo n't tell me if I 'm a father now . SZENT-GYORGYI You gon na be fodder ? AUGUST I hope to be . Everything is ordered for it , and the time has come , but the message hasn't. p. 75 SZENT-GYORGYI Why you sit in box ? AUGUST To help make the funeral a happy one , as my brother wished it to be . SZENT-GYORGYI Your brother  --  who ? AUGUST Ernest Hughman  --  you remember , do n't you ? SZENT-GYORGYI Soldier ? AUGUST Yes , Pl . SZENT-GYORGYI Soldier die ? AUGUST Yes , Pl . SZENT-GYORGYI Where soldier die ? AUGUST The telegram does not say . It 's a military secret , but he died somewhere in the War . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Angry ) War got no secret . War no good . War murder baby . War murder young man . War kill Christian man . War murder Jesus . Pl no believe in War . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , O little baby ! Come to bad world and live for Pl . ( He makes a cross of his body , and his face becomes deeply pained ) Then baby  --  smiling baby  --  die for Pl ! Baby come with love , but War murder baby , send him back . Hey hoh  --  baby , sweet baby ! ( He turns away and steps down off the platform ) Hey hoh , hey hoh ! p. 76 DEATH-COMIC ( Bounces tennis ball ) Come along , come along . Who 's next ? AUGUST Send the Gypsy Girl ! Maybe she can tell me if the Infant breathes now . DEATH-COMIC ( Blows the toy horn ) Gypsy Girl ! To the casket , please . ( To AUGUST ) Lie down , now . AUGUST lies down . The GYPSY GIRL goes to the casket and looks down at AUGUST . AUGUST sits up . AUGUST Is the Infant breathing ? Where are your cards ? GYPSY GIRL I have left them . They tell the truth , but I do not like their manner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one sort or another , but I do not like the way the cards tell the truth . I tell fortunes no more . I am waiting to learn if any sort of telling of the truth is good . I do not know . Perhaps it would be best to leave it all untold . AUGUST Whatever is best is no matter to me now . Only tell me is the Infant breathing , is the Mother sleeping peacefully ? GYPSY GIRL Two things are most alike of all , and yet most unalike  --  that is why I have left the cards , and do not know if with them I should also leave the search for truth . Two things : coming and going . To come is to begin going , and therefore the same as going . I 've left the cards . I can not answer anything . p. 77 GAYETY-COMIC ( Leaps onto the platform ) Here are the cards . I 've kept them six months , but the card of Death is not among them , it is with the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free now of Death  --  and tell the troubled man if the Infant breathes , the Mother sleeps . Here . Take the cards . He thrusts the cards out to the GYPSY GIRL . She looks at them , somewhat angry with herself and angry at the cards , and yet somehow deeply tempted to take them back  --  without Death  --  to see if now their way of telling the truth may be better . The GAYETY-COMIC waits , watching her , then speaks . GAYETY-COMIC Take them ! You are old friends , and want each other . I can see that you do , and that you need each other . So here they are . I 've saved them for you . Take them , shuffle them , and ask the man to take his card . Death is not in them now . Death has served its purpose , and can not serve it again . Tell the man what he wishes to know . Is the Infant breathing ? Here . Take the cards . ( The GYPSY GIRL takes the cards ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pretty , too . I have never believed in Gypsies , or in telling any fortune but my own , but if you are a Gypsy , and not simply another pretty girl ; and if you must tell the fortunes of other people , and leave your own untold , then take the cards and be what you prefer , and tell what you must . I believe in nothing more alarming than the kiss , and want no other fortune . Since this is so , and I have kept the cards for you , and restored them to you  --  no longer made impure by the presence of Death  --  then I deserve a confirmation of my own faith  --  or , in other words , a kiss ! p. 78 GYPSY GIRL You are a  --  GAYETY-COMIC Wait , wait ! I do not want my fortune told , other than its greatest end , or beginning : a kiss with you . ( He thrusts out his head ) You will not refuse . It would be unholy . ( He pushes out a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth ) You 've very little distance to go . But if you make the journey , do not make it in poverty . Come down to my country with all the sweetness of your nation . And do not come for a tiny visit , but stay awhile . The GYPSY GIRL makes the journey and stays a good long while . The GAYETY-COMIC lifts a foot backward slowly , relishing the wondrous flavor of wealth and good fortune , holds the foot suspended there as if it were holding the swift-passing delight , finally brings the foot down again , stirs a hand out in space , rises up slowly , and soon instead of being under the GYPSY GIRL he is over her . Then he puts his arms around her , and moves with the kiss from the realm of the allegorical to the realm of the real , or at any rate the realm of no fooling . The GYPSY GIRL struggles womanfully , but the GAYETY-COMIC has got her well  --  tricked or not tricked  --  and holds her until she struggles no more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about her . Then the GAYETY-COMIC breaks it up , stands back , nods smartly , as if to say , O.K. p. 79 GAYETY-COMIC Now , I would thee wed . Would thee wed me ? AUGUST For God 's sake , I am wed and nearly a father . Ask her later . ( He looks at the GYPSY GIRL ) She would thee wed  --  or should  --  but now , first , let her tell me the story of my fatherhood , if so it is . ( To the GYPSY GIRL ) Tell me , tell me ! Am I a Father ? Is the Infant here ? Is he breathing ? Is the Mother sleeping ? Shall I step out of this box and be delighted with the joy of it all ? GAYETY-COMIC You rush me , man ! You 've had your wedding , and your wife , give another clown a chance . We are all brothers , are n't we ? I 'd like to suffer fatherhood myself . ( To the GYPSY GIRL ) Wouldst suffer motherhood , whilst I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . ( Suddenly , after riffling the cards in her hands ) Take a card . GAYETY-COMIC Good God , I asked you , not the cards . I would not wed them , for their kiss is dry . I seek yours to carry me straight through next winter 's snow . AUGUST ( Impatiently ) Take a card , take a card ! It 's sure to be a lucky one  --  or one she 'll say is lucky  --  or lucky enough . Take any card . It 'll do . At a time like hers , any card will be the holy one . Just take it , and let her tell my story , too . I 'm dying , while you come to life . p. 80 GAYETY-COMIC What can the cards tell me that I do n't know ? I want her through all winter , do n't I ? ( To the GYPSY GIRL ) Here . Give me the cards . I 'll be the fortune-teller . You have your fortune told . It 's time you did , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which is a number not to take lightly . GAYETY-COMIC I 'll take it heavily and lightly both , as you prefer . It is truly a number , and it 's seldom given . Give me the cards and I 'll tell your fortune . ( He almost takes the cards out of her hands . He fools with them , looks upon them with a smile , since he knows them all , front or back ) Close your eyes , now . Here . Take your choice ! It 's sure to be me ! He has pushed a card out beyond the others . The GYPSY GIRL takes this card , looks at it and smiles . AUGUST What card is it ? GAYETY-COMIC Look at her . Are you blind ? AUGUST No . Only half-dead . What card is it ? GAYETY-COMIC It 's my card . I do n't have to look at the card . I know it 's mine . ( To the GYPSY GIRL ) Tell him . GYPSY GIRL It is . The cards tell the truth , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here . The Lover . In this corner , the red heart . Here , standing , the man with the sword . Here on the table beside him , the red rose . It is his card . p. 81 GAYETY-COMIC ( Cockily ) Take another card . ( The GYPSY GIRL does so ) Tell him what the second card is . GYPSY GIRL ( Happily , amazed ) It is my card . The Loved One . The twin of his card . Here in this corner , the red heart again . Here , standing , the woman with the book of life in her hands . And there on the pedestal the monument of naked love , with the empty bow . GAYETY-COMIC There , you see ? ( Swiftly ) Take another card . ( The GYPSY GIRL does so ) Now , tell him what the third card is . GYPSY GIRL ( Almost solemnly ) It is Marriage . Here , on their knees , holding hands , are the man and the woman of the first two cards , before the Priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cross , the window , and the burning candles . AUGUST ( Impatiently ) That 's fine , but what about me ? GAYETY-COMIC Take another card . Take them all , one at a time . They 'll come out fine , in perfect order . My name is Joe . GYPSY GIRL No . Three is all . Three cards tell everything . My name is Mary . p. 82 AUGUST ( Impatiently ) Mary , tell me is the Infant breathing ? GYPSY GIRL It is . GAYETY-COMIC I , Joe , take thee , Mary That 's it . It 's done now . AUGUST ( Excited ) Wait a minute , wait a minute ! Have your marriage ceremony later ! Mary , what did you say ? Is the Infant breathing ? GYPSY GIRL It is . It is now breathing . AUGUST How do you know ? I did n't take a card . GYPSY GIRL I know . The message is on its way ! You will see . AUGUST Are you sure ? How did you find out ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breathe when I stopped breathing in the kiss . AUGUST Did you stop breathing ? GAYETY-COMIC She did , and so did I. We almost died . AUGUST Mary , is this true ? GYPSY GIRL It is ! The message is on its way . You will see . AUGUST And how is the Mother ? Is she sleeping peacefully ? GYPSY GIRL She is well and happy , deep in the living sleep . p. 83 AUGUST And the Infant , is it man or woman ? GYPSY GIRL It is man , but like himself from first of all , it is man , born of woman . AUGUST ( Almost delirious with relief ) I feel weak . ( He looks up ) I thank God . The Infant is here , the Mother sleeps , the Father  --  ( He falls back into the casket . ) The GYPSY TRIO hurries to the casket , and look down at AUGUST , crowding one another . VIOLINIST He is a father now . Look at him . He 's fainted . GYPSY GIRL It 's nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return soon . Let him stay with her a moment . He will sit up soon . Play a happy song . The GYPSY TRIO go back to their places and begin playing Pragnienie , Pragnienie . There is singing , dancing , eating and drinking . In the midst of the gaiety , a TELEGRAPH MESSENGER comes in . He stands bewildered a moment , watching and listening . PL hands him a drink , which the YOUNG MAN swallows . PL takes his hand and drags the MESSENGER into the dance . EVERYBODY is happy . The music stops . MESSENGER ( Officially ) Telegram for August Hughman . AUGUST Where am I ? ( AUGUST sits up in the coffin ) What 's happened ? Did somebody call out my name ? p. 84 MESSENGER Correction . Two telegrams for August Hughman . AUGUST ( Looking at the MESSENGER ) I am August Hughman , I believe . MESSENGER I have two telegrams for you . He goes to AUGUST and hands him the two telegrams . AUGUST opens one with shaking hands . SZENT-GYORGYI What is message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a seven-pound man . I do not know what this one says . GAYETY-COMIC Read it , read it , and tell us . AUGUST opens telegram and reads it . He falls back into the coffin , and the telegram drops to the floor . The GAYETY-COMIC picks it up and reads it . SZENT-GYORGYI What 's message ? What 's message ? GAYETY-COMIC ( With importance ) My friends , I have a most happy message for you . The man whose funeral we are celebrating is not dead . He is alive . SZENT-GYORGYI ( Shouting ) Christian man no die ! Christian man no die ! PL Szent-Gyorgyi fight smierc , keep Christian man alive ! GAYETY-COMIC ( Continuing ) The message says that he was lost , but has been found . He was found in a small part in an Army play . The message does not say where he is now , but wherever he is , he is alive . ( To the GYPSY TRIO ) Music , please . p. 85 AUGUST ( Sits up ) Get me out of this terrible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the casket to his feet )
