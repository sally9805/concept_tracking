Architect Frank Lloyd Wright , 77 , dislikes buildings " all dressed up in military fashion , heels together , eyes front . . . . " He makes his houses lie flat on the ground and stretch out . To his followers , the old master is a modern Michelangelo whose sculptures can be lived in . <P> Wright 's latest , a country house for wealthy stockbroker Gerald Loeb , has yet to be built , but a 6 ft. by 12 ft. model went on view last week in Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art . Designed for a barren hilltop , the Loeb house was to be as low , flat and full of wrinkles as an unmade Japanese bed . <P> Wright laid out a jigsaw puzzle of pierced roofs , gardens , lawns , curving walls and pools . The circular swimming pool , hollowed out around the edge , has columns under water as well as above , enclosing a glassed-in submarine gaxden . Said Wright : " The average swimming pool looks to me like a glorified bathtub . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chimney : a vertical window through which Loeb would be able to watch the smoke and flame from his hearth , ascending like mercury in a thermometer . The bedrooms , designed to be dark , had no window except a narrow band of glass around the roof-edge . They were circular , air-conditioned " sleeping turrets , " cork-lined for added coziness . <P> The neighbors in Redding , Conn , are already muttering that Loeb 's horizontal hideaway will not fit in with their colonial-style mansions , but Loeb confidently expects it to be far better suited to " modern Connecticut living " than theirs . <P> A money-wise , 52-year-old bachelor , Loeb recently toured the Midwest to see Wright 's houses for himself . He admits that the temperamental old architect 's notions are sometimes impractical in small ways , but thinks that living in a Wright-designed house will be worth a little inconvenience . Says Loeb happily : " Wright is good and he knows he 's good . "                 @ @ @ @
