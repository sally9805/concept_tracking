The supply problem is a double edged one for the hotels . It not only means an impaired efficiency in their operations but it raises a tax question . On the basis of their higher earnings the hotels are subject to rising Federal income levies .

Built in High-Price Period The heavy tax burden that hotels bear is one reason their finances have been so strained in the past decade But in back of that is the high-price-level period in which they were built , Take the Lexington Hotel in New York City , for instance . It opened in October . 1929 . The $6,309.000 that went into It was raised by sale of $3,900,000 of first mortgage 8% A bonds , $600,000 of First Mortgage 7% B Bonds , $650.000 of General Mortgage 7% Bonds . $814 , - 000 of 6 ? debentures , $175,000 of 6% notes and $170,000 from unsecured , creditors .
