Prokofiev : Scythian Suite ( Chicago Symphony Orchestra , Desire Defauw conducting ; Victor , 6 sides ) , Piano Sonata No. 7 ( Vladimir Horowitz ; Victor , 4 sides ) . Two good and noisy pieces by Russia 's greatest contemporary . The earlier Scythian Suite ( composed for a Diaghilev ballet in 1914 ) comes out better than the recent ( 1942 ) Sonata . Both are recorded for the first time in the U.S. Performance : good . <P> Stravinsky : The Song of the Nightingale ( Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra , Eugene Goossens conducting ; Victor , 5 sides ) . The Emperor of Japan 's mechanical nightingale outsings the Emperor of China 's live one , but breaks down in the attempt . When Stravinsky composed it in 1909 , no political moral was intended . Performance : good . <P> Bizet : Carmen ( Rise Stevens , Nadine Conner , Raoul Jobin and Robert Weede , with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra , George Sebastian conducting ; Columbia , 10 sides ) . A pedestrian presentation , in which the best efforts are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Song . Performance : fair . <P> Vincent d'lndy : Istar , Symphonic Variations ( San Francisco Symphony Orchestra , Pierre Monteux conducting ; Victor , 3 sides ) . A strip tease on records . The theme of the score comes only after seven variations have been played , to indicate that the Babylonian maid , Istar , has just thrown off her final veil . Performance : lush . <P> Ferde Grof : Grand Canyon Suite ( NBC Symphony Orchestra , Arturo Toscanini conducting ; Victor , 8 sides ) . One of the maestro 's favorites , much to the consternation of highbrows who wish he would n't bother . He gives it the works . Performance : excellent . <P> Hot Jazz ( Bunk Johnson and his New Orleans Band ; Victor , 8 sides ) . Old Bunk 's trumpet leads the choir in When the Saints Go Marching In and A Closer Walk with Thee , then turns secular in Franklin Street Blues and I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate . Clarinetist George Lewis and Trombonist James Robinson step high on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stella Brooks ; Disc , 6 sides ) . A little ( 109 Ibs. ) white gal with a blue voice sings the naughty colored lyrics of West End , Jazz Me ( " Come On Professor " ) and other New Orleans classics . Background music by Hot Trumpeter Frankie Newton and five others makes these real collectors ' blues . Performance : good .
