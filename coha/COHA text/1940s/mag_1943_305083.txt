From Winston Churchill 's private secretary went a polite reply : " Mr. Churchill regrets that he is unable to accept the honor . . . .

" <P> Unofficial reason : Winston Churchill was Dundee 's M.P . from 1908 until he was trounced at the polls in 1922 by a Scottish prohibitionist and teetotaler named Edwin Scrymgeour . Mild-eyed Scrym stuffed his speeches with Old Testament quotes on the evils of John Barleycorn , gave Winston a beating he has not forgotten .
