General Eisenhower , Supreme Allied Commander , broadcast a sober warning and clear instructions to the people of Occupied Europe . Said General Eisenhower , his voice resonant and reassuring : <P> " The hour of your liberation is approaching . <P> " To members of resistance movements ... I say ' follow the instructions you have received . ' To patriots who are not members of organized resistance groups I say ' continue your passive resistance , but do not needlessly endanger your lives until I give you the signal to rise and strike the enemy . . . . Until that day I call on you for the hard task of discipline and restraint . ' <P> " Citizens of France ! Follow the instructions of your leaders . ... Be patient . Prepare . <P> " Prompt and willing obedience to the orders that I shall issue is essential . . . . <P> All persons must continue in their present duties unless otherwise instructed . Those who have common cause with the enemy and so betrayed their country will be removed . As France @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives and government . . . . <P> " You may sustain further loss and damage . Tragic though they may be , they are part of the price of victory . . . . I shall do all in my power to mitigate your hardships . I know that I can count on your steadfastness now . . . . " <P> General Eisenhower had ordered that warnings be given , whenever possible , to French towns in which military targets were to be bombed heavily . But the warning , by leaflets dropped from planes , might be less than an hour before the attack . Then the people must leave the towns immediately and on foot , taking only what they can easily carry , and hurry to open country . They must avoid main roads , railways and bridges , avoid bunching up . <P> Patriots and Puppets . European leaders in exile speedily followed with messages to their countrymen . Premiers Pieter S. Gerbrandy of The Netherlands and Hubert Pierlot of Belgium told their people of the opening of invasion , and called on them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever resistance is possible . " Both leaders added special warnings to underground fighters not to be tricked into premature action , but to follow only genuine Allied orders broadcast from London . Similar messages of encouragement and caution went to Norway from King Haason VII , to Poland from Premier Stanislaw Mikolajczyk . <P> Frenchmen heard the final contrast between the leader of Vichy , Marshal Ptain , and the leader in exile , General de Gaulle . The Old Man of Vichy , magnificent only in his consistency , begged his countrymen to ignore Allied or Gaullist commands , and to obey the Germans lest Nazi reprisal fall on France . General de Gaulle , shunned until the last moment , instructed them to heed " the French Government " ( i.e. , his own ) , and said : " France , overwhelmed . . . but never conquered , is on her feet to take part . . . . The simple , sacred duty is to fight . "                  @ @ @
