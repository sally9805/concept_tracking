Nobody has ever played the game of U.S. concert management with a shrewder gambler 's eye than pudgy , Russian-born Sol Hurok of Manhattan . Last week Hurok gambled $120,000 on one of the longest and prettiest shots of his career . She was a pert , dark-haired , 18-year-old coloratura soprano named Patrice Munsel . For his $120,000 , Hurok got the rights to Patrice 's concert and radio appearances for three years . On an operatic filly who has not yet run her maiden race , that was tall betting . <P> Patrice Munsel has a contract to sing this winter with Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera ( she won the Met Auditions of the Air last spring ) . But after that , <P> Hurok will take over her reedy , agile soprano , fluent in French , Italian and English , primed with at least ten big-time opera roles . And he can be counted on to feature the face behind the voice . <P> Patrice is as choice a bloom as any in the recent bevy of young sopranos . Only child of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splash six years ago when she sang before the Spokane Citizens ' Club . Before she was 14 she had become a ballet and tap dancer , and an expert in what she calls " artistic whistling . " For the past three years she has lived in Manhattan with her mother , who holds her to a strict daily routine : 10:30 to noon , voice lesson ; 1 to 3 , operatic coaching ; 3 to 4 , Italian lesson ; 4 to 5 , French lesson ; 5 to 6 , another voice lesson . At 6 Patrice is entitled to dinner . Her favorite dish : pickled herring with an onion on an apple .
