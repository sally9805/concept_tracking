Mixed with either potash or Congressmen , sugar is a potent explosive . This week the annual Congressional blowoff made all Good Neighbobs wince and hold their ears . <P> Good Neighbobs want to continue the quotas of the 1937 Sugar Act-which permits Cuba to supply 29% of U.S. demand , domestic beet growers 23% , the Philippines 15% , Hawaii 14% , Puerto Rico 12% , domestic cane growers 6% . <P> Instead the House this week rushed through a bill which is a sugar lobbyist 's dreamboat . Often the various U.S. interests ( beet growers , cane growers , Eastern refiners ) snipe at each other as well as the public weal in the running fight over raw-sugar quotas . But this year they ganged up solidly on their offshore rivals . Their weapon : the House bill , introduced by South Carolina 's Hampton P. Fulmer , and a companion Senate bill introduced by beet-growing Wyoming 's Joseph C. O'Mahoney . <P> These bills would shift the quota percentages to give the uneconomic U.S. beet growers 65,000 more tons a year , cane growers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50,000 tons , the Philippine quota by 27,000 tons ; Puerto Rico and Hawaii would suffer minor curtailments . <P> For the benefit of U.S. refiners , Cuba 's quota of refined sugar would also be cut - from 375,000 to 300,000 tons . <P> Also in the bills is a mysterious gimmick which redefines the dividing line between liquid sugar , which comes under quotas , and edible molasses , which does not . Effect of this highly technical clause would be to classify molasses as liquid sugar , thereby putting an end to molasses imports from the British West Indies , which now supply nearly half of U.S. demand . <P> For the Administration this sugar lobby steal would have bitter consequences . It would sabotage U.S. reciprocal trade treaties with Cuba and Britain . It would offend Hawaii and the Philippines . <P> Yet the House passed the Fulmer bill without blushing or even drawing a deep breath . The House Agriculture Committee had reported it without holding hearings . The vote was taken after only a few minutes of debate . Texas Congressman Richard M. Kleberg read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Puerto Rico 's Commissioner Bolvar Pag read a letter from President Roosevelt strongly implying opposition . The House ignored them ( 134-to-32 ) . Snorted angry Richard Kleberg : " A sellout against the wishes of 130,000,000 people . " All Good Neighbors could hope for was better consideration in the Senate .
