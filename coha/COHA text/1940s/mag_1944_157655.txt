To Alben Barkley the scene was familiar : the high-ceilinged room , and the big man propped up in the plain mahogany bed , his tremendous shoulders bulging his pa jama coat . In seven years as majority leader of the U.S. Senate , Kentucky 's Barkley had talked with President Roosevelt literally hundreds of times , at all hours and in many places , including the President 's bedroom . <P> The President 's regular Monday conference with the Democratic leaders of Congress is usually held in his big oval office in the Executive wing of the White <P> House . But last week Mr. Roosevelt held the conference in his bedroom . The other leaders-Vice President Wallace , Speaker Rayburn , House Majority Leader John McCormack-were already there when Alben Barkley walked in . <P> In the Bedroom . The President was jovial . He announced cheerfully he had decided to veto the new tax bill . He proceeded to read excerpts from his veto message . A three-against-one argument promptly boiled up . While Wallace sat silent , Barkley , Rayburn and McCormack vigorously tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veto , they argued , would simply mean throwing away more than two billion dollars in revenue . Why not let this bill become law without his signature ? A veto would stir up fresh bitterness in an already restless and resentful Congress . <P> The debate grew detailed . Leader Barkley nailed the President 's false classification of social-security taxes as general revenue . Bringing up his point against the timber tax , Mr. Roosevelt reminded the leaders that he is a treegrower himself . Politely but firmly , Barkley declared that the President 's annual crop of quick-growing Christmas " bushes " can not be compared with the once-a-generation harvest of slow-growing commercial timber . <P> The argument remained polite . The President remained adamant . Leader Barkley summed up . On the Senate Finance Committee he had worked on the bill . He had fought against some of its provisions ; he knew the bill was far from perfect . But this bill was the work and the will of Congress . He could not assent to throwing away 2.3 billion dollars for the reasons raised by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he , Barkley , would have to stand up on the floor of the Senate and defend his position . Mr. Roosevelt remarked that this was understandable . The conference broke up in strained good humor . <P> " For the Greedy . " Next day the President sent the veto message to the Capitol . It was the first time in history that a U.S. President had vetoed a general revenue bill . It was addressed to the House , as the tax-originating branch of Congress , and was read only there . But some Senators got copies at their offices .
