Atom-powered ships might sail a million miles on a single fuel charge of uranium or plutonium ; the prospect was most promising , said General Electric 's Vice President Harry A. Winne last week . But atomic power for public utilities , he thought , was not quite so promising . To compete with soft coal at $4 a ton , " fissionable material " would have to sell at $6,000 a pound . <P> Nevertheless , giant General Electric Co. was brimming over with high hopes for the Atomic Age . Already G.E . had committed itself to an extensive program of basic atomic research . At the Knolls , outside Schenectady , the company will build a 300-acre research center to house its dangerous new activities . Meanwhile , armed with their 100,000,000-volt betatron and other high-voltage machines , its scientists are studying the " meson , " a mysterious , sub-atomic particle which may hold the key to a revolutionary course of atomic power . <P> Last week General Electric completed a dicker to take over , from Du Pont , the management of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three great piles in the Hanford desert were built to produce plutonium for bombs , their byproduct is unharnessed energy in enormous quantities . G.E . will run the piles at cost plus $1 . Its profit will be in priceless experience .
