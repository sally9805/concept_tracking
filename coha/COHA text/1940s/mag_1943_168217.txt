The milling of white rice has been a notoriously paradoxical operation : most of the food value is stripped off and thrown away before the grain is considered fit for human consumption . A new process has now been developed which avoids this wasteful procedure . Already supplying good , rich white rice to the U.S. armed forces , the process may revolutionize rice milling . <P> Its U.S. sponsor is a Houston rice broker named Gordon L. Harwell . A born pot-watcher , Harwell used to sit up late nights with a pressure cooker and a potful of paddy ( rice in the husk ) trying to cook up an improvement on conventional milling methods . In orthodox rice milling , machines first remove the husk ( containing vitamin Bi ) , then the germ and several coats of bran ( rich in fat , minerals and vitamin B complex ) , finally give forth a polished white kernel which has lost most of the vitamins and minerals in the original rough grain . ( The husks are burned ; the bran fed to animals . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Brown rice ( the stage be fore the bran and germ are removed ) is both rich and edible , but it has never been as popular as white rice because it 1 ) looks less attractive and 2 ) keeps less well ( the oil it contains becomes rancid ) . Harwell hunted for a process that would somehow transfer the valuable food elements from the outer coatings to the white kernel , but his pressure cooker experiments were failures . <P> Then one day a German biochemist named E. G. Huzenlaub ( now a naturalized British citizen ) marched into Harwell 's Houston office with the magic for mula . Today the Harwell plant at Houston produces 1,200 barrels of Huzenlaub rice ( called " converted rice " ) a day , all of it sold to the Army &; Navy . In the new process the rough rice is soaked in warm water , undergoes a vacuum treatment , then is put under pressure which transfers the soluble vitamins and minerals from the husks and bran coatings to the kernel . Next a vacuum dryer seals the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and polished in the usual way . <P> Since rice is the world 's No. 1 grain ( in the number of people it feeds ) , the Huzenlaub process may well prove to be one of the most important food discoveries in years . The U.S. rice-milling industry , still loath to accept it , has denied Harwell 's firm membership in the Rice Millers ' Association , claims that the new process is no better than several others by which milled rice is impregnated with vitamins . But millers in 36 countries are now licensed to use the Huzenlaub process . Only country turned down so far : Japan .
