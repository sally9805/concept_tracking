" Is n't it true , " complained Writer-Director Joseph ( A Letter to Three Wives ) Mankiewicz , " that a real-estate operator whose chief concern should be taking gum off carpets and checking adolescent love-making in the balcony-is n't it true that this man is in control of ... the motion-picture industry ? " <P> With 17 others who work in the movies or feel strongly about them . Mankiewicz was sounding off on his favorite subject . The sounding board : LIFE 'S Round Table on Hollywood . For 2 days at San Bernardino , Calif. , some 100,000 words flew around the table between scholars , actors , technicians , a critic , a moviegoer , and some of the best U.S. moviemaking talent : 20th Century-Fox 's Mankiewicz , M-G-M Production Chief Dore Senary , Warner 's Jerry Wald , Independents John Huston , Hal B. Wallis and Robert Rossen . <P> In its current issue , LIFE reports on the ideas that went round &; round . Samples : Creativeness in Hollywood is stifled by U.S. theater owners , who control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing from it but , in Mankiewicz 's phrase , " 400 items of salable merchandise every year . " The creators may get their big chance when the Government finally splits theater ownership from production . The moviemakers recognize that a low-budget " special audience " film , e.g. , Home of the Brave , can turn a profit without a mass audience , but Hollywood is geared to supply the bigger audience , where the bigger profit lies . Hollywood clings to its self-censoring <P> Production Code to forestall harsher action by public censors . The pressure group it fears most is the Roman Catholic Legion of Decency ( " a C rating for a picture is death " ) . One speaker ( protectively anonymous in the report ) said : " The Legion is something that Hollywood should have fought and did n't ... for the same reasons that they have never fought anything : they did n't want to stop the flow of film for one week . " The U.S. mass audience , even the moviemakers admitted , is more grownup in its tastes than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult pictures . But the men from Hollywood did some buck-passing to the audience , too : the public perpetuates the star system , which keeps budgets high and originality at a low ebb ; it sometimes passes up good pictures , e.g. , The Search , and flocks to trash starring big names ; it needles Hollywood for kowtowing to pressure groups , but never organizes to help keep the screen free . <P> Concluded LIFE : " The moviemakers , as the Round Table Editors met them , were earnest and thoughtful men , who represented the good Hollywood . . . The movies need . . . ' more freedom for more men of talent ' . . . But it must be fought for by the good Hollywood and by the people who believe in freedom . . . From this Hollywood . . . these people can get movies as good as they demand-but demand them they must . "
