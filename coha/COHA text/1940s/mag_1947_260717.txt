A new radio relay system connecting New York and Boston was demonstrated last week by Bell Telephone Laboratories . The cableless cable uses microwaves about 7 cm. long , which are not affected by weather , static or most kinds of man-made interference . The waves move in straight lines and refuse to curve with the earth , so they can not make Boston in one jump . The telephone people skip them from hilltop to hilltop . <P> The waves start from the roof of a Telephone Co. building in Manhattan . A tricky metallic " lens " concentrates them into a narrow beam , sharper than the shaft of a searchlight , which points at the first relay station atop Jackie Jones Mountain , 35 miles away . A receiving lens gathers in the waves ; an amplifier hops them up ; a second transmitter beams them to the next hilltop relay . They make eight jumps to reach Boston . <P> The present setup will carry hundreds of telephone conversations or one television broadcast ( which can not travel over ordinary wires ) . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work soon on a New York to Chicago jump-line.
