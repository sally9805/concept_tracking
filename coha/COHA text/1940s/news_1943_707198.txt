txt Mayor Morello Ii . La Guardia warned some 10,000,000 residents of the New York metropolitan area yesterday afternoon that the long expected meat famine had arrived . In a nine-minute broadcast from City Hall over six radio stations he appealed to the public " to go very easy . on the purchase of meat , particularly beef , this week and during the next week . " Asserting that the supply of beef was " about as low as it has ever been in the entire country , " Mayor La Guardia made it clear that there was no shortage of livestock . 1He declared that the government 's rollback subsidy had not been accepted as a solution of ceiling difficulties and that livestock was being withheld from market . ' Furthermore , he pointed out that when the War Food Administration issued its new set-aside order requiring slaughterers to reserve 45 per cent of their output for the armed forces , lend-lease , etc. , merchant shipping had not been ineluded . As a result , it was logical to expect that raids on civilian stocks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor announced that efforts were being made to have the Federal Government remedy this situation by including merchant shipping in the 45 per cent quota and guaranteeing civilians that they would get their 55 per cent . Poultry Inquiry Held Meanwhile , City Markets Commissioner Daniel P. Woolley held a three-hour hearing on complaints that retail poultry dealers had been charged more than ceiling prices by the Kingsway Live Poultry Corporation , 9010 Quentin Road , Brooklyn . Before the hearing was adjourned until 2 o'clock Monday afternoon the proceedings had been marked by shouted accusations of " Gestapo methods " and undue haste in the investigation . Mayor La Guardia 's broadcast on the acute meat shortage over radio stations WNYC , WJZ , WOR , WHOM , WBYN and WEVD from 4:05 to 4:14 o'clock in the afternoon was arranged on short notice as reports reached this city of widespread demoralization of the meat industry by the roll-back subsidies and the 45-per cent setaside order . Packing plants in Cincinnati , Cleveland and Buffalo were reported closing down , and livestock feeders ' organizations in Nebraska were described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's rollback subsidy plan was dropped . Warns People of City In his afternoon broadcast , which was repeated in the evening over WMCA , WNEW and WHN , Mayor La Guardia said : " I thought that I would take this opportunity in order to give the people of this city as much notice as possible and request them to go very easy on the purchase of meat , particularly beef , this week-end and during next week . . " The supply of meat , and that is the supply of beef , is about as I low as it ever has been in the entire country . Now that does n't mean that livestock is low . The same amount of livestock , of course , exists , but this is what happened . Commencing Monday , the movement of livestock to the slaughter houses was very light and continued so all during the week , and we are now feeling the effects of that here in this section of the country . " It seems tha : the amount of the government subsidy provided will take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but leaves the packers , the slaughter houses , wholesalers and retailers it the same relative position as to ceiling price and the price of livestock . " The livestock people seemed to be in doubt as to what would happen and , therefore , apparently are holding back the livestock from the market . It is expected that the government will adjust this situation and that they will have a normal supply of animals early next week , but then we will net get the benefit of that until several days later , as the coolers of the packers and wholesalers are pretty well empty in this section of the country . Coolers Virtually Empty " I have a report from Buell F. Maben , the Regional Administrator of the Food Distribution Administration , who said the supply was sold to retailers by Tuesday of this week when the price rollback became effective . Since supplies have been light , packers ' coolers are practically empty at this time . All fresh meats are scarce in New York City . " Now , in addition to that , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 28.2 , Section 1410.12 , ' Beef Required to Be Set Aside , ' dated June 11 , provided that . each slaughterer , subject to the provisions of Food Distribution Order 28 shall set aside , reserve and hold for delivery to the Army , Navy , Marine Corps and Coast Guard of the United States 45 per cent of the supply . " That we know , but somehow , Section D of this order says that beef set aside pursuant to the provisions of this order shall not be sold to or purchased by ship operators . " Now that will cut into the 25 per cent , at least in this city , of our remaining 55 per cent , coupled with the reduced shipments to our city . Couple this with the reduced shipments to our city and you will readily see why the supply of beef is low at this time . " Now I know that frantic efforts are being made to change this order so as to provide for all government requirements within the 45 per cent . If that does not happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the country . "
