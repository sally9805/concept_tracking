txt ARMY TO TRY SPIES , ROOSEVELT HINTS He Commends Captors of Nazi Agents Here  --  FBI Denies Youth 's Tip Broke Case President Roosevelt said yesterday , at a news conference in Washington , that he assumed that the two Nazi agents captured by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in this ' area would be tried by a military commission , but that he could not tell definitely whether that procedure would be followed . Commending the captors of the two enemy agents for what he described as a grand job , the President , in response to a question , said that he assumed that they would be tried in the same way as the eight Nazi agents who were taken into custody in 1942 . They were tried in secret by a commission of seven generals , which imposed // death sentences on six and sentenced one of the others to life imprisonment and one to thirty years . Attorney General Francis Biddle conferred at length with members of his staff yesterday about the case of the two r.w prisoners , cording to The Associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be followed in prosecuting them was made . It was indicated that the final decision would rest with President Roosevelt in his capacity as Commanderin-Chief . Meanwhile , the FBI maintained its strict silence about the manner in which it first got on the trail of the men under arrest , William C. Colepaugh , 26-year-old native of Niantic , Conn. , and Erich Gimpel , 35 , a native of Germany and a short-wave radio expert . The two men were still held incommunicado in the Federal Court building in this city , and the time and place of their arraignment were withheld . Inspector Earle Connelley of the FBI declared , however , that press dispatches were in error in crediting 17-year-old Harvard Merrill Hodgkins , a high school senior and Life Scout of Hancock Point , Me. , with the tip that led to the search for the two men , culminating in their arrest in the New York area within the last few days . Inspector Connelley asserted ' that FBI agents were already engaged on an exhaustive investigation of the area near Hancock Point , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rubber boat on the night of Nov. 29 , before the story of young Hodgkins was reported to the agency . In their investigation the FBI agents questioned all residents of the area , Inspector Connelly said , and found two persons who told of seeing Colepaugh and Gimpel on the night they landed . He said that one was Mrs. Mary Forni , who saw the two men walking north along the Hancock Point Road in a driving snowstorm about 11:50 P. M. on Nov. 29 , while she was driving south toward her home . On Dec. 4 , in the course of their check of the neighborhood , the agents located Hodgkins and heard his story , according to Inspector Connelley . He asserted that the youth said he had seen the two men about 11:30 o'clock on the night of Nov. 29 while he was returning from a dance , and later told his father . Young Hodgkins ' version of the affair , as carried by The United Press , was considerably more melodramatic . He told of sighting the two men in the Snowstorm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the thing that struck me funny was the fact that they had such light clothes . As near as I could see they had on topcoats . No one around here wears a topcoat in the winter and least of all on a night like that one . I pulled over some and went by slowly so I would n't hit them and I could see they were carrying bags . " I kept driving along slowly and could see their tracks plainly in the snow . After about 100 yards the tracks turned off the side of the road and went into the woods . " Everybody up here has been thinking about spies landing along the coast and I got to thinking those two men might be up to some funny business . So when I saw the tracks in the woods , I stopped the car and walked in a little way . They led right down to the shore , where the sea was pounding in . It was a pretty high tide , about as high as we 've had in fifty years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Pa was away on a hunting trip . He 's the deputy sheriff here , so we decided to wait until he came back before we did anything . By the time Pa got home it had rained and all the tracks were washed out , but he decided to call up the G-men . He got hold of them and they came down and warned me not to breathe a word about it .
