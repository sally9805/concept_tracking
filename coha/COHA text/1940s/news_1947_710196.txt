txt If the United States Department of Agriculture has its way a stout fence will be built along the Mexican-United States border to facilitate the enforcement of quarantine regulations designed to keep out diseased cattle . Segments of such a fence have been erected , but they are too short to be of much use . The need of a complete fence has been driven home by an outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease which started in the State of Veracruz , Mexico , last year and which has spread . The United States-Mexican boundary follows the Rio Grande River for a distance of 1,210 miles , the Colorado River for a distance of twenty miles , and overland territory from El Paso , Tex. , to the . Pacific Ocean for a distance of 875 miles . The fence will therefore have to be 1,905 miles long . On this international boundary the usual points of entry for livestock are Brownsville , Laredo , Eagle Pass , Del Rio and El Paso , Tex. ; Douglas and Nogales , Ariz. , and Calexico , Calif . Unless a fence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle is always present . Caused by a Virus Foot-and-mouth disease is highly infectious . It is caused by a virus , chiefly among cloven-footed animals . It derives its name from the blisters that form on the mucous membrane of the mouth and on the skin between the toes and above the hoofs . Hogs , goats , sheep , deer and wild animals may be infected . Horses do not seem to be susceptible . Dogs , cats and rabbits can be infected artificially but not naturally . There have been cases of accidental human infection in laboratories , but man is not readily susceptible . Animals may be infected directly by other animals or indirectly by manure , hay , drinking troughs , cattle-cars , market stalls , barnyards and pastures . Farmhands and cattle-tenders may carry the virus on their shoes and clothing and even on their hands while milking . Dogs , cats , rats , chickens , pigeons and other birds are carriers . The mortality varies . In the mild form of the disease 3 per cent of the animals die ; in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent . Even if all stricken animals do not die they lose weight rapidly , they suffer pain , and their milk-producing power is impaired . Hence the whole business of raising , marketing and slaughtering cattle is deranged . In 1920 and 1921 the German livestock industry lost an estimated $120,000,000 through footand-mouth disease . In that same period Switzerland lost $70,000,000 , and Switzerland has an area less than half that of Maine . Origins Undetermined How the virus of the foot-and-mouth disease was carried into Mexico has not yet been determined . At first it was suspected that two herds of zebu cattle imported by Mexico in 1945 and 1946 , from an infected district in Brazil in violation of a treaty with this country explained everything , but so far the disease has not appeared in either of the two ahipmc.lts . Nevertheless it is a suspicious circumstance that the foot-and-mouth disease first appeared near Veracruz about Nov. 1 , 1946 , on a ranch where the second shipment of Brazilian bulls had been placed . Prior to June 5 , 1946 , when the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered this country by way of Mexico . These remain in Texas . No sign of the footand-mouth disease has appeared in this herd . Both Mexican and American veterinarians are watching the bulls . Mexico has prohibited their export and has made it compulsory to register them and to report all cases of sickness and death among them . The United States Department of Agriculture has given instructions at border stations to cease the inspection of ell ruminants and swine , which has the same effect as expulsion . Four veterinarians of the Department of Agriculture have been . ordered to join a like number of Mexicans in making a survey of the extent and spread of the disease . There is only one way to eradicate the foot-and-mouth disease , and that is to slaughter all infected animals and to burn or to bury their carcasses deeply . Quarantine of the type that we have established along the border and that Mexico has established in certain districts of her own domain can do no more than check the spread of the disease .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
