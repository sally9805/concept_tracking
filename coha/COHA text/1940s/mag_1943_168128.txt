Only in the precarious peace of Eire could Europe today provide such a spectacle . At Dublin 's Trinity College last month crowds were turned away from a jampacked scientific lecture. * Cabinet ministers , diplomats , scholars and socialites loudly applauded a slight , Vienna-born professor of physics . Erwin Schrdinger was speaking on the subject " What Is Life ? " <P> Schrdinger has a way with him . His soft , cheerful speech , his whimsical smile are engaging . And Dubliners are proud to have a Nobel prizewinner living among them. + But what especially appeals to the Irish is Schrdinger 's study of Gaelic , Irish music and Celtic design , his hobby of making tiny doll-house furniture with textiles woven on a midget Irish loom-and , above all , his preference for a professorship at the Dublin Advanced Studies Institute to one at Oxford . <P> Schrdinger is a mathematical mystic . Says he : " There is no worldly truth but mathematical truth . In politics , history and diplomacy , truth changes from day to day and people get different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Schrdinger 's mathematics , however . true , is rarely intelligible to the public . His Nobel Prize achievement , ten years ago , was devising wave mechanics to reconcile the seeming contradictions in the nature of light . Light unquestionably has a wave motion , yet it obeys the quantum laws as if it were composed of particles or small bundles of energy . Schrdinger imagined a sub-ether filled with ripples too small for detection . He conceived of a " particle " of light as an " area of ripples , " a wave-throb that is detectable by instruments . <P> A Unified Universe . Today Schrdinger is concerned with a deeper problem-the same one that has occupied Albert <P> Einstein in recent years : to provide a fundamental explanation for both gravitation and electromagnetic attraction . <P> Electromagnetic fields so far are inde pendent , apart from other phenomena , do not satisfy the scientists ' yearning for fundamental unity . The mathematical struggle is not to handle them in practical terms , nor to add further dimensions to space-time in order to account for them ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their unity with the world of space , time , matter and energy . Schrdinger has found this in an " affine " geometry , which deals with pure concepts in their essence , not with measurement in the ordinary sense . He now claims to have " unified " gravitation with electromagnetic fields . <P> But if Erwin Schrdinger , as his lecture title suggests , has also attempted to fit life into his equations , he has gone beyond the ambitions of any other mathematician . In that case , it is small wonder that he fascinates the imaginative Irish . <P> * Prewar U.S. precedent : In January 1930 , a crowd of 4,000 , trying to squeeze into 1,400 seats at Manhattan 's American Museum of Natural History for a showin of a film on Einstein 's relativity theory , pushed down an iron gate , shoved a heavy door off its hinges . <P> + He left his professorship at University of Berlin in 1933 for four years at Oxford , thence went to Graz in Austria , finally to Dublin in 1938.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
