" A deficit of 10 billion dol. less this year may well be 20 billion neat year , and even more the follow .

This means an over-all federal debt of 100 billion perhaps by July 1 , 1943 , and rertainly within that fiscal year . " We have beard much in late years of planned economy , which has meant , so far , plans to spend more government money .
