Carr Staff Writer of , The Christian Science Monitor A big strike in the woolen and worsted mills of New England appeared today to be shaping up for Feb. 1 . Despite weeks of pressure for settlement , 45 mills in this region and 20 elsewhere , with 25 , - 000 workers , have not yet signed ' up with the union . Insiders said today they thought a number of them would continue to refuse and that strikes would result in many mills . The course of negotiations has not tamed out as the Textile Workers Union ( C. I. 0. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wanted from the American Woolen Company , whose 20 mills make it the biggest unit in the industry , union leaders felt the rest of the woolen and worsted manufacturers would follow suit . They had considerable reason for so thinking , as American Woolen often has set a pattern for the industry . Few N. E. Mills Sign But this time it has not yet so worked out . The other mills have not gone along with the union in the number the union anticipated . Few - New England mills . have signed up following American Woolen . The union so far has announced eight in the east , and the most important of these hdlre been outside of New England . The friction over the American Woolen agreement came about partly through the way this company went it alone , according to current reports . When the union first gave out its demands , the employers met as a group with the union , and this common action continued for a time . Meanwhile , American Woolen had been negotiating independently with the union and apparently did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the union , until after its settlement was completed . Chief difficulty in the dispute has been found in the demand for a " union shop " required all new employees to join the union . Many believe that if the union withdrew this , the mills generally would settle for the 15-cents-an-hour increase asked . Since group conferences were broken off , the union has been holding local conferences with mill managements , and may succeed in signing up more of the smaller mills the coming week . The present contracts expire Feb. 1 . The union has taken strike votes and promised to call strikes immediately in every mill where a new agreement has riot been accepted by that time . The Federal Government again is actively stepping in through Miss Anna Weinstock , Conciliator of the United States Department of Labor assigned to the dispute . She is beginning conferences with individual mills tonight , it is reported . Lag Looms in Meat It will take a few days for the John P. Squire Company pf Cambridge , the largest packing house in New England , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a. m. tonight , it was said by officials today . Nothing official had yet come through regarding seizure . The main factor in resumption of operations is the time it will take for hogs to come through from the Middle West . In snowy weather this may require five to six days , in clear weather three to four . The company has now 1,200 hogs in its pens and has been feeding them , but this supply may not fill out more than a half a day . A few other packing houses in New England also are scheduled for seizure , according to Washington announcement . They include the New England Dressed Meat &; Wool Company of Somerville , and the H. L. Handy Company of Springfield , subsidiaries of Swift &; Co. , and the branch house of Armour &; Co. in Roxbury and Chamberlain &; Co. , Boston , an Armour subsidiary . It also is expected locally that another Swift subsidiary , the Boston Fresh Tripe Company in Brighton , will be seized .

Murphy , Financial Secretary and Business Agent of its Boston union , said today its members would go back to work when the company was seize4 . It employs 20 workers . Back-to-Work Sentiment There is considerable sentiment among C. I. 0 . Packinghouse Union members in Massachusetts for not going back to work if the Government seizes meat platits unless the Government guarantees an increase in pay . However , it appeared very likely that local unions would follow whatever instructions were sent out from the national headquarters of the union in Chicago . Representatives of local unions over the country are now assembled in Chicago . The Boston union sent its Business Agent , H. W. Weiner . He is expected to telegraph the Boston President , Joseph Masci , as soon as a decision on policy is made . A walkout today in any of the seven independent meat processing companies of Boston and Cambridge was averted by signing of , agreements with the Packinghouse Workers Union ( C.

In the case of the seventh , the Colonial Provision Company , while the matter was not settled , an understanding with the union to be followed in adjusting the wage agreement was reached and further negotiations will go on at a later date , it was reported today . Negotiations between the Steelworkers ' Union ( C. I. 0. ) and various local metal-working companies in which . it has called strikes are continuing . Instructions from the union 's international office are to ask for an increase of 18% cents an hour . the figure advised by President Truman . No settlements have yet been reached on this basis locally . T.nral 25 and the organized hauling companies of the Boston area come back again today before the Board of Conciliation and Arbitration. , at the Massachusetts State House in an effort to resolve the deadlock in their negotiations over a new contract .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
