The case was once called " one of the most shocking in Treasury history " by ex-Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr . As the evidence of tax evasion piled up in Manhattan federal court against Henry Lustig , owner of Manhattan 's glittering , high-priced Longchamps Restaurants , Inc. , it was indeed shocking . Restaurateur Lustig , who came up from peddling vegetables on Manhattan 's lower East Side , had missed few tax-dodging tricks . <P> With the help of a nephew and employe , E. Allen Lustig , and his chief bookkeeper Joseph Sobel , Longchamps ' had kept two sets of books , one for Henry , one for Uncle Sam . Profits on which taxes were paid were determined by avarice , not earnings . Fictitious expenses were put down ; the bulk of the tips to hat-check girls ( $5,000 a month ) was pocketed by Lustig and not reported . Lustig 's house hold expenses ( and race horses ) were charged up to corporation expenses ; $18,142 went to a decorator , $913 for Mrs. Lustig 's modes , $2,300 for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He claimed a tax deduction for his dependent mother-in-law for four years after her death . Lustig admitted all this.His only defense : he had voluntarily told the Treasury of the evasions , had been promised immunity if he paid up . The deal had been made , said he , with Internal Revenue Collector William J. Pedrick on March 26 , 1945 . Retorted Pedrick : there had been no deal . At the time set by Lustig , Pedrick had been attending an Alfred E. Smith memorial dinner-and eight prominent Manhattanites so testified . <P> Last week , a jury took only two hours and 36 minutes to find Lustig and his aides guilty of defrauding the U.S. of $2,872,766.62 in taxes . Maximum sentence on the 23 counts : 112 years in prison , fines of $230,000 apiece .
