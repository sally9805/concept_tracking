There were two levels of the wartime underground in Europe : anonymous patriots who could sometimes fight back a little , and-farther down-wanted men who had to burrow and keep hidden . Gisele van der Gracht 's Amsterdam apartment was a station in the subcellar underground . Gisele , a thin blonde in her 30s , was a first-rank Dutch artist , known for her stained-glass window designs . During the occupation she spent half her days on bread lines to feed the men she was hiding . To help them pass the terrible time , she also found pens , ink and paper . <P> Once they set foot in her apartment , Gisele 's " boys " were there to stay . They dozed in the daytime , stayed awake nights " so there would not be too many warm beds in case of a Gestapo raid . " Three of the hunted , Peter Goldschmidt ( 22 ) , Simon van Keulen ( 19 ) and Harry Op het Veld ( 19 ) spent their nights sitting around a table lit by a wick in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they took as long as possible on each picture . <P> The results , on exhibition in a Manhattan gallery this week , showed something of the lavish care and knotted intensity with which medieval monks illuminated the writings of the Church Fathers and the lives of the Saints . But their subject matter was more surrealistic than sacred . Their usual theme : the horror of war , illustrated by such symbolism as rotting flesh on temple steps . There were no heroics . In the new Dark Age , saints bore assumed names , and martyrdom was usual .
