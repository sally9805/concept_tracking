Like a mourner laying a nosegay on a grave , Miss Josephine Roche last week paid the first liquidating dividend of her bankrupt Rocky Mountain Fuel Co. , the company the United Mine Workers loved . The dividend of 25 on each of the company 's 758,720 shares of common stock came from sales of coal lands and royalties from mines leased to other companies . <P> The biggest check , for about $44,000 , went to the U.M.W. 's company , Lewmurken , * Inc. , which once tried to save Rocky Mountain Fuel by lending President Roche $709,693 . It had good reason to keep the company going . Miss Roche , a militant liberal , had taken over the presidency two years after the death of her union-hating father , who had joined other Colorado mining companies in smashing the U.M.W. in the ill-famed Ludlow riots . <P> Miss Roche signed a contract with the union , the first in Colorado . But the shaky company , heavily over-capitalized by her father , began to slip when natural gas came into Colorado , went bankrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When liquidation is completed , in five or six years , Lewmurken , which owns 23% of the company , may have received as much as $300,000 in all . But the U.M.W. is shedding no tears over its loss . It was richly repaid in the unionization of all Colorado coal mines . <P> <P> *Named for John L. Lewis , Philip Murray and Tom Kennedy , still secretary-treasurer of the U.M.W.
