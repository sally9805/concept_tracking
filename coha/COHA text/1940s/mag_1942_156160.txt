The soap battle of the century last week came out into the open for all to see . <P> For years huge Lever Bros . ( Swan Spry , Rinso , Lux , Lifebuoy , etc. ) and huger Procter &; Gamble ( Ivory , Crisco , Oxydol , etc. ) have slugged at each other in the nice-Nellie manner of the advertising campaign-with occasional forays that were not so nice , but not so noticeable to the layman , either . Now the battle has exploded in a big way : in Boston a Federal grand jury indicted Procter &; Gamble for using the mails to defraud . By the terms of a 57-page , 40-count indictment this turns out to mean bribing various Lever Bros , employes with aliases like " Babe , " " Red " and " Chick " to betray production , sales and advertising secrets " against the peace and dignity of the U.S. " <P> Procter &; Gamble , full of years ( it was founded in 1837 ) and good works , denied the whole kit &; caboodle of charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Began with a damage suit over granulated soap . Lever 's Rinso had proudly dominated that field since 1918 , and Lever is still plenty mad over the $5,000,000 it had to dish out to Procter &; Gamble and Colgate because a new spraying process Lever adopted in the late ' 20s turned out ( in 1937 ) to be a patent infringement . About the same time , Lever enraged Procter &; Gamble by bringing out Spry to compete with Procter &; Gamble 's long-established Crisco . Smart Lever Bros. -British-founded , now ambiguously owned by British Unilever 's Dutch affiliate Lever Bros . &; Unilever N.V. , through a South African holding company-has always been famed for spotting and invading a good established consumer-goods field where there was room for competition . But the battle of shortening was really only a minor engagement . <P> The Big Fight was still over soap , and among the juiciest corners of the U.S. soap market was the all-purpose , bland , white soap that floated. * For years there have been other floating soaps in a small way , but " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floating soap to the average U.S. citizen . As far back as 1933 , Lever experiments with a " different " floating soap had led them to the U.S. Patent Office . In 1940 the company obtained a patent on a " revolutionary " ( and still extremely hush-hush ) soapmaking process : a " continuous " manufacturing technique that turned out floating soap in a stream of cakes , rather than in batches ( brewed separately in caldrons ) . <P> Suits &; Counter Suits . While Lever Bros , was still experimenting with its floating wonder ( already dubbed " Swan " and being tested in key sales areas ) , Procter &; Gamble , in 1940 , came out with a " new Ivory " also made by a continuous process . In February 1941 , Lever cracked down on the " new Ivory " in the Baltimore courts with a patent-infringement suit . Less than two months later P. &; G. hit back with a Cincinnati plea for an injunction against the sales of Swan as an obvious and unfair imitation of Ivory .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
