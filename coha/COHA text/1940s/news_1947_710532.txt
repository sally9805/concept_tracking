With flood crests along the Missouri and Mississippi higher than for over one hundred years , with lesser streams running wild and causing tremendous damage , it is imperative that something be done to stop the annual widespread destruction of property , disruption of transportation and commerce , and desolation of thousands . Of course , every thoughtful American wants to see the national debt regularly reduced , but he does not want to see the growth of the nation retarded through unreasonably curtailing expenditures necessary for important protection and development . America is not yet complete nor safe . Both growth and strength call for better flood protection , arid better harbors and channels . Waterways and flood control works , like highways and railways , require constant improvement and maintenance . During the war both were neglected . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is difficult to believe that since the end of the war , Congress has sanctioned $11 billion for the economic rehabilitation of foreign countries , some of them our deadly enemies but a short time ago , and has then unreasonably reduced appropriations for urgent improvements in our own country .
