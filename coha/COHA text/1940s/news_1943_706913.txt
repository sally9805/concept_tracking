txt Although concerned with the future of State revenues because of the curtailment of civilian activities which have been taxable , Governor Dewey has no intention of backing down on his proposed change in the State 's fiscal year . This information was ascertained today because a change in that plan is almost certain to be suggested in the Legislature if a feeling arises there that new taxes might be necessary in a year or so should a decline of present revenues turn out to be drastic . The Governor may have paved the way for that fear by his recent emphasis on the uncertainty of future revenues . The change in fiscal year is tied up with revenues in this matter . Revenues exceeded expenditures during the last three months of the last fiscal year by about $80,000 , - 000 , and this , coincidentally , is the same amount as the $80,000,000 surplus for the entire year which is estimated to accrue by the end of the current fiscal year , July 1 . Under the Dewey plan the last three months of the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new fiscal year would start April 1 , and therefore the surplus would never accrue . It is similar to starting to pay bills three months in advance of the date used for payment . The bank balance suffers . In this connection it might be noted that Governor Lehman in 1935 shifted tax dates from a coming fiscal year into an existing one , thus saving at that time the imposition of about $35,000,000 in new taxes , but unbalancing the tax payment dates . Now , when Mr. Dewey proposes to shift the tax dates back , in the interest of quarterly installment payments of the income tax and closer computation // DEWEY KEEPS PLAN AS REVENUES FADE // of State revenues and expenditures , the money gain of 1935 is reversed , as far as the books of the State are concerned . It was indicated today that Mr. Dewey feels that the change is a necessary one , and that it should be carried through for longe-range benefits even though a " bookkeeping surplus " is wiped out . With this attitude on the part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ successful in the present situation , especially in view of his determination to fight for the plan if necessary . The bill permitting the fiscal year ' change , and wiping out unexpended balances as of March 31 , must be passed this month , before the Governor submits his budget . It is the only bill in sight for which time is of the essence . Unless it is attended to the legislative wheels will not start really grinding for several weeks . The legislators return tomorrow night , but the only business on hand will be the announcement of committees . Speaker Heck indicated today that there were few changes scheduled in the standing committees of the Assembly , with none at all on the two most important committees , , Rules and Ways and Means . The Assembly will have the same number of committees and the same proportion of Republicans and Democrats as last year . In the Senate , Majority Leader Joe R. Hanley may not be back from a veterans ' meeting in Washington in time to attend tomorrow 's session , and announcement of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his return . The houses can not have a calendar of bills until their ; committees have been named and have been functioning at least a week . It was indicated at the Executive Mansion today that the Governor might fill one or two important Cabinet posts this week , but it was said to be doubtful that he would have these nominations ready to go into the Senate tomorrow night . The Governor worked last night and today on his budget and budget Imessage with Budget Director John E. Burton and Secretary Paul E. Lockwood . Meanwhile , the State Conference of Mayors today asked the Governor and the Legislature to enact no legislation which would either reduce revenues of local governments or increase their expenses . In making public its 1943 municipal legislative program , the conference asked also that age qualifications for firemen and policemen be suspended for the duration of the war , and that they be permitted to make temporary appointments without the appointees receiving full civil status .                  @ @ @
