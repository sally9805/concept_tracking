Last week another shipload of troops sailed from Lisbon for the Azores , the third contingent that has gone there in the last three months . In Lisbon it was announced that Portugal 's President , General Oscar de Fragosa Carmona , would also sail July 20 for a month 's inspection tour of the Azores . Thus did Portugal serve notice that any U.S. attempt to occupy the islands as strategic outposts would be resisted . <P> Portuguese newspapers spoke out plainly . Diario de Manha , organ of Portugal 's sole Party of National Union , observed sadly that Portugal had always regarded the U.S. as " one of the last irreducible bulwarks defending certain principles of law and international morality , " but that the new U.S. theory of hemisphere defense " opens the way to the most perilous adventures . " <P> Concluded Diario de Manha : " It is legitimate that nations like Portugal protest pretensions affecting their dignity and rights of national sovereignty , and affirm aloud before the world their will and right to resist any aggression , no matter where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Joao Antonio de Bianchi hurried around to the State Department to see Under Secretary Sumner Welles , then announced that he had received " definite assurances " that the U.S. would not try to seize the Azores , the Cape Verde Islands or any other Portuguese possessions . In a press conference Under Secretary Welles was less definite . The U.S. , calmly observed Mr. Welles , has no desire to see any change of Portuguese sovereignty of the islands . Nevertheless , he added , President Roosevelt had stated that it was vital to American security that Atlantic outposts " remain in friendly hands . " <P> A problem of defense ( how to get to the islands before Hitler ) had become a problem of diplomacy ( how to wangle an invitation ) . Perhaps , some observers hoped , an invitation might be tendered to several American nations , led by the onetime seat of the Portuguese kingdom , Brazil . But the Portuguese knew that an invitation to anybody to protect their islands would be an invitation to Hitler to protect Portugal .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
