That distinguished literary quarterly , the Southern Review , has announced that its spring issue of 1942 will probably be its last . Louisiana State University decided it can no longer afford the $10,000 a year the Review costs .

's prexy , Major General Campbell Blackshear Hodges ( ret . ) : <P> " They tell me the Southern Review is a fine publication , but I think its chances are damn poor . . . . " <P> The Southern Review was founded in 1935 on a cut from the millions " that moral idiot of genius " Huey Long lavished on the university .

The high standard of its writing and its editing , its interest in younger writers and avant-garde literature made it influential far beyond the South .

But football is part of the life of the Delta . Says the budget committee of the Southern Review : " The committee does not feel that the university can continue to support so heavily an activity which relatively reaches so small a number of people . . . .

What could the busy people of the Delta make of this stanza by Andrew Chiappe : <P> When riveters come to the nursery , <P> And microscopes reveal the unsuspected horror , <P> There may not be time then <P> For words furred with love like summer 's caterpillars . <P> The gap between the U.S. intelligentsia and U.S. life was just too wide .
