Americans were sick &; tired of the word ca n't . They had heard it over &; over : monotonous and nerve-jangling as a broken phonograph record : we ca n't attack until 1943 ; we ca n't get help to China ; we ca n't open a second front ; we ca n't get the raw materials . <P> Americans had listened patiently to the learned arguments of the can't-do-it experts . But now , at long last , millions of them were rebelling against the pessimists . <P> Center of the revolution was big , bald Engineer Henry J. Kaiser , whose motto has always been : Who ca n't ? Kaiser had gone to Washington with a big , bold plan to build 5,000 cargo planes and lick the shipping shortage-the kind of vast , impossible vision that Americans love . At Washington 's hands , the vision had suffered shabby treatment . <P> Kaiser was a proven miracle worker on great dams , in his great shipbuilding yards . Yet the Army &; Navy refused to see an ounce of sense in his new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn-nest opposition . Even after he won a go-ahead signal from Production Boss Donald Nelson ( TIME , Aug. 17 ) , the Army &; Navy still scoffed . <P> But this week Kaiser went back to his West Coast bailiwick with something more important than a half-won victory over the brass hats . He had set the nation 's imagination on fire ; even in stolid Washington the flames crackled and spread . <P> In the halls of Congress up rose Oklahoma 's Senator Josh Lee , to tell what his Military Affairs subcommittee thought of cargo planes and the men who scoffed at them . Senator Lee had always been an Administration stalwart , slow to criticize an official word or deed . Now his words sounded as if a new , fighting spirit were abroad on Capitol Hill : <P> <P> " Everyone appearing before the committee favored increasing the production of cargo aircraft , but there was a defeatist attitude on the part of some . A defeatist attitude is not warranted by the facts . <P> " It was said there is not enough aluminum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was said that we do not have enough steel . It was said we can not produce enough motors . <P> " No doubt these critical materials present problems , but all of them can be solved . They must be solved . . . . <P> " The Government could collect all the automobiles in used-car lots . The Government could take the iron railings from around yards , balconies and estates . The Government could take the chromium plated and nickel-plated fixtures from homes . If it were done without favoritism , the American people would approve it . More than that , they would applaud it . " <P> Up rose Wyoming 's Senator Joseph C. O'Mahoney with a hope and a prayer : " Week after week and month after month we wait for the aggressive leadership of which the Senator speaks . . . . " <P> Columnist Raymond Clapper examined the record of Kaiser 's trip to Washington , noted that there was nothing in writing to insure Kaiser 's plan a chance , decided that Washington had insulted the American spirit .
