" The Bismarck Sea may not be mine , but it is no longer his and he crosses it at his peril , " said Douglas MacArthur a year ago . It had begun to be his a few days before when his Fifth Air Force swooped down on a warship-escorted convoy off New Guinea and sank it to the last ship . <P> His control seemed cinched last week when 1 ) a horseless cavalry division made the key of the Admiralty Islands ( Los Negros ) theirs for keeps and 2 ) Marines jumped closer to Rabaul , the failing Jap stronghold on New Britain . <P> Cavalry . Fortnight ago MacArthur sent burly Major General Innis Palmer Swift and his 1st Cavalry Division into a surprise attack on Los Negros , in the center of the Bismarck Sea . Last week " Bull " Swift was able to sit down on Los Negros with a bottle of Japanese lemon pop in his big hand and tell how the job was done . <P> It had been a tough fight . It would be rugged until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main objectives had been captured . Momote airfield , swiftly taken , had been rehabilitated and U.S. fighter craft were operating from its strip in support of forward units . Jap shore batteries on nearby Manus Island had been silenced by Vice Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid 's navy and supply-burdened LSTs were unloading without enemy interference . One of the first Navy shipments : fresh beef to supplement the Army 's K-rations . <P> The airfield was secured following two violent Jap countercharges which dwindled finally into melodramatic suicide . Drunk with beer and saki , the Japs dashed in waves against American machine guns . <P> Some of the Nips embraced death with a song on their lips , " Deep in the Heart of Texas , " which gave wry satisfaction to the Texas cavalrymen who killed them . The survivors of the blast of U.S. fire ended it all by hugging grenades and pulling the pins . Said an American general veteran of the last war , " the strangest thing I have ever witnessed . " <P> Marines . Across the sea some 300 miles , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his 1st Marine Division had been fighting their way in the direction of Rabaul . It was a slow pace . Last week they speeded it up , jumped overwater to a new objective : the airfield and town of Talasea on the Willaumez Peninsula , 170 miles from Rabaul . <P> Soon Admiral Kinkaid 's PT boats will be using Talasea harbor as a base . Meanwhile Kinkaid 's navy , composed mostly of small craft , roams the Bismarck Sea at will , bears down with flaming guns to silence Jap shore batteries . Even PTs serve prominently in such activities . MacArthur described them as " shelling " several Jap positions . Observers of the heightening South Pacific war concluded that heavier weapons have been added to the PTs ' cluster of 50-caliber guns to help exploit the advantages and widening opportunities of the Bismarck Sea .
