txt BELGRADE , Nov. ** a speech marking a turning point in the struggle against the Communist Informatica Bureau , Premier Marshal Tito yesterday told the second congress of the Croatian Communist party in Zagreb that economic difficulties with the Cominform states had now obliged the Yugoslays to " reorganize and regroup " the five-year plan to industrialize their country and to eliminate all secondary projects . In perhaps the frankest assessment of the internal situation of a country ever made by a Communist leader , Marshal Tito said that the Yugoslays had overextended themselves economically and were obliged to retrench and concentrate all their resources just to achieve the five-year-plan . He said the plan would be carried out on time under a new directive and announced that the main target for the 1949 phase of the plan would be capital construction in basic heavy industries and // housing for the rapidly increasing industrial population . Marshal Tito said he was not afraid to admit publicly the weaknesses and difficulties of the present situation in Yugoslavia . Only the strong can afford to reveal their difficulties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lie said , must be sacrificed for the benefit of the main target which is to industrialize the country within five years . He maintained that this retrenchment was not a step backward but a reorganization taking into account Yugoslavia 's resources and potential . In a bitter diatribe against his internal enemies of the right and left , Marshal Tito promised to smash either or both if they resisted the party 's program . So far as the rich peasants were concerned , Marshal Tito said that destruction of the remnants of the capitalist class in rural areas was a matter of tactics and he posed the question : " Which is better , a frontal attack and suffer defeat or to show them that they must suffer defeat in the end and they must therefore lay down their arms ? " He said that liquidation of this class was taking place step by step and that unless it ceased resisting and unless it provided adequate quantities of wheat and agricultural produce for the industrial population very stern measures would be taken . Turning to what he described as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arbiters of Marxist ideology and who thought they could practice socialism better than the present Yugoslav leadership , Marshal Tito , reIferring to the Cominform supporters , said that they " will get the same answer as the reactionaries who attempted to oppose us " if they try to interfere with the party 's program . He bitterly criticized the Croatian Communists and Communists in other constituent republics of Yugoslavia for not paying heed to " the voice of the people . " " The five-year plan originated at a time when relations with our allies were much more favorable than they are today , " Premier Tito said . " We did not count on any kind of material gifts  --  or any one giving us help without value in return , but we hoped we would be , extended a friendly hand and friendly help . " Today , not through our fault , certain conditions have come about that precisely this position  --  help from friendly Socialist countries ? has declined to a great extent , and for this reason we have greater difficulties than otherwise . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was confined to the five-year plan and which became broader and broader as we went along , " he continued . " Cooperative centers and other projects were built , but a great deal of material was needed for these because they were put up everywhere . This , however , spread our existing possibilities too far . What must we do now ? We must confine ourselves to that which is most important . I am certain , comrades , that someone outside our country who hears what I am saying will say these people have made megalomaniacal plans and now they can not carry them out . This will be said not only by imperialists but also by those who are criticizing us in a very strange way . But we answer : we will carry out our plan  --  and carry it out we shall . " " I am not afraid to admit our difficulties and our weaknesses . Communists must never make a secret of their weaknesses and difficulties . We are speaking openly , and let anyone say what he will . We speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own strength . " We can speak of them because we can overcome them . He who is weak or incapable will of course make a secret of them , but we will not make a secret of them . We are strong and reunited . We have a united party and a united people , and that is a basic guarantee for the execution of our plan for our construction . " Sees Great Efforts Ahead " I have touched upon this in order to tell you that great efforts face us in the following year , 1949 , In that year we shall throw . all our forces in the construction of those projects of our five-year plan which will make it possible to accelerate building socialism in general and carry out the five-year plan in particular . " Therefore , in our capital construction we must not spread out too much but build in depth . Firstly , we must create that which is most imperative and that means that our working people and our Communists and all of our other leaders in our country must know one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic and that local things are only part of the whole . " Local interests must not dislocate the general plan . We must never lose sight of the principal targets  --  the blast furnaces , Marten furnaces , foundries , coal , coke , oil , and housing projects for our heavy Workers . These are the most essential . " This is not a step backward in the five-year plan . We are grouping and reorganizing internally . We are taking that which is most essential in order to work according to better planning and work in a more organized manner . After we have created the basic conditions of our industrialization then we will throw ourselves entirely into the production of those articles that are needed by our people and which will give our people more material proof of what socialism means . " Counsels Humanistic Attitude Marshal Tito said the Communist party leaders and rank and file of the party members must take a more humanistic view of the people of Yugoslavia in their dealings with them ; that it was no good commanding them do things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and consistent and persistent explanation of problems . He said there were too many shortages of basic necessities such as thatches and oil for lamps and that the peasants ' reaction was that a Government that could not solve such problems was a weak Government . He said that if the problems and current difficulties were fairly explained to the peasants they would understand them . Turning to the plight of the growing industrial population in Yugoslavia , he told the Communist congress that it was not enough simply to make a plan ; the plan must be made to work and the workers cared for . He said that the turnover of labor on projects throughout the country was far too great and was essentially caused by neglect of the authorities to provide good housing and good living conditions . Good apartments must be constructed - where the workers can have warm homes , where they can eat well and where they can have movies , radios and other amenities , he continued . " I must emphasize that 1949 will be a year of great effort in most basic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses , " he said .
