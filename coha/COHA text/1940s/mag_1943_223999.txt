Handsome William Averell Harriman , whose father left him a railroad kingdom , a fortune of $100,000,000 and a reputation of fearing " neither God nor J. P.

' s chairman of the board , he is known as one of the most liberal of U.S. industrialists , is also known as a hardheaded businessman who has made ( and sometimes lost ) millions on flyers of his own . <P> In London since 1941 as Franklin Roosevelt 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the U.S. and Great Britain , did a bang-up job , journeyed to Russia with Winston Churchill to confer with Joseph Stalin .
