txt The tightest situation in the history of New York hotel accomodations prevails now and will continue at least for several weeks , with thousands of guests being turned away daily and with many prospective visitors likely to find themselves without sleeping quarters unless they have managed to make reservations well in advance . Weary managers and other executives yesterday were kept busy answering pleas for rooms and turning down even old guests and well-known patrons who sought any kind of room available . An executive of the Vanderbilt Hotel reported that some offices and rooms of some members of the staff had been taken over to help fill the demand , with additional calls coming in steadily and no more space available for anyone , even though the management tried hard to place the prospective guests elsewhere . Some of the larger hotels , including the Waldorf-Astoria , are advertising in out-of-town papers that they can not make any more reservations for some days to come .

There was no space , even for those willing to pay almost any price . The New York correspondent for a mid-West newspaper seeking accommodations for a sports writer of that paper who will attend the World Series said he managed to get a reservation five days ahead only after calling eighteen hostelries . James H. McCabe , general manager of the Hotel Pennsylvania , reported that " thousands " of requests had been turned down in the last few days and that the hostelry was booked to capacity for two weeks . Mr. McCabe said the influx of service men and buyers was the principal factor . Buyers , he added , must come into the city twice as often as formerly ' to get merchandiie . A. spokesman for the New Yorker said prospective guests by the hundreds were being turned down daily and estimated that 65 per cent of the registration there consisted of men and women in uniform .

" The hotel 's placement bureau , established to cope with the abnormal situation , was reported having difficulty in finding rooms for transferred patrons even in Brooklyn , the Bronx and Newark . The Governor Clinton 's rooms for next week were sold out ten days ago . In an effort to ease the situation , the Hotel Association of New York City has set up a clearing house and reservation bureau to which the various hotels now are referring disappointed visitors . Even in the residential and apartment hotel field outside of the midtown district the situation was the same . Oscar Wintrab , managing director of Essex House on Central Park South , reported that he had not been able to take any additional reservations for the last two weeks , and that all space was filled for the next three weeks .

The situation was said to be worse than it was during one period of the first World War , the only previous comparable time . No such rush was experienced even during the World 's Fair in 1939 . War visitors , service men on leave , their relatives and friends , and some war-workers here for vacations or week-ends are partly responsible . Many suites also have been taken for the next few days by families waiting to get into their new apartments , now being painted or furnished . Another factor , especially in the residential hotels on the East SUN , is the increase in permanent residents , amounting in some cases to 90 per cent of the accommodations . This trend was laid to the fact that many persons , influenced by war restrictions , have closed their homes and taken city apartments .                 @ @ @ @
