On Whitman Avenue ( by Maxine Wood ; produced by Canada Lee &; Mark Marvin in association with George McLain ) brings an upstanding Negro family to live in a genteel white neighborhood . At once there are rumbles and soon there is an uproar . A sympathetic landlord and a few others fight the rest of the community to let the family stay , but the pressure becomes too great and the Negroes are forced out . <P> Despite its painfully vital theme and generally plausible story , On Whitman Avenue is flattish propaganda and flatter theater . Working from the problem in , instead of from the people out , it consistently substitutes cardboard for flesh &; blood , cliches for sharp , individual reactions . Dramatically , moreover , it soon hobbles , eventually halts . Fairly interesting while matters are coming to a head , from then on it can only . repeat its wrangles , restate its issues , and delay its ending .                    @
