D R. ALBERT COOMBS BARNES , of Merion , Pennsylvania , who owns the greatest collection of modern paintings in the world , claims he came by his most prized pictures by being an outright freebooter . " I just robbed everybody , " he says . " Particularly during the depression my specialty was robbing the suckers who had invested their money in flimsy securities and then had to sell their priceless paintings to keep a roof over their heads . " The only securities Barnes ever invested in were municipal , state and United States Government bonds . So he was equipped to take advantage of the financial distress of the owners of pictures he coveted . He acquired in this way his famous Cezanne , The Bathers . The dealer , Ambroise Vollard , a distinguished pioneer in modern art , had the painting and ref used to sell it . Vollard was a bold speculator , however , and his fortunes sometimes changed quickly . One day he came to Barnes and said it was urgent that he get a substantial sum of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doctor like to buy ? " The Bathers , of course . " " No , not that one , " said Vollafd . " That one or none . " " All right , " said Vollard finally . " How much will you give me for The Bathers ? " Barnes offered $65,000 . Vollard had previously turned down a bid of $200,000 for it , and said so . " Good-by then , " said Barnes . He got The Bathers for $70,000 . Another Ckanne , The Man With the Skull , he had wanted for a long time . A man in Switzerland owned it . A benefactor of the Chicago Art Institute had offered $150,000 , but the owner held out for $200,000 . The Swiss ultimately had to turn the picture over to a bank in Amsterdam as security for a loan . He called on the Philadelphia collector at his hotel in Paris one morning and told him he could n't pay the interest on the loan ; the bank was pressing him . He said if the painting were forced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near its value . The Man With the Skull was added to the Barnes collection for $50,000 . An Rmerican in Paris A DRAMATIC coup was the acquisition of Renoir 's Mlle.Jeanne Durand-Ruel . In his book on Renoir , Barnes says that this portrait of the young daughter of the noted art dealer and friend of Renoir is " one of the most successful pictures of Renoir 's entire career , " and adds that it " embodies the form and spirit of the eighteenth-century French tradition , but enormously enriched as an expression of the charm , daintiness and naive grace of childhood , ' The painting was for many years in the Durand-Ruel family , and at last Mlle. Durand-Ruel herself , now grown , became the owner of it . Naturally she would n't part willingly with this portrait of herself as a child . But circumstances played into Barnes ' hands ; she felt compelled to sell the picture she treasured so dearly . The canny connoisseur was notified and he appeared with ready cash . He got it for $50,000 . A Renoir of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's genius , had sold a short while before for twice that amount . Barnes says he would have given $150,000 for Mlle. Durand-Ruel 's painting , had it been necessary . Only a couple of months ago he went as high as $175,000 for a Renoir which Pierre , the patriarch of the Durand-Ruel family , had bought from the painter for one hundred dollars . The turbulent doctor had just the right mixture of Main Street and the Gallic spirit in his make-up to succeed in Paris . The French capital had seen so many Americans , but since John Paul Jones most of them had been disappointing . The Philadelphia importation was n't . He gave body and substance to the impression Paris had formed of -a model American from reading the works of James Fenimore Cooper . The blending of the two students into the Matisse canvas is crecidental , but symbolic of the Barnes Foundation , which believes that art is part of your daily life and that you can learn to appreciate it no matter who you are or what your schooling , provided you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's basically stupid and I 'm basically intelligent . " Doctor Barnes ' favorite hangout in Paris was the Little Temple , the studio of Paul Guillaume , the art dealer . Frequenters of the Little Temple were all geniuses or a reasonable facsimile thereof , and the talk had a rich , nutty flavor to which Barnes made his own contribution . Once he remembers holding forth on modern art there with six chiefs of African tribes and four principals of the Imperial Russian Ballet , plus Diaghileff himself , the great master of the Russian ballet . At the Little Temple one day be got into an argument with the noted art critic , Waldemar George . The critic was fluent and assured . His opponent squirmed impatiently , trying to edge a word in . Finally Barnes jumped up and put on his hat . " Hell , " he said , cutting off M. George 's discourse , " we ca n't discuss paintings unless we 're looking at them . Come on ! " He led M. George into a taxicab and took him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture , he harangued him for fuur hours without interruption . Suddenly the critic , who was otherwise only human , fell to the floor in a faint . A Philadelphia Feud B ARNES came to know the French group of 11 . J composers known as The Six ? Satie , Auric , Honegger , Milhaud , Poulenc , and Talliaferroat the Little Temple . The doctor , who has a working knowledge of music , included modern music among his enthusiasms . This led him to become dissatisfied with the symphonic war horses performed at concerts of the Philadelphia Orchestra , which he attended regularly during the winter season . Finally , when Leopold Stokowski ventured some unsought advice to Barnes about his paintings , the latter wrote to the blond maestro of the orchestra about the Stokowski music . " When I think of your almost unique genius and great opportunities , " said he , " I blush for your hackneyed programs . . . for your failure or delay until it is ' old hat ' in Europe to give adequate new work of real merit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bells or Mahler 's spectacular banalities or Wagner 's voluptuous debauches or Weber 's inanities . Why give us so much of the soul stuff that nourishes the idle , the ignorant , the lazy , the delmuchli , to whom in music the only thing is the cheap emotional orgy , the ' dreamy reverie relieved by nervous thrills ' ? " A few days later Barnes met a friend of Stokowski 's on the street . The friend was agitated . " What did you write to Stokowski ? " he demanded . " After reading it , Stoky was n't able to conduct the Friday-afternoon concert . " Barnes knew personally many of the prominent French politicians , was an intimate of most of the leaders of the Popular Front . He was told that the reason he was accepted in the inner circle was that he was one wealthy American who admired Franklin D. Roosevelt . He idolizes the President , but does not include Mrs. Roosevelt in this admiration . At the salon of Mme. Marie Cuttoli , whose husband was a veteran member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Chamber of Deputies , Yvon Delbos , onetime foreign minister , and Henri Laugier , professor at the Sorbonne and Delbos ' adviser . who is now on the faculty of the University of Montreal . Barnes ' lapses , amidst a scholarly dissertation , into the lingo of the U. S. smoking car delighted these notables . The irascible American steadily outraged the Louvre . Each summer he financed a trip to Europe for a dozen or so of the more promising students of the Barnes Foundation . He would meet the students in Paris , Vienna and Madrid , and supervise their communion with art in the top-ranking galleries . His lectures to them in the Louvre every day ( Continued on Page 34 ) 47 p . WHILE AMERICA was engaged in the pursuits of peace , Pontiac was regarded everywhere as " the fine car with the low price . " Forward-looking engineering and careful manufacture were responsible for that . Now the same progressive attitude has developed a modern , low-cost maintenance plan which not only Pontiac owners but owners of all cars will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris proved almost as big a drawing card for tourists as the Mona Lisa . A hitter foe of the " Lovely ! Lovely ! " school of art appreciation , he would tell his charges what the pictures were all about in the forthright speech of a bricklayer . Untutored wanderers in the Louvre would jump at this chance to kibitz on understandable art knowledge and crowd eagerly around . The doctor , far from objecting , would talk louder as the group got larger . Once a guide escorting two elderly women through the Louvre came alongside Barnes and his fellow travelers . There were so many in his camp that Barnes was shouting , The guide tried to match that , and was doing quite well when one of his clients stopped him . " Monsieur , " she said , " we are not deaf . Why do you scream ? " Barnes ' outstanding pupil in his European class was his best friend , John Dewey . The philosopher was interested in the scientific approach to art , and so , paying his own way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles through the galleries of Paris , Madrid and Vienna . He was an alert listener to the lectures and methodically took notes on them . One afternoon when Barnes was talking on Raphael at the Prado in Madrid , he was chagrined to see that Dewey was asleep . He chided Dewey about it later . " Well , " said Dewey , " I had read what you wrote about Raphael in your book , The Art in Painting . You said he was n't much of an artist , so there was no point in my staying awake to hear you say it all over again . " When Dewey wrote his book , Art as Experience , he consulted his friend frequently and would submit pages of the manuscript to him . If Barnes did n't like what Dewey had written , he would say so forcefully and Dewey would write it over again . Dewey dedicated the book to Barnes , " in gratitude . " The fIrt in Painting Both men were surprised to read in a recent biography of the philosopher that Dewey had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it . " The statement , " he replied , " is so remote from the facts as to be absurd . Not only had Doctor Barnes been building up his collection long before I made his acquaintance but I derived my interest in and knowledge of pictures as a form of art from Doctor Barnes . As a member of his class in Europe in 1926 I was in the process of obtaining my own aesthetic education . " Barnes says he is used by now to the reports that almost everybody , except him , formed his collection . Glackens is the only one who ever assisted him , he attests , and of the twenty pictures that Glackens picked for him , Barnes later replaced eight with better ones . Even under German occupation , they still must remember the mad Philadelphian at the Louvre . When the doctor writes a book he does not wait for inspiration , that occupational disease of authors . Rather , he would embark at once for Paris with a research staff . Every afternoon he would be accompanied to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would dictate rapidly his impressions and analyses of such paintings as merited his approval or contempt . Then at night the research staff would help him correlate his material . The material gathered , Barnes would retire to Port-Manech , a Brittany fishing village . Rising at six and after taking a fast walk along the shore , he would write in longhand for eight hours at a stretch . These pages would be dispatched in batches to America for typing by a secretary who could read his handwriting . The great Barnes work is his The Art in Painting . Its 500 printed pages were written in six months . It has been published in several editions at six dollars a copy , is used as a textbook in 100 or more American and European colleges and universities . Paris Personage Ezra Pound , the poet , has called it " by far the most intelligent book on painting that has appeared in America . " And Waldemar George , after reading it , wrote : " Doctor Barnes is the only man of whom I have any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities from the subject matter of a picture . Whether in the presence of a Raphael , a Paolo Veronese , a Tintorett-o , or an Italian Primitive , he can detect with extraordinary insight that frequently complex structure of forms and color in which the painter has embodied his creative purpose . " Barnes is the author of several other books in collaboration with Violette de Mazia , a teacher at the Barnes Foundation  --  The Art of Renoir , The Art of Cezanne , The Art of Henri Matisse , and The French Primitives and Their Forms . Barnes was a hero to the villagers of Port-Manech . They made him , in fact , honorary mayor . And on August fifteenth , when the Feast of the Assumption was celebrated , the doctor marched at the head of the procession , even in front of the priest . It was when a Frenchman attempted to blackmail him , Barnes says , that he knew he was a personage in Paris . He was drinking at a sidewalk caf ? with Paul Guillaume when a man came up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to write a very uncomplimentary article , which Barnes could prevent only by the payment of 50,000 francs . The doctor related the incident to his friend , the then American ambassador , Myron Herrick , who got in touch with Jean Chiappe , head of the SUret-6 Gkerale . Chiappe learned that the blackmailer had , it seemed , actually declared he intended to kill Barnes . Chiappe displayed typical French logic . " Why do n't you shoot the blackmailer first ? " he asked . The Philadelphian said it was urgent that he catch a ship home the next day . " Shoot the blackmailer first , and then you wo n't miss your ship , " said Chiappe . " If you do n't , " he added darkly , " you might . " Chiappe furnished Barnes with a price list of the services of a band of Corsicans who dealt with such enemies of the people-500 francs , a light trimming ; 1000 francs , much worse ; 2000 franca , put the offender in the hospital . Barnes gave an artist he knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the blackmailer , and sailed happily for America . He was by then generally recognized in Europe as having the finest collection of modern art anywhere . But in Philadelphia he was called , because of his tastes in art , a perverter of public morals . This reputation was enhanced in January , 1941 , when the Main Line Lorenzo , with the bland statement that " the sky 's the limit on what you may say here , " opened wide the doors of the Barnes Foundation to Bertrand Russell , the British philosopher and radical . Because of the unorthodoxy of his published views on sex and morals , Russell had been barred by a New York court action from teaching at the College of the City of New York . Barnes , long an admirer of Russell and his writings , considered the decision of the New York Supreme Court justice a serious infringement of academic freedom . He issued a blast that must have carried the ninety-mile distance to New York , in which he said that the Russell ousting was the work of bigoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train to California , where Russell was by then living , and signed him to a five-year contract to come to the foundation to teach a course on the history of ideas from the early Greeks down to the present . On his first day at the foundation , Russell lectured in the main gallery . Russell , who admits that he does n't care much for art , except that of the Chinese , faced , as he spoke , Ckanne 's big Bathers and a wall glowing with Renoir nudes . All subsequent lectures have been held in a smaller gallery on the second floor . Asked later why his class was moved , Russell said , " So many nudes are distracting to a philosopher lecturing on philosophy . " Russell lectures one hour every Thursday from October to May inclusive , for which he is paid $8000 a year . Barnes sits in the rear of the room and listens attentively , a deference he pays to very , very few . A chair beside Barnes is reserved for an old employee who was once his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a salary equal to Russell 's . From the foundation enrollment of 200 students the staff selected fifty whose background it was thought would enablethem to appreciate Russell 's teaching . In addition there are in the class ten teachers of philosophy in colleges and universities in the Philadelphia vicinity . The foundation had requests from about 300 outsiders who wished to take Russell 's course . In English that is a model of simplicity . Russell makes his subject understandable and rather exciting to those even who may never have heard of Pythagoras or ca n't tell Aristotle from Plato . He painstakingly writes out difficult names and subject matter on an old-fashioned blackboard like a rural pedagogue . Now and then he dismisses the sex life of some ancient civilization with frankness . After his lectures the class besieges him with questions . One of Barnes ' assistants keeps close tab on these questions . If a student persists in asking flippant or irrelevant questions his membership in the class is short-lived . Whether Russell still regards the foundation as a refuge is not known . There can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . For Mrs. Russell it has been anything but a refuge . She is not allowed inside the foundation . The former Miss Patricia Helen Spence , she was Russell 's secretary before their marriage in England in 1936 and was named as corespondent by his second wife . She is red-haired , slender , vivacious and pretty . She and Russell  --  with their son , Conrad , aged four  --  live on a farm twenty-five miles from the foundation . She drives Russell to Merion and she used to remain sometimes for his lectures . In telephoning to the foundation early in Russell 's tenure there , she referred to herself as Lady Russell . Since Russell has renounced his title of earl and prefers to be called plain Mr. Russell instead of Lord Russell , Barnes was annoyed . He said , " She seems to have difficulty swallowing the impressive title of Lady Russell . It evidently gets stuck just below her larynx , for she regurgitates it automatically . " Soon there were more irritations . " When she came to the foundation , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there struck her as the ideal place to do her stuff . She high-hatted the officials . She acted as if she had the right to abolish the foundation 's rules . She indulged in grandstand stunts . After she had exhausted her repertoire , we changed her name from Patricia to Plebeia and told her to go home and stay there . " What precipitated the final row , which kept the foundation tense for several weeks , was the fact that Mrs. Russell attended her husband 's lectures without first getting the permission of the foundation officials , and she knitted in the class . Seldom , if ever , since the French Revolution , has a pair of knitting needles been so symbolic . The foundation decided upon drastic action last October . Barnes met with the board of trustees . It was reported at the meeting that students sitting near Mrs. Russell were handicapped in their concentration on Russell 's teaching by the clicking of his wife 's needles . A letter was dispatched to Mrs. Russell which cited her " indulgence in knitting , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . finds it advisable to ask Mrs. Russell to observe certain relevant regulations which have been found necessary and which apply to all persons alike  --  namely : " The Foundation has never been a place where people may drop in occasionally , at their own volition , nor is any person whosoever allowed to do things that interfere with the rights of others or are harmful to the Foundation 's interests . . " Russell himself replied to the trustees . He protested that the letter to his wife was " astonishing by its incivility . " By return mail he was told that the trustees considered their letter to Mrs. Russell to be , " in view of the circumstances , inordinately courteous . " The trustees explained that they had acted in the matter to forestall these questions by students : " Why not let Anybody attend the class whenever it suits his convenience , and why not make a sewing circle of the session ? " At his next lecture Russell apologized to the students on behalf of Mrs. Russell for her knitting . He went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not permitted at his lectures . He said she had attended his lectures at Oxford and Harvard and the Universities of Chicago and California without objection . Paradise Lost After the lecture Barnes arose and said , " Mr. Russell , in saying that Oxford , Harvard and Chicago and California did not object to your wife 's presence at your lectures , do you mean to imply that there is something wrong with the way the foundation conducts its affairs ? " " Oh , no , " said Russell . Later Mrs. Russell decided to rally to her own defense . She wrote to the trustees that she hoped they might long continue to enjoy their " unreal paradise . " Then , her mood shifting from insouciance to moral indignation , she continued : " As for my knitting ; it was with some hesitation that I took it with me on two or perhaps three occasions ? to the Barnes Foundation ; but when I consulted my husband , he remarked that I had disturbed no one by my knitting at far more difficult and technical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Harvard , and that therefore I might assume that I would be giving no offense . " My knitting is in no sense an ' indulgence ' and I would not have run the risk of annoying anyone by it , however slightly , but for a purpose that seems to me serious , the wish todiminish the number of those who suffer from the cold . " If I am sometimes a little cold myself in the future , when . . . I wait for my husband outside the Barnes Foundation ( outside the grounds , of course ) I will knit with more zest from a nearer realization of what it must mean to be cold and really without shelter ; and I will marvel that in such a world anyone should be willing , deliberately , to make one fellow human cold even for one hour . And I will marvel , too , as I do now , that anyone should wish , in a world so full of mountains of hostility , to magnify so grandiloquently so petty a molehill . " This appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the foundation trustees . Democracy Triumphant " It was . . . sweet of you , " th ? foundation 's answer to Mrs. Russell said . " to tell us . . . that a superior , well-bred , learned , charitable , kindhearted soul should not be informed by barbarians that her presence in their midst is undesirable . How to bear up under the disgrace is our most serious problem at the moment . " Barnes then wrote to Russell . He said that everyone at the foundation liked him personally and his lectures , but asked him to realize " that when we engaged you to teach we did not obligate ourselves to endure forever the trouble-making propensities of your wife . " To this Russell replied that " whoever quarrels with my wife quarrels with me . " In a final volley Barnes told Russell that apparently he assumed responsibility for his wife 's " disorders " at the foundation , and that if Mrs. Russell " ever enters the door of our gallery " an official had been instructed " how to deal with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " The question Mrs. Russell forced us to settle was whether autocracy or democracy was to prevail in the conduct of the foundation 's affair . We voted unanimously in favor of democracy . " If you suppose that this ended the Russell lectures , you are mistaken ; he goes on quite merrily . And it has not altered Barnes ' estimate of the quality of Russell 's teaching or its value to the foundation . Barnes has not abandoned the battle for Russell in the C. C. N. Y. matter . Some months ago he spent $2000 to have published a book called The Bertrand Russell Case . In it nine scholars , including John Dewey , Horace M. Kellen , Walton H. Hamilton , Morris R. Cohen and Sidney Hook , dealt with various aspects of the proceedings . In a foreword Barnes said that at stake was " the lifeblood of Democracy , the right of every individual to he free from tyrannical acts of dictators , which , as in the Russell case , usurp the rights of the people , violate the basic principles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the whole Nation . " In the ten years from 1910 to 1926 that the citizen of Merion was becoming recognized as a world force in art , folks back home continued to look upon him as just another rich man who did n't know what to do with his millions and was therefore buying pictures . The awakening came in 1921 , when his native city learned about Barnes and modern art at the same time . The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts asked him to exhibit his ( Continued on Page 38 ) ! Continued from Page 36 ) paintings there . The doctor , with some pride in his unequaled collection , accepted . But the Philadelphia public took one look at the startling examples of postimpressionism he displayed and clapped its hands over its eyes . A group of alienists and psychologists led by the nationally famous Dr. Francis X. Dercum pronounced publicly that the artists who painted such things were either crazy or moral degenerates . Said one , " The works represent those ghastly lesions of the mind and of the body which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit them to walk about , and feed themselves , avoid a commission of lunacy , and paint . " Said another , " I have seen the work of insane persons who lean toward art and I will say that the drawings of these insane artists are far superior to the alleged works of art I saw at the exhibition . " Said a third , " These are quack practitioners of art . They are cheats . They care less for art than the wicked pleasure they derive from distorted representations of the human form . " Barnes looks upon himself as a psychologist of distinction , and whipped the learned psychologists with psychology . " Who , pray , " he asked in a public statement , " seriously interested in the science of normal and abnormal psychology has ever heard of them ? I have one of the most complete libraries in this country on normal and abnormal psychology and nowhere can I find any of their names recorded . If any of them will qualify , say , at the next meeting of the American Psychological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aesthetics , I shall give to the city of Philadelphia my entire collection of paintings and a suitable gallery to house them . " Otherwise , he admonished " the elderly doctors " to accept gracefully " the inevitable of fireside , slippers and silence . " The incident filled him with a brooding feeling that the people of Philadelphia were incurably backward , a feeling that he has n't been able to shake off to this day . In 1922 , the next year after his row with the doctors , Barnes announced that he was building a private gallery for his collection . It was to be known as the Barnes Foundation , and the general public was not to be admitted . Cynics saw in this a bit of exclusiveness that had n't been matched since old King Ludwig of Bavaria erected a theater for himself with only one seat in it . Art for Tom , Dick and Harry But far from sequestering his art for himself , Barnes ' declared purpose was to establish in the foundation a system of democracy in education based on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dewey . It was to be a school endowed with $10 , - 000,000 , so that young men and young women could learn to understand art , tuition free . The reception accorded the exhibition of his paintings convinced him , he said , that the general run of art patrons were snobs . So it was his plan to bring artistic knowledge to Tom , Dick and Harry , who would n't otherwise have a chance to get it . Owen J. Roberts , now a justice of the Supreme Court , drew up a charter to that effect . The foundation 's aims , and details of their execution , were described minutely in a set of by-laws . Barnes was named president ; his wife , Laura L. Barnes , vice president , and Miss Nelle Mullen , who had looked after the management of the A. C. Barnes Co. , secretary and treasurer . The trustees consisted . of Barnes , Mrs. Barnes , Miss Mullen , the latter 's sister , Miss Mary Mullen , also a former employee of the A. C. Barnes Co. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barnes bought the land for the foundation . The only change that has occurred in the official directory has been the election of Miss de Mazia , a teacher at the foundation , as a trustee , succeeding the late Captain Wilson . fin Academic Tilt Coincidently with the opening of the foundation , its president established a chair of modern art at the University of Pennsylvania , his alma mater , and the students of those classes were given access to the gallery . Again Philadelphia sent up distress signals . The senior professor at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts asserted that this meant that " Bolshevist " ideas were invading the university . " I can not imagine a greater calamity , " he said . In retaliation Barnes excluded from his gallery all members of the faculty of the academy , because , he said , they came there " habitually in a state of profound intoxication . " Meanwhile the university , Barnes noted , was n't above looking his gift in the mouth . It cagily announced that the Barnes courses were not part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he detected other signs , he said later , of " inertia and hostility " by the university . In May , 1926 , Barnes wrote to university officials and told them that he intended that the university was ultimately to have his art collection , with an income provided by him to support the foundation in perpetuity . But accompanying this offer was a formidable memorandum in which Barnes listed all the things he thought were wrong with the university 's setup . He suggested that Penn students , as they had been observed at the foundation , were not quite bright . Terms used in ordinary discussion of mental processes and reactions , such as " instinct " and " perception , " he said , were meaningless to them . He said these deficiencies would have to he remedied , and recommended that the university 's art school be reorganized . The university did n't even bother to acknowledge his letter . So , in November , 1926 , this note from the secretary of the Barnes Foundation was delivered to the secretary of the university : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University of Pennsylvania has been suspended from further participation in our education program . The suspension takes effect as of this date . " University officials wrote letters of explanation of the " unintended discourtesy " shown him . One of his staff replied that when Barnes read these letters " what he said beat anything I ever heard him attempt in picturesque profanity . " Thus ended the possibility of the university inheriting $20,000,000 worth of art plus the foundation 's endowment . It also drove the foundation into an isolation that was both splendid and impenetrable . Never again did it enter into any entangling alliance with another institution , no matter how eminent .
