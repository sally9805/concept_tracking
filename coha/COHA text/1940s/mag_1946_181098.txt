In a blurred , easy voice , Decontrol Board Chairman Roy Thompson let the big price secret out through the nation 's radios . Livestock , meat , soybeans , cottonseed , flaxseed and their by-products would go back under controls on a date to be fixed by the OPA . Dairy products and most grains would not . " I expect , " concluded Chairman Thompson , red-eyed from weariness , " that we are going to hear plenty of criticism . " <P> He was right . Next day , C.I.O. President Phil Murray sang out lustily because any controls had been dropped . Industry 's top stentor , U.S. Chamber of Commerce President William K. Jackson , yelled because any had been kept . Lesser fry-packers , cattle and grocery men , the pro-and anti-control press , etc. - broke out in a contagion of argument . Last of all , the consumer took up the battle with violent yes and no messages to the Board . <P> To Specification . To the biased glance , the price decisions seemed a studied compromise . They were-and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Daniel W. Bell , who had bravely picked up the coals hot-handled them by Congress last July , had followed congressional standards in determining recontrol . The standards : 1 ) the price of a commodity must have risen unreasonably since June 30 ; 2 ) the commodity must be in short supply ; 3 ) its regulation must be enforceable ; 4 ) its recontrol must serve the public interest . These standards , in some respects political , in all respects loosely phrased , were Congress ' way of hedging the free market . <P> In the Board 's opinion , meat , soybeans , cottonseed etc. had qualified for a return to price ceilings on every count during the price-free period ( July 1 to Aug. 20 ) . Milk prices had risen less . That was all there was to it . Gratefully , the Board moved off the griddle to await the decontrol questions that would be passed up from the Agriculture Department and OPA , and to keep its price-eye on the free-wheeling dairy folk . Congress , and supposedly the people , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step toward a free market , but it was a hesitant , tentative step . <P> Time for Figuring . Agriculture and OPA , which knew nothing of the board 's decisions until their general release , joined forces as soon as they heard the news , decided they would need another no-ceiling week ( ending Aug. 29 ) while the machinery of bureaucracy figured the new meat prices . They picked Sept. 9 as the date to put them into effect in the butcher shops . Nobody knew what they would be , although OPA Boss Paul Porter guessed " at or near June 30 levels . " But lamb feeders , cut off from a $36 million Government subsidy , were sure their product would have to jump at least 5 a lb . Beef feeders , still smarting under similar subsidy treatment , figured 1#162 ; a Ib . Meanwhile , meat producers frantically rushed their crops to market ( see BUSINESS ) .
