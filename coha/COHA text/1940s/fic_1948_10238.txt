Cerro Gordo has reported it already . " " Oh ! " said the voice with a quick shift to let-down disappointment . Then it went suddenly into a high sing-song : " Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of smoke ? " and then added matter-of-factly , " Solomon 's Song , three-six . " Bart clicked down the receiver , not knowing whether to be pleased or amused or irritated . The old guy on Horse Mountainwas still a top-notch lookout , but getting daffier on reli/gion all the time . Anyway , no time to worry about that just now . He hurriedly got into slippers and his brown bathrobe , and started for the office . The loose slippers did not serve well for running , and as he scuttled across the hundred yards he looked like a middle-aged brown-robed monk trying not to be late for matins , his bald spot even serving as a good imitation of a tonsure . As he ran , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That meant bad enough , but not too bad . In the control-room he flipped the radio-switch , and as he waited for the tubes to warm up , he turned to the wall-map with its push-pin for each lookout . Six-six-point-five for Cerro Gordo led out northeasterly , and three-two-oh for Horse Mountain , northwesterly . The threads crossed on the south slope of the ridge to the north of Onion Creek , but he would try to get another reading before he committed his crew . He spoke into the microphone : " Z-17 calling Z-142 . . . . Z-17 calling Z-142 . . . . Come in , Z-142 . . . . Come in , Z-142 . " He paused , hoping . Slugger O'Neill was not notable for brains , but any boss of an isolated crew should know enough to be standing by with his radio this time of morning . " Z-17 calling Z-142 . . . . Z-17 calling Z-142 . . . . Come in , Z-142 . . . . Come in , Z-142 . " He thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio-transmission . And then , so clear that he could recognize the bass tones of the voice , Slugger O'Neill spoke to him across twenty-five miles of canyons and ridges : " Z-142 to Z-17 . . . . Z-142 to Z-17 . . . Go ahead , Z-17 . . . . Go ahead , Z-17 . " Bart dropped the formality :  | " Say , Slugger , this is Bart . We 've got a smoke somewhere over by Onion Creek . I say : somewhere over by Onion Creek . You 're the nearest crew . So get your men ready to hit it in a hurry . Get your men ready . You hear me ? " " I get yuh , Bart . " " 0 . K.  --  Get ready and stand by on the radio . I want to get a third cross from Hamlin Point , and then I 'll be back with orders in a minute . Back with orders in a minute . Z-17 over and out . . . . Z-i7 over and out . " The youngsters were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? . . . Who was it ? . . . We got a fire ? " They quieted as he straightened up from talking into the transmitter . " Come on , you guys ! We 're alerted ! . . . One ax , three shovels , two McLeods . . . . Canteens all round . . . . Two K-rations apiece . . . . Radio . . . . Get set ! I 'm standing by for orders . " The flurry of preparation hardly lasted a minute . " Get the camp policed ! " Slugger yelled from where he again crouched beside the radio , ear-phones in place : " Wet down the campfire ! " " Slugger , do we eat breakfast before we start ? " " We do not ! But sling something together so we can eat on the trail . " Then the radio squawked : " Z-17 calling . . . " They hit the trail at 5:42 , the shadows still deep and cool . The boys shouted back and forth eagerly . Going to a fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In spite of their nondescript clothing they looked like a band of primitive warriors , shovels and McLeods like weapons for hand-to-hand combat , as they strung out in single-file along the narrow trail . Slugger led the way , carrying the doublebittedax , like the chieftain . They had about two miles to go ,  |p104and  with Slugger setting the pace it would be a lot like a twomilerun . Once Bart had got the crew started in , he relaxed a little . There was still much to be done , but it did not need to be done in such a hurry . He checked the aerial photographs , just to be sure , although from long familiarity with the country he knew already that the fire was burning in heavy forest on a steep slope . He called his clerk-dispatcher , and told her to get dressed and take over the office . He called Cerro Gordo and Horse Mountain and Hamlin Point again , and found that the smoke was building up some , as you would expect . ( Horse Mountain quoted Jeremiah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crew of five eager boys with a driver for a crew-boss ought to hit the fire soon enough and hard enough to get it well corralled before the heat and rising wind of afternoon made it more dangerous . Given any kind of break , that is . That was the trouble  --  the break might go the other way . He rose nervously , and shuffled across the floor in slippers . The fire was in such an isolated spot that he had no other crew he could throw at it in a hurry . And Slugger , though he had his points , was no strategist . At that moment the fire which was causing so much commotionthroughout Barlow District was actually , on the spot , still far from terrifying . Grown suddenly intense by its engulfingof the clump of saplings , it had made the most of some good puffs of down-canyon wind just before dawn , and had taken off at right angles to its previous direction of advance . On a front of only a few yards it had made a quick run of some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an occasional clump of young trees . By this very activity , however , the fire had also workedp105against itself by sending up enough smoke to attract the attention of creatures whose racial experience , unlike that of the ants , included a familiarity with fire . Men did not merely stand and wave their arms ; instead , they came swarming out with set purpose and weapons of offense . As late as 5:53 a single active man with a shovel could have scraped away the duff from the front of the fire , and gradually extending his line could have contained the flames and let them burn themselves out . Since at that same time Slugger and his boys were little more than half-an-hour distant , anyonemust have concluded that the fire was doomed . At that minute , however , one chance out of the millions possible contrived to change the situation considerably . In its diagonal upslope advance before the down-canyon wind , the fire had at last reached the pine-cone which rested against the dead twig . Both cone and branch were soon blazing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broke at the point where the cone rested against it . The cone toppled downhill , rolled two feet , wobbled  --  hesitated . ( If it had been a long sugar-pine cone , it would have rolled uncertainly and have come to rest ; if it had been the tiny cone of a Douglas fir , it would have lodged in some little roughness of the ground ; but it was the almost spherical cone of a Jeffrey pine , eight inches through its shortest diameter . ) It toppled again with the thrust of gravity and momentum , rolled a foot , then picking up speed , went rolling and bouncing and leaping erratically downward . The wind of its own movement made it blaze more fiercely . A flying ball of fire , it catapulted down the canyon-side , leaving a trail of sparks and burning scales behind . It struck a tree-trunk , ricocheted , rolled on again , caromed off a rock , and finally came to rest against a log , a good hundred yards from where it had started . Many of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment and then went out . But many othersignited the tinder-like needles . A hundred-yard-long trail of smoke puffs began to rise . In thickly littered places the dry twigs soon blazed up . The tiny isolated fires reached out and joined . The log where the cone had come to rest began to smoke vigorously . Here and there a seedling flared up ; underbrushbegan to crackle . All the heat combined to form an updraft , and the air flowing in from below blew up the flames . In an inconsiderable time the fire had thus become several times more dangerous . Its area had not greatly increased , but because of the long down-hill shoe-string the perimeter which would have to be contained within a cleared line had quadrupled . Still , the life-hold of the fire was by no means assured . If one man could have suppressed it before the cone rolled , six would now be adequate . Slugger 's crew was over the ridge . On the steep switchbacks the pace had told , but now they were on the headwaters of Onion Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lead as the trail swung round a shoulder . " There she is ! " he yelled , halting . The boys came crowding up behind him , and saw , from well down toward the bottom of the canyon to a point more than halfway up , a faint line of smoke with a denser column at the top . " She 's not going places , " said one of them . " We can catch her all right . " " Got a long front , if an up-canyon wind comes along , " said another . He was the smallest and they called him Shorty ; the pace had tuckered him out , and he was sweating hard . But the pause was only momentary . As at the sound of the gong , Slugger had been used to rush from his corner head-onp107at his opponent , so now he sighted across and down the canyon , straight at the nearest smoke , and his fighting spirit took over . " Come on , you ! " he yelled thunderously , and plunged diagonally down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelps of enthusiasm the boys followed him . For a moment , however , the smallest one hesitated . He was tired , and glancing ahead he saw clearly enough that by following the trail farther before taking the plunge a man should be able to get to the fire sooner and more easily . Then he went with the crowd , sliding and scrambling downward , fifty feet behind the others . Ten minutes later they came puffing up the other side . Slugger halted about twenty feet from where the smoke was rising along the upper side of a log . Even he was blowing hard from the breakneck downhill plunge , the fight through the brush along the creek , and the steep climb up two hundred feet with sliding shale and slippery pine-needles for a footing . " Look  --  you-guys  --  " he panted . " Spread out  --  along thedown-canyonside.  --  Say  --  who ai n't here ? " " Shorty  --  he slipped  --  jumpin ' th ' crick . Hurt his knee  --  he 's comin '  --  but he 's slow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump  --  a crick these days ?  --  Well , get busy , you four ! " " What about the radio ? " said the boy who was carrying it . " Well , s'pose I oughtta  --  call Bart . Ah , t'hell with it ! It 'll take ten minutes . I 'm goin ' t'scout this fire first .  --  Get a dinklineup that side first . I got ta see what  --  we 're up against . " The theory of fighting a forest-fire is simple . Since there is no way available for extinguishing the blaze , you merely confineit within a fire-line , and let it burn itself out . An ordinary fire-line is a foot or two wide . From it all duff must be scrapedp108away , so that the creeping ground-fire will die for lack of fuel . Above the ground all low overhanging branches must be cleared out , and in thickets this means the cutting of brush and saplings . The high branches of the mature trees are ignored , in the hope that they will not catch fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a crown-fire , in which flames tower up high above the highest trees , and pass from one treetopto the next in complete disregard of fire-lines . Since heat , unless driven by a strong wind , rises sharply upward , the amount of conflagration short of a crown-fire that a narrow fire-line can stop is often little short of seeming miraculous . In the files of the Forest Service are endless statistics showinghow many feet of line a man can build under such and such average conditions , but as any Ranger or Fire-Crew Foreman can tell the world , average conditions never exist , and every fire is a special case . Theoretically Slugger O'Neill had hit the fire at 6:23 with a crew of six . Actually , one of them had bumped his knee , and was not yet up the hill . Also , Slugger himself went off , as was right and proper , to scout the fire , taking with him the ax . Therefore , four men with three shovels and a McLeod began to build line . All four were winded and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , endingwith the dash across-canyon . Just when they should have been at the height of enthusiasm they were really hitting their first slump . They got to work with a fair show of spirit , but the vigorous cursing showed that they were driving themselves . Immediately also the problem of tools arose . " One ax , three shovels , two McLeods , " Slugger had ordered , but shovels were not adapted to work on the rocky canyon-side . The McLeod  --  afoot-wide heavy hoe on one side , a kind of broad/toothed rake on the other  --  was just the thing for scraping away the duff until the unburnable raw earth showed through . Also they soon needed the ax , which Slugger had taken with him . But what tools to take to a fire and how to have the right tool ready at the proper time and place  --  these two problems have been the ruin of many a better firestrategistthan Slugger O'Neill , and can never be wholly solved , short of omniscience . The McLeod-man worked rapidly up-hill clearing a narrow " dink-line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be widened later . One shovel-man went along with him , doing what he could . Two shovel-men , however , became involved with the smokinglog . Actually that spot was no more dangerous than a hundred others along the perimeter , but the average human being has a strong tendency toward concern about what he sees before him , and toward lack of concern about what he does not see . The log was smoking heavily , and beginning to burn , along six feet of its length . To dig out a line all around a sixty-foot log just because it was burning along six feet seemed too much work . So they pecked at the burning part with their shovels ineffectually . They might have chopped it out , but Slugger had the ax . After some minutes the sixth man came limping up the hill with his McLeod . He manfully tried to scrape the fire out , but accomplished nothing except to get his McLeod hot enough to lose some of its temper . Then the shovel-men scooped up dirt from the stony ground , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not put the fire out , they reduced it to temporary harmlessness . By this time Slugger , having made the circuit , came sliding down the hill on the other side of the fire . Seeing three men puttering with one log while nine-tenths of the fire was still uncontrolled , he cursed them out , and sent two of them upp110to the upper end of the fire . The lamed one he assigned , with a shovel , to work along the lower point and watch for rolling cones . Slugger himself went up along the front of the fire to clear out brush and saplings with the ax , where it was necessary . Under the stress of exerting his authority he forgot to set up the radio and report in . By a quarter of seven Bart had eaten breakfast , and dressed , and been back in the office long enough to be feeling nervous . Slugger should have reported by now , telling what the fire looked like close up and whether he thought he could handle it with his crew . No news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No news was simply no news . Still , that made a man nervous , just not knowing . A great many things could happen on a fire , and some of them usually did . The lookouts reported a build-up of smoke for a while , and then a gradual dying down . That ought to mean that the boys were getting some work done . The Barlow suppression-crew had already started , but they were to set up their radio at the road-head on Onion Flat , and wait for orders before hitting the trail on foot . That was about all Bart could do at the moment , but he decided to call the Dispatcher at Suffolk . A little council of war would n't hurt . The Dispatcher was feeling optimistic and even jovial , as indeed he usually was , as long as a fire was still a District problem and had not been dumped too heavily in his own lap . " Hello , Bart , " he said into the phone . " I hear you have a little trouble on your hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little . Slugger do n't report back . " " Well , you ca n't expect everything from one crew-boss.  |p111He  's in there swinging an ax , you can bet , and wo n't take time out to radio . From what Cerro Gordo says about the smoke , I 'd judge he 'll have it hooked in an hour or so . " " I would n't worry except that it 's a tough place to get reinforcements in to . " The Dispatcher dropped his easygoing mood . " I 'll tell you , Bart . I 'll order up the plane and take a look in there myself . Ought to be able to make it  --  let 's see-by ten o'clock . Should I alert the paratroopers  --  any place to jump up there ? " " Gosh , I do n't know . There 's Reverse Meadow , but that 's not so close . There 're a couple of bare spots along the ridge , but I hate to ask anybody to jump into them . " " I 'll alert them anyway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Onion Creek , ' I guess . " " Ca n't be . Had one of those already this year , up on that Onion Creek that runs into the North Fork . What other names you got up there ? There 's nothing else on the map . " " There 're all those old mines . Golden Queen  --  " " Sounds like a perfume ! " " Spitcat , Broken Nose " Oh , Spitcat will do ! All right , Bart . Good Luck ! " Laying down the receiver , the Dispatcher took his pen , and matter-of-factly entered Spitcat in his log . There had been 163 fires already that season in the Ponderosa Forest ; this was merely #164 . Inwardly the Dispatcher was congratulating himself that they had kept Slugger 's crew up in that area , all ready for a quick attack . The far-planned strategy was paying off . Dave Halliday , the meteorologist , saw the fire from farthest away of them all . To him it existed at an infinitesimal spot in an ordinary weather-situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 1014 isobars , some two hundred miles to the east of the advancing cold front of a Pacific storm . As a result , the moderate south wind which blew toward the storm-center would dominate the region of the Ponderosa Forest during the day , growing stronger as the afternoon advanced . Some rain was probable in the night . He had committed himself to that forecast . What effect all this would have on the fire was the special business of the people charged with its suppression . . . . The Supervisor had heard that there was a fire , but it remained a local affair as far as he was concerned . He had confidence that his Dispatcher and Ranger would handle the situation . And yet , he kept remembering that there was an uncontrolled fire , and in September . . . . The Dispatcher also saw the fire at a considerable distance . It was his one-hundred-sixty-fourth fire for the season , and his capacity for worrying over every individual fire was badly impaired . The Spitcat did not seem especially dangerous . It was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  seven miles over steep trails from the nearest road-head . . . . To Bart the fire was like a gnawing worry in the pit of his stomach , a kind of tiny focal infection which spread its poison through the body . He did not know what was happening , and was uncomfortable every moment . No matter which way the fire moved , it would burn a fine forest , and his trees were almost as his children . . . . Judith Godoy on Cerro Gordo actually saw the smoke . But even to her the fire was small and far away . Now the smoke built up a little , and now it died down , but at most it seemed scarcely more than the smudge of a campfire on the horizon . In spite of herself she kept half wishing that the fire  --  her fire  --  would not be crushed out so young , but might grow and amount to something . But as often as the thought arose , shep113revolted from it consciously , as a disloyalty to Bart and the Forest . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five boys had as yet been close enough to wince at the heat and choke at the bite of smoke in the throat . They had been working for an hour now . The brilliant sun struck hard against the slope ; the breeze had fallen off , and a hot mid-morning calm lay on the canyon-side . From their scrapings and shovelingsthe impalpably fine red dust rose and hung in the air , settling all over them , irritating their nostrils and throats . The first flush of enthusiasm was long past . They were tired . Hands and faces were sooty and dusty , and streaked with the paths where sweat-beads kept rolling down . Already they were thinking of how fine it would be to get back to the routinework of trail-clearing . Yet still they worked steadily and doggedly , and were in good enough spirits . They were making progress . They had run a line nearly all the way up the down-canyon side , the front of the fire . Another hour 's work , and they might see the whole circuit of the line completed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watchfulness as the fire burned itself out . They were tired , all right . Shorty was limping from his bruised knee . They were hot and grimy . Already they were sucking the water from the canteens , and wishing they had time to break out the K-rations . Still they had the satisfaction of knowing they were doing a man 's job . Another hour , and they 'd have her hooked . The storm which on Thursday had been merely incipient had on Saturday grown well toward maturity . It now centered to the north of Unalaska , and was drenching Dutch Harbor with a heavy downpour . .. .  |p114From  the storm which had just crossed the Gulf of Alaska , the waves beat heavily all along the coast of Oregon , and spattersof cold rain were falling . The mountains of northern Idaho were white with new-fallen snow. sound . Even while the boys were at work , however , conditions were changing . The heat of the now high sun began to establishan up-draft in the canyon , and the approach of the stormfrontreinforced this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then a long sigh , as if somethinggigantic were letting out its breath . The smaller branches swayed gently . The tufts of flame wavered and spiraled , and then leaned over backward and stayed that way . The boys looked at one another quickly . For a moment , from where they were working , it seemed as if the wind were aiding them , blowing the flames back upon the burned area . The fresh breeze was cool on their sweaty faces , and their lungs sucked gratefully at the smoke-free air . Then they remembered the other side of the fire . Instantly , what had been the front of the fire had become its flank or rear . The wind no longer blew the heat toward the line which the boys had so laboriously cut through . Insteadof advancing diagonally up-hill in a down-canyon direction , the fire shifted front by more than a right angle and took off up-canyon . When he had arrived at the fire , Slugger had known nothing about the distant storm , and even if he had , his bull-like desire to charge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as an allowance for a wind-shift . As it was , he had acted in accordance with his own character , attackingstraight on , at the point of gravest danger  --  tactics , indeed , which in warfare or fire-fighting are likely to bep115At this time of the wind-shift the fire had something of the shape of a long-barreled pistol , pointed down-hill , with the grip turned in the down-canyon direction . The crew had run a line along the under side of the barrel and part-way around the grip . But now the south wind fanned up the flames , and from all the upper side of the pistol-barrel the fire began to advance . In terms of a man walking , it did not move rapidly . Even a lame man or a child would easily have kept ahead of it . But in comparison with the rate at which six already tired workers could build fire-line , the speed of the advance was ominous . Looking at one another , the boys for the first time felt a quick anxiety , almost a fear . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . He was no poet , and he had never heard of pathetic fallacy , but quite naturally he personified the fire and attributed to it a malignantintelligence . Slugger cursed violently to cover up his defeat . For a moment he hesitated , weighing the alternatives . Either he could fall back well up-canyon and try to build a line across the advance of the fire , or else from his established line he ould hang on the flanks of the fire , keeping it from broadeningits front , hoping to work ahead gradually and pinch it off . Early in the morning he would undoubtedly have chosen the bolder strategy . Now he chose the safer . " We 'll flank her , boys ! We 'll catch her all right ! " Then for the first time he tried to build up false courage . " This wind 'll die down pretty soon ! " And he added the rallying-cry of the hard-pressed commander : " They 'll be gettin ' reinforcementsin to us pretty soon ! " " Sure ! " said the boys . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get us some reinforcements ? . .. We ca n't fight this fire all by ourselves ! "  |p116Since  he was clear at the top of the fire when the wind changed , Slugger was a long way from where he had left the radio . Again , on the grounds that it would take him half an hour to climb down the hill and back , he justified his own picture of himself as the heroic ax-swinging leader , not a fiddler with dials and frequencies . " Come on , boys , " he yelled . " We 'll flank her on the up-side and pinch her off ! " And with one Homeric ax-stroke he cut clear through the butt of a young tree standing too close to the line . Bart called the Dispatcher again : " Say , Arn , I 'm starting in . Have n't heard from Slugger , but Judith up there at Cerro Gordo says the smoke is definitely building up . " " It 's this south wind . The weather-man says it 's going to get stronger , and may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you 'd better start in . Do n't get out of touch , though . " " Who do you think I am , Slugger O'Neill ? I 'll keep the radio on ! " As he left the Station , Bart followed the same road up which he had driven through the darkness of that same morning . " Gee , " he thought , as he steered around the first curve , " seems like I was swinging curves all night ! " He felt dull in spite of three cups of coffee , and he had that little confused feeling a man had when he did n't really get enough sleep to make a clean break between two days and so was n't quite sure whether this was yesterday or today or tomorrow . After a mile , he turned off , crossed the bridge over the South Fork , and took the Idylhurst road . At first the shade still lay on the road , but soon the sun was higher , and hot . The dry furnace-heat of September beat in upon him ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He longed for a cool breeze to snap him out of his lethargy and make him face the day with some enthusiasm . An official notice affixed to his instrument-panel warned him against too fast driving even when going to a fire , but he interpreted it liberally . The road was narrow and twisty , but it had a smooth oiled surface , and he knew all the bad turns . I-lis radio buzzed and squawked a little , and once he faintly heard someone calling a station that was not even in the Ponderosa . Then at last ( he was at the bend just before Idylhurst ) he heard Judith Godoy 's voice calling Z-112 , his own car number . As he took the transmitter from its hook , he pulled to the side of the road and stopped . It was just a brief message . She was relaying for the Dispatcher . He wanted Bart to know that things did n't look so good . On his own responsibility he had ordered the Barlow suppression-crew to start in from Onion Flat. " 0 . K. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Judith . " Fell Arn for me that I 'm nearly to Idylhurst and going on in as fast as I can . " He slowed down for fear of children and dogs as he came to the row of houses at Idylhurst . The women came bouncing out on the porches , and he heard one of them yell some questionabout fire . They would have seen the truck with the suppression-crewgo by already , and living right next to the trees they would be nervous about a fire . Well , this one was a long way off , and going the other direction . Bart pulled in at the Guard Station . Tony already had Betty saddled , and they took only a minute to get the neat-I ooted black mare into the horse-trailer . She snorted a little with excitement . Bart patted the sleek shoulder . " You old girl , you like to go for a ride just as much as anybody . "  |p118Beyond  Idylhurst there was no more oiled surface . The dust lay thick , and freshly imprinted into it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double tire-marks of the truck led on ahead . The eight miles from Idylhurst to the road-head at Onion Flat were slower going , but Bart pushed as fast as the bumping horse-trailer would allow . Here the forest was thicker , with taller trees , and the road was still partly shaded . Nevertheless , it was hot , and the trees shut off what breeze there might be , and the dust made everythingseem even hotter . Dust  --  powdery red dust that , they said , had particles of gold in it  --  dust rose all about him and settled everywhere . It coated the wind-shield that he had washed before leaving . It floated in at the windows and seeped upward from the floor-boards . He felt his face grow dry and tight , as if someone were slowly shaking talcumpowderon him . Yet he did not mind the dust . He was used to it , and it was only a minor irritating feature , like poison-oak and rattlesnakes , in a country that he loved . In fact , as he drove on , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For now that he was actually getting close to the fire , his excitement rose . He found himself humming the tune of Merriam 's Mill , that battle-song of the Ponderosa , and thinkingthe words as he hummed : She called the District Ranger by help of radio , And said , " There is a smoke I see on bearing one-one-oh ! " He felt himself split wide open . On one side he longed passionatelyfor a call from Slugger saying that the fire was under control , so that he could relax suddenly , and make a wisecrackback . Then he would quit worrying about his trees , and turn around and head back for Barlow . But on the other side a kind of diabolical suggestion rosep119up , and he felt his sense of excitement urging it on . For if the fire was a worthy opponent and too much for Slugger , then by tonight he himself might be locked in battle with a giganticenemy that knew neither pity nor rules of combat . He felt the quick surge of the fighting-spirit : Which also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ triangulated as a mile from Merriam 's Mill . To think of the blackened trees afterwards ! And yet also to think of trucks rolling and the cats crashing through the thickets , the long lines of men and the councils of war : " What about it , Bart ? . . . Ask Bart . . . . Say , Bart , can you get a cat up that ridge ? . . . Bart would know about that ! " ( So , in the old days , soldiers marched into battle , half in anxiety and fear , and half in fierce excitement to hear again the crashing volleys and the thud of charging hooves . ) And he hummed : But the trees are black along the slopes of all of Bigler Hill ; Ziegler 's Station all is burned , and so is Merriam 's Mill . The empty truck stood parked at Onion Flat . He pulled in beside it , and took the transmitter again : " Z-112 calling Z-i7 . . . . Z-112 to Z-17 . Come in , Z-i7 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a blind spot . So he called Z-3 , and talked to Judith , who in turn talked with Barlow . . . . No , no news from Slugger . The Dispatcherwas taking off in the plane from Suffolk about quarterto ten . The smoke looked a little bigger . Lovers Leap could see it now . Those were all the messages Barlow had to forward . " All right , Judith , " said Bart . " Write this down and send it in for me . Am at Onion Flat , starting in on horseback.  |p720Have  portable radio with me . Will call in when have chance . ' Repeat that back . " Judith repeated . " All right . ( Say , with your binoculars you 'll probably be able to see me going up the switch-backs in half an hour . ) O. K. Z-a 12 over and out . . . . " As he forded the creek on Betty , Bart looked carefully up the narrow gorge , but a shoulder of the mountain still blocked his view , and he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off to the north . Then the sure-footed mare scrambled up the bank , and began the long pull up the switch-back trail . In half an hour , near the top of the last switch-back , he caught up with the Barlow crew , lying down catching their wind . He stopped to let Betty blow for a minute . From the  --  way the six boys were sweating , he saw that they had been pushing hard . So , instead of making a wise-crack about their lying down and taking it easy , he said : " Do n't rush too hard . It 's a long pull ahead . " They grinned , knowing what he was thinking . Higher up , the view opened out . Between the orange trunks of two big pines he saw for many miles back down the long straight canyon through which he had just driven . He felt his heart leap suddenly , as it did when the space and majesty of such a view pressed upon him . Far to the west Cerro Gordo Lookout shone like a beacon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand but far below , Onion Creek foamed white over falls and chutes as it came down the narrow impassable gorge . The trail leveled and swung round on contour , getting closer to the creek . He pushed Betty to a trot for a short stretch . He came down-slope , forded the little stream of Grizzly Creek , and followed the trail over a low pine-coveredp121rise . Then , as he came out into the open of Reverse Meadow , he saw the smoke . . . . He had a tremendous sense of relief . As so often , fire actuallyseen was not so bad as fire imagined . This was no raging conflagration . He spoke to Betty , and with her quick walk she left the little meadow , and began to climb the steep trail which ran up the canyon , pointing directly at the fire . She had not gone far before she pricked up her ears , and then Bart too heard the plane . He had been carrying the radio in front of him on the saddle . Now he dismounted quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around it , and threw it over a limb . 1 le set up the radio in a hurry and switched it on , and by that time the plane was in sight . Bart stood in an open space and waved his arms up and down . When the plane was almost overhead , he saw the wings waggle . Then he went and put on the ear-phones . From where he sat , he saw the plane circle over the top of the fire , and then go right into the smoke . He waited  --  too long a time , it seemed  --  feeling that little sickness which came sometimes when he saw a plane maneuvering so low over the mountains . Then it came flying right down the canyon out of the smoke , and he heard Arn 's voice calling him on the radio . Arn 's report was clear . " Not too good , not too bad . Slugger 's there all right . He 's got a line up the back of her where it 's not much use now , since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the top , but she 's got two hundred yards open front , with two long stringers out ahead . She covers ten acres maybe . ( : et up to it as fast as you can . I 'm going to send in the jumpers . " " Where you going to jump them ? " " The meadow is too far . I 've been scouting that thin placep122on the ridge . Looks all right  --  although , of course , I 'm not doing the jumping . Any big rocks in there under the bushes ? " " Should n't be . It 's a gravel-top ridge . " " Well , the lieutenant can decide . If he thinks it 's too touchy , we 'll have to use the meadow . " Radio contact suddenly became bad , and for a moment as the plane circled , Bart heard nothing above the sputtering of the motor-noise . Then he asked : " You got one of our men to guide the army pilot in ? " " Yes  --  the Super ! " " Repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Super ! " " How come ? " " Well , he knew the plane might be going , and he said he 'd never gone out with a jump-plane , and wanted to see how it was done . He cancelled an appointment with some big lumbermen . I think myself he just wanted to get up to see the fire  --  like the rest of us . " A little after ten o'clock , Bart halted on the trail just oppositethe smoke . He found a good place for Betty , took off her bridle , and tied her loosely , so that she could follow the shade a little and reach a few bushes to chew at . He set up the radio again , and had no difficulty in making contact with his clerk-dispatcher at Barlow . Her voice was already getting squeaky with excitement .  --  Arn had landed back at Suffolk all right and had taken over . Ten jumpers were going in , and the plane ought to be starting any time now . Arn had orderedin twenty mill-men from Magna too , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Bart , now that he 'd seen the fire , wanted any more men . " Tell him ' no , ' " said Bart . " Ten jumpers inside of an hourare worth more than a hundred men for the night-shift . But ap123I 'll call back again as soon as I 've got over there and scouted it . " He signed off , pulled down the aerial , and packed up the radio for carrying . As he looked across the canyon , he saw , here and there among the tall trees , little stretches of fire-line  --  the ground all black on the up-canyon side , everything green on the down-canyon side . This edge looked dead and cold already , but the up-canyon side was smoking vigorously , as the breeze carried the fire along . There was no door on this plane in the place where a door ought to be , and the Supervisor did not like it . He sat oppositewhere a door should be , and held on to a bar behind him with both hands . The dark-brown lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open space , holding with only one hand . Then the plane banked , and the place where there should be a door seemed to become part of the floor . Feeling about to slide out into space , the Super gripped convulsively , and pulled his long legs in . The shiny-black corporal beside him grinned . " Not my racket ! " said the Supervisor apologetically , through the engine-noise . " What you doin ' on this ride , big boy ? " " Oh , I know the country . I point out the place you jump into . " " Pretty soft ! You point ; we jump ! " But the little crackle of laughter that came afterwards did not ring very merrily . " Where you from ? " asked the Super , knowing that it was usually a safe question and waving his hand to take in the whole outfit . " Us ? Oh , lots o ' places . Harlem , Chicago , L. A. , Beale Street . ( Me , I 'm from Philly . ) We even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed again , at his own imitation of Southern dialect . " What your name , big boy ? " " Me ? Oh , just call me Slim . ' " Then he noticed that the corporal suddenly grew quiet . He thinks I 'm talking down to him , thought the Supervisor , but I could n't say , " Call me Mr. Jones . " The plane bumped sharply , and the Supervisor looked at the ten men who were soon to jump . They sat , lounging , on the uncomfortably narrow metal bench which ran along both sides of the long compartment . They were in their jumpingoutfitswith only their face-masks yet to adjust . They were padded like super-football-players , and looked , he thought tritely , like men from Mars . Each had a coil of rope dangling from his belt . They sat silent , most of them smoking . They did not look at all happy , and he could see little beads of sweat on several foreheads . That might be the heat of the padded suits , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jump into space on top of a country that mostly ran up and down could not be comforting . The sergeant was pointing suddenly outside , and the Supervisorstood up and craned his neck toward the doorway , holding to a convenient little steel cable that ran along the ceiling  --  or whatever you called it  --  of the plane . Now they were flying over the fire . " This is my racket ! " he thought , and he made a quick appraisal . The fire was not crowning anywhere among the big trees . At the point of one of the long stringers was a hot-spot , and he saw the reddish flames lick upward where a clump of young trees was burning . Still , with one crew on the fire already , ten men about to jump , another crew getting close , and Bart on the job as fire-boss  --  with all that , he would n't grant that fire much of what the insurance people called lifeexpectancy.  |p125Just  beyond the fire  --  at least it seemed so from the air  --  he saw the thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his free hand , pointed , and then realized that in that one gesture he had accomplished his whole function on the flight . The lieutenant and the sergeantboth looked , and he could tell by their faces that they were not going to jump up and down and yell " Goody ! " He saw why , easily enough . The thin spot was not to be called a meadow , even optimistically . Tall trees pressed in upon it , and some of the trees growing right in it did not look so small . I t was really nothing better than a brush-covered opening with a suggestion of gullies beneath the brush . And as for slope , being just off the top of the ridge it did not slope as much as the rest of the country thereabouts , but that was about all you could say for it . He felt very unhappy at the thought of anybody jumping into a place like that . Even though it might mean trouble with the fire , he began suddenly to hope that the lieutenant would decide to head back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there could be any other decision . " Christ ! " said the lieutenant sharply , " that 's no bigger than a barn-roof and just about as steep ! " The Supervisor felt a quick relief . And then , suddenly military , the lieutenant snapped out , " Sergeant , take charge of the jumping . " " Yes , sir , " the sergeant answered back in such a paradegroundvoice that the Supervisor looked to see if he had snapped to attention . Fortunately he had not , for at that moment the plane bumped in such a way that if the sergeant had been standing at attention he would certainly have been tossed out head-first in a most unmilitary manner . " Make it three-three-four , " said the lieutenant cryptically , and then swinging from hand-hold to hand-hold he walked up to the pilot 's compartment , to direct the pilot and give the signal for jumping.  |p126The  plane had flown past the bare spot , but now it began to circle back . " Come on , first three , " ordered the sergeant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Each snapped a clip onto the convenient steel-cable to which the Supervisor had just been holding . They shifted their chutes nervously , making sure that everything was clear . Their face-masks were in place now , making them look more Martian than ever , but through the clear plastic the Supervisorsaw the whites of the eyes flashing in a black face , lookinginhuman and yet pathetic , like the eyes of a trapped and frightened animal . He turned to the private who was now sitting beside him on the bench . " Do you get used to jumping , or is it always tough ? " " Do n't know about the other boys , suh ; but me , I get scared ! " The plane quit circling and straightened out . The three jumpers moved up closer . The sergeant looked out tensely . Suddenly a buzzing bell sounded . " Ho ! " shouted the sergeant , and the three men went out so closely together that they all seemed one . The Supervisor had a feeling that his heart jumped up and went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still stood tensely , looking . From the cable three ropes dangled as if a gallows-drop had been sprung . But the sergeant still stood tensely , looking , and as the plane banked a little , the Supervisor had a glimpse of a swayinggreen parachute afloat in the air . The sergeant relaxed . Without asking , the Supervisor knew that all the parachutes had opened and that perhaps the sergeanthad even seen the men land . Watching the next three jump was not so bad , and as theyp127went out , the Supervisor saw a parachute on the ground squarely in the middle of the thin spot , and a man standing beside it waving . As they went in for the third run , there was a tense moment when they saw one parachute hanging in a tree . But just afterwards they saw a rope dangling and a man sliding down it . The jumpers did n't carry those seventy-foot ropes at their belts just to look pretty . Four men went out on the third run , and then they circled twice more , as the sergeant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food and bedding attached to yellow parachutes . After the last bundle had been dropped , the plane circled to head for home , and the lieutenant came back from the pilot 's compartment . He and the sergeant settled down on the bench opposite the doorway , and lighted cigarettes . The Supervisor sidled up beside the lieutenant . " Did all the chutes open all right ? " he asked . " What ? " said the lieutenant , as if that were a funny question . " Oh , sure  --  they opened . Sure . Everybody got down fine . " Just the same , there was a glisten of sweat on the lieutenant'sforehead , and he was not wearing a jumping-suit . But the Supervisor felt a vast relief . Not only had they all dot down safely , but also they would not take long to pull off heir helmets and padded suits , grab their tools , follow down the ridge , and report to Bart . Ten fresh men on the fire-line would make a lot of difference , and they still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hottest burning-period came , in the middle of the afternoon . When Bart had got to the fire , he had seen immediately that it was out of control . Ugly as things looked , however , hep128did not seize a shovel and start to work . His job was to scout around the fire , and particularly ahead of it , and then plan strategy . So he merely told Slugger and his men to keep on doing what they were doing already ; they were certainly not hurting anything , and no matter what they did , the fire was by now far beyond the power of six already tired men . He had been scrambling through some underbrush when the big lumbering transport plane passed overhead . He heard it circling , and once from a clear space he saw three green parachutes suddenly open up right beneath the plane . When the plane headed home , Bart had just finished his circuit , and was mapping the fire on a form printed to show a section of land , with dashed lines for quarter-sections and forties . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where imaginary lines crossed through this rough country of canyon and forest , but it was part of Bart 's business to know , and he had had twenty years to perfect himself . So without hesitation he wrote DEFINITE on the dotted line after TOWNSHIP , and marked 7 in the middle of the map , to show that this fire was in Section 7 of Definite Township . Then , starting down in the southwest forty of the southwestquarter , he drew a curving line northward , into the northwest forty , and then back to the beginning . The area enclosed within the line represented the burned lost its pistol shape entirely , and looked more like a short dangling sock tattered at the top , with the sole and bulging heel representing what had once been the under side of the barrel and the pistol butt . ) But Bart was thinking of distances . The area was somewhat more than a quarter-mile long . It would be longer before they could control it , and allowing for breadth and irregularitieshe would have to figure on nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what Slugger 's boys had alreadycompleted . For the whole job he had Slugger 's tired crew , plus ten ( he hoped ) jumpers , plus the suppression-crew of six , who should be getting there in an hour or so . He planned quickly . The rear was already held ; two of Slugger 's boys for patrol would be all it needed . Slugger and the three others could take the upper flank , where they were already , and he would reinforce them with the suppressioncrew . That section of line would follow the ridge , where the fire was likely to burn low . He would throw the jumpers in along the lower flank . That was dangerous because of rolling cones and logs , and they would have to build under-cut line , well ditched to catch the rolling stuff . Such tactics left the front of the fire wide open , but he was counting on the jumpers to work faster than the fire moved , so that they could get ahead and pinch it off . If not , the twenty mill-men would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down anyway , and they should be able to close the last gap without difficulty . With flames crackling ten yards away , Bart stood for a minute thinking . At best , any strategy for fire-fighting was only a balancing of chances . Some of them could be predicted with accuracy  --  length of line required , terrain and cover , number of men . You could make a fair guess at short range as to burning-conditions , and quality and condition of men . But beyond that , hovered the surrounding darkness of ignoranceand the future . All you could do was to set a safetyfactoragainst all those chances which might break against you . Everything considered , the chances looked good . They ought to catch the fire  --  at best , some time in the late afternoon ; at worst , not later than ten , after the mill-men had been on the line for an hour or two.  |p130Now  he heard the shouts as the jumpers came hurrying down along the ridge . He called back to them , and when they came up , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned , explaining the situation to the corporal . It was a joy to him to watch the jumpers get to work . They were fresh ; they were picked men ; they had been specially trained for fire-work . Also , he guessed , any colored boy who volunteered for a jumper did it partly to show that he could do anything a white boy could do , and maybe better . As he started to struggle up-hill again toward Slugger 's crew , Bart looked at his watch . At the start of a fire , time always rushed by and left you standing , and now it was alreadytwelve-thirty . The suppression-crew should be here any time . Also , he realized , the sun was not quite as hot as it usually was at noon . Looking upward , he saw a faint white veil of high cloud over the western sky , just beginning to dim the sun a trifle . He remembered a forecast of possible rain . Well , they could use a rain , and if the sun went under , burning-conditions for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had figured . By mid-afternoon the Dispatcher at Weaverville in the TrinityForest was wearing a grin that would not come off ; half his lookouts reported rain . Farther inland , east of the oceanfrontingranges , the storm was weaker ; even so , the west side of the Shasta had rain at Mt . Eddy and a snow flurry on Billy 's Peak . From the Klamath to the Mendocino fire-danger ratings were tumbling like stock-prices on Black Tuesday . A grassfirein Colusa County , which had been running like a horse at noon , lay down and died of itself at two-thirty , smothered by rising humidity.  |p131Working  on his afternoon map , Dave Halliday was not grinning . Of course , from the scientific point of view which interested him most , a weather situation was merely that , and nothing either to grin or frown over . Still , two years in the Weather Bureau and four years in the Navy had taught him that the best scientist should also be a humanist . In meteorologicalterms the present weather-situation was nothing much  --  just an ordinary beginning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Francisco would not consider it of great importance . But here in the Ponderosa Forest , to all these people who lived with fire in the back of all their thoughts , to his new friend the Dispatcher especially , the situation might mean everything , even life and death . By now he had begun to realize his own place in the scheme . The others saw a fire as burning on a certain slope in a certain quarter-section . Or at most , like the Dispatcher and the Supervisor , they thought of a fire in terms of Forest and Zone and Region . But they turned to him  --  almost imploringly , it seemed at times , like villagers to a far-traveler  --  for news of the greater world . He must see a fire in terms of a spinning earth and a sun retreating toward Capricorn , of arctic against tropic and continent against ocean , of the flying spray from Pacific waves whipped up by winds and absorbed by thirsty air a thousand miles off-shore . Just when the breeze might eddy around in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any old-time ranger could tell better than he . But beyond the limits of his own horizon the ranger was helpless . So now he studied the map . The front  --  that was nothing . I t would doubtless bring some rain tonight , making good his Iorecast . Possibly it would douse that fire which was burning somewhere in Barlow District . But the front was a weak one ,  |p132and  after it had passed  --  would summer move in again for another month and heat go shooting up and humidity fall ? No  --  he hardly thought so . A much stronger storm , a genuinesummer-breaker , was showing along the nearer Aleutians . It could mean nothing to the Ponderosa , however , for some days . Letting his eyes swing again to the stations immediately behind the present approaching front , he noted light northerlywinds , rather moist air , but  --  more strikingly  --  a sharp drop of temperature . Lookouts in the Trinity who could have sun-bathed in the hot early morning must now be wearing sweaters . Then from the storm center in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Over Oregon also , temperatureswere dropping sharply as the cold air from the northern Pacific moved in behind the front , although barometricpressures had not risen much as yet . . . . The forecast was a difficult one . After he had typed it and left his assistant radioing it out , he walked over to the Dispatcher'soffice . Arn was there . " How 's your fire ? " Dave asked . " Had a message through from Bart half an hour ago . He 's got twenty-three men there now , counting himself . He 's cheerful . Expects to get his line all tied in before so long , in time to get his backfires going before the main fire gets there . Then we figure that rain you 're sending us will get here to make the mop-up easy . You 're not renigging on the rain , are you ? " " You sound doubtful . " " Well , there ought to be some rain all right , but I 'm wondering about tomorrow . I could n't make a clean forecast . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Go ahead . " " You see , I figure the pressure in eastern Oregon is the thing to watch . If we get a high in there , it 'll mean we have a big dome of cold air lying over the plateau . " " What of it ? " " You know about water running down hill ? ' " Read about it in a book once . " " Well , cold air runs down hill just the same way , and if a lot of it piles up in eastern Oregon , it 's going to start sluicing down through these canyons until it fills the Central Valley of California like a bath-tub . And then  --  " But he noticed that Arn was looking glum enough to eat worms . " O. K.  --  Do n't go on ! " said Arn , " I know all about it from here in . We used to call it a Santa Ana on the Angeles , and a Mono on the Stanislaus . Up here it 's not quite so hot , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire already going when she hits . " " Well , maybe she wo n't . Ca n't tell for sure yet ! " " She probably will all right . It 's the right time of year . Ourchance is to get this Spitcat Fire out , before the wind hits . " " There 's the rain , you know . " " That 's right ! " said Arn , suddenly more cheerful . All afternoon the jumpers had worked along the lower flank . The big cones of the Jeffrey pines were devils for rolling , and so the line had to be carefully ditched . Building an under-cut line was slow work , and during the afternoon the jumpers never managed to get clearly ahead of the fire . All they could ( to was to pinch it a little and force it diagonally up-slope toward the ridge . The Barlow suppression-crew worked the ridge . Therep134were only six of them , but they did not have to under-cut , and so they kept up with the jumpers of the lower flank . Slugger 's crew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held sections of line , except for the boy with the bad knee whom Bart had assigned to stand by at the radio . One rolling cone jumped ten feet across the line and started trouble , but the patrol set up a shout and brought two of the jumpers down on the run . By fast work they got a line around the slop-over before it really got going . After sunset the wind which had been steady all afternoon fell off to a light breeze , still from the south . Soon afterward both crews managed to get a little ahead of the fire , and Bart judged that this was the moment . The jumpers were tired now , but as their corporal yelled at them , they sprinted again and swung the direction of their line-building straight up-slope . There was a gap of two hundred yards to link up . From above , Bart heard the clank of shovels hitting rock as the suppression-crew , swinging back at a sharp angle , came down slope to meet the jumpers . Only fifty yards off , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off . Bart scrambled up the slope with the corporal , pointing out where the line could be put through most efficiently . Then he sent the corporal back , and went on to meet the suppression-crew , knowing that he would have to build his back-fires from the ridge down . When the suppression-crew had cleared fifty yards , Bart pulled a fusee out of his pocket . He held a match to the end , and the fusee flared with a bright pink flame . He stuck it among the twigs of a dead branch that lay four feet inside the fire-line . When the twigs blazed , he pulled the fusee out , and went along inside the line starting fires in the needles and twigs . " Fight fire with fire . "  |p135With  the wind as it was , all the little fires blew toward the line , but moving only a few feet they had no chance to get big , and when they came to the cleared line they died . But on the other side , eating backward into the wind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he watched , they spread sideways and gradually joined into a solid front . Then as the main fire grew closer , the back-fires caught the suck of the draft which the main fire pulled in toward itself against the light wind . Suddenly the back-fires sprang to life , and went roaring through the underbrush toward the main fire . The two met about a hundred feet from where Bart was standing at the line . As in the head-on dash of two waves , the fires piled up . A clump of underbrush suddenly disappeared in white-yellow flames . Close by , a seventy-foot fir tree , its resins vaporized by the heat , exploded into a flame that towered a hundred feet upward . There was a long-drawn hiss that was almost a roar . For twenty seconds the dying tree stood out in the twilight , a white-hot torch of flaming gas . As it burned out , the tips of the level branches glowed red for a moment , and then the tall tree was nothing but a dark silhouette of branches against the fire-lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fireworks , he was trying to see what the sparks did . As far as he could tell , they went almost straight up and cooled to blackness high in the air without blowing across the line to spread the fire farther . " Well , we got away with that one ! " he said to one of the suppression-crew , and went on down to light the next section . Before the two ends of the line were tied together , the fire was so close that there was no chance for a back-fire , and they had to hope that the line itself would hold . The fire jumped in one spot , but two of the suppression-crew , working almostp136in the flames , managed to hold it . One of them came out with a hole burned in the back of his shirt where a spark had lit . Then , so suddenly as to seem queer , everything was quiet . Also everything was dark , for as they had worked , twilight had crept up , and now that the big blaze had died down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the last few minutes the two crews had mingled , and now they stood , white and black , just as they happened to be , dog-tired , grimy and sweaty , leaning on their shovels , still watching but also letting rest soak into them . Inside the line hundreds of little flames licked up where cones and branches and logs were still burning , but they were all tiny by comparison and made little light and no noise . The corporal scratched a match , and the flare seemed to light up the hillside . He lit his cigarette , gave a light to the suppression-crew foreman who stood beside him , and tossed the match into the burn . Then , just as if to make things doubly sure , there was shouting from across the canyon and a show of lights , and Bart knew that the mill-men , fresh and twenty strong , had got up , and would be ready to take over for the night . But as he started to relax , weariness hit him suddenly . It had been a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really slept much since Wednesday night . He felt dizzy , and sat down on the ground for a moment to get hold of himself.  |p137To  THE MEN on the line the fire was red glare in the eyes and reaching flame , roar and crackle in the ears , choking in the throat , fierce heat on the face . The fire possessed them , and beat in upon their senses . Yet , actually , what was that thing called the fire ? Like a man , a fire exists in time . First as a tiny spark . it lives faintly . A breath of wind might blow it out ; some drops of water , quench it . But , if born in happy circumstances , it feeds lustily and grows . It takes shape and develops structure , drawing in fresh air along the ground , throwing off smoke and consumed air skywards . Where once it scarcely crept , now suddenly it walks and runs . The vigor and power of youth rises within it . It grows adult , and casts out sparks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeps ahead in power and glory , the shadow lies over it . " This too shall pass away . " Failing to find food , rained upon , blown against by contrary winds , the fire loses vigor . Grown weaker , it searches less strongly for food , and so grows weaker still . It lies in the quiet of old age . At last , quickly or slowly , it dies.  |p138The  likeness to a man does not fully hold . Now a fire is more like a shape-shifting monster , stretching out long and encircling arms before it . Now a fire is like a nation , growing weak for a while , and then springing up with a new vigor , as millions of flamelets within it die , or as new flamelets blaze up . But  --  man or monster or nation  --  like them all , the fire is the thing-in-itself . It begins , and is , and ends ; it is born , and lives , and dies . After midnight an old moon was high enough above the shoulder of Howell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man see something outside the range of his flashlight . Twenty feet off , Bart could now make out the foiin of the boy called Shorty , curled up beside the radio , trying to get a little sleep in spite of the cold of the mountain night . Bart himself had only snatched a few cat-naps ; as sure as he settled down , some message came in over the radio or somebody clumped down the trail about something or other . Or even if there was nothing actually , Bart 's nerves brought him up with a snap , just when he should have been settling deeper into sleep . There was no one else on the fire of sufficientexperience to take over as night fire-boss . He stood up to take a look . His improvised headquarters were at the bottom , just outside the lowest tip of the burned area . There was little to show that it really was headquarters  --  just the radio , and a few extra tools and two back-pumps which somebody had packed in and not used . The fire was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now that the moon was up . He was weary , but it ought to be done . He hated to wake the boy at the radio , but as he stepped closer , the boy stirred , and looked up of his own accord . " Sleeping ? " asked Bart.  | " Not much . Too cold ! We started in a hurry , and Slugger thought we 'd be back in camp before night . " " I 'm making a round again . There wo n't be any emergency , but write down the messages if there are any .  --  Here , put this jacket over you . " " You need it yourself ! " ' Ti ! be walking .  --  Say , how 's your knee ? " " Not hurting much .  --  Thanks for the jacket . " As he moved off , Bart felt chilly in nothing but his shirt , but he hated to think of a kid trying to sleep and just lying there shivering . That was the devil about fires above four thousand feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus all the heat of the fire itself , and then in the early morning you were ready to freeze to death . But , as he breasted the steep trail , the first line that Slugger'screw had built , Bart soon was warm enough , even though he took the stiff climb easily , because of his own weariness . He used his flashlight rather little , for the moon gave some light , and he wanted to see what the fire itself was doing . You would have said at first glance that it was really dead , but as you looked closer , here was a little glow , and there a tiny flame , and since you saw dozens of such points , you knew that there would be thousands of them within the area enclosedby the fire-line . Along here he must be very close to where the fire had started . In the morning , whenever he had time , he would look around for curiosity and find the tree that had been struck . Up ahead , he now saw a larger flame begin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was not worried . I le climbed higher , stopping to pant now and then . Afterwhile he came to where the line ran around in a half-circle. hat , he realized , was testimony to how close Slugger 's crewp140had been to choking off the fire in its infancy ; the projecting knob showed where they had actually confined what had been the head of the fire before it took off up-canyon . Just beyond this , Bart came to the larger fire he had already been seeing . Six loggers lay sprawled about , and they had just thrown a new log on a bonfire they had built inside the line to keep themselves warm . They had heard Bart scrambling up the trail , and as he came into the range of the fire-light , they turned or rolled over languidly to greet him . He asked them how things were , and one of them said it was all quiet  --  only , he did not make that statement in such simple and concise form , but after the custom of loggers he elaborated the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost a paragraph . Bart squatted down to catch his wind . A perpetual slowpacedconversation seemed to be going on among the men  --  like a slow fire , never quite kindling , never quite going out . One man would make a deliberate and potentially insulting remark to another , and after a while that other would reply in kind , perhaps involving a third . Then , just when Bart thought the matter had been dropped , the third one would languidly pick up the ball and toss it again . More than half the words , it seemed , were unprintable , and Bart wondered at the endless monotony of the ironclad rule which required , , that a man could not even turn to warm his other side withoutreferring to Christianity , his neighbor 's ancestry , and sev eral bodily parts , functions , and perversions . Having six men at one point meant that long stretches of the line were without patrol , but Bart said nothing . There , was really little danger during the night , and he knew loggers . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other times they responded to orders or ignored them according to , whether the orders seemed reasonable in their experience.  |p141By  two o'clock Bart had followed the line that the suppression-crewhad built along the ridge , and was at the head of the fire . Another group of men lay about another bonfire here , and one of them also said it was all quiet  --  adding the same elaborations that the other fellow had . The moon had gone under clouds now , and actually the fire was even quieter than it had been . The overcast was low . The air felt heavy with moisture , and this moisture was smothering the fire , forcing it to use up its heat in merely driving the dampness away . Except for the nasty forecast of a high north wind in the later morning , Bart would not have been bothered at all . Even so , he was not really worrying . By this bonfire he took out his map , and revised it . Coming lip from the other bunch of men , he had counted his paces , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now had a better idea of size . He redrew his lines a little . The burned area now showed as an elongated slug-like form , wrigglingin a mild double curve up from its base about two hundred feet above the creek to its upper point , where he now was , some four hundred feet higher . The length was about five-eighths of a mile ; the average breadth , somewhat under two hundred yards . He estimated the area as forty acres , what the Forest Service would list officially as a Class C fire . Actually , although Bart hated all fires desperately , he realized that this one had not done any great damage . It had wiped out the underbrush and small trees , but the underbrushwould spring up fast and very few of the small trees would ever have grown to maturity anyway , against the competitionof the big ones . Of the big trees very few had been killed , because the fire had mostly stayed close to the ground . The chief damage would be that the fire , eating at the bases of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , andp142caused what the lumbermen called " cat-faces . " Boring insects would work into these cat-faces , and in a few years there would be a lot of sick and dying trees . Bart put the map into his pocket , and started to slide down the steep trail where he had set the first back-fire . Soon , having to pick his way with the aid of the flashlight , he was working along the undercut line that the jumpers had built . An occasional blackened cone lying in the ditch showed that it had not been labor wasted . Halfway along he came to the six men of the suppressioncrew , huddled miserably around a fire built inside the line , trying to sleep . They were cold in spite of the fire , and ready to sit up and talk . From lying where the needles had been burned , they had added soot to dust , and their faces were so black that you could hardly have told them from the jumpers . " How 's she look , Bart ? " asked the crew-boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 'll probably get a little rain any time now . " A general cry of protest arose , as if Bart could do anything about the rain . But to be rained on after a fire and to have the charred pine-needles dissolve into black mud and to be wet as well as cold  --  that was a final insult . " What you crabbin ' about ? " said Bart . " The rain 'll save us a lot of work at mop-up . " " Oh , sure , " said one of them . " But I need some sleep . Those jumpers are the lucky boys . They just went back up the ridge to where the plane dropped their bed-rolls . " " Huh ? " said another . " They can have their blankets , if they 'll let me not have to jump ! " " You said it ! . . . O. K. , brother ! . . . I 'll take mine on the ground ! " An approving grumble ran around the fire , and then there ! was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whi-sh-sh high inp143t lie tree-tops . He tipped back his head , and felt a tiny drop spatter on his nose . " Here she is , boys , the rain ! And I 've got to be on my way . " Bart 's mind was suddenly at ease . A fire that was already I. nocked down could never stand being rained on . But as he scrambled along the trail , he felt very little rain . It might be wetting the over-spreading canopy of pine-needles a hundred and fifty feet in the air , but scarcely any was reaching the round . There was that bad forecast , too . But still with a fire looking as nearly dead as this one was , even Bart could not worry much . . . . He was nearly back to his starting-point when he heard an unmistakable click-clunk-squeak . He felt a sudden warmth of comradeship . At times during the long day he had seemed to lie a forgotten ranger with a few men , fighting a dangerous fire on a lonely canyon-side , alone . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pack-train , and that meant that lie was not forgotten . Somewhere during the long day people had thought of John Bartley and his men , and known that the K-rations would be running low . Then they had made sandwiches , and packed lunches in brown paper bags , and packed the bags into cartons , and packed the cartons into a truck . Then the truck had rolled up through Idylhurst , and on to the roadheadat Onion Flat . And at some time Tony had loaded his mules into a truck and taken them also to Onion Flat . He had unloaded the mules and saddled them , and packed the lunches in the big saddle-bags . Then he had forded the creekby now it was dark  --  and led the mules up the switch-backs , and along the contour above Onion Creek , and into Reverse Meadow , and on up Onion Creek , until he had seen the faint glow of the fire across the canyon . He had left the trail and Worked the mules slowly down the canyonside and across thep144creek and up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  withlunches for tired and hungry men , and with extra batteries for dying flashlights and headlamps , and with a first-aid kit , and a dozen other bits of this and that which men might be needing on a fire . Bart felt something go out of him  --  a sudden inexpressible great love of the world and the people in it , and most of all of his own comrades . There were sudden tears in his eyes , all because a greasy-haired little Mexican mule-skinner was working three smelly mules up through the pine-trees . " Why , Tony , you old son-of-a-bitch ! " he called as he saw the dark moving forms . " Where the hell you been all this time ! " And he saw the shiny white Mexican teeth as Tony broke into a grin . . . When at last he came sliding downhill to headquarters , Bart was cold and damp . There were no messages written on the pad , and the boy was sleeping , curled up beneath the jacket . Bart lacked the heart to wake him up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards , inside the fire-line where a log was still smoking along its upper side in spite of the dirt that had been piled in against it . ( The boys never seemed to learn that you could n't put a fire out that way . ) The log was giving off some heat , and Bart sat close to it . The rain had stopped ; the wind , getting colder every minute , was shifting into the north already . Bart was stiff with the chill , but he was also dead tired . He sat all huddled up , and his head settled forward now and then as he dozed off , only to wake up again , tired and shivering . That morning , across hundreds of miles of inland plateau , though it was only September , frost was glittering on thep145'age-brush . The air , cold and dry already when it had moved ill behind the storm-front , had grown colder during the clear night , and having had most of its remaining moisture squeezed out as frost , it was also even drier than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extending upward some thousandsof feet , rested upon a plateau which was several thousand feet above sea-level , in eastern Oregon and the adjoining parts of Idaho and Nevada . Only a few hundred miles to the southwest , in the lowlyingCentral Valley of California , the temperature had reached a hundred degrees in the afternoon , and had scarcely fallen below eighty during the night . The air was correspondinglylight , and it rested on a surface only a little above sealevel . Lacking a barrier , the heavier air must by the mere law of gravity , run down and replace the lighter air , and the only semblance of barrier between the two was the line of the northern Sierra Nevada . In ancient days , however , that edge of the tilting block of earth which had formed those mountainshad been lifted only a few thousand feet above the level of the eastern plateau , and during the hundreds of centuries since its up-lifting the forces of air and water and frost had worn down gaps and passes which were scarcely a thousand feet above the sage-brush plain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the high-towering cold air , was little more than a picket-fence to ruffle the under surface . Before daylight a dry cold wind was beginning to pour through the passes and down the long canyons of the western slope . Dave Halliday , still working beneath the green-shaded electriclight , wrote 1023 on a free-hand circle covering most of southeastern Oregon , stamped HIGH inside of it , and leaned hack to survey the map . The wind-arrows for the stations top146the north and east of Suffolk already pointed southwest ; well feathered , they showed winds at ten to twenty miles an hour . He would scarcely have to contrive what could be dignified by the name of a forecast ; the thing was already upon them . Outside , there was full daylight already , and through the window he saw the line of neatly planted young plane trees at the edge of the lawn . He was rather surprised that their big leaves were only stirring gently . That merely meant the wind had not yet quite got here . Arnold Sorenson 's big hands fumbled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Hello ! " he said sharply , wiping the sleep from his voice . " Dispatcher Sorenson speaking . " He recognized the voice of Dave Halliday : " Sorry to bother you  --  " " Skip it , Dave . You are n't inviting me to tea , are you ? " " Well , there 's trouble all right . Nothing but a little breeze here yet , but Reno has a twenty-mile northeasterly , and on my map I 've got four isobars piled up between here and eastern Oregon . " " What kind of wind does that mean ? " " Twenty miles and up , in the canyons , hitting forty in the gusts along the ridges , and so dry she 'll crack your lips in half an hour . " " Sounds sweet ! " said the Dispatcher . Then he paused for a couple of breaths , considering . But there was obviously nothing worse that a weatherman could report , and so there was nothing more to ask . " All right , Dave , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumped out of bed , started dressing . . . . As he walked across to Headquarters there was a fairly good breeze blowing . It raised some dust from the dry vacant lot , and flapped the leaves of the plane trees . The sun , justp147rising , had a kind of hard brazen dazzle to it ; though the breeze was cool , the heat of the sun was unpleasant , and the glare made him squint . Suddenly he disliked things in general . The sun , for instance , seemed personally hostile , and in the bare sky it looked indecently naked . He was licking his lips . Then he remembered , and tried to relax . That was what such a wind always did to people 's nerves . He remembered an old story that in the early days a Californian who committed murder during a north wind could plead that as an extenuatingcircumstance . In his office he turned the radio on , got contact with the stand-by on the Spitcat Fire , and asked for Bart . Bart sounded tired and sleepy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , usually the way of it  --  the man at the fire was either a lot more or a lot less excited than the man at Headquarters , because he saw the fire as it looked at the moment close-up , and you always had difficulty in making him realize hat the general situation would soon be better or worse . " Oh , " said Bart , " I went all the way round her a while ago , tad she looks awful cold . The rain  --  well , ca n't say we really ad much rain  --  but the dampness , anyway , knocked her . rutty flat . I 've got two faller-crews in there  --  I can hear them ight now  --  and they 'll be getting the snags down pretty fast . " " How about wind ? " " There 's a pretty steady wind  --  down-canyon . Do n't seem no bad though . Once the sun gets higher there ought to be me up-canyon draft build up to check it . " " The weatherman thinks not . He 's forecast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , maybe . But he ai n't been around this country as lung as I have . " " Say , Bart , hold on a minute , will you ? I 've got something have to do . "  |p148The  Dispatcher got up and walked across the room . What he had to do was to think a moment . " Of all tools , " he was quoting to himself , " men are the most apt to get out of order . " Bart was a good man , one of the best , but just now he was like a McLeod with a bent tooth , or a radio with a loose connection . His malady was what they called " first-slump-itis . " You hit the fire all keyed up , and then when you got it knocked down , you had to relax . Moreover , Bart might be right . The fire might be harmless now , and young Dave Halliday could be wrong . But in this businessthe only safe way was to figure that the worst possible would happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the transmitter , " you know what 's going to happen if that fire takes off in a norther . Remember the Merriam 's Mill and the Kimshew ? That fire is pointed right at some of the best forest in California . " ( Maybe a little shock would help . ) There was a pause , and the Dispatcher felt that the shock . was working. " 0 . K. , Arn . I 'll do everything I can . You know that all right , do n't you ? " ( The Dispatcher caught a faint pleading t note in the voice , and he realized that Bart must be very , tired . ) " But say , Arn . What can I do , or anybody else , if this fire sets out to go places in a forty-mile wind ? " When he had signed off , the Dispatcher was in as much of a dilemma as ever . He could not set trucks and bulldozers and hundreds of men rolling to fight a fire which existed only asi a future possibility . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to Bart was his closest present contact with the fire . " How 's the Spitcat looking , Judith ? " he asked . " Not much I can see this morning at all . Hardly any smoke at all . "  | " Well , I 'll tell you , Judith . Keep watching it , and if anythinghappens  --  she blows up or anything , starts throwing a ha of smoke  --  call me direct . Understand ? " After that , when he had eaten breakfast and the time was ; a little more decent , he called all the Ranger Stations in the Ponderosa , and then Zone Headquarters . At least if he ould n't mobilize , he could get everybody alerted . He noted in the log-book , most carefully , the time of all his calls . If there was a Board of Review , his record would be clear . He was anxious and nervous , tense with the dry north wind . Through the window he idly watched a scrap of newspaperbeing blown along . The wind lifted it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turning it over and over . Only when it had blown out of sight did he realize that the wind , to blow the paper like that , must be rising . And just then the Super stepped in . " Hi , Arn , " he said , " I 'm early . Could n't sleep  --  this wind , I guess . I was going over to Rabbitbrush today about some grazing permits , but I think I 'd better stick around . How 's that fire ? " But before Arn could answer , the girl with the fire-danger rating came in . ( And she was early too , because she also , it seemed , could not sleep because of the wind . ) She went to set the point on the rainbow-colored little circle . The Dispatcher knew that there was bad news ahead , with a high wind like this . Nevertheless he started a little , when she stepped away and showed the dial-face . The point stood well within the red sector labeled Extreme . During the night  --  like a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vital forces ebb  --  the Spitcat had grown weaker . At first , after the opposing rush of the backfireshad stopped its advance in a great upsurging wall ofp150flame , the fire had for a while burned vigorously in isolated spots . But having consumed the fuel at hand and being unable to spread farther , it quieted rapidly . Minute by minute , one by one , the flames flickered out ; red deadened into black . Nevertheless , the fire had spread to such a large area that even by morning it was still alive in some hundreds of isolated spots . As , after some great gang of the underworld has been shattered , a few of the desperate and dangerous still sit nursing their hatred in hidden cellars and lonely rooms , hoping for the time when they may again go out to steal and kill , so in hidden and lonely places the fire still lived . From the lower side of a log , a faint smoke arose . Underground , a dead root smouldered . In deep duff , though the surface was black , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall snags of the dead trees . As the fire had first rushed by them , it had ignited the dry moss around their bases . Aided by the upward draft of the heat , flames quickly ran clear to their tops , and for a little while they flamed like tall torches . Soon , however , the moss burned away , the passing of the ground fire removed the draft , and the fire in the dead trees died down . During the night the fire was quenched in many of the snags , but it still burned in others  --  eating along beneath a slab of still clinging bark , hiding in the crotch of a branch , working through the holes of borers and all kinds of cracks and crannies . The falling of the snags was too dangerous to be undertakenin the dark , but immediately after daybreak two crews had taken the guards off their cross-cut saws , collected their mauls and wedges , and moved in . Some twenty minutes later the first cry of TIM-BER-R-R resounded along the canyon/side , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall of the canyon , the first of the snags came down . As it struck , thirty feet of its top broke off , and a shower of sparks showed that it had been still a hazard . He dry northeast-wind had been moving down the canyon of Onion Creek since before daybreak , but it was not very strong . Nevertheless , aided by the quick rise of temperature after sunrise , it rapidly dried up the moisture of the night . New flames , almost invisible in the dazzling sunlight , licked upward here and there . Smoke rose from spots where there had been no smoke a moment before . And high in the air the tops of dead snags again began to burn . Yet , one might have said , the wind came only as a stimulantwhich for a few moments revives a dying man , then to pass away and let him sink more rapidly . The fire , contained withinthe line , could reach out for no new fuel , and the wind merely made it burn out more rapidly . So after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down again and to disappear-except that the tops of a few snags were smoking heavily told bursting into flame here and there . The situation was still under control , although Bart was worried again , as any fire-boss would have to be with a twentymiledry wind and some snags still smoking . The crews that had rested through the night were back on the job , and so he now had thirty-eight men for patrol and mop-up . With the northeast wind the down-canyon side was again the dangerous tine . He put the rested crews on that side , and scattered some of them back into the underbrush to watch for spot fires . The loggers and mill-men patrolled the rest of the line except for those who were getting the snags down . The snags were all that Bart was really concerned about , especially those thatp152were already flaming , even though they stood well inside the fire-line . Something must be done about them , if possible . He hurried down to where a falling-crew was at work . " How about it ? " he asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " The men glanced at one another . " We 'll take a look , " said one of them . One snag was burning at the bottom , and was too hot for the saw , even if you had had a salamander-crew to work it . They looked at another , appraised their chances with liberal profanity , and then got to work with the nonchalant air of men who were risking their lives and rather enjoying it . ( After all , you did n't hire out as a faller at all , if you were interested in dying in bed . ) Bart let them take the risk . If this fire ever jumped the line on a day like this , there would be a lot of trees burned and many lives in hazard . While two men worked on the saw , another stood back and i watched the burning top . Just as they finished the first undercuthe yelled , and they ran . A thirty-foot slab of flaming three- " inch bark came falling through the air . They dodged behind trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working , with a crash that would have brained any man alive . They kicked the burning fragments out of the way , and got to work again . And still that great mass of cold air poured out , southward and westward , across the jagged tops of the mountains toward the hot lowlands . High in the air it was like a smooth and swift-running stream . But close to the ground , it eddied and swirled around peak and ridge and point , and ran turbulently as a mountain-torrent  --  here slower , here swifter , here built up into great gusts as surging waves of invisible air brokep153against mountainsides , funneled through gaps , or clashed one against another . Dry at the beginning , that air grew drier still as it flowed down the slope , and grew warmer . It licked up thirstily the few drops of rain and the little dampness of the night . It robbed the plants of hard-won moisture sucked up from deep iii the ground . Leaves wilted on the bitter-brush and mountain-lilac ; turpentine distilled from the pines ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pressure of the dry wind like an attackingenemy , the men wet their parched lips , and still the lips cracked . Suddenly they knew they were playing a desperate gamble . Around the fire ran a narrow line of cleared earth . Inside it , as the dry wind brought half-dead sparks to life , more and more flames licked up . Another snag where the fire had seemed dead , began to smoke ; flames rose from its top , leaning off before the wind ; sparks flew . And just beyond the line , everwhere the thick dry underbrush and the desiccated pine-needles waited for a spark in the turpentine-smelling air . The fallers took longer chances . " TIM-BFR-RR ! " came the call , and another snag crashed down to the ground , where the gusts no longer swirled off the sparks . In the underbrush the scattered men with shovels and McLeods looked back and forth , watching the air for flying sparks , and the ground for I rising smoke , wetting their lips , wondering . . . . Then at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , a gigantic wave of air billowed and broke along the slope of the ridge , invisible , except as it wildly tossed the branches . From the slope of Howell Mountain another surgingwave raced downward . The two met on the ridge in a great swirl.  |p154The  tree-tops bent suddenly like grass . In the power of the blast the flames at the tops of burning snags stood out stiff like flags . The quick wrench of the whirling air tore off bits of bark and rotten wood , swirled them upward for a moment , and then tossed and hurled them off . Some cooled as they fell ; some lit within the fire-line ; but others blew across the line and fell flaming upon the tinderdryneedles . As a dog jumps from a platform and hits the ground running , so a fire took off from each fallen spark . A strip of glowing bark dropped within ten feet of Slugger O'Neill . He jumped for it , as a flame licked forward three feet across the needles . With a single desperate scrape of his shovel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself . In a few frenzied seconds he scraped a line around the spot-fire and contained it . But other burning bits fell elsewhere . Flames ran across the surface of pine-needles for a second , and then flared up into the bushes . Working wildly , men shouted for help , but none came , for there were more fires than men . As you worked to hold one fire , another blazed up in the bush behind you . Suddenly it was wide-open disaster , twenty spot-fires racing across the duff , smoke everywhere , underbrush blazing . Bart , running down the line from where the blow-up had caught him , saw that the game was up . " Get back out of there , boys ! " he screamed . " Get back out of there ! Head for the old burn ! " Some of them heard , and a white-faced youngster burst out of the underbrush , slapping at a spark on his sleeve . " Onel " counted Bart . " Two-three-four-five . There 's Slugger  --  six ! " But there were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees that in a minute or so was going to blaze up like hell itself . Taking a long breath , heplunged in . If men were endangered for being where his r : ,  |p155orders  had sent them , his job was to get them out , or else not go home and tell about it . Fifty feet in , he came to a boy working so frantically around a burning bush that he did not even hear as Bart shouted at him . Bart grabbed his arm and shook it . " Get back out of here ! Get back into the old burn ! " " Christ ! " yelled the boy . " Why do n't someone come ? We can catch this one ! " " You damn fool , get back before your pants burn off you ! " And then suddenly the boy looked around , and went white , and ran back . Bart went on , shouting to the men ahead . Then all at once he knew that there was no going back into the old burn any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to another of the boys , who had dropped his McLeodand stood gazing about in horror at the blazes in front and behind . " Come with me ! " said Bart . He was running now , edging off between the fires . Paralleling what had been the old line , he picked up two of ' the jumpers . Far ahead , through rising smoke , he saw an-w her of them running downhill in great leaps like a deer . He found two more  --  these were from suppression-crew  --  and then there was no more time . With the five men following , he angled off , running downhilland away from the fire  --  but there were fires ahead too . Sinoke was everywhere , blowing out flat before the wind . They coughed and choked with it , and their eyes watered and stung . The air was furnace-hot . Bart heard one of the boys cry out sharply in panic , " We 're Rain ' to burn here ! I 'm goin ' t'run for it ! " Turning , Bart struck him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Shut up ! " he said . " I 've been in these woods twenty years ,  |p156and  I do n't want to die more than you dol Stay with me ! " They went on for a few moments , the boy sniffling . Smoke shut off the sun and all landmarks , and Bart only kept directionby the feel of the slope . They choked so hard that they had to lean low to breathe closer to the ground , and their run faded off to a shuffle . The dry wind poured heat upon them . They hit a thick clump of young trees , and had to skirt it . Maybe , Bart was thinking , the boy was right . Maybe I did n't want to run for it because I 'm old and have a paunch on me . Maybe I should have let them run . But still panic was never good on a fire , and if you ran , you might get snarled up with thickets , or break a leg , or merely'find that the fire  --  in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or blown ahead , and trapped you . Just then right ahead through the smoke they all saw the glowing red-hot branches of a bush , and one of the boys let out the little scream of a trapped thing . But Bart was not afraid of panic any more . They were past that , and only wantingsomeone to tell them what to do . From the sparks that came sailing by , he knew that fire was not far behind . Things would be decided now , pretty soon . He led on , through the thick smoke , toward the glowing branches in front . It was a spot-fire  --  not very big probably , but it would have to do . It was scarcely burning along its windward side , where they were . Bart took as deep a breath as he could , threw his hands over his head , and dashed through the line of fire . The others followed . They had to slap out burning spots in their clothes , and their shoes were hot . But they were inside a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were certain to get extremely hot , maybe worse . But it was better than making a blind dash through the burn- ing and smoke-filled forest , and short of some miracle such as the wind dying down , it was the best they could hope . Their hearts were pounding ; they were coughing worse than ever ; they were half-blinded with smoke . They all lay ( ) it the hot ground , panting , and trying to suck up a little ofthe cleaner air that moved along under the smoke . On Cerro Gordo that morning she stayed mostly inside the room . The wind seemed to shake the whole tower ; she could scarcely stand on the catwalk . There was only the faintest wisp of smoke over beyond reverse Ridge . Then she just glanced in the other direction ( ' or a second  --  so it seemed , at least  --  and when she looked I , ; tck , a great black column was towering up . Even while she stood for a horror-struck moment looking at it , the top billowedupward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some deep ancestral habit , she stood , making sure before she committed herself . Then she ran for the telephone . This time she was cool as she rang the bell and waited ; she was a veteran now . " Hello , Arn ? " she said . " Say , the Spitcat has blown up . There 's a big column of smoke , rising fast . " After he got the news , Arnold Sorenson , the Dispatcher , paused only long enough to think once , " Well , here it is ! " and then he went into action . " Come on , Bud , " he called to his assistant in the next room. - That Spitcat Fire has taken off ! Call our rangers , and tellthem to give us all they got . Fire-camp at Onion Flat . " He lifted the receiver , and heard the operator taking a call . " Clear the lines , Jackie , " he said . " We 've got a blow-up ! " " Yes , sir , " said Jackie , without even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  get me Zone ! " Yet , as he waited the few seconds it would take to get that call through , the Dispatcher felt himself curiously calm and not particularly in a hurry . This was no flash-fire like that one on Hart Creek , where a minute 's time lost in getaway might mean the difference between five acres and five thousand . It was not even like the Spitcat of yesterday where ten parachutistscould turn the scale ; now a whole battalion would not suffice . Today the job was not so much like fighting a battle as like building up an army . What yesterday had been a frontier-incident was now a total war . The fire was blazing on both sides of the little burned area . The six of them lay close together , the four on the outside sheltering with their bodies the two who lay inside . One of these was hysterical , and the other had to hold him so that he would n't jump up and run , as he had tried once . Two of the boys had held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used the shovels to scrape dirt and burned needles and rocks from the center and pile it around the outside . The freshly cleared earth was a little cooler , but there were so many rocks that they could not scrape out much dirt , and the pile only served to shelter their faces . Every little while someone squirmed suddenly and started slapping at a smoking place on his shirt or pants where a spark had lighted . Now and then the hysterical one gave a scream . So far , so good ! Bart was thinking that he had been in as bad a hole as this a couple of times before  --  on the Nelson Point Fire , for instance . He had even seen men go hysterical . ( He hoped the boy was just hysterical , and not really gone off . ) So far , so good ! The bark of the trees around them had been scorched in the first run of the fire and now it was smoking . If it began to burn , the place might get warmer than ap159man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and let them siiffocate in smoke . Or , if the fire worked up into the tops of t lie big trees and went roaring off as a crown-fire , burning needles and twigs would come showering down , and the heat would just get to be more than a man 's body could stand . Someone started " Our Father . . . " in a quiet voice , and t hen someone else began with " Hail , Mary . . . . " In a few minutes now they would know . So far , so good ! Humbug Point saw the blow-up , and Lovers Leap . Horse Mountain reported , and signed off , quoting Joel 2:30  --  " and in the earth , blood , and fire , and pillars of smoke . " Far to the north , Sheer Rock saw it suddenly above the high shoulder of I Lowell Mountain . Hamlin Point saw it build up above the round top of Cerro Gordo , like the towering smoke of a newbornvolcano . . . . Lien Roach at Sheba Ranger Station stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm heading out . Part 's in t rouble ! " Jerry Barrett was pressing the throttle down to the floorboards , a mile out of Rabbitbrush , on the highway up to the Pass . . . . Already Forest had talked to Zone , and Zone had talked to legion . In the Regional Office in San Francisco , two hundred miles away , the Dispatcher was yelling for aerial photographs , and telling his operator to put a call through to Los Angeles . " Good God ! " he was thinking , " that whole Ponderosa country is a tinder-box today . We 've got to hit that fire with everything we can throw at it  --  and quick ! " Since the blow-up , the Spitcat bad already run half a mile flown the ridge , and thrown out spot-fires even farther . It was not a solid wall of fire , but was full of reaching arms , andp160isolated spot-fires , and little islands of doomed greenery burningfiercely around their edges . Now the great gust of wind had died down , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piling-up of heat . The first rush of the wind had raced it along the ground , driving the heat low before it . But now the great mass of superheatedair rose upward . A small tree flamed , and then with a deep hiss a two-hundred-foot pine rose in a solid column of flame that towered a hundred feet higher . For half a minute the hiss deepened into a roar ; the burning branches tossed as in a hurricane ; then , as the tree burned out , the roar faded . But already the heat had been too much for the next tree . It too towered into flame , and from it the fire spread onward to the interlocked branches of two others . And now with a kind of slow majesty  --  when the end of the world is at hand , there is no need to hurry  --  the crown-fire moved down the ridge , leaping from tree-top to tree-top . The great pines and firs were burning like blades of grass in a prairie-fire , and the flames leaped up their hundreds of feet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the power of Forest and Zone and Region would have been for the moment no more than a few ants , futilely scurrying . The camp-truck  --  it was always kept loaded  --  rolled out of the yard at Suffolk , three of the crew in the seat . . . . A rumor was running on the grape-vine that Bart  --  no , it was Slugger  --  had been caught in the blow-up and burned to death , along with six men  --  no , it was eight . . . . The Supervisor himself , a little pale , was nursing the radio , trying to get through to the fire . But everything had gone dead . All they knew about the fire was what came in from the lookouts . " Call for that scouting-plane again , " he said.  | " Say it 's double emergency , may mean saving lives . " And again he spoke into the transmitter . . . . Walt Burnaby , trouble-shooter for the Regional Office on big fires , picked up his war-bag , and headed out for San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst of the smoke , Bart heard the long hiss and roar that meant a crownfire . He raised his head a little into the smoke and fierce heat , and turned this way and that , trying to locate the sound . There was all the difference between life and death , dependingupon whether the fire had crowned to windward of them , or farther down the ridge . Almost at once he was fairly sure it was down-ridge , and at the same moment a breath of fresh and cooler air , clean of smoke , low along the ground , swept across his face . And then , suddenly , he knew . " Feel that , boys ! " he yelled , or tried to yell . But there was so much smoke in him and his throat was so dry , that he merely moved his tongue and lips and croaked a little . But they too had felt the cooler air , and as another whiff of it came across the ground , two of them raised their heads up . They looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they grinned . The Supervisor quit fiddling with the radio . " I 'm heading in , he said . " Who had I better take in the car ? " " Ralph and two of the girls are going in for time-keepers , " said the Dispatcher . " Take them .  --  Say , who 's fire-boss ? " " Why , Bart .  --  Is n't he ? " " Oh , Bart  --  yes ! " And then the Supervisor pulled out . . . . The Modoc and the Lassen had no fires going , but their danger was so high that the Zone Dispatcher told them top162watch their own backyards . He took five " overhead "  --  rangers and other trained men  --  from the Klamath , and ten from the Shasta , and the whole Trinity fire-team , including the Supervisor . . . . On Second Street in Sacramento the loud-speaker began toblare : " MEN WANTED FOR **28;3001;TOOLONG , GOOD PAY ! - MEN WANTED TO FIGHT FOREST-FIREI " There was one thing about a hot fire  --  the hotter it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high wind  --  the faster it drove the fire along , the faster it cleared out the smoke and heat after the fire had passed . One minute they were on the edge of roasting to death and suffocating while everything was ablaze just outside their little island . The next minute they were sitting up in a stream of fresh and fairly cool air . Once there was little fuel left , the force of the wind was actually blowing the smaller flames out , as if they had been matches . The one that was hysterical suddenly stopped his whimpering , sat up , and seemed perfectly all right . One of the jumpers discovered that when he had started to run his canteen was around his shoulder in its sling . In the excitement he had not even thought of it before , but now he passed it round . Each of them gargled a mouthful , and spit it out to get the smoke from their throats , and then drank a little . Bart stood up , and got his bearings . From down-ridge came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way they had come in  --  many little fires were still burning , but they were isolated and the ground looked not too hot to walk across . He knew that it could not be far to the old burn . They seemed to have run a long way through the smoke , but actuallythey had not.  |p163All  at once he ceased being a man saving his life or even a crew-boss saving his men 's lives . He was Ranger of Barlow District , and he was fire-boss of a fire that had gone rampagingout of control . His forest was burning , and lie could actuallyhear his beloved trees going up in flames one after the other . Moreover , he was the key man , and until he got back into touch , nothing at all  --  or all the wrong things  --  might be done . " I 'm going outl " he said . " You can come with me or stay here  --  there 's no more dangerl " As be thought they would , they all followed him . They were still shaken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the feet , and Bart went at a run . He was so keyed up with emergency that he did not feel tired in spite of it all . As he thought , it was no distance at all back to the old fire-line . No one was in sight , and Bart went scrambling down the steep trail , halloo-ing as he went . At the bottom , the fire had swept through what had been his headquarters for the night . The two back-pumps were scorched beyond use , and his radio was a lot of bare wires and blackened tubes . He heard halloo-ing now from the other side of the canyon . I Ie led his little gang down to the creek , crossed , and went up h the other side . A lot of men were sitting around at the spot where he had tied Betty the morning before . They were mostly from the mill-crew . When they saw Bart , they burst out into a chorus which was mostly profanity , but managed to express the idea that they thought he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were men without a leader , demoralized , merely watching the fire , impassively , as a spectacle . They had halted here apparently because this was where Betty had been tied ,  |p164and  that was a sort of official recognition . Tony had taken her out with the pack-train early in the morning , and nothing was left here but a trampled half-circle and two piles of horsedung . But for men who had suddenly seen things flame up as if their whole world were going to pieces , this was enough for a rallying-spot . Bart had so many things to do that he had no place to begin . First of all , he asked whether anybody had been burned . The men shrugged their shoulders , but at least they did not know definitely of anyone who had been killed . Where were the crew-bosses ? They did n't know for sure  --  but after some questions it turned out that Slugger and another boss were probably down the canyon somewhere with a few men watching this side of the slope to catch spot-fires . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to pieces . ) Then Bart saw the boy with the bad knee , and beside him was Slugger 's radio , which the boy had had the sense to carry out . But in the excitement the aerial had been lost somewhere . Bart sent two men across to the old headquarters to see if they could salvage an aerial . He sent four men to scout around the old fire line to look for the boss of the mill-crew , and bring back all the abandoned tools they could find . He sent four more to go to the top of the ridge , see what was happening on the other side , locate any men who were over there , and find out if they needed first-aid . Step by step he brought order again , and the listless men came to life . He sent the rest of them down to join Slugger and help with spot-fires . He had a chance now to look again at the five who had been with him in the fire . The two jumpers seemed all right ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and sent them down-canyon also . The boy who had been hystericalwanted to go too , but Bart knew he could not be trustedp165on a fire-line for a while , and told him to rest . One of the others had a bad-looking burn on the hip , and the fifth had a shoe that had gone all to pieces with the heat . Still , they might have been a lot worse off . The two men came back with the aerial , broken in one place and black with soot . They set about rigging it . At least it might serve to get a message as far as to Cerro Gordo or I Iumbug Point . Then at last Bart had nothing to do for the moment . He eat down in the dust of the trail . The sun was dazzling on his eyes , and the dry wind , warmer now , still came pouring down the canyon . The fire was crowning , a mile down the ridge . It was throwing a monstrous column of smoke , hot enough to rise high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all the charred bits of needles and bark that were being whirled upward . As each tree flared , Bart saw the sudden towering flame , and a piece of himself seemed to go up with every tree . He felt suddenly discouraged , as if he might burst out crying like a little boy . For all he knew yet , several men might have been caught and burned . And then he felt so tired that he could not even keep his mind steadily upon how bad everything was , and as he sat there in the trail , his head tipped forward , and he dozed off . By now , half the lookouts in the Plumas and Tahoe Forests could see the Spitcat smoke . From a hundred miles westward , lookouts in the Mendocino saw it rising above the haze that filled the Sacramento Valley . It towered to twenty thousand feet , dark gray in the distance , leaning off to the south and west before the wind . The top was so high that its moisture had condensed and a fluffy white cloud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fewp166minutes before , that moisture had been part of the wood and leaves and pine-needles on the ridge above Onion Creek , it had passed as vapor through the fire , and now it was a chilly mist , close to freezing , a little below the boundary of the stratosphere . . . . Flying at eight thousand feet , above Blue Canyon , the great four-motored plane was ahead of schedule because of the heavy tail-wind . One of the passengers sighted the far-off column of smoke . " Look ! " he said to his seat-mate . " Must be a forest-fire . " " Sure looks like it . You suppose they have men out there fighting it ? " " Must be a dirty job , in all that smoke . " A little wave of comment spread through the plane . Most of the passengers were interested enough to turn their heads in that direction . " I hear they have women for lookouts now , " said a girl . " It must be thrilling ! " Two men began to argue languidly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether it just happened to be there anyway . But most of the passengers were now collecting their thoughts for their arrival in San Francisco . . . . The heat of the fire was more intense than ever . In its midst the oxygen was actually burned out of the air over an isolated spot about an acre in extent . For a second the needles and twigs glowed red , superheated to incandescence like the filamentof an electric-light , unable to burn for lack of fresh air . Then as the wind burst in , the whole acre exploded , with a roar that was close to a crash . A tremendous whirlwind of fire and smoke spiraled upward two hundred feet above the treetops . In it swirled flaming twigs , strips of bark , and even whole branches , torn off by the tornado-force of the hot blast.  |p167Now  in the clear , now in the very edge of the smoke , the scout-plane bounced and tossed in the rising heat-currents. l'at Gilchrist , the Polkville Ranger , reported over the cracklingradio : " She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . .. Ca n't see that she 's spotted across Wilson Creek yet , but there 's enough eddy to the wind so she probably will . . . . Some men down there  --  look black , but may be soot on their faces . Do n't dare go down lower to see . One of them 's waving , but he do n't make it look emergencylike . I do n't think anybody 's hurt . . . . Onion Creek side not so bad  --  quite a few men there , and the wind is keeping her a little away from the creek . " In Pasadena , five hundred miles to the south , the street was tliick with Sunday-morning traffic as people converged upon a I I the churches . Suddenly the traffic shrank back to the curbs . A Forest-Service car , its siren at full blast , took the five-mile length of Colorado Street in five minutes , heading for BurbankAirport . . . . On the skid-rows of Stockton and Reno , as well as in Sacramento , the loud-speakers were blaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stenographer of the Ponderosa had gone for a week-end with her family in Marysville . The call came that she was needed as a relief at the switchboard . " They ca n't make you , " said her father . " Tell them where to get off at ! " " But you see , Dad , there 's a fire ! " And she began throwing her things into the suitcase . . At Camp Far West many of the men were away on Sunday passes , but the sergeants swept the barracks of the unlucky ones.  | " Turn out , you guys ! There 's a fire ! . " From the thick-forested ridges of the Klamath where men look out toward Oregon , from the brush-covered peaks of the Cleveland which meet the mountains of Mexico , from Los Padres canyons where the ocean-mist eddies around redwoods , from arid Inyo slopes where the last pines go out to meet the desert  --  from them all the men were coming . When the camp-truck pulled in at Onion Flat not a single man was there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along with the suppression-crew truck , and Tony 's mule truck . The camp-truck rolled to a stop at the little turn-around which marked the road-head , and the camp-boss jumped off and looked the place over . It was a good spot for a camp  --  a pine-covered triangular flat covering about ten acres at the point where Bacchus Creek came into Onion Creek . The camp-boss mapped the lay-out in his head  --  Parking on both sides of the road as it came into the south end of the flat along Onion Creek , Timekeeper next , and then Supply at the turnaround , Communications , First Aid , and Headquarters opposite Supply between the road and Onion Creek , Kitchen in the angle of the creeks with room enough around it for men to sit and eat , Sleeping Grounds out of the way over by Bac. chus Creek , and Latrine up on the first slope of the hill . Another truck with supplies and five more of the campcrew pulled in behind the first one . " All right , boys , " barked the camp-boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ropes , shovels and McLeods tied in bunches , sharp double-bitted axes specially boxed for safety , mauls , wedges , rakes , cross-cut saws with guards for carrying , brush . knives , clippers , Pulaskis , grubbing-hoes , gasoline lampsp169headlights for night-work , the first-aid chest , desks for headquarters , bedding-rolls ( they made a mountainous heap ) , toilet paper , canteens , time-keeper 's blanks  --  everything was there , including a dozen sharpened pencils , neat stenciled sign-boards for Headquarters , Latrine , and the rest , a box of extra shoe-strings to call a man 's bluff when he said he had , , token a lace and could n't go out with his crew , and a little American flag to fly over Headquarters . But that was only at Supply , and over by Kitchen they unloadedstakes and ropes , camp-stoves , horses and planks for long tables , chests of tin cups and tin plates and tin bowls and knives and forks and spoons , a tent in case of rain , and a big canvas fly to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crates of telescoped boilers and all kinds of kitchen-utensils . And then the food  --  canned tomato-juice ( " You ca n't fight a fire without tomato-juice ! " ) , canned grapefitlit-juice , canned beans , canned corn , canned peas , canned peaches , canned plums , canned milk , sugar , salt , pepper , catsup , coffee  --  for , if men are going to work , they have to eat , and the better you feed them , the better they work . By the time the two trucks were nearly unloaded , a third ane pulled in . It had the cook and the bull-cook , and all the fresh supplies . The housewives of Suffolk were going to find poor pickings on Monday morning , for the cook had routed Ilse three Suffolk grocers out of their Sunday-morning naps , and swept the shelves of packaged bread , butter and margatine , apples and peaches , eggs , bacon and all fresh meat , potatoes and cabbages . There was a little confusion at first , and occasionally someoneran about looking for the precise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of mauls pounding on steel stakes . Then , as soon as the ropes had been run through the rings on the stakes , the place was no longer a forested flat inp170the mountains , but it was full of neatly marked-off and labeled squares and rectangles  --  like a village all laid out and waiting for its inhabitants . The Cook had his fires going , and would be prepared to serve lunch to a hundred men , or more in a pinch . The Supply-chief was ready to pass out tools at a moment 's notice , and the Transportation-chief had his book ready to check cars and trucks in and out . You could almost say the room was swept and garnished . Though no one actuallyhad any brooms out , two men were raking up the muledroppingsand clearing all litter from what would be the main paths , and two others were cutting bushes and small trees that would be in the road and were neatly lopping off all low branches , being careful not to leave sharp points for people to scratch against . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FIGHT FOREST-FIREI Bo Fox , the insignificant man who dislikeda closed door behind him , followed the drift . He was out of a job and nearly broke . In front of him a man said to his buddy : " Well , why not ? They feed you good , and you can sneak off to the woods and ditch a lot of work . " They went in to sign up , and Bo Fox followed them , drawn along in their wake rather than swayed by his own decision . . . . The smoke of the fire had now drifted down over Reverse ; Ridge , and obscured the sun . The rabbit , assuming that twi-r light was at hand , emerged from a manzanita thicket , and began to hop here and there , nibbling at grass and the tips of low-growing branches . . . . Barney Zulik , the cat-skinner , was at a beer-parlor in Polkvillewhen a foreman came looking for him.  | " There 's a fire up in the Basin , Barney . They need you in i here with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Barney . " Ai n't it my day off ? " And lie added some diversified comments . But the foreman knew the next move . " Say , Barney , " he said , " the guys that run those ForestServicecats ca n't cut bacon up in the woods . They need a real at-skinner in therel " " Set me up another ! " Barney yelled at the bartender , but lie already looked uncomfortable , as the workman 's sense of A job to be done began to stir within him . His bullet-head , set low on his shoulders , turned this way and that , as he glanced ; Tout to see what the others were thinking . He began to speak again in expletives , but ended : " O. K. I 'll be there . Only do n't try to rush me ! " And with quick gulps he drained his glass of beer . . . . Dutch Harbor was now drying out in a chilly and raw north wind . Having moved some hundreds of miles eastward , the storm was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gulf of Alaska . The little congregation at Suffolk had a war-time look  --  women , children , and graybeards . Many of them were ForestServicefamilies , and besides , a crew of thirty-five locals was ; ilready on the way to the fire , and most of the suppressionrewboys were from Suffolk . There was a haunting sense of fear in the little wooden church , and the preacher in his long prayer added a simple petition " for those of our loved ones who may be , this day , in danger . " He had hardly done more than announce his text when he saw a girl come in at the back , walk up the aisle nearly to the front and whisper something to her mother.  |p172From  high in the pulpit , he saw the wave of the whisper spread outward . People leaned across pews to get the message . No one was listening to the sermon , and the preacher , a sensible man and humanly curious , stopped talking and motioned to one of his deacons to come up and tell him the news . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there may be no more confusion , " he said loudly , " let me make an announcement . Ranger Bartley , who had been caught inside the fire with several men , has reported in . He and the others are safe , and all the other men of the original crews are now safely accounted for .  --  Let us join in singing Praise God from whom all blessings flow , ' after which I shall , under the circumstances , pronounce the benediction and dismiss the congregation . " Sunday always made mobilization a little harder , but the Dispatcher was well enough satisfied . Men were moving , and not by dozens now , but by hundreds . Access was still the worst problem . The only way he could figure to get cats to the fire was to truck them in from the Sheba side to Parker Flat , unloadthem there , and have them walked in along one of the ridges above Reverse Creek . It would be slow , but on the south side the cliff along Reverse Ridge and the narrow gorge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly force . But there was one thing ! If they could not come to the fire , the fire was obligingly coming to them . It was burning almost directly toward the road-head at Onion Flat . This morning a man had to cover seven miles of mountain trail to reach the fire . By tomorrow morning he might not have to do half that distance . The Supervisor took his time getting to the fire-camp . He could not afford to hurry or get excited . In front with him was the Chief Clerk going in as Timekeeper , and behind therep173were the two excited girls , both in blue jeans , who were going iii as assistants . Twice he stopped and talked with the Dispatcher , by radio , and found that mobilization was going ; Tong as fast as could be expected . He had no special job on the fire as yet , and hoped he would not have one . A big fire needed someone who could keep the long perspective , and not be concerned with any particular half-acre or half-day . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention on Wednesday and on all the little things that the others would miss , and to watch the men themselves  --  needling this one a little , commending that one . At the moment he was concerned about the road-markers . You could never have too many of them . He stopped the car where a track ran off toward the right . " I do n't suppose anybody would make a mistake here , but you ca n't tell at night . Signs are cheap . Let 's put up another . " He picked up a sign . It was designed : that the arrow could be pointed right or left and the sign m ill be read . The arrow itself was of a glittering ruby-color to , reflect back the headlights at night . Having tacked the sign to a convenient tree , the Supervisor drove on with the comfortable feeling of another detail made safe.  |p174Timekee|per  with his two girls had barely got set up for business when the first crew pulled in . During all the after  --  noon they came . Twenty-one ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down their speech a little when they saw the two girls . Thirty-five ( 35 ) local pick-ups from Suffolk  --  small ranchers , day-laborers , and the town bum . Ten ( i o ) Power-and-Light men with Johnny Martley a ' crew-boss . Twenty-five ( 25 ) of the Zone Hot-Shot Crew , professional . shock-troops , fit as athletes and specially trained for night fighting . Forty-four ( 44 ) from a crew that had been grubbing wild gooseberry on Blister Rust Control . Three ( 3 ) loggers with a lumber-company power-saw . Forty-five ( 45 ) Reno pick-ups , the worn-down survivors of x many a skid-row brawl and bender , with missing teeth and broken noses , and here and there a finger gone or only a shrunken lid where once was an eye . All afternoon also the overhead poured in  --  the men of the Forest Service with their pine-tree badges , ready to officer the crews . Bart threw the reins to one of the boys , and hurried toward Headquarters . Men seemed to be milling around all over Onion Flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and smeared where he had wiped it with his sleeve . From the blackness his bloodshot eyes shone with a kind of glare . There was dried blood on the back of his hand from a scratch . One shirt-sleeve was torn into tatters , and the back of his shirt was burned in three places . Hat and jacket were gone . He limped as he walked.  |p175All  over the Flat the impact of his coming surged and tidied . " There 's Bart . . . . The ranger .. . . Now we 'll be going . Hi , Bart ! . . . Tough time of itl . . . Knows all this ountry like a book . . . . Ben Roach was slapping him on the back . Jerry Barrett had cabbed him by the arm . Bart felt the warm wave of confidence and friendship rising 111 ) around him , almost like a physical support in his weariness . These men were his comrades ; they trusted him ; yes , they loved him . By God , they would go back in there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out that fire like a couple  --  f matches burning . But when he came to Headquarters and saw the Supervisor , he was cold for a moment , and then something inside him boiled up hotter . For in that first glance of the Super 's eyes Bart saw no love , although there was no hate either . But they were level , deep-searching eyes , and they seemed to be asking merely , " What about this Ranger ? Can he do the job ? " Then the Super , who always seemed to be looking down from the eight inches difference of height , stretched out his hand at the end of his long arm , and what he said was nearly the same , in words , as what Jerry Barrett had said : " Hi , Bart ! Well , I 'm glad to see you got out of it all right ! " Bart held his own hand back . " Thanks , Super , " he said . " Say , my hand 's all messy . " But then he put his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart , you must be tuckered out . " Ten minutes before , Bart had been ready to fall right to the ground but now that something which boiled inside him brought new drive and strength.  | " Say , Super , us old-timers can take it . This ai n't nothing for an old smoke-eater . You shoulda been here for the Merriam'sMill . " The Supervisor looked up and glanced around , and though he said nothing , his glance cleared out of Headquarters all the rangers who were standing there , so that he and Bart were alone . " Say , Bart , " he said , " how is she ? " " Pretty bad , all right . But I think we can catch her tomorrow morning . " " You think , or you hope ? " " I said think , did n't I ? " " Yes . " There was a pause , and then the Supervisor said , and his voice was almost hesitant : " Look here , Bart . I 've been figuring . You got called out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Sunday afternoon , and I know you have n't had much let-up . You 've been through a hell of a mess today . How about my putting Ben Roach in as fire-boss , and you getting some rest ? " The blood-shot eyes in the blackened face seemed to glare more brightly ; the thick jaw-muscles set hard . " Of course , Super , if you want to throw me out , all right . But this is my District that 's on fire , and my trees . I know th. , country . " The Supervisor thought for a very long moment : " O. K. She 's your baby . " Bart organized it as a three-division fire . Division I was the north flank , the Wilson Creek side ; Division II was the south flank , the Onion Creek side ; Division III was the front . Bart picked an Angeles man as Division-Boss for I , and a Trinity , man for II , but for III he picked Ben Roach , who was hisp177friend , and an old fire-fighter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barrett of the Rabbitbrush for ( thief of Staff . The Division-Bosses were assigned their Sector-Bosses , and the Sector-Bosses their Crew-Bosses , and the Crew-Bosses got the names of the dozen men who formed their crew . The crews lined up and were issued tools , and head-lamps , and canteens . About sunset they began to cross the log footbridge , and start up the switch-back trail . The Supervisor got out of Headquarters , so as not to be in Bart 's hair . After he had looked over the kitchen , he went and sat in his own car . Things seemed to be moving well enough , but he wondered what a general would think having to send into battle an army which had been thrown together in half a day , in which officers were assigned to their troops and moved them out to the battle-line in the same half-hour . The decision about Bart had been a hard one , and as he thought it over , he again weighed one side against the other . Bart knew fire , and he knew the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course were the chief points for him . On the other hand , Bart was tired , perhaps too tired , and besides lie was too much tied up in his feelings with the country . He said " my trees , " and when he said " I think , " he should perhapshave said , " I hope . " To fight a fire you had to be clearheaded , even if that meant pulling back and letting a thousand fine trees burn today , to save ten thousand tomorrow . So far the pro and con balanced . What had really swung Iiim was the knowledge that through the Forest , and even up and down the Region , men knew and liked John Bartley , and called him Bart . And if he himself , whom men called the Super , had used his power to replace Bart , there would havep178been an ugly taste in men 's mouths and a feeling of doubt and uncertainty . And men did their best job of fire-fighting only when they trusted their leaders . After dart : the Maps-and-Records @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working on his first map at a field-desk beneath a flaring gasoline lamp at Headquarters , and he gloomily deriveda kind of inverted pleasure from a careful plotting and 1 calculation of the day 's burn . On his township map he had outlined Saturday 's burn in red . It was insignificant-looking , about forty acres wholly j within Section 7 of Definite . From the reports of scouts  --  in the plane and afoot  --  he had lightly sketched in pencil the outline of the present day 's burn . Enormous by comparison , it spread across the townshipline , now stretched in a broad belt across Sections 12 , 13 , and III , 14 of Deerhound , and was already encroaching upon other sections . It had swept the whole ridge between the two creeks , and having crossed Reverse Creek at the end of the ridge , was burning now at several points in Reverse Flat . It ' teas roughly three miles long , and was nearly a mile wide . There was also a spot-fire to the north , where the fire had jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an orange  --  colored pencil . Estimating as carefully as possible , he put it down as totalling1085 acres , or something less than two square miles.  |p179THE  SIMPLER PEOPLES have no doubts ; the fire , for them , is living . It understands speech  --  so say no ill in its presence ; it g ows old and feeble , no matter how well fed , and must once a year be re-kindled ; the fire-sticks are man and woman , and the spark is born between them ; the reaching flames carry the seed of life , and a virgin lies close at her peril . The old words linger , and make us half believe . We feed and tend a fire , as if it were horse or child . It eats , devours , runs , spits , and roars . It lies as a sleeper , springs to life , and tiles . Its dwelling-place , the hearth , stands for man 's dwellingplace , the home . And ashen hale is the color of coming death . Quench once meant , both to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; kindle , to light a fire and to give birth to young . And c% en yet , as spelling shows , our kin and our own kind are those kindled from the same ancestral fire . At Cerro Gordo the girl was still on the catwalk after midnight . Far off , beyond the vague black mass of Reverse Ridge the : fire lit up the sky with a violent pink , like no color shep180had ever seen . " Forest-fire pink  --  our latest ! " she could imagine the advertisements saying . But who would want to wear it ? You thought of pinks as mild and washed-out , but this vehement glare was more dominant than scarlet or magenta . The night before , even though she had known where to look , she had seen no brightness . The fire was too far away , burning too mildly behind too many ridges . During the day she had seen only the gray mass of the smoke-column , but with evening the glow had built up as the light faded . The old guy on Horse Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day and a pillar of fire by night ; he was getting so excited that he was cluttering up the air with Biblicalquotations . Perhaps she herself was the one to be getting excited . As she knew from the map and from the wind and from the pink glow itself , the fire was driving right toward Cerro Gordo . To start with , it had been twelve miles off , now it was not more than nine . . But nine miles was a long way , and the brightest part of , the glow , which showed the actual line of flame , still made and arc of only six degrees on her fire-finder scale , a mere spot 004 the horizon . Besides , all day her squawking radio had blurteout memoranda of the mobilization . Region 5 was throwing a thousand men at the Spitcat . Somewhere  --  even now , per . haps  --  they were closing in for the kill . And she also was one of them , even though she wielded no shovel . She felt the quickening sense of comradeship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . y . All day they had been calling by telephone and radio . Familiar voices spoke : " Say , Judith , what 's that smoke looking like now ? " Unfamiliar voices spoke : " Cerro Gordo Look . out ? . . . Relay this message for us By day and night , now faint and now loud , she heard the.  |p187conversations  , sometimes both ends , sometimes only one , those strange conversations in which someone repeated himselfor said the same thing over in different words because Inc was not sure that the man at the other end could always h car . Now it was the Chief of Staff talking to a Division-Boss : " Has she spotted across the creek yet anywhere ? Has she  --  hotted across the creek ?  --  " Not that I can see . I do n't think so . No , I do n't think she 's spotted across the creek . " Now it was a scout reporting from in front of the fire ; he must have been going a hard clip through the woods , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond  --  me  --  from where I am now  --  that is  --  west  --  I mean . Nothing west  --  of me . Lot of reproduction - - thick stuff in around  --  here .  --  Y'hear me ? " ( Silence , as her radio did not pick up the reply , and then the scout went 011 . ) " O. K.  --  As I'as sayin '  --  lots of reproduction  --  she 'll burn hot . Well , I better be on my way . " Then he had signed off quickly , and there was only silence . But she could imagine him as he pulled down his aerial and gathered up his equipment and took another nervous appraise. ; look at the advancing fire , and then crashed on through file thick growth of young trees . " The girl was happy that evening  --  " she suddenly put the thought into unspoken words , and then checked herself . Yes , sloe was happy in spite of the fire  --  really , to be honest , becauseof it . For with the fire she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a girl by herself on a piountain-top , in flight from what she had not faced ; she felt herself now again to be a part of humanity . High on the lonely tower , cool in the night-wind , her thoughts were with the men who sweated on the fire-lines , in danger of deathFIRE 182p82perhaps . With them she fought a common enemy . This was no time to make up words in fantasy , to seek refuge inward . like a half-grown schoolgirl . There had been smouldering and ugly memories , and she had never quite dared to look at them . She had gone to i mountain-top , she had killed a rattlesnake  --  to show how strong she was . But she had not dared to look inward . But now the glow beyond Reverse Ridge was like reality itself . You could not wish it away . If you closed your eyes , it was there when you opened them . You could not fool it , or cajole it , or browbeat it , or trick it into signing on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter , but it was honest . With a thousand others , she marched outward to grapple it . Then , all at once , she looked into her own mind . Strangely , the ugly smouldering things were like light and cold ashen as if a fire had burned them . Suddenly , along with being very happy , she was lonely too , needing someone to share her happiness . After nightfall the Sacramento Valley had grown cooler , and though the broad current of air still flowed down the mountain-slope , it was no longer like a raging torrent , but like i smooth and swift river . As the wind had fallen off , the flames from each burning tree-top had begun to rise more sharply upward , and before long a tree burned without igniting the next one beyond it . From this gap in the blazing front the arms of cooler air worked outward in both directions , and the gap grew wider . The fir trees , their gums vaporizing , their thick-set needles holding back the heat , still went up in sheets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as they let the winter snow sift through to the ground , so they let the columns of heat and even the flames passp183through them and reach the upper air . Their slender needles held little gum , and even when they burned , they did not tower skyward with an explosive roar . Since most of the forest was of pines , the fire thus ceased to crown . It was very far , however , from sinking back into the weakness of the preceding nights , and it advanced steadily through the duff and underbrush , shot up in higher flames : t L every clump of younger trees , and occasionally still it roared t lear to the top of a big fir . It burned on a front of more than a mile , and from two square miles the heat still rose from burning snags and logs , like the heat of a thousand furnaces . As in some nation two races may live at peace before a hatred is kindled between them and grows hotter until they tly at each other 's throats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o f the air and the carbon of the needles and wood , in ordinary t lines , lived quietly . But now , heated by the approaching fire , they rushed together , and by their flaming union released more heat to spread the fire farther . Constantly indeed the ! teat drained off into the air , upwards ; at the same time , cooler air was sucked in at the base of the fire . But though the ! teat was thus kept within some limit , the current of cooler fresh air brought fresh supplies of oxygen . Like some great insensate monster , the fire thus seemed of its own strength to breathe and feed and to consume the forest for its own sustenance . Soon after midnight the southern corner of the fire came to t I t c edge of Reverse Meadow . The dry grass flared up ; the front of fire swept quickly across , and soon was burning in the forest on the other side . After midnight the three of them got together at Head- ( itiarters  --  Bart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regional Office . They pored over maps and aerial photographs , and hastily studied the reports which the scouts had radioed in . All evening they had been like a General Staff which sees its troops drained off to minor theaters of war . Division I had called for men to fight a spotfirebeyond Wilson Creek and keep it from crossing the ridge . Division II had needed fresh men for patrol to replace the worn-down mill-men and paratroopers who had been on the line since Saturday . But Bart had doled reinforcements out sparingly . To stop the fire he must meet its attack head-on as it came rolling across Reverse Flat , and so for Division III he held back the best crews for a striking-force . More than two hundred men were concentrating in the vicinity of Reverse Meadow . Exceptfor the stiff climb up the mountain-trail , they were fresh . They were under the command of Ben Roach as Division . Boss , and were organized under Sector- and Crew-Bosses , well equipped , with head-lamps for night-work . In addition , two cats were about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially , was simple . The crews of Division III must close a mile-and-a-half gap and get the back-fired going before the main fire reached the line . But beyond that . the problem grew more and more complex , as factors of time and wind and cover and human fallibility appeared . " We 'll radio to Ben to put her through here , " said Bart . From a point to the southwest of Reverse Meadow he drew a line northwesterly across the front of the fire , leaving a good quarter-mile of leeway . " How much of that line is through trees and how much through brush ? " asked Walt Burnaby . " Half and half , " said Bart , drawing on his memory of the country . The Super was checking the aerial photographs . " Betterp185titan half is through brush  --  thick manzanita , " he concluded . " Not much more ! " Bart snapped , and then he noticed , with a faint irritation , that the Super was doing a multiplication problem on a sheet of paper . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had once had to do in school arithmetic : " If A builds ten feet of fence in an hour , how long will it take . " Only the problem was a great deal more complicated than even an eighth-grade one . Take a mile and a half of line on the map , but that gets to be at least a mile and three-quarters on the ground , because you ca n't run a line straight across country . Then a man will build so many feet of line in an hour , but not so much his second hour , because he will be a little tired , and even less in the hours afterwards . He tends to work faster at night because it 's cooler , but slower because he ca n't see so well what he 's doing . Line through manzanita is much slower and has to be built wider . Two cats can punch a line through manzanita like nobody 's business , but two cats in the woods are n't two cats on the line . And then on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advance . Some of its paints were a long way out ahead , but you could send a crew in to hot-spot the points and hold them back . If you really tried to write an equation for all that , you had correction factors stretching across two pages , and yet if you did n't look at some real figures , you merely made a guess , or believedhat you wanted to believe . You studied fire-fighting all your life , and then every fire was different , and you had to adjust what you thought you knew . The Supervisor straightened out his long body from where it was bent over the desk , and came up with an answer . How much the answer was from figuring and how much from lunching  --  just as Bart hunched  --  was hard to say.  | " Well , " asked Walt Burnaby , " what 's the verdict of higher mathematics ? " The Supervisor could not tell whether Walt was smiling or not , but he was sure about Bart . " The mathematics says we 're all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He paused a moment . " Bart , you might give her a little more room . All that would burn would be the brush-field , and it 's no use anyway . " He saw the stubbornness set on Bart 's face . " You know , Super , that brush-field is old , and the young firs are poking right up through it . Give us ten-twenty years , and the brush will be dying out . Burn her now , and she 'll come up solid manzanita again . . . . You know , we got to decide something . " For another moment the Supervisor thought of all that might go wrong  --  a leaking oil-line on a cat , the carelessness of a Sector-Boss . Bart took the transmitter and glanced up for a word or a sign . The Supervisor remembered suddenly the story of some general who kept silence and refused to confirm or to countermand a charge . Bart began talking into the transmitter . Well , thought the Supervisor , that was it , and they had made a decision . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was better than no decision at all . Perhaps it was the same with a fire . But there was this difference . In war , even a rash decision , so long as you did something , might disconcert or confuse or frighten the enemy ; your very rashness might surprise him and catch him off balance ; you might even expect him to make some mistakes . But no matter what you did , you never bluffed or bothered the fire . You thought of it sometimes in human terms , as vindictive or treacherous , but actually the worst thing about it , and what most shook a man 's nerves , was its wholly inhuman calm , its unbreakable imperturbability . EIGHTH DAY 187p187Ito Fox did not mind being crowded into a bus with some thirty other winoes . In fact , he rather liked being close to the nian on the seat beside him . He got a little alarmed when the bus-door was closed with a bang , but he soon found that he mild open the window . That made him feel better . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountains and it was night , the air got so cool that the others made a fuss and he lead to close the window . Still , knowing that he could open it , and even crawl through it , made him feel less like being trapped . The old bus ground along slowly , up-grade , around many curves , and he heard through the darkness the rushing sound of a river . Barney Zulik ran his cat down the ramps from the truck , and zoomed his engine for a moment . The Forest-Service catskinnercame across to speak to him . Barney had never seen film before , and had the usual disdain of a lumber-company cat-skinner for a Forest-Service one , but he shook hands , and lie even agreed that he would follow the other cat . After all , this was a Forest-Service show . The other fellow was yelling various things over the roar of the engine , and Barney got the general drift : " Easy enough . . . five miles or . .. open , mostly pine . five-hundred feet up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Barney did not bother to hear or remember everything . All Inc had to do was to tag after the other cat , and he was ready to guarantee that in any game of follow-the-leader he would go as far as the other guy would , and farther too . The lights of the two cats glared whitely in the little open space at Parker Flat , reflecting back from the light-coloredp188bark of the big pines . The roar of the engines blotted out the gentle night-noise of the wind streaming through the pinetops . Barney 's swamper climbed up beside him . A ForestServiceman moved up-slope ahead , scouting the way on foot . He stood out sharply in the lights , his long shadow bobbing about as he moved . The other engine suddenly roared louder , and the cat lurched forward , crushing down the bushes . Barney gave her the gun , and followed the tracks . The Dispatcher did not even try to go to bed . Mobilization was still rolling , and there were a hundred things to watch after . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lately , but in some way it seemed hot . The dry wind blew steadily , with the smell of dust in it  --  and sometimes , he thought , the smell of smoke . He was still tense and nervous . That was , he knew , partly from the wind . But it was partly , also , from being so far away . Except when there was a blow-up , a man on the fire-line never worried much . The closer you were to the fire , the smaller part of it you could see , and when you were right there , it often seemed to be merely crackling around in a few bushes , no bigger than a trashfire in your own backyard . Often , if there was a chance , a man lay right down by the line or leaned back against a tree , and went quietly to sleep . Men at the fire-camp worried more , but they saw the reassuring movement of crews up to the fire-line . They rolled up in their blankets and lay on the hard ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men blundering over them in the darkness.  |p189But  a dispatcher back at Suffolk , if he had any imagination , worried and worried . If he went to bed , he lay in all the comfort of box-springs and sheets , and instead of sleeping , he tossed . He saw the fire , not as a few bushes burning , but as a nightmarish monster  --  miles around , blazing redly , engulfinga whole township . The men and equipment , even though they passed through , seemed mere driblets , and lie never saw them massed into power , as they were in the fire-camp . Though he was not even trying to sleep , the Dispatcher began to think of a wind-shift that might carry the fire off in some new direction , and of men trapped in brush-choked ravines , and of run-away crown-fires that roared through the night . He stepped to the little porch outside his office , still keepingwithin sound of telephone and radio . The stars were bright , but they were unfriendly , as the sun had been . They looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was no mellowness or benevolence , and no real beauty it , them . They looked  --  lie thought of a film he had seen  --  lik e diamonds sparkling on a hard and mean-looking woman . But over a large part of the northeastern sky , no stars were showing . That was where the smoke-column stood up . An old bus came lumbering by him , and slowed to a stop at the gasoline pump . He clicked it off in his mind ; it would be the one from Sacramento which had been delayed on the grades by an overheating motor . The men piled out , yawning and stretching , cursing aimlessly , lighting cigarettes . Beneath the brightness of the floodlight , the Dispatcher saw that it was , in average bunch of pogies . They were the despised and the rejected of civilization  --  weaklings , morons , alcoholics , perverts . Half of them were gray-haired . He felt a quick resentwentthat these were the basic material from which he mustp190build a fighting-force . Scarcely a man in the load but would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physically unfit , or mentally unreliable . Yet , as an honest man , he would give them their due . They r could take cold and heat and dirt and smoke , and sleep under a bush , and eat emergency rations . They expected little . At best , fire-fighting was a nasty job , and where a high-class workmanwould have thought he was being intolerably abused , the pogy would take things as they came . Sometimes also a crew of pogies would dig in and do a job to make you proud of them . " O. K. ! " he heard the bus-driver yelling . " Pile inl " The first one back into the bus raised the window and leaned out . For a moment the Dispatcher thought the man was trying to crawl out the window , and being a little shrimp he probably could have . That was a funny note , a pogy wantinga window open ! Usually the inside of one of their buses was hot and stuffy , smelling of tobacco , cheap liquor , and bodies . He heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he went in to answer it . And still to the camp at Onion Flat the trucks and buses kept rolling in . Ninety-nine ( 99 ) soldiers with a First Lieutenant ( i ) in command . " Hope to God that Looey goes out on the line with his men  --  the last one just stuck around camp ! " One hundred ( ioo ) sailors with two ( 2 ) Warrant Officers . " Christ , they 're wearin ' black oxfords again  --  do n't the Navy never learn at all ! " Two ( 2 ) volunteers who had been fishing up by Poisonp191Spring . " Say , you boys was in that C. O. camp last year , was n't you ? " Five ( 5 ) overhead from the San Bernardino , not quite at Dome among the tall trees and thick forests of the North . ' Hello , Bax . They sure must be scrapin ' the bottom of the barrel to send you ! " Sixty ( 6o ) pick-ups from Sacramento in two buses . " Sure , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California Hotel ? Must put an X here . " Fifty-eight ( 58 ) Mexican Nationals , lifted as a unit from the San Joaquin harvest-fields . " Adios , amigos ! Moocho goosto ! **55;3031;TOOLONG .. . Sure they understand me ! " Thirty-two ( 32 ) professionals from the State Division of Forestry , sent to give a hand in the emergency . " Say , why do n't you Federals hold a fire sometimes where the hills ai n't so steep ! " There came a sudden humming mutter , as the generatortrucktook over . Electric lights , strung from tree to tree , came on all over the central part of the camp . At Headquartersand at Timekeeper men turned off the hot and flaring gasoline lanterns . , By two in the morning the camp had sunk somewhat into inactivity , but it was still far from dead . Three men worked ; it Headquarters . The radio stand-by sat at his instrument , hilly alert . The timekeepers were busy . Supply issued bedding-rolls as new crews came in . Three camp-fires were burning quietly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them went over and stood by the fires for a few minutes , smoking cigarettes , spitting into the coals , relaxing . Even away from the electric lights the moonp192shed a little brightness through the canopy of pine boughs , j and as the men left the fires , they had enough light to guide them to the sleeping-ground . There  --  huddled beneath a bush , stretched straight upon the pine-needles , half-curled around the base of a big tree  --  everywhere were the rough mounds of men rolled in their blankets , catching a little rest , hoping to sleep the few hours before they went on shift in the morning . The heat of it that night was in the big brush-field which coveredmost of Reverse Flat , where Division III was running a line to hold the front of the fire . Ben Roach had the best crews there  --  the Hot-shot veterans , the blister-rust boys , some mill-men and loggers , the Suffolk locals . The fire was not exactly racing across the brush-field , but it was moving steadily , and making a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a good imitation of a real crown-fire . As the thick leaves distilled their oil , the hissing sheets of flame were white hot ; they looked hotter even than the blaze of a fir-tree , though they rose only to twenty or thirty feet in height . More often the fire did not spread directlyfrom bush to bush , but after one bush was burned , the flames died down as the fire crept forward through the ground-litter . Then the heat of the burning litter ignited the lower branches , and the next bush flared up . Here and there a vigorously growing young fir had managed to get its head above the manzanita , and each of these also , as the fire came to it , went up in a sheet of flame . A difficult place to work , and a dangerous one ! " Look out for your men , " Ben Roach warned his bosses . " Always be sure there 's a way out for them . " Not that the bosses needed any warning . They were experienced men themselves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but lead nothing of the soft green lushness of a jungle . The tough twigs bent back stiffly as you pressed to get through , and if they snapped , the broken points stuck out dagger-like . First went the ax-men . At each thick-set bush they swung with the flats , breaking the twigs and little branches . When they could reach in to larger branches , they used the edge . It was slow work . The moon was not bright enough to do much good , and the bobbing headlights were not all youWild ask for swinging an ax . The manzanita-wood was hard and tough ; even sharp axes in skilled hands made slow work ) I ' it . To come to one of the fir-trees was a relief . A good lumberjack could send the chips flying cleanly from the butt of one of these , and bring it toppling down after a few strokes . But even a good lumberjack left a manzanita branch looking chewed and haggled . " It 's as bad as the stuff we used to have in Burma , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of work the sweating pair of ax-men moved back , and other men went ahead to throw the litter of branches into the brush on the side away from the fire . Then the ax-men moved ahead again , and from behind came the men with shovels and McLeods , scraping away the smaller branches and twigs and the litter of dead leaves until the red dirt showed from beneath . A narrow line is no good in manzanita , and so they cleared to an eight-foot width . It was a lot ) hard work and little to show . Before long a kind of recurring chant began to go up : " Where 're the cats ? . . . Say , a cat could plow right through this stuff . . . Why do n't they get some cats ? " There was a long stringer reaching out ahead of the main line of the fire , and getting dangerously close . Ben sent the Suffolk locals in to hot-spot it , and hold it back . They workedp194close up to the point of the stringer , running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight a delaying-action , both flanks in the air . Right where the nose of the ridge began to fall away , the catskinnersgot their first good view of the fire  --  not only the main fire in the brush-field , but also a lot of the isolated blazes where snags and down-logs were still burning along the ridge that the crown-fire had swept over . They stopped a moment to consider . The Forest-Service cat-skinner said they were about two miles from the nearest point of the fire-line , and he figured they could make it by daybreak . " Christ ! Let me take the lead , " said Barney . " I 'll get us there before that ! " The other cat-skinner did not like the tone , but it was Barney 's turn . " Take it over then , if you want to get your Boy-Scout badge ! Hell , it 's no treat for me ! " Barney gunned his engine , worked his levers , spun the cat about , and walked it through the bushes to a place ahead of the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within him , and there was a dash in the way he swung it around . They started down the steep nose , a four-hundred foot slope ending in some almost level ground , an arm of Reverse Flat . In a few minutes Barney found he was going no faster than the other fellow had . The trouble was with that Forest-Serviceguy who was walking in front scouting out the way with his flashlight . " That bastard with the brass-plated pine-tree ! " Barney was fuming , " I 'd like to put it where it belongs , and him tool Ifp195he 'd get outa my way , I 'd slide this bunch of junk down to the crick faster than he could follow after it . You get out  --  " he turned to his swamper , " and point me out the way , and we 'll forget that bastard ! " They went a little faster then . The nose of the ridge was fairly open forest of big trees with much brush beneath them , and some rocks . The two scouts thrust ahead this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they had time to signal , Barney 's lights were close upon them , and the cat came roaring down , crushing bushes , toppling small trees , its treads crunching and scraping and sliding on the rocks . There was a steep open place , and for a hundred feet ahead Mrney 's lights showed up nothing but a smooth expanse of brush . He gave her the gun , and the big cat , its blade raised high , lurched forward . The two scouts jumped aside , out of t he way . The cat crunched down the slope . Then suddenly its t reads ran out along the tops of the bushes , and as the cat tipped forward the treads had nothing but bushes beneath them . Barney jumped and went flying through the air . The cat dropped on its blade , toppled , went upside down . Then , the whole thrust of its momentum driving it downward , it turned again  --  lazily as a rolling elephant  --  and came to rest upright . They rushed to pick up Barney 's body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he came up from the underbrush cursing . Short-necked and thick-set , he had merely curled up And lit in a clump of manzanita like a rubber ball . The stubs of broken branches had torn his clothes and clawed his face , ; end he looked as if a harrow had worked over him . But havingfallen about two feet from where the cat had rolled , he was not even limping . The cat , being at least as tough as Barney , was probably not much injured either . They hurried to look it over . Barney gotp196the engine started , but the control levers were bent beyond using from having had the whole weight rolled over on them . When they examined the place , they found there was a six-foot sheer drop-off . The brush had grown up higher belowthe ledge , so as to make the slope look about even . It was a natural tank-trap . The cat rested broadside to the slope , tilted at a silly angle , up to its ears in brush . The moonlight lit it up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Barney sat on top in all the blaze of light . The blood oozed from his scratched face , and he cursed steadily . He shoved and yanked at the hopelessly jammed controls . The old moon was high when Ben Roach made a hurried inspection of the first half-mile of line and told the Sector-boss to start burning it out . This had been the easiest part , before they came to the brush-field . Here the line ran through an all-aged forest of mixed conifers  --  ponderosa pine , incense cedar , and Douglas fir . But even here the line-building had been no picnic . There were gullies , and thick clumps of bitterbrushand young trees , and patches of squaw-carpet that held the earth in a mat of wiry roots . There were big fallen trees , half rotted , and you either had to take the line around them or else use up time in sawing a section out of them . Where a dead snag stood close to the line , you had to set a man to scraping a line around it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running up to its top . Still , this was all moderately open as compared to the brush-field , and a good eighteen-inch line was enough . Moreover , the Sector-boss started to light his back-fires without any fears for his men ; the forest behind them was open enough for a get-away , if necessary . But the brush-field was a differentp197story . In many places a man could hardly move through it at all , and the bosses always had to plan first for safety . The Suffolk locals had managed to hold back the point , but the main fire was getting too close for comfort . The men 's faces were sooty with smoke . They stopped to cough more often , or stood blinking their eyes to get the tears out and to see where to strike . They sucked at the canteens to ease thepoking in their throats . Now and then someone slapped quickly at his neck or hand , where one of the tiny but very lint specks of burning manzanita leaf had fallen . As every man worked , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncomfortable sense that these sparks were also I'alling beyond the line . Twice , little spot-fires puffed up on the wrong side , but men breaking their way through the brush controlled them before they took off= . The unfinished gap was less than two hundred yards now , and the men of each crew could look ahead through the alreadypaling moonlight , and see the bobbing headlights of the other crew and the severed branches being thrown aside . Rut off to one side the fire was not so far away as the distance to the other crew . " Listen ! " yelled one of the men . As the clump of axes and die scrape of McLeods ceased , they heard the crackle of fire and the sigh of wind , but cutting across those sounds , from cuff to the north , came the muttering roar of a big Diesel engine . A little cheer went up . " There she is ! . . . About time ! . . . That 's sure a cat ! " They suddenly relaxed a little . They stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One ) f them spoke the thoughts they had not dared express : " Say , it 's lucky she got here . We 'd never have closed this gap in time . "  |p198After  that they hardly worked at all . They knew that their axes were dulled and their muscles tired , and that the cat could punch the line through so fast that a few feet more or less made no difference . The noise of the Diesel swelled up . When the cat-skinner struck the cleared line , he made even better time . With blade still raised high , he bucked and plunged along . " Christ ! Look out  --  here he comes ! " With fine unconcern for human life , the big cat came careening down upon the men . They scattered to both sides , crowding back into the brush . The machine took over . It lurched to a stop at the head of the line . It paused a moment . The roar of the engine grew quieter , as if the monster  --  saying , " Permit me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation . The two men on top of it began to work levers , but they looked like mere slaves of the machine . The real power lay elsewhere . As the men worked the levers , the big steel blade sank lower and lower . The swamper switched off the lights , useless now in the dawn . The cat-skinner stood up and looked ahead at the lay of the land . The fire was so close that he decided to swing the line back in a little loop . The engine roared louder ; one tread scraped and slipped as the cat changed position a little . Then , as **26;3088;TOOLONG took over , it lurched slowly forward at the dense thicket ahead . Even above the roaring motor there was a sudden crackling noise as the blade sheared into the manzanita . The bushes at which the men had labored so slowly were no match for the concentrated power of the machine . Twigs bent back ; whole branches snapped ; four-inch stems were sheared off or uprooted . A forty-foot fir tipped , and went over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man could follow at a slow walk . Now and then indeed it paused . Perhaps the brush had piled up too high ahead of the diagonally slanting blade and must be pushed to one side . Perhaps , meeting the resistance of some larger , deeply rooted bush , even the power of the cat was equalled , and the treads slid for a moment , tearing the earth . But always the monster , backing off for a fresh start , changing angle a little , came in again and swept all before it . Behind the machine , the men moved in as mere scavengers . They picked up the litter of broken branches , threw them aside , and got to work with shovel and McLeod . But they could not even keep up . If there had been another cat to follow the first , clearing the litter , scraping down to the red earth , the work would have gone much faster . By now it was full light . The blaze of the fire was no longer as dominating as its smoke . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the other crew . Crashing into the brush , it swung around , and started back to mop up the line . The swamper lowered the blade , and it scraped the top of the ground , sliding all the litter off to one side , shaving off the top-soil . Crunching and banging , it tore out rocks or scraped over them . After it passed , the high places showed red dirt and the low places were filled with litter . Merely by the two passings of the cat , the trail was cleared out and leveled so that in a pinch a car might have been driven along it  --  where , a few minutes before , the brush had been so thick that a man could not even walk . Except for the raw earth and the piling up of litter on the sides , the fire-line was like a country lane , with the bushes on each side standing up higher than a man 's head . In one spot the fire was only twenty feet off . As a bush flared , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hung over the side , sheltering himself behind the seat . The cat-skinner shielded his face behind an arm . It was now or never , and behind the cat came Ben Roach with a lighted fusee . By good luck the back-fire caught quickly , and roared up to meet the advancing point . But there were dozens of others . Or rather , the line no longer met merely the threat of advancing points . There was danger everywhere . From one side the heat came like a steady pressure . The men worked , sheltering their faces . The heat of the first back-fire died down . No sparks had jumped the line , but the line itself had been too hastily cleared and a point of fire had worked across it to the other side . The heat was still furnace-like , but two Hot-shot men rushed in , caught the point of fire , and threw it back across the line . As they came running out , their shirts steaming , Ben Roach lit the next stretch of back-fire , and on the other side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger was too great , and so no man must be left there . That part of the line now had to take care of itself . To be anywhere along the line was dangerous now . On the unburned side the brush stretched away , so thick that a man trying to penetrate it must often climb over the tops of the bushes rather than walk on the ground and push his way through . Once the fire burned up to the line or a back-fire was lighted , no one could stay in the cleared line without being burned , and if he went into the brush and the fire jumped the line , he might be caught . The only way to light back-fires without trapping the men was to begin at the middle and work outwards in both directions . The rear-guard was the post of honor . A Sector-boss from the Inyo Forest held it on the north end , and Ben Roach held it on the south . .. .  |p201Ben  Roach had fought many fires , and he knew that this was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step by step . With luck it might hold , but the cat had got there a little too late , and there had been only one cat . The sun was up now , and that meant that the wind would blow a little harder . As he fell back , he made sure that no men were left behind him , and then he went along sticking the fusee into the dead leaves or among the twigs of some dead branch All the while he listened for the shouts from behind . With a couple of miracles they might hold her . A billowing curl of smoke came down right over him , and he coughed and shut his eyes , and slapped out a spark . His last back-fire blazed up finely , and he stepped off to get away from the heat . Then suddenly came the long whoop from behind . He swung around . " Beat it , boys ! " he yelled . He flung his fusee into the bushes , and ran . Ben was not young any more , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once could , and also he had to look around as he ran to be sure that no one was left behind . But the only ones he could see were two youngsters ahead of him , and about all of them he saw were the rising and falling soles of their shoes as they widened the gap . There was a cooler stretch . A buck leaped out of the brush on the fire-side , took two jumps down the trail , and then went off into the brush on the other side . ( He 'd take care of himself probably ; a deer could go through brush where a man would stick . ) Ben was panting , and it was hot and smoky here . He hoped that the Sector-boss , or whoever it was , had not waited too long before yelling . A wood-rat , fur ablaze , scuttled across . ( He would probably spread the fire , but no matter now . ) Chen , just ahead , smoke and flame seemed to be blowing right across the line . ( Anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , blowing hard . He was too much of an old/timer to get rattled in a tight place . He might try to go back and out the north end , or chance it through the brush , or build himself a back-fire , or just wait for the blaze ahead to die down a little , as it might . But things did not look too bad ahead . He wrapped a bandanna around his nose and mouth , pulled his felt hat low , took a long breath , and dashed in . For the first dozen jumps it was bad . Flames were reaching across the cleared line . But just as he wondered , he came out into an open space . He fell down , and rubbed his smoking clothes against the dirt . Then he was up and dashing into the bad spot ahead . It turned out to be not so bad , and in a few seconds he came through to the Sector-boss and a few men on the other side . All the Sector-boss said was : " Well , Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks he was getting Ben knew that his clothes and face must be a sight . There was a smell of singed hair about him from where a flame had swept under the brim of his hat . " Yes , " he said , " I made it , but I wo n't need a neck-shave soon .  --  How about all the others ? " " Everybody made it , I guess . But a couple of them sure got hot pants . Sorry I did n't give you more time . She came fast all of a sudden . " " How about the north end ? " " Have n't heard any shoutin ' , and you can still hear the cat , if you listen , though that might just mean they 'd pulled her back . " " Do n't make much difference now . The line 's all gone to hell anyway . Get on your radio , and tell ' em to pull out before they run into trouble . I 'll get to mine , and tell Bart about it . Check with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's tough . If both the cats had got here , we 'd of held her . . . Say ! " The Sector-boss held up his hand for silence . " Listen . They 've cut off the cat-engine . ... And now hear ' em yell ! " The cat-skinner , finding that he was likely to be in a hot place , had merely shoved the brush back in several directions , and then when the yell came to abandon the line , he just swung the cat into the open space , cut his engine , and ran Ior it . A cat thus protected would ride through a lot of heat . What happened on the north end was about the same as what had already happened on the south end , except for the doings of one man . The Forest-Service men on that sector were largely from the Inyo . They had been on a fire in another northern forest , and had been sent to the Spitcat without even going home or getting their clothes off . ( Now the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pines stand widely spaced on dry mountain-sides and even brush grows thinly . ) They were rather appalled at the thickness of the growth in Reverse Flat . As a result , most of them were over-cautious , but one of them was foolhardy , because he kept feeling that the brush at any given point must be unusually thick and that it would be normally thin just a little way off . Also he was a cocky youngster , who had never yet been in a bad fire . He had gone a few yards into the brush to catch a spot-fire , and he was there when the shout came to abandon the line . Looking back , he saw the cat-skinner run along the line and hen the Sector-boss , but the Sector-boss did not see him . Thinking for himself , he decided that by the time he scramNedback through the brush to the line and then ran along cite line , he might be in a bad way . Looking the other way , Ise saw that it was no great distance to where some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east side brush never grows thickly among trees . The smoke was drifting down heavily upon him from across the line , and he realized  --  all this took only a few seconds  --  that he was in a bad spot either way . As any man must , he made his decision in the light of his experience . He turned away from the fire , and began battling through the brush toward the fir-trees . ( It was like that old nightmare . You work and strain till the blood beats at your ears , but still your legs seem to have lead weights bolted to them ; your chest is tight , and the very air seems thick , as if you tried to struggle forward through deep gray ooze . ) For ten feet he crashed through an easy place . Then swingingwith his shovel , he broke away some branches ahead of him . There was a solid front of branches next , but on hands and knees , dragging the shovel , he started to crawl beneath . A dry branch snapped , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wriggled like a hooked fish . He lunged hard . The shirt tore , and he felt the branch-stub gouge at his back . With a twisting roll he broke through , and came out at the other side of the bush , panting , having advanced six feet . Standing up and jumping hard , he let his weight crash him through the next barrier . He felt his back bleeding . He came up squarely against a big dead bush , a whitened skeleton with sharp points reaching outward like a hundred deer-antlers . All he could do was to go back , swing to the right , and try again . He had gone no more than a hundred feet , but his heart was pounding so violently with the exertion that he had to stop for breath . Looking to the right , he saw that the fire had already jumped the line . A point had run ahead almost even with him.  | " Do n't get excited , " he thought , and looking ahead , he saw that the fir-trees were not so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He plunged ahead once more , again trying to slash a path with his shovel . It worked , but progress was too slow . Smoke was getting thicker and lower . He could hardly tell which way he wanted to go . The fire must have jumped the line behind him too . There was a sudden easy place  --  a deer-trail perhaps  --  and for a twisty thirty feet he almost ran . Then he stopped short , for it had bent toward the point of fire on the right , away from the direction he wanted to go . Getting his bearings with difficulty on account of the smoke , he again plunged at the tangle . A new wave of smoke rolled over him , making him stop and yield to a fit of coughing . But what really struck panic into him was the heat . The fire must be closer . He abandoned the useless and impeding shovel , and with a fit of energy flung himself upon the tops of the bushes , almost as a swimmer upon water . He worked forward for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or floundering across quicksand . The branches broke beneath his weight , and the broken points caught in his clothes , holding him back . They scratched and tore his skin . One shirt-sleeve was dangling , and he ripped it off . Standing up , he tried to walk across the tops of the bushes with his feet breaking through the twigs and finding some solid support upon the heavier branches beneath . This also worked , but it was too slow . His energy was failing . He had worked hard during the night , and now he was like a man trying to swim against a swift current , or setting out to sprint a hundred yards andp206finding he must go a mile . He was dizzy with fatigue , and the smoke cut him off from even the comfort of pure air for his heaving lungs . He stopped a moment for breath , crouching down low for cleaner air . He calmed his rising panic . " Got to play this clever , " he thought . He looked about shrewdly for the easiest passage-way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it without too much trouble , found another , went on . But such progress was always sinuous , and he struggledahead twenty feet to gain ten feet toward safety . He slapped at a spark , and in new panic at the thought of spot-fires , stood up to look ahead . Smoke was rising from a spot-fire well in front of him , to the left . But he felt sudden relief when he saw that the closest fir tree was scarcely a hundred feet away . Energetic again with the thought of safety and rest , he plunged ahead , just as a white sheet of searinghotflame went up from a bush not thirty feet behind him . He burst through bushes , climbed and walked across them , crawled beneath them . His face and hands , and his bare arm , were crisscrossed with bleeding scratches . He kept his eyes half-closed to protect them from smoke and from twigs . Almostblindly , in an animal-like intensity to live , he struggled on , keeping direction by the drift of the smoke . Then suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something soft and comforting to feel , not the harsh and hostile stubs of manzanita . It was the branch of a fir-tree ! He had a quick sense of thankfulness and relief , and then as he looked up , his heart sank even lower . The tree , some thirty feet high , rose from a solid mass of brush . The downward-slopingbranches of the fir intermingled with the upward-reachingbranches of the manzanita . The dense brush pressed upon the tree , as closely as the water of a lake lapsp207around an isolated spire of rock . Here was no safety , and no hope of easy progress . He was so exhausted that he lay still , with one hand claspingthe fir-branch , and failed to react quickly . He was like the runner who has run his mile , not to win a medal , but to find safety beyond the broken tape . Then , when he had broken the tape , there was no safety , and he had spent his strength on the final sprint . After half a minute he roused himself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complete panic . Still , he reasoned , where the trees stood more thickly , the brush must be thinner , since it could not thrive in shade . Straight ahead seemed still the best way . The long running point of fire on the right was ahead of him , and the spot-fire on the left had advanced and grown much larger . He was just about to try skirting the fir-tree when another loud of smoke enveloped him . He closed his eyes ; his throat gagged ; a paroxysm of coughing shook him . Suddenly  --  from smoke , or exhaustion , or panic  --  he was faint . Swallowing nausea , fighting blackness , he collapsed , sinking down almost comfortably upon the soft fir-branches . He lay dazed , unable to recover quickly because the smoke was still choking him . Like cold water dashed in his face , a sudden blast of heat brought him to alertness . The tip of the fir-tree was tossing . A gust of wind had blown up , and the fire was making a quick run . A bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in crackling fire . Quite calmly he knew that he could not out-run this fire . Even when he had had a good start , the thick brush had been too much for him , and now he was exhausted , and half-overomewith smoke . For a moment he thought of trying to make a cleared space around him or of digging a hole and coveringp208himself with dirt . But even if he had still had his shovel , there would probably not have been time , and with his bare hands it was clearly impossible . Yet he was a young man , scarcely more than a boy , and he could not merely lie there and let the fire burn him . With a final desperation he began to climb the fir-tree . Once he had reached the trunk , he found the branches in ladder-like arrangement , and he went up rapidly . The thick and sloping branches were almost like a sheltering roof to keep out both smoke and heat . He thought hopefully that the fire might sweep ahead beneath him . He was barely conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bush blazed up beside it , the distilled gum of the fir-needles exploded into a hissing flame . As the fire towered high above the tree-top , something tumbled from the branches , and fell inertly to the ground . A day of disaster , with one bit of bad news close behind an-other ! Bart had got to bed  --  crawled into a sleeping-bag without even taking off his shoes  --  about two o'clock . In spite of all his tensions , he was so tired that he went solidly to sleep , only to be raised out of it cruelly at four-thirty , when the siren went off . As the day-crews , cursing the siren , came crawling out of their blankets , Bart pulled himself together , crawled out too , and blundered over to Headquarters . The first thing they told him was that some fool cat-skinner had run his cat off a cliff and put it out of action until some major repairs had been done . Then , after an hour , came the word that the whole line in Reverse Flat  --  partly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone all to pieces ,  |p209and  let the fire go racing across the brush-field . Then , to top it all , a man was missing . Things were still too hot for anybody to go in and look for him . There was a chance he might merely have out-run the fire and still be wandering around in the woods . But he was more likely dead . Worst of all , he might be lying somewhere , badly burned and dying in agony for lack of care . Bart himself looked like disaster . He had not yet changed his shirt with the hole burned in it , or got all the soot off his face . There were bags under his eyes for want of sleep . Before the news of losing the line had come in , the daycrewshad lined up and eaten breakfast , and got started up the steep switch-back trail . Bart had to send a man on horseback to recall a lot of them . They would not be needed in Reverse Flat from here in . Yes , it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some ways it was not so bad as the day before , when the original blow-up had sent the fire crowning down the ridge . That had been complete rout . Today at least it was retreat in good order . The three of them held another council of war , but it did not take long this time . " I played it too close up , " said Bart . He felt that he had to say something , and he felt so bad about the man and about all the trees that were going to burn that he cared little about himself . " You 'd have been all right , " said Walt Barnaby , " except for that crazy cat-skinner . He wrecked his own cat , and of course that held up the other one for a while too . " " There was n't enough safety-margin , " said Bart . " We know that now , Bart , " said the Supervisor , " but nobodycan tell for sure in advance . " Still , Bart remembered how the Super had said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let the brushfieldburn . Just then the news came in that they had found a shovel with the handle burned away , and that did not make him feel any better . You could say it was just an industrial accident , as if you told a man to take a truck down to Suffolk for supplies , and he had a collision and was killed . Just the same , Bart had ordered the line run through , and the loss of that line and of the man were tied up together . There was no argument , though , about where the line should go this time . They all agreed that the top of Reverse Ridge was the place , and there was hardly need for Bart to state the case : " It 's a natural line of defense  --  ridge-top , and rocky , so that the trees are scattered . In a lot of places rock-ledges crop right out . Where you do n't get rock , the ground is pretty level on the ridge , and it 's good cat-country . That ridge would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mean a fire like this one ! " They agreed . And then came all the problems of reorganizationand redeployment . From a three-division fire , they reorganized it as a two-zone fire , with five divisions . First Zone would be all the north side . The Angeles man would take over as Zone-boss . There would have to be a new fire-camp . ( " Arn Sorenson can fix up the details . " ) Second Zone would be the south side . Its Division I would run from the northeastern point , near where the fire had started , down along Onion Creek ; that was mostly cold line now , and would not need many men . Division II would run from Reverse Creek along to the top of Reverse Ridge at the head of Waupomsy Creek ; there would be a lot of fire along that line ; it would be mostly a flanking-job , but still Division II would need plenty of men , and at least one cat  --  two , would be better . Division III would take the line straight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet thep211fire head-on ; that Division-boss would get first call on men , and should have all the cats he could use ( " Tell Arn we need a lot more cats ! " ) ; if the cats could clear out a way , tankers might even be able to get up to the ridge and fight the fire with water . ( " Arn 's got to see that the tankers are in the right place . " ) The other zone included the other two divisions . It had nearly as long a total line as Zone I , but it was cold  --  or nearly cold  --  or else would be a flanking job . Division IV ought to have two or three cats . ( " Make a note for the Dispatcher . " ) Division V could get along without any . There would have to be a wholly new fire-camp ( " Tell Arn to pick a place . " ) , and maybe a drop-camp somewhere on Division V. ( " Tell Arn , either that , or else get another packtraingoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gasoline- and oil- ( lump for the cats ( " Tell Arn ! " ) . Maybe we need a spike-camp over at the road-head there by Cerro Gordo . ( " Make a note for Arn on that too . " ) From here on , the Angeles man in charge of Zone 2 would be practically an independent commander . The fire was so big that no single Fire-boss could get around to all parts of it and plan the strategy in detail . The fire-camp for that zone would have its own independent supply-lines coming in from the north . The two camps might be seven or eight miles apart  --  by direct air-line , across the mountains  --  but they would be a lot farther than that by any trail , especially now that the fire was burning between them and would block trails . By road you would have to go thirty-nine miles back to Suffolk , t hen seventeen to Polkville , then twenty-seven more to Sheba , and then over a twisty mountain road twenty or twenty-five miles more . It would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i , particularly Division III , was the hot spot . ' ! ' here you wanted the men you could trust most , and workp212with best . So Bart kept Ben Roach for Division III ; there was nobody better than Ben for close-up command . Accessibility had always been the first problem with this fire . It had started in one of the most out-of-the-way spots in the forest . Now it had burned so as to separate the two zones and make any shift of personnel almost impossible . Now indeedthe fire was getting much more conveniently close to the Onion Flat camp . But still there was the problem of getting the men to the line . From Headquarters Bart had to tip his chin back to see up to the top of the steep mountain-wall beginning just across Bacchus Creek . It was a six-hundred-foot rise to where he could see , and beyond that was a gentler slope of four hundred feet before you got to the crest of Reverse Ridge . To get up the face of the Ridge by trail you would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cliff , and then two miles up Curran Creek . And then you would have to walk back along the top of the Ridge . But to a man who knew the mountains , the face of the Ridge was not so formidable as it looked . In most places the cliffs fell off sheer , but in between there were gaps where the rock had broken away . There were talus-slopes , and chimneys , and water-courses  --  you could even see trees  --  along which any active man could scramble up or down . From the camp to the crest of the Ridge was a thousand-foot climb , but not over a mile of distance . All that was needed was to have each Sector-boss take his men along the trail until he saw a likelylookingplace , and then lead them up to the top . Bart heard a nervous little laugh , and turned around to see one of the boys who had come in for campfire-permits the week before.  | " Wher 'd you blow in from ? " " Oh , we 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoke , and thought you might need some help . So we came in and volunteered  --  even if we are Conchies . " You mean , " said Bart , grinning , " you smelled smoke , and could n't keep away ! " The boy gave his little laugh again : " Yes , I guess so . " " What crew you in ? " " Mostly loggers . " " That 'll be a good crew , but do n't learn too many bad words from ' em ! " The boy gave his little laugh , and went on . But to Bart the meeting gave a definite lift . This fire-fighting was nasty and dirty and exhausting , and yet it made you feel good inside . I le did n't know that he blamed a Conchie too much for not going out to kill people . You might have to do it , but it could n't ever be a thing to feel too happy about . A Conchie who would come in and volunteer  --  especially after he 'd been fighting fires under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crews who had been ordered back from the trail to Reverse Flat , now that the line was lost , were coming into amp now . They were a motley crowd , but Bart suddenly felt a great human love for them all . They fought a common enemy , and not a lot of other men much like themselves . In a war , you had to teach men the causes , so that they would hate , and not trade tobacco and chocolate between outposts . Rut once let a man see a crown fire , and you did n't ever need t ell him it was an enemy of all men . The crews came streaming across the flat  --  loggers and millmen , linemen from Power and Light , soldiers and sailors , Conchies , two store-clerks from Suffolk , field-laborers from the Valley , pogies and winoes , a young Mendocino ranger with a Master 's degree , who might be Chief Forester before he died .

Among the pogies there was a good scattering of Negroes , two Filipinos , and a slant-eyed fellow who must be halfChinese . Among the loggers , three dark and short Indians , remnants of a slaughtered local tribe , walked beside the tall , blond-haired Scandinavians . The brown-faced Mexicans I talked musically in a language the others could not even understand . A Sector-boss called to his men , and jumping the narrow stream of Bacchus Creek , he began to lead up the steep ascentbeyond . By folklore , it was supposed to blow for three days , once it got started . Dave Halliday was not at all impressed by folkloreabout weather . A wind like this might blow one day or two days , or maybe four days . His morning weather map showed that it was certainly going to continue for its second day . Pressure over the inland plateau had fallen somewhat , but there was still a mass of cold and heavy air which was bound to come pouring out toward the California valleys . The Ponderosa Forest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the map and checking back to Sunday 's map , he decided that the wind would probably blow its traditional three days , and very likely a fourth for good measure . The storm which had brought in the cold air was moving slowly east across the Dakotas . The next storm behind it was squarely in the Gulf of Alaska . Between the two a tongue of polar air was poking down across Canada . He found himself wanting to see a weather-map of thep215whole world , instead of this miserable little rectangle which was only a few thousand miles each way . Though there were no intense storms and nothing you could call remarkable , yet lie felt a drama in the making . It was the turn of the seasons . he forces of the South were at last in full retreat ; those of the North , advancing . The sun was drawing back ; the frost was creeping down from the Pole . Now , during the clear nights on the high plateau , the heat that drained off into space was more than sun could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the west were still weak . Between a dying summer and an unborn winter , the west winds faltered . It was hard on the Ponderosa Forest . But even if you had . t World Weather Control , would they decide to shut off this particular little flow of air ? Perhaps it was just the safetyAveneeded . The situation which was burning trees in Californiamight be strengthening the hands of fire-fighters in Washington and British Columbia . And what about the forestsin Russia and India and East Africa ? He smiled a moment i .. the thought of what a thankless task World Weather Con-t ml would have . Just now every pressure-group in California would be bombarding it with telephone-calls : " This is the governor of California speaking . Shut off this north wind . It 's an outrage ! " . . . " Sorry , sir , but unless we drain that air off from the plateau , the European hay-crop will be ruined by too much rain . " He was glad that he only had to forecast weather , without being responsible for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had a curious kind of loyalty to the Ponderosa Forest . If he had really had the power , probably he would have turned off this wind .

Pressure over the inland plateau had fallen somewhat , but there was still a mass of cold and heavy air which was bound to come pouring out toward the California valleys . The Ponderosa Forest just had the bad luck to lie between . Studying the map and checking back to Sunday 's map , he decided that the wind would probably blow its traditional three days , and very likely a fourth for good measure . The storm which had brought in the cold air was moving slowly east across the Dakotas . The next storm behind it was squarely in the Gulf of Alaska . Between the two a tongue of polar air was poking down across Canada . He found himself wanting to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . ( So do n't worry . ) And you had n't ought a talk like that  --  might be some pipsqueaks hear it . Do n't worry now . Things look good . S-1415 to S-1493  --  Over and out , over and out . " Bart suddenly realized that Ben had signed off quickly to keep the Fire-boss from saying anything more over the air . He had slipped ! The radio stand-bys all around the fire would have heard , and would be saying to the next man : " Gee , Bart is worried . Things must be bad ! " For that matter , the Super and Walt Burnaby right here at Headquarters had heard him , and they were not saying anything , but he thought they looked a little disturbed . Judith Godoy and Dave Halliday , close together , leanedagainst the railing on the east catwalk . She was wearing khaki trousers and her dark-green man 's shirt , open at the neck to show her throat . The yellow handkerchief around her hair was more for work than looks today ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her mouth was a red blob of lipstick , that was more for protection too ; the air was drier than ever . The broad towering column of smoke was rising from just beyond Reverse Ridge . It was plainly full of eddies and billowsnow ; its grayness was shot through with yellow tones where it reflected flames and sunlight . Even from six miles off , though they could not look quite to the base of the fire , they continually saw great reddish flames lick upward . " I 'm just a Greek chorus , " she said . " What 's that ? I 'm just a meteorologist . " " I mean , I see everything that happens on the stage and make comments , but I just stay put and do n't take part in the action . " " Your comments affect what other people do .  --  Well , whatp254about me ? I keep looking at that storm on my map , and makingcomments on it , but I ca n't make the storm bring us rain to douse the fire . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even forecast it yet . If it keeps far enough south , we 'll get rain . If it keeps north , there wo n't be rain , and there 'll be another dry north wind behind it . " " That 'll be bad ! " " That 'll be terrible ! The only sure thing is to get this fire hog-tied before the front comes in , and we have n't got fortyeighthours to go . " " You heard him . He said the next half-hour was it . " " That 's fine ! That 's a lot off my back . On a carrier they can always decide whether to send the planes out or not to , but you just fight fires any weather . I do n't know that I like being a Greek chorus . " " It 's another thing we have in common , anyway , " she said simply , and then was in a fright for fear she might have said too much . But he was only smiling at her nicely . " There 's another bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wipe it off her hand . But in some way or other it seemed more natural just to let his hand stay on top of hers . A back-fire is a powerful weapon , but two-edged . It is highly effective , and equally tricky . Its effectiveness , and its trickiness , change with wind , cover , terrain , and all the other factors affecting the main fire itself . No experienced man begins backfiring without the secret fear that his own weapon will turn in his hand and strike him . A steady wind was blowing , so that the back-fires , if lighted close to the line , would not work back into the wind effectively . But if they were lighted well inside the line , the windp255would bring them sweeping down upon the line almost as dangerously as the main fire itself . The situation thus called for the trickiest of maneuvers , and the one which above all requires the closest timing . A large fire sucks air in toward itself from all directions . Thus at a certain distance ahead of itself the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance reverses the wind . The backfireswere thus to be lighted at the moment when this reversed current of air became effective . Perfectly executed , this is the grand slam , re-doubled ; it is the hole-in-one ; it is the home run with the bases full . Some old rangers , however , will tell you that approximately one hundred things may go wrong ; others say two hundred . Watching from his rock ledge , Ben Roach felt moderately confident . The line was clean , and in many places had the backing of the rock outcroppings . The growth in front of it was not too high or thick . He saw the crew-bosses begin to scatter some of their men back from the line to guard against spot-fires . The main fire had now dropped from the tree-tops entirely , but was still burning fiercely along the ground . It was getting close enough and was throwing out an almost intolerableheat . Ben felt the wind fall off to a lull , and then slide gently against his other cheek . At the same moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As its pink flame blazed up , he thrust it boldly into a carefully piled heap of dry brush . Thin smoke rose up , and then flames leaped and crackled . The fire built up fast . Two men watched to see that it did not jump the line . The Sector-boss ran off to start the next fire . In a few minutes Ben saw smokes rising from the line farthereast . The reverse of the air must have come later to the west , but after a while he saw the smokes there too.  |p256By  now the back-fires were roaring off and forming a solid front , twenty feet high . In a few minutes they would meet the main fire in a sudden dashing up of flame , and the worst would be over . Everything looked fine . A ranger who knows the country and has fought fire during thirty-nine seasons , who is sturdy of body and unwarped in mind , who feels behind him the strength of all his comrades  --  that is one man . It is something else to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insignificant , with a mind harboring strange bug-bears . Bo Fox , one might have thought , had nothing to live for , but most emphatically also , he had nothing to die for . There was thought neither of home nor of Fatherland , and not even pride in himself , to sustain him . To Ben Roach looking from the rock-ledge the back-fires roared off magnificently . To Bo Fox , half a mile down the line , the back-fires crackled too close to his ears , and threw off a terrifying heat against which he covered his face . The line seemed pitifully narrow and ineffective . He did not realize that the flames were actually moving away from it . Glancing back along the line where he had come in , he saw everything blotted out with drifting smoke , but he saw the crew-boss standing firm , and that steadied him for the moment . The reversed air-current was only close to the ground , and once sparks had been whirled upward , the prevailing wind blew some of them back across the line . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take care of it . The back-fire reached the advance of the main fire , and at their meeting the flames leaped high . Men cowered before the heat . Bo glanced behind him , and at that moment a little bush on the wrong side of the line flared up . He felt the click of the door behind him , and with the high/pitched scream of a terrified animal , he dropped his shovel and ran ! The crew-boss saw him and shouted , and then ran to stop him . The others looked , and saw a man running in panic , the crew-boss running and shouting , and a fire across the line . On the other side of them the fires roared up . " Run for it ! " someone yelled . " It 's the only way up through the cliff ! " They dropped tools and ran . " Jesus , we 're trapped ! " Swinging round , the crew-boss tried to block the trail , standing with his arms out , calling to them , cursing . Like stampeding animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's the only way out ! " The men of the crew farther east looked up and saw the others running , and their own flank in the air . The line was lost ! Something frightful must have happened ! They glanced behind them nervously , and rememberedabout only one way up through the cliff . Hell , the line was lost and there was no use being a hero ! They oozed back uncertainly . Their young crew-boss , worried about the responsibility for his men 's lives , considered hastily , half in a panic . If the other crew was running , there must be some reason for it . Perhaps the whole line was being abandoned , and in the confusionorders had not got through to him . He made the decision : " Come on , let 's get out of here ! Bring your tools ! " Having the tools made it look like an orderly retreat , but once started there was no use going slowly . The men began to run , glancing over their left shoulders at the fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these ran unashamedly , dropping shovels and axes and McLeods . In the other direction , it was sheer rout . Crew after crew looked up as they heard the babble of frightened men . They saw scared men running . The panic infected them , and they imagined some disaster , all the more terrible for being unknown . They too began to run . And once a man had started running , his panic grew . There was no use doing things by halves , and so he ran fast . As he ran , justifying himself , he babbled out words of disaster and terror to men whom he passed . This was no trained army , disciplined through months of maneuvers . The officers were not empowered to shoot the first man who retreated . Yet they were set against an enemy which was horrible and implacable , and worked upon primitivefears . As they ran , they felt the heat . At every bend of the trail , they feared to see the red fire already licking across it . Some of the crew-bosses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the flight . Most of them stood their ground , and usually a man or two of the crew stood with them . A Sector-boss , trying to block the flight , was knocked down by the running mob . The rout surged by the rock-ledge where Ben Roach stood , helpless to stop it . His jaw dropped . He had seen panic before , and recognized it now . " Good God ! " he said , turning to his radio-man . " You make allowance for wind and slope and cover and all the rest , and then the men panic on you ! " " We gettin ' out of here ? " the radio-man asked nervously . " Naw , this place is safe as church .  --  Get me Bart . " Toward the west the panic continued until the men came to the top of the gap through which the trail started down.  |p259By  that time they were blown and tired , and they had got to the place which had become associated with safety in the back of their minds . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Toward the east the panic rolled along until it came to the line held by the crew of convicts . These trusties might not rate high socially , but they were tough babies . They enjoyed mightily seeing the honest men run , and they stood by the side of the trail and jeered obscenely . The men who had been scattered back from the line to fight spot-fires started to run also , and most of them ran right away from the fire . Once they were running , they seemed to feel the fire hotter and hotter on the backs of their necks . When they came , by twos and threes , to where the cliff dropped off , they went sliding down steep places and jumpingfrom ledge to ledge , taking many more chances than they would have with the fire . They all got down safely except for one who piled up on the last slide with a broken leg crumpled under him . Actual trouble rather stilled the panic ; one man stayed with the injured fellow , and another went off for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcroppingsbacked it up . The little blaze which had startled Bo Fox merely burned itself out against the rock . But a long stretch of line was left empty except for a scattering of bosses and the few men who had stuck by them . As the meeting of the fires threw up high stabbing spirals of flame , the upper wind caught sparks and swirled them across the line . Here and there , as was only to be expected , wisps of smoke curled up . Like all spot-fires they started small . Some burned themselvesout against rock-ledges ; the few remaining men got to some of them . But other fires had puffed up in the longp260stretches where no men were left and in the gaps between outcroppings . In the dry wind the little fires built up rapidly , and raced ahead . Then suddenly , when that news came , Bart had a horrible vision  --  as if what had once been a beautiful young girl was stripped and ravished , horribly mutilated and fouled with dirt and black blood , and left thus to lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " God ! " he said only half aloud , and there was terror in his tone . He saw the Super and Walt Burnaby jump a little as he said it . Startled , they looked at him ; then quickly , at each other . By that time they were getting some idea of what had happened . Ben Roach had kept them in touch for a while , and then : " Getting too hot here . I 'm going to crawl into a rockcrannynow , and let her go over me . Over and out . " After that their chief reliance was Cerro Gordo . The Lookouthad a good view , except for the smoke , of all the south face of the ridge . From her reports it looked as if all the center of the line was holding by its own natural strength . But to east and west the fire was across , and reaching out in two broad tongues down the steep slope , the points moving fast . On the cliff-like slope the growth was thin , but the wind could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as fast as on the level ground . " God ! " he had said all at once , with terror in his voice , and the others had looked at him.  | " What is it , Bart ? " he heard the Super saying , and the voice sounded far away . But perhaps he himself was far away , he thought , for though he knew he was standing by the high desk at Headquarters , he heard the crash of flames in the cedars , he felt the bite of the thick smoke and the fierce heat , and he saw the azaleas wilting and the moss turning brown and the water flecked dirtily with ashes . " Yes  --  what is it  --  Bart ? " he heard Walt Burnaby 's voice this time , and it too came from far away , and it spoke slowly , forming the words distinctly , as you talk to a child . Then Bart came back slowly from where he had been . He put his hand on the planks , and steadied himself . He was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so much the being tired as all the horror that was soon to be . ( There was something dashing this way and that through the bushes , trapped . ) " Why , yes , " he said , and he thought his voice was steady . " Yes , Walt , I 'm here . What is it ? " " Do n't you think , Bart , you ought to get some rest ? You 've been going a long time . " " Hell , I 've gone longer than this , lots of times  --  that Mendocinobust in ' 44 . " " That was n't your own district . " It was the Super this time . " You 're worrying now . " Suddenly , when it was the Super talking , something oozed up from inside , and Bart was strong again . " Yes , " he said , and his voice was firm . " And why should n't I worry ! This ai n't just a lumber-yard to me ! I 'm Fire-boss here . That line would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can allow for that ! " " Nobody has blamed you , Bart , for that  --  or is going to . " But as Bart looked up at the tall man who towered abovep262him , there were wild ragings inside of him . ( He hoped they did not show in his face . ) He hated the younger man because his days of strength lay ahead , and because he thought of trees as lumber , and figured fire-fighting on sheets of paper . Then he shook himself , and turned to the map . He was Fire-boss ! He drew the point of a finger along on a line a little up the slope from Curran Creek . " We 'll put a new line along there , " he said . Even as he was saying it , while he leaned over the desk , he knew that they glanced at each other again across his back . He would have been angry , if he had not felt so tired again , and if the memory of that horrible vision had not still smouldereddeep inside him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " that 's playing it pretty close up , is n't it ? " " Maybe , but there 's some awful pretty country we got to save in there  --  that glen along Curran Creek . We can hold that line , if we do n't stand around makin ' long faces ! We got to believe we can do it ! ' But again he knew that they were looking at each other , and that one of them was probably making that little movement of the head which means to step aside somewhere and talk this over . " It ca n't be done , " said Walt Burnaby . " That 's right , " said the Super . He was holding the piece of paper in his hand . It was full of figures  --  man-power and transportation and line-building , against distance and rate of spread . The fire won , unless you figured in a miracle on the other side . " Well , " the Super went on , " I suppose we 'd better tell Bart so . " There was silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost hopefully . NINTH DAY 263 " No use ! " " What do you mean ? " " You know what I mean . " " I guess so , Walt . " " When a man starts talking about if we just think we can do it ! '  --  Maybe you can fight other people that way , but you ca n't , a fire ! " " Well. , it 's my job ! " " You 're supposed to put it in writing . " " Good God , not unless somebody makes me ! " From where they had drawn aside to talk it was not more than a hundred feet to Headquarters . That seemed a long , long walk . But even so , it was not long enough to let him think of a good way . Everybody liked Bart ! He himself liked Bart , even though Bart did n't like him . He wished he were the kind who could do something the easy way with people  --  not just run head on . Some people could jolly around for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not the other way round ! He came to Headquarters . Probably the boys must know what was going to happen . As he stopped and stood still for a moment , the Chief of Staff and the Maps-and-Records man and the others about Headquarters looked at him , and . they caught something in his glance . They faded away , out of earshot . Bart stood facing him , his back against the high desk . You could see he was waiting for something , as a wounded animal waits for the knife or the club . " Say , Bart , " he began , " you know , you were on that Hart Creek fire , and you 've had a pretty rough time here . You 're getting pretty tired , I guess  --  " He paused . " Yeah  --  " said Bart , not helping him out . " You see , Walt and I have been talking . We think maybep264you better  --  do n't you think it would be a good idea ?  --  if you took some time and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sweat flowed . " You mean , " said Bart in a level voice , " you mean you 're throwing me out of bein ' Fire-boss . " " Well , Bart , you 've had a tough time  --  " Suddenly he saw Bart 's eyes blaze ; at least he was going down fighting . " Super , you got to give that to me in writing ! " " All right , Bart , if you want it the hard way . " And yet it seemed really the easier way . This at least was a man taking it , not a wounded animal . The Super was calm now . He took a writing-pad , found a piece of carbon-paper , and adjusted it . With pen pressing hard to be sure the imprint carried through the carbon , he put down the date , and looking at his wrist-watch , added the hour and minute . Then he wrote : Ranger John Bartley is hereby and as of this time relieved of all further duties as Fire-boss of the Spitcat Fire . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PonderosaN . F. That was official enough to pass any Board of Review . " Here , " he said . Bart was still defiant as he took it , but as he looked , he seemed to crumple . He folded the paper once , and put it into his shirt-pocket . Then he turned and walked away. 1Like the wolf Fenris who has broken his bonds , with everreachingfingers like the hundred-handed Briareus , the monsterof withering flame and choking smoke again ranged loosep265in the forest . The fire rolled ahead through two broad breaks in the line . If there had really been a solid wall of cliff as the men imagined , the bare rock might have blocked the march of the flame . But actually , down every steep brush-covered slope in the gaps between sheer rock , the fire ran fast . With wind behindand steep slope in front , each spark fell far ahead . Burning cones and debris rolled and tumbled . As spot-fire after spot-fire flamed up in advance , the fire no longer merely crept along the ground , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocky southern face of the ridge , the forest was so thin as hardly to seem a forest at all . Sun-loving ponderosa pines grew sparsely , like trees planted one by one in a park . Here and there ancient gnarly junipers clung to the cliff-side , their roots anchored deep in the rock-crannies . Betweenthe scattered trees was only a thin growth of underbrushamong the rocks . Sending up little flame and smoke , the fire seemed to be rushing through to seize richer spoils , as men cross a desert to reach gold-mines beyond . Its rush was all forward . Often , splitting at some rock , it sent two arms ahead , to unite farther on but leave between them a long spindle-shaped patch of unburned ground . So also the front of the two breaks did not widen much . Instead , each seemed to pour over the steep slope following the breaks in the cliff , as if a dam had broken and water were cascading downward . As when an army-front collapses before a swift thrust and in the confusion , by platoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so on the broken front of Division III , each sector-boss and crew-boss fought the fire as he saw it . Here two bosses and three men labored heroically to contain ap266spot-fire . At last , exhausted and panting , they saw it die down , and then found that another one had leaped the line behind them so that all their work had gone for nothing . But elsewhere , thirty men without a leader merely stood and watched a fire escape when they might have controlled it . Gradually order came again . As the heat died down , Ben Roach climbed out of his rock-cranny , and got his radio working . Cerro Gordo Lookout , in spite of the smoke-curtain , plotted the general front of the two advancing points . Scouts , ; I hurried out from the fire-camp , reported more exact findings 1 i by radio . Sector-bosses radioed that they had rallied what few men they had left and were hanging on along the flanks of the break-throughs . In the log-book stood the simple entry , " 2:11 Supervisor Jones took over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected a certain sense of resentment , of oppositioneven . He had replaced Bart who was everybody 's friend , and he himself was merely the Super . Nobody called him Slim . But there was no sullenness . The fire burned a man in the brush-field , or the fire wore a man down and broke him by piled-up weariness and worry and horror . But where the man dropped out , the line united and faced the fire still . There was no surrender in this war . Again it was a flanking job , and he organized rapidly . In the emergency he turned out the night-crews two hours early . If they could hold the flanks and prevent the swift downwardrunningtongues from getting any wider  --  that would be enough for the present . On the down-slope there would be no chance of stopping the run , and there would be little chance of stopping it at the bottom . Now in September the water inp267Bacchus Creek was down to narrow ribbons between the pools . From the steep down-slope sparks would blow across the narrow ravine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then with the dry wind still behind , and duff and underbrush crackling dry , the fire would sweep off up-slope again with the combined forces of wind and rising heat to drive it . All anyone could do was to flank it on the up-slope and slowly pinch it out , or else fall back to a ridge and build a strong line along the crest . Again , he thought , it was like fighting a war . A general figured it would cost so many dog-tags to cross the Rhine . Thank God , a fire-boss did n't figure in lives of men , but he had to sacrifice trees here to save more trees farther on . That was part of Bart 's trouble ; he did n't want to admit that any trees had to burn . Now as he tilted his head and looked up the steep slope beyond Bacchus Creek , he saw the actual running front of fire . It had come over the crest and through the line of the cliffs , and now was sliding down the precipitous slope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious crab-like quality to it , for the smoke and flame rose up , and the line of fire moved down . Here and there through the smoke he caught the flash of a swinging ax . But the men were merely hanging on the flanks , having an easy enough time of it there , but wholly unable to work around in front . The Camp-boss came with his inevitable question : " Shall I start pulling her out ? " The Super looked at the fire again and estimated time and distance . He figured a minute on his pad  --  man-power and rate of line-building . Yes , it looked as if they could throw a line around the camp and hold it , but such tactics would call for many man-hours of labor , and there would be some riskp268in any case , both to thousands of dollars ' worth of property and to men 's lives . Shifting camp might be more expensive in time and labor , but at least it was safe and sure . " Go ahead , " he said to the Camp-boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no flat place big enough this side of the Guard Station at Idylhurst . " " Make it the Guard Station then . " Suddenly at the order men came hurrying , and trucks roared out of the transportation park and backed into place , and all the tons of material that had been so recently brought in and stowed so neatly with so much labor were broken out again and loaded . At the kitchen they quickly dumped the great kettles of half-cooked stew and the coffee-pots and the boilers of hot water , and they loaded kettles and pots and boilers still hot onto the truck . They doused the fires , and dismantled the stove-pipes and let the stoves cool a little , and loaded them while they were still warm . They loaded the mountainous heap of supplies  --  the sacks of potatoes , the boxes of oranges and apples , and the crates of cabbages and peaches , the margarine , the eggs , the bacon , and the packaged bread , all the high-stacked pile of canned goods . They loaded the chests of tin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knives and forks and spoons , and took down the big canvas fly and rolled it up and loaded it , and all the garbage-cans and kitchen utensils . The Timekeeper and his two girls loaded their own records and supplies , and piled into a car , and got off easily . But at the supply-dump they loaded the grind-stones and all the hundreds of axes and McLeods and shovels that were not out on the line , and the high heap of bedding-rolls . Even while they worked , the fire was rolling down the slope beyond the creek , and the smoke came drifting across the flatp269in little wisps . Then from off to the left along Bacchus Creek came the high whining roar as a pump-engine started . Anotherjoined in from far off to the right on Onion Creek . The pumps could throw water from the creeks , and wet down things close to the stream . They might work in along the flanks and narrow the front , but there was no hope that they could keep the fire from jumping Bacchus Creek . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two machine-guns against the break-through of an army-corps . A starter whished , and an engine took hold , and the first truck lumbered out past the Transportation-boss , and started down the road toward Idylhurst . A car got off with the women who had been working in the kitchen . ( That was good ; it was no time to be looking out for women . ) Just then came a thicker whirl of smoke as a gust of wind eddied down the narrow canyon . After that came the long whoop that they had been waiting for , from over on the slope by Bacchus Creek . It turned the blood a little cold . Someone was yelling for help , and you knew that the wind-gust had thrown a spark across the ravine and it had lit in the dry needles and taken off with a rush up-grade in the wind . With luck they would catch this one , but there would be a dozen to follow it . They were still working at Headquarters , but the canvas fly was gone from above them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for desk and a few maps and pads , and the log-book . If you laid down a pencil , somebody picked it up and packed it . Men were gathering round to grab the desk-planks too . Men unstrung the ropes from the steel rings , and coiled them up and loaded them . Mauls clanked against the steel stakes , knocking them loose in the ground . Men came carry-P270ing the brightly-painted red seats from the latrine , and the box of toilet-paper . They came with the wash-basins and the long planks from the wash-stand down by Bacchus Creek ; the wash-stand had almost been forgotten in the rush , and the fire was so close over there already that the tin basins were hot to the hand and the men had to grab the stuff and run . There was another long whoop , and then another . Two more trucks pulled out . At Transportation five grunting men hoisted a gasoline-drum into a pick-up truck and got it going . ( That was nothing to have around when sparks were falling . ) The Transportation-boss ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in all the cars . Mentally he checked the cars against the men left to be sure that they all had drivers . The flag came down at Headquarters and the radio aerial . " Keep close to me , " the Super said to his radio-man . Then he said to his Chief of Staff , " Let them get our stuff loaded now . Go on back , and get set up at Idylhurst . I 'll be along after a bit . " " Aye , aye , captain ! Last man to abandon ship , eh ? " The Super grinned . Hardly anything as heroic as abandoningship  --  but that was the idea at least ! He had hardly stepped back from the desk before some men picked up the planks , and another one shinned up the tree and started knocking down the neatly stencilled sign HEADQUARTERS . He walked across the flat , his radio-man dutifully trailing him . The camp  --  camp-site you would call it now  --  showed all the pathos of things without people , like an evacuated village or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hold . The ground was ripped and torn where feet had tramped and stakes had been pulled up . P271At the kitchen the sloppy messes of dumped stew had spread out along the ground ; in the center they still steamed a little , but along their edges flies were gathering already . A sack of fine Oregon potatoes had been spilled and lay scattered about . In the confusion of broken crates lay one that had been left for empty , but was still half-full of unopened cans of tomatojuice . A shiny tin cup lay there . Someone had tramped on it and ruined it , but a tin plate near by was good as new . Farther off among the trees lay a blanket-roll that had been missed . Somebody 's jacket hung limply from the stub of a limb . The sign LATRINE with an arrow beneath it was still on a tree . But all these made nothing to worry about . Firefightingwas a wasteful business at best , almost as wasteful as war , and you could n't stop to count pennies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeks . The rapid-fire high-pitched sputter of a pump was close . Just across Bacchus Creek he saw flames tossing in the bushes , close enough to be hot against his face . Up Onion Creek the clean flat arch of water from the pump was playing across at the other side of the ravine . It should be no trick to hold the line of Onion Creek , for the wind was nearly down-canyon , and the rushing stream was ten feet wide . Men were scattered along on the side opposite the fire , as they should be . But looking up Bacchus Creek , he saw that it was another story . Smoke was rising thickly on both sides of the little trickling stream . Whether the fire had jumped the bushy ravineor whether it was a big spot-fire made little difference . Already the Division-boss must have had to pull his men out from this side , and be merely trying to flank the fire on the west side as it ran up the slope . As he himself had planned , the area of the camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be made on lines farther back.  |p272Suddenly  he felt lonely and exposed , as if he were cut off from all help and about to be surrounded . This was no man 's land ! " Let 's get out of here , " he said , and he saw that the radiomanlooked unusually happy to be going . As they crossed the camp-site again , a spark had fallen from somewhere , and a little fire was quietly burning in the needles near where the kitchen had been . Running before the wind , widening its front as it ran , it had already left a blackened , wedge-shaped mark , twelve feet long . One edge of it licked along the mess of spilled stew , and sent up a faint smell of burning meat . Even without a shovel , just by grabbing up the abandoned tin plate and scraping a few needles away , he could have stopped that fire . But there was no use . He walked on . There was only one car  --  his own  --  left at the parking space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starter button , hoping it would work . The engine started easily , and then he gave one last look . The little fire had spread noticeably farther . He swung the car out of the parkingspace , and started down the road for Idylhurst . The air was crisp and hot , but he seemed to hear the gurgle and swish of water , and to see the bow of a ship settle down deeper to meet a wave . The old man was going crazy , certainly . From the whining radio she heard the high chanting voice of the lookout on Horse Mountain . " Thus saith the prophet Joel , " it ran on . " Yea , the fire hath devoured the pastures of the wilderness , and the flame hath burned all the trees of the field . " Even on the catwalk , alone now and looking out throughp273the darkness toward the blazing face of Reverse Ridge , she heard him : " Repent ye , yea , repent . Thus saith the Lord through the mouth of Jeremiah , I will kindle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round about it . " Well , the old guy might be correct ! Jeremiah and the Lord were doing a pretty good job ! She had seen the dramatic break of that afternoon , and now the southern face of ReverseRidge , in full view , was still blazing up before her eyes . Two nights ago she had seen only the violent pink of the reflected fire ; last night she had seen merely an occasional tip of flame ; tonight , half the world seemed to be ablaze . Even on her high catwalk there was glare enough to cut through the darkness of the night . It reflected from the windows , not flaring up and down like the light from a single bonfire , but vibrating with a long and slow pulsation as now one part of the vast fire blazed up or another died down . " Woe unto us ! " cried the voice . " The mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven , with darkness , clouds , and thick darkness . " He was a little off , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain was burning to the midst of heaven all right . She thought of the line of the old song that her grandfather used to quote : Fire on the mountain , run , boys , run ! When she was a little girl , she wondered whether the boys were running to put the fire out or to get away from it . Well , she might have to do a little running herself before this was over . Step by step , day by day , the fire moved closer and closer . First it had been a tiny puff of smoke  --  twelve miles off . Then it had come  --  nine miles , seven miles . ( Like the poem about Sheridan 's ride she had read in Americanp274Lit . ) Now it burned in full view at the very base of her own mountain , four miles away . " Thus saith the Lord God , " the voice was chanting , highpitchedand ecstatic . " Behold I will kindle a fire in thee , and it shall devour every green tree in thee and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quenched . " " Sign off , Horse Mountain , " another voice was saying in irritation . ( It sounded like Humbug Point . ) " Sign off ! I 've got to get a message through . " There was a moment 's pause , and then Horse Mountain said in a matter-of-fact voice , just for the record apparently : " Ezekiel , 20:37 ; Ezekiel , 20:37 , " and signed off . The other message was merely something being relayed through from the Zone 2 fire-camp , nothing of interest . As she looked out now through the binoculars , she saw individual fires . A tall snag suddenly flared clear to its top . She even saw , or imagined , its flames stringing out westward with the wind . ( It was shifting more into the east as Dave  --  oh , Dave  --  yes , as he had said , this afternoon , it would . ) With the more easterly wind she could see that the fire , having slid down to the bottom of the steep slope , was sending out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Curran Creek . What must be a patch of brush in the ravine was going up now in an intense flame that was more white than yellow . And there he was at it again ! She heard the high-pitched voice in sing-song : " A fire goeth before him , and burneth up his enemies around about . His lightnings enlightened the world ; the earth saw , and trembled . The hills melted like wax at the presence of the Lord . " Oh , she thought , come now ! It was a lightning-fire all right , but she had n't heard of any hills melting.  |p215whole  world , instead of this miserable little rectangle which was only a few thousand miles each way . Though there were no intense storms and nothing you could call remarkable , yet he felt a drama in the making . It was the turn of the seasons . The forces of the South were at last in full retreat ; those of the North , advancing . The sun was drawing back ; the frost was creeping down from the Pole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plateau , the heat that drained off into space was more than sun could supply during the day . Yet the storms moving from the west were still weak . Between a dying summer and an unborn winter , the west winds faltered . It was hard on the Ponderosa Forest . But even if you had a World Weather Control , would they decide to shut off this particular little flow of air ? Perhaps it was just the safetyvalveneeded . The situation which was burning trees in Californiamight be strengthening the hands of fire-fighters in Washington and British Columbia . And what about the forestsin Russia and India and East Africa ? He smiled a moment at the thought of what a thankless task World Weather Controlwould have . Just now every pressure-group in California would be bombarding it with telephone-calls : " This is the Governor of California speaking . Shut off this north wind . It 's an outrage ! " . . . " Sorry , sir , but unless we drain that air off from the plateau , the European hay-crop will be ruined by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only had to forecast weather , without being responsible for it . And yet , in spite of his world-view , he had a curious kind of loyalty to the Ponderosa Forest . If he had really had the power , probably he would have turned off this wind . Being just a person , he was too conscious of what was happening right around him , and his cracked lips were uncomfortable . hat would be the trouble with WWC , as they would call it . Whoever ran it would have to be a real citizen-of-the-world ofp218keep the fire from taking off up-slope , and to edge it back to the south of the creek . The abandoned cat , scorched but still workable , was brought out of the burned brush-field . Another cat also came to the rescue , and the newly organized Zone 2 flung the best of its man-power on this critical half-mile . On the other flank the problem was simpler . Since ther &; was obviously no stopping the fire where it roared in the fun- ' nel of the canyon , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line up the nose of a ridge , and be sure that the fire nowherejumped across the watershed . Far away along the top of Reverse Ridge two cats and two hundred men began work . The rabbit on Reverse Ridge was considerably disturbed that morning . He had never before seen or heard a man or a machine . The breaking of the underbrush , the clamor of voices , the scraping of tools , the roaring of engines  --  all worked togetherto confuse and alarm him . He retreated into his thickestbrush-clump , near the corner of the line where Division III and Division IV joined . There , not fifty feet inside the line , he lay quietly . After a while , since no harm came to him , he grew less alarmed . The bus in which Bo Fox was riding continued to have an overheating engine . Finally at Idylhurst it was stopped , and the men were loaded into a truck . They were then taken along the road which skirted the slope of Cerro Gordo , and unloaded at the new spike-camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led them up the steep and narrow trail toward the top of Reverse Ridge . Bo Fox looked about him with a continual , though furtive ,  |p219a|p|prehension  . He saw nothing in particular to arouse anxiety . He had never gone so deeply into the mountains before , but the presence of many men comforted him , and the crew-boss gave orders in such a way as to relieve him of any strain of making decisions . The trail zig-zagged up a steep talus-slope which formed a break between unscalable cliffs on either side . As the crew climbed higher , Bo looked more nervously in both directions and saw what seemed to be continuous walls of cliff , except for this one gap where the trail ran . His tension grew somewhat . The gap was comfortably broad as he looked at it , but when he moved his glance along the line of cliffs , the gap seemed a mere narrow entrance , the only break in a solid wall . If anything should contrive to block this door , the place might be a trap , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbroken front of smoke , This noon the base of the smoke-column covered twice as wide an arc on her fire-finder as it had on the day before . By its very look it seemed closer too . From scraps of talk over the radio she knew that it was on this side of Reverse Flat by now , and so was only about eight miles off . The smoke was less of an unvaried gray . She made out more whorls and convolutions . The sun was high overhead , but even so , it shone only as a red disk through the smoke . ( " The red sun was pasted in the sky like a wafer . " Who wrote that , about some battlefield ? She remembered it from English 13oC . ) Although she could . still cast a shadow , the light had a sinister yellowness . Then , as she stood on the east catwalk with her hands on the railing , something light and fluffy and white settled gently on the railing by her right thumb . It was a bit of feathery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling of that bit of ash , the fire seemed to jump closer . Now as she looked , she saw yellow tones , as of reflected flame , along the base of the smoke-column , just above Reverse Ridge . She decided also that the peculiar feeling in her nostrilswas not wholly from the dry wind but must be from smoke in the air  --  a faint permeation which had come so slowly across the miles and spread so universally that it could not be isolated as a smell . With the dry wind and the close atmosphere , it looked like an uncomfortable afternoon ahead . She thought of going into a halter and shorts , but that was hardly the costume for an official representative of the Forest Service , who was even theoreticallyempowered to make arrests . That ought to be headlines  --  agirl pinning her badge on the halter and dashing out to give someone a ticket for breaking fire-regulations ! But besides , during a fire there might be a lot of rough characters around , and a costume like that might seem a come-on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be comfortable . She did n't think there would be any man she could n't handle , particularly with the aid of that loaded pistol which Bart had insisted she keep handy . When she went out on the catwalk again , she looked more like Carmel Beach than Cerro Gordo Lookout . She had even done up her brown hair in a yellow handkerchief to keep the smoke and ashes out of it , and she was wearing dark , sloped-up glasses , for by now the sun was getting far enough to the west to be out from the smoke . The fire was certainly moving in on her . Plugging along the road which skirted Cerro Gordo she heard still another truck . She could not see it on account of the trees , but she knew that it was making for the newly established camp . Looking through her binoculars she clearly made out yet and  |p221other  long line of men carrying tools , climbing up the steep trail through one of the gaps in the cliffs . Then suddenly she was enveloped with thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impressed with the insects which she saw from the lookout , for she had thought of insects as fluttering low along the ground , not as sailing high across the tops of peaks . She caught one of the thousands , or millions , that were now filling the air . It was like a little winged ant . They must be termites , which swarmed after the first rain of the season , and were on their way to establish a colony in some fallen log . They would eat and digest the wood and thus return it to soil ; then from the soil another tree would be nourished , which after five hundred years might fall as another dead log and nourish the far descendants of these same termites . According to the Termitic School of Philosophy , she supposed , the object and divine purpose of forests was to supply food for termites . There were other flying things too , dark little beetles . Once she slapped hard when one of them lit on the back of her neck and bit her viciously . Unlike the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to be making purposefullytoward the smoke . These must be what Bart had called smoke-beetles , which lived by burrowing into charred wood . For them a forest fire was a bonanza , a regular opening of the Cherokee Strip . So much was happening that she had little time to be conscious of that feeling of exaltation which had come over her as she looked at the red glow through the darkness of the early morning . Yet when she stopped a moment , she still was happy , and was also happy with that sense of loneliness and wishing to share happiness with someone . Perhaps , she realized , that was why she listened intentlyp222when she heard a motor puttering somewhere on the treecoveredslope below her . It sounded closer than the main road , as if it might be on the steep pitch up to the lookout . As the sound got closer , she was sure . She dodged back from the catwalk in a slight panic , and considered pulling some jeans on , and a shirt . Then , peering through the glass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees , and a bright red jeep came right up the slope where there was n't even a road , and stopped in full sight . There was only the driver in it . He was not wearing a Forest-Service uniform , but he did not look like a rough-neck either . The gray pants looked like the Navy , and the open-necked plaid shirt gave him a collegiate touch . He had no hat , and his wavy brown hair had been blown in all directions by the wind . He looked sophisticated enough not to mind a girl in halter and shorts . Maybe he was sophisticated , but he did n't know much about the etiquette of lookouts . Instead of calling up to ask permission , he just started to climb the steel stairs , and she could hear him whistling softly . Of course she could close the trap door in the catwalk , and make him explain his business first , but that seemed like timidity and a bad start . She was really excited , pleasantly . She stood at the corner of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wind-blown hair rising up through the trap-door , and then the back of his neck and the plaid shirt . When that much of him had come up , he stopped , looked back over his shoulder , and saw her . At first there was just sheer amazement in his face , and then after a full second he blushed red . She stood enjoying it , as what girl would n't ! Then she had pity . " Come on up , " she said . " I 'm Judith Godoy , the lookout . " " O-o-h , " he said in a long-drawn exclamation , " I beg your pardon ! "  | " No harm ! Come on up . " " You see , " he said , still without moving , " Arn Sorenson did n't tell me there was a girl here . I 've just come to Suffolk , and I thought lookouts were men . " " I see . " " I 'm awfully sorry . All Arn said was he thought the lookoutand I might get along pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's what passes for a good joke in this part of the country .  --  Well , come on up , and have a look at my fire . " But when he came up , she was pleasantly conscious that he was not looking altogether at the fire . All right , she thought , it 's no crime , and there 's nothing about my figure that 's too deformed . Bart was in the saddle once more , and the black mare took the narrow trail along Curran Creek with quick strides . Behind , followed a boy with the radio , riding a bay gelding . The trail was steep as they came to the place where two big cedars grew close together , and Bart had his chance . He pulled the reins in , and swung himself to the ground . " Let them blow a minute , " he said to the boy , and then without saying anything more he went off through the underbrush . The place was not a hundred feet from the trail ; yet , asith many another place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . The tourists flocked to high points where they could see for miles and miles without being really close to anything ; they stood on the edge of canyons , and uttered senseless exclamations . But Bart never passed along this trail without stepping aside to look at what he merely called The Glen.  |p224Ice-cold  and clear , fed from unfailing springs , the little stream dropped in gentle falls over clean rocks from pool to pool . Where the high water of springtime swept them , the rocks were shining gray , and above that they were deep in moss kept always green in the dainty spray of the tiny waterfalls . Farther back from the stream , where the air was still moist , the azaleas grew , and in the spring the glade was spotted thick with the faintly orange blossoms . Out of the carpet of azaleas rose the red-brown fluted columns of the cedars , and high overhead the canopy of branches let the sunlightpierce through in long rays . Even on hot days , the Glen was cool . On windy days it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , air moved gently up or down the stream , as if the place itself were drawingbreath . Without thinking , Bart took off his hat . Moving carefully among the azaleas so as to break no branches , he went forward to a tiny pool , and knelt by it . The little rainbow trout darted away , as he leaned over to drink . As he rose again , he stood and gazed around . He breathed deeply . As when he had looked out from Cerro Gordo , profoundfeelings surged within him , inexpressible longings for beauty , and vague hope that all things might live together in love . Now , scarcely a hundred feet away , he made out the doe . She was standing in the shelter of a bush , looking out at him with grave curiosity . He saw the sleek curve of her neck , and the wide liquid eyes , timid and yet not really afraid . " Hello , old girl , " he said quietly , for he had seen her there often before , and she was almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . With a last look , he shuffled back through the azaleas , movingcarefully . This at least , he thought , was secure . The troutp225were too small to tempt fishermen , and no lumberman could afford to send crews into such a narrow ravine just to take out a few cedars . The doe might grow old and die , but her fawns would still haunt the glade . Trampling tourists would never come to admire the view . A six-foot waterfall , some little pools , moss on the rocks , azaleas , a sleek doe  --  that was not enough for a national advertising campaign and bus-loads of exclaiming vacationers . The place was secure to the man who loved it . From beneath the cliffs the springs would send forth their icy water , until the years of God had run . He had scarcely been gone a minute . As if with faith renewed , he came back to the trail , swung into the saddle , and started on , the boy on the bay gelding still following him . Nature might rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge men were at work . Bart shifted too , and changed to leader of men . As he rode along , he was like a general inspecting the ridgetopwhere his troops built fortifications against the headlong sweep of the approaching enemy . " That 's the Fire-boss ! . . . He 's the works ! . . . See , the guy on the black horse ! " He heard them , as the crews drew back to let the horses through . Though he was on horseback and though the radioboymight pass for an orderly , there was nothing of the fussand-feathersthat hedges a general about . His pine-tree badge was his only symbol of authority . His shirt was dirty and torn and had a hole burned in it ; his face was shaggy with a sproutingblack beard , speckled with gray . " Hi , Bart ! . . . ' Bout time you got here ! Been sleepin ' late ? . . . Where 'd you get that cayuse , Ranger ? " The ForestServicemen called out as he rode along . To a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air . A little more than forty-eight hours before , he had scrambled across a ravine and come to an insignificant fire on a canyon-side where Slugger O'Neill and his five tired boys were the only crew . By now , on Division III alone , three cats roared back and forth , and where their treads had passed , the trails were already deep in dust . By now three hundred men , still being reinforced , were mopping up behind the cats , and the bosses were from half the forests of California . Coming to a high spot along the ridge , Bart dismounted and climbed a rocky outcrop . Six miles to the west , away from the fire , Cerro Gordo Lookout stood out white on the round mountain-top . Close below him , over the curve of the slope to the southeast , the fire-camp was hidden from view . To the north and northeast , all was fire . Through the smoke he could barely make out the three parallel , toe-like ridges running out from the base of Howell Mountain . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still rising from them . The thickness of the smoke cut off the view of the brush-field in Reverse Flat , but he knew that it was all fireswept , and that the snag-patch was still blazing . Just along the left-hand edge of the smoke-column he barely made out the sector of Division IV where the fire had jumped to the north side of the stream . By latest reports that fight was going well , and from where he stood , it looked as if the fire had been edged in along the flank and finally crowded back to the creek . At best , that was only a victory in a local engagement . It was important as confining the fire and keeping it from widening its front , but it had not met the fire head-on . The main fire over there was south of the creek . It had moved fast through the snag-patch , and had thrown a long arm ahead . Division IV might still be in trouble if the fire jumped the creek again and headed up-slope . ( And that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fire always decided to do something else . ) Right below him , however , on the north slope of Reverse Ridge , was still the main front , a good mile wide . As he watched it , the fire was not racing rapidly , but even from so far away it seemed to advance with a terrifying inevitability . As a gust of wind struck , it made a short run forward , and engulfed a clump of small trees . He saw the flames shoot up . Yes , with the dry wind tending toward gustiness , conditions were still at the emergency-level . He had a pang at thinking of all the trees that would burn , but it would be too dangerous to put men in front of such a fire as it came funneling up those canyons  --  useless too . For there the fire , with the cumulativeheat sweeping up-slope , would have every chance of jumping any line that could be put in front of it . And if it crowned in the tall Douglas firs , it would merely roll on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridge was the only place . It was a strong position , for at that point the rising heat would be carried off into the air above the tops of the trees growing on the downward slope . Moreover , he had been able to mass machines and men along the ridge . Yet , as he watched the smoke and flame , his heart was sick for the burning trees , and he was far from confident . The very cumulative enormousness of the fire was sickening . By now the perimeter stretched out to many miles . Every minute millions of sparks were flying upward , and any veeringgust , even a whirlwind generated by the heat itself , might carry a spark across the line . There , in the crisp dry wind , thespark might take off before anyone saw it , and become a run-t ining fire that a hundred men could not catch . By this time the boy had got the radio set up , and was in touch with Zone 2 . Bart talked with the Zone-boss . He confirmed , what Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back across the creek . But they were having a bad time keeping it from jumping again farther up ; he needed more men for Division IV . Bart called the Onion Creek camp , and it turned out that the Super wanted to talk to him . " Hello , Bart , " said the Super . " Say , they found the body . " " The body ? " " Yes . " " Oh ! . . . Say , was the guy married ? " " They say he was . " They signed off , and Bart looked down the slope again to where the fire was burning . Suddenly it came in his mind to be a vile and ugly monster , raging wantonly among his trees . He had a quick and wild thought that he would gallop along the line to rally his men , and with a wild cheer they would dash down the slope against the fire , and charge upon it and stamp the life from it . Then he realized that the boy was staring at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving his lips . " You sick ? " said the boy . " Naw , I 'm all right , " said Bart , but it was an effort . " Must be tough to be a fire-boss , lots o ' work and no rest . " " Not that , " said Bart . " But when you 've watched a forest for twenty years and then see this happen , you 'll know what I mean . This big stretch of Douglas fir down there now  --  God , by tomorrow afternoon it 's going to be nothing but a lot of blackened snags . " The Super went to the chow-line late that evening . Balancing his tin plate and cup , he stood between two pogies , waiting for a cook to ladle out stew.  | " How 's she look , Ranger ? " asked a pogy . " Not too bad , " said the Super . He had felt suddenly warm when the pogy had called him " Ranger , " but of course the pogy did not even know his real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a ranger . The Super helped himself to catsup at the long table , messy with spilled sugar and salt and dirty spoons . Then he walked to the base of a tree , let his long legs fold up beneath him , and sat cross-legged , eating . Two Forest-Service men  --  from the Stanislaus , he thought  --  were eating near him , talking and laughing . He thought that perhaps he should have joined them . He would have liked to , but he was afraid they might stop laughing , and call him Super . The throbbing of the generator-truck began , and in the dusk the electric lights came on . Well , this was another day , he thought , and about as bad as a day could be . They had lost a man , and half a mile of line , and had a big runaway fire on their hands . It looked fairly good for tomorrow  --  lots of men and equipment , well-placed lines . Yes , it looked fairly good , barring accident . Bart  --  well , Bart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get so sentimental about trees ! Sentiment never was good for fighting fires ; the fire itself never showed sentiment . As soon as you began thinking from somewhere inside your stomach and guts instead of from your head , you made mistakes . Why be sentimental about a tree ? It was just a lot of lath , and siding , and two-by-fours , that still happened to have roots on one end and needles on the other . If a lumber-yard burned , you figured the loss in dollars and cents , but you did n't weep tears . Then , as had happened before on a big fire , the Super becamealmost indignant at conifers . They were senseless helplesscreatures , who had let themselves get into such an evolu/tionary box that there was no reason in it . Generally speaking , they refused to grow except in a region with a long dry season , and then by shedding needles and twigs and bits of bark they converted their whole forest into a powder-magazine awaiting the first spark . Besides , they stored up highly inflammable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry was the thick non-conducting bark about the bases of the bigger trees , but this did not suffice . Beneath the electric lights at Headquarters the Maps-andRecordsman again performed his melancholy rite of totaling up the burn . In the last twenty-four hours the fire had swept diagonally across the center of Deerhound , burning most of Sections 2 i and 22 and smaller portions of seven others . The area , as he outlined it tentatively in pencil , was highly irregularin shape , each bend and angle mutely eloquent of some shifting fortune of the battle . A sharp bump stood out at the northeastern corner , where the spot-fire to the north of WilsonCreek had spread fast until caught by a hastily built line along the ridge . A notch toward the southeast showed where the first half mile of line across Reverse Flat had held , thus saving the fine forest that covered the southeast quarter of Section 22 . At the western end of the fire a long tongue reachingforward was a startling evidence of how the snag-patch had aided the run of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aided by the wind blowing directly up the diverging watercourses on the face of Reverse Ridge , had actually in the twenty-four hours doubled its front . With his dividers set to half a mile by the scale on the map , he measured the perimeter of the burn , and ended by counting , " Twenty-six . " That meant that merely to walk around the fire would be a journey of at least thirteen miles . Evenp231though the fire was still uncontrolled , the amount of necessaryand useful work accomplished was already tremendous . More than ten miles of line along the flanks had been constructedand held . Considering that his outline accurately represented the scouts ' reports , he methodically traced with a yellow pencil inside the course of the black line . The whole shape of the three days ' burn stood out suddenly on the map , in red and orange and yellow , like the snout and head and shoulders of some monstrous crocodilian rearing up from the slime . He worked out the area of the last day 's burn as 1,955 acres , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice as much as had burned on the two preceding days , and the acreage of the total burn now was slightly more than three thousand acres.  |p232As  SYMBOL , fire is the opposite of water , as dryness , its negation . Water stands for release and fruition ; dryness , for sterility ; but fire , with its heat and red flame , for all the drive and passion without which nothing would need release or demand fruition . The words are as much of common speech as of poetry  --  fire of life , flame of love , glow of genius , spark of imagination , blaze of indignation , burning wrath and lust and zeal , consumingjealousy , kindled ire , ardent desire , smouldering hate . The prophet and philosopher would lack much , lacking the symbol . The Buddha preached his Fire-sermon . Jeremiah cried : " Ye have kindled a fire in mine anger , which shall burn for ever . " Paul wrote shortly : " It is better to marry than to burn . " Empedocles thought fire one of the four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three to be only its manifestation , and fire itself to be the soul and even intelligence . But also fire is the purifier and the destroyer , that welcomebringer of the last release . Then at the end of the world themountains burn and the seas are consumed . Loki brings theNINTH DAY 233 I ,  |p233flames  to high Valhalla . So also each man goes through the final fire . Then crimson flame and sooty smoke pass by , leavingbehind the quiet ashes , clean and cool and white . Once more , in the darkness before moonrise , she looked out from her mountain-top toward the glare beyond the dark mass of Reverse Ridge . Again the fire had taken a long step toward her . It still showed in that violent pink , but there was a deeper crimson shade along the lower edge and now and then a faint flaring of yellow . Where on the night before the glare had been a little spot and low on the horizon , now it dominated the northeastern horizon , and was twice as wide , and towered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the ridge stood out in intricate silhouette against the vibrating pinkness . There was no sound , though it seemed there should be . She could only imagine the crackle and roar of flames . She was , her thought ran , like a person who sees sheet-lightning flicker in the sky from far across the horizon , or like some horrified villager who , too far off to hear the explosions , standing in calm and quiet , watches the bombing of a city . Then , faintly at first , over the easy murmur of the wind in the pine-tops , she heard the grinding of a truck coming downgrade . It grew louder fast , roaring in crescendo , magnified out of proportion by the stillness of the empty mountain-side . She saw the glare of its headlights , now low among the trees , now suddenly lighting up the pine-tops as the truck bounced on the rough road . It passed by . The sound and the glare faded out , as the truck crossed the little stream that was the head of Bacchus Creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the silence she looked out again toward the fire  --  andp234caught her breath ! Against the pinkness flared a luminous yellow point of living flame . There was no arguing now ! She was in the presence of the enemy . Her imagination flared quickly like the flame itself . She thought of bale-fires and beacons . The Apaches are over the river ! The Northmen have landed ! The topsails of the Armadaare bearing down the Channel ! But after the first moment of alarm , she relaxed . The bright spot she was seeing did not mean that the fire had raced suddenly ahead and swept to the ridge . On the lookout she was high enough to command a partial view down the north slope . Just now , on some isolated point , a tall snag had flared up , and the flame had risen into her line of vision . In a few minutes , indeed , the point of light died down , flickered once or twice , and disappeared . She saw again only the pink glow , vibrant along its lower edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was happy still . There were no bad thoughts from which she fled into fantasy . That was a nice boy who had been up here in the afternoon . TAH-ta-ta-TAH ! Take a girl on the rebound , and then put her alone in a lookout ! TAH-tata-TAH ! He was coming back , said it was the best place to observe winds . TAH-ta-ta-TAH-ta-ta-TAH ! In the unfriendly blackness Bart lay in his blankets . He was so tired that he twitched now and then , but he could not sleep . " Old nerves ! " he thought . " Come on now , relax ! Never used to be this way ! " In his weariness the yielding pineneedlesfelt comfortable as a soft bed . He was used to sleeping on the ground . It was not that ! ( Come on now . This is Tuesdaymorning , and what between Hart Creek and this fire you have n't had a good sleep since last Wednesday . If you don'tp235sleep , you 'll go to pieces ! ) But the harder he thought of sleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . He was like a mouse , and sleep was the cat stalking him . And though he wished to be caught , yet at the last moment always some power deeper than he could control kept him alert to scurry away just as the cat pounced . Once the soft paws caught him for a second , and then he jerked into wakefulness again . After a while the thoughts began to race so swiftly that even his heart beat faster , and he merely lay there thinking . The Super now ! Ought to be running a lumber-yard , not a forest . Figuring on paper ! Beat his face in some time ! Of course , they had lost that line across Reverse Flat , and one guy  --  no , do n't think about that ! But that was because of that crazy catskinner . All cat-skinners are crazy , but you could n't figure a cat-skinner would do that . Lucky he did n't break his goddamnneck . Always figure the worst is going to happen . ( God , it sure had , this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imaginings of the darkness , in the guiltiness of his own failure , his fingers grew tense and hooked and his chest swelled . He gripped a tall lithe man by the throat , and the man struggled and writhed mightily , and then the long legs crumpled and folded and the thin hard-muscledbody went down . His heart pounded and he was wide awake . " What an awful dream ! " he tried to think . But he knew that he had not really been asleep . Then the Super faded from his mind as the fire filled it  --  a red and reaching monster , treacherous and destroying and foul . Wiping away the gracious beauty of the pines and the cedars , leaving death and blackness , burning the deer and quail , burning  --  ( no , do n't remember ! ) . Once he had thought of the fire , there were a thousand parts of it to think of . That narrow canyon where Reversep236Creek came down ! What if there was a slop-over , and some men there , and the fire took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? With a quick movement he half threw back his blankets . He would go to the radio and call Division IV , warn the boss about it ! But he lay back again . No , that was mere panic . But Division I now ! They had n't called for anything all day . That boss up there , that Eldorado man , maybe he just was n't watching things , did n't realize how bad a fire could burn up in there . What if it jumped Onion Creek after all now , after they 'd fought so many spot-fires , and managed to hold it on the north side that day of the blow-up ? Just becausean Eldorado man did n't watch out ! This time he actually sat up before he realized that what was driving him on was only unbridled fantasy . Division I  --  why , the Line Inspector had been all along it this afternoon and reported it was in fine condition , mostly cold ! Calling the Division-boss now would merely make him wonder why you did n't trust him . Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying about Division I. It was the old joker . Division I covered that part where the fire had first taken off , where he had first come to it , and seen it burn hot . When a fire-boss had seen a fire grow up , the place he had first fought it came to be a fixed thing in his mind . If he did n't watch out , he got the feeling that to hold that place was to hold the fire everywhere . And so he might send in more men there , even though that part of the line was all cold and men were needed somewhere else . But Division V now  --  maybe that was being forgotten . Or IV ? No , III was the bad one ! Then he thought of trucks running off the narrow roads and piling up in ravines , and of men caught beneath falling snags , or hit by carelessly swung axes , or stumbling over cliffs in the dark.  |p237And  then suddenly he really was out of his blankets , and on his knees with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to church , he was praying quietly and simply : " 0 God , watch those fellows up there by that canyon , and do n't let them do anything crazy . And God , help us stop that fire along the ridge . ( Tomorrow about noon , will be the time . ) And keep the front tires of the trucks from blowing . And do n't let the little quail get mixed up and fly right back into the fire the way they do sometimes . And help me get through tomorrow . And  --  ah  --  amen ! " As he got to his feet , he looked around into the darkness , a little nervous lest someone might have noticed . He felt better , and yet prayer was not included among approved techniques in the Fire Control Handbook . Picking his way , barefooted , among sleeping men , he went off toward where the lights glowed brightly at Headquarters . Two Ponderosa men were on duty , one of them acting as Night Fire-Boss . " Hello , Jake , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bart . " " What about that narrow canyon up on Reverse Creek ? " " Nothing special . Zone 2 sent a message over a while back . Here it is  --  we logged it at 3:22 . Says everything is O. K. They wanted some more batteries for the headlights , and said they 'd released Ike Selsby of the Mendocino and sent him out , because a message came through his wife was having a baby . " " How about Division I ? " " Why , nothing at all . Were you looking for something ? " " No . Just wondering . " " I can get them on the radio just in a minute if you want me to . " " No , not necessary .  --  Guess I 'll get back to sleep . "  | " You better , Bart . You look all in . " Then he walked back toward his blankets . He had said " get back to sleep " because he did not want to admit he had not slept . By now he could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pines . The wind seemed to have risen ; he heard it moving through the tree-tops high above . He climbed into the warmth of his blankets again . His beard tickled as he lay against the jacket folded on top of his boots which served him for pillow . As he rubbed the tickliness , he felt the beard so long that it was soft instead of scratchy . Well , he thought , I laid my troubles on the Lord , and then I checked with man . Guess I can sleep now . But he really knew that he would not sleep at all now , and would lie quietly waiting for the siren . It would not be so long now . Then he would get up without any break between two days , without the lift and the new life that comes with sleep . Dull and tired , he would face the daylight . Everything would look doubly hard . He could only hope that luck would break with him this day , and that he could get through till evening . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the hours from dusk to daybreak . By now he had becomeaccustomed to the clatter of tools and the voices of men and flashing of small lights which continued to stay at a little distance and did not approach his cover . Just at daybreak , however , the deep roar of a Diesel engine grew closer , along with all the clank and crash of the working bull-dozer . The rabbit was a little alarmed , and was already fed to satiety . He hopped off to his favorite covert in thep239center of the thicket . Ears laid back , eyes glancing about , he rested there alertly . The noise of the bull-dozer rose up to a peak . Then , as it died down again , the rabbit relaxed . .. . The storm-front now lay across the Alaskan panhandle . Behindit , a cold and dry wind poured down from the mountainsupon Juneau ; ahead of it , a slanting rain from the south drenched Ketchikan . Bo Fox and the other pogies had spent the night at the spikecampwhich had been set up on Curran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cerro Gordo came to an end at a little flat . The crew turned out at four-thirty , ate breakfast , were issued canteens , lunches , and tools , and set out to relieve the night-crews . Along with the others Bo jumped the tiny stream , and began to climb the steep trail which went up by many switchbacks . Again looking apprehensively both ways , he saw no other break in the face of the cliff . Looking up and ahead , he noticed that the smoke was thicker and closer . By now , having been together on the line for a day , the men were feeling some comradeship . There was calling back and forth , and shouting of friendly obscenities . As they paused to catch breath on a steep shale-slide halfway up , the man beside Bo took a suck at his canteen , and said something about wishing it was stronger . Thus encouraged , Bo spoke what was on his mind . " Jesus , this must be the only way up to this place ! " The other man looked languidly one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concluded agreeably . " Looks like it , but . there might be lots of others for all I know . "  |p240Like  most casual laborers , he was not interested in geography ; he assumed that someone else showed him how to get there and back . But the steep slope was sheltered from the wind and was quiet . The third man down the line had heard Bo speak , but had not made out all the words . He asked the next man closer : " What 'd they say ? " " They say this is the only way up here . " The man who had asked the question was not without independenceof judgment , but as he looked along the line of the cliffs , the statement seemed reasonable . For lack of anything better to do at the moment , he passed the word on to the next man , unconsciously changing it to a direct statement . " You know , this is the only way to get up here . " Each man had just enough interest to wonder what was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his knowledge to pass the word on . It ran along through five men , and then came to a skeptic . " Is that so ! " he said belligerently . " Who says it is ? " Taken back , the other blustered in his own defense : " Why , everybody says so ! It just come down the line . TheRanger up there musta passed the word back . " But the skeptic was not really interested in cliffs , and the mention of the " ranger " gave him a new approach . " Good Christ ! Is that all that bastard has to worry about . And if it is , what of it ? You wan na go another way t'see the view ? " By his shift of attack , however , the skeptic had tacitly admittedthe truth of the original statement . At the same time the men farther down the line had noticed the argument and wanted to know what it was about . The word thus rapidly spread down clear to the last man . Growing stronger and simpler as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backp241along the line from the boss at the head , that this was the only way up . They were simple and ignorant men , not given to viewing the larger scope of affairs . They did not question or wonder why the " ranger " had seen fit to pass this information along . Nevertheless , among all the men behind Bo Fox ( and he was well toward the head of the line ) the idea was implantedas a fixed point of reference : " This is the only way up through the cliffs . " As Arnold Sorenson , the Dispatcher , was fond of saying , a fire was like a team or an army of allies  --  wind , humidity , terrain , and many others . Among the most important of the allies was always the forest itself , which offered different **27;3116;TOOLONG to the size and type of its trees . The Spitcat Fire had started at an elevation of about 4,500 feet where the forest was of Jeffrey pines with an interminglingof highly inflammable white firs . When the fire , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had raced across the meadow and the brushfield , it came to a forest which was growing at a level five hundred feet lower and was therefore a different forest . Here the commonest trees were the ponderosa pines , and mingled with them were Douglas firs and incense cedars . To a forester walking there the three kinds of tree would have been as differentas Chinese , Negroes , and Indians in war-paint . Without even raising his eyes to the needles he would have distinguishedthe scaled yellow-orange bark of the ponderosas , the corrugated dark gray , almost black , of the Douglas firs , and the fluted red-brown of the cedars . Before fire had entered it , it had been a gracious and beautifulforest of spacious vistas  --  the trees of all ages , from this year 's tiny green spikelets to stalwart veterans of the centuries ,  |p242six  and eight feet in diameter . It was a forest where the impression was of air and light , not of tangled darkness . The larger trees were broadly spaced , and beneath their shade even the smaller trees seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sunlight poured into the glades , and filtered through the thinly spread needles of the tall pines . The yellow-orange bark reflected the sunlight , and seemed to carry it clear to the ground . This was no dim forest of the story-books to be haunted by bears and witches . Its sun-dappled glades were more like the settings for merry men in Lincoln green , and nut-brown maidens , and jovial foresterstrolling : What shall he have that killed the deer ? This was before the fire had run through it . After the fire the forest was black and ugly . Fire had even licked up high around the trunks of the larger trees , leaving them covered with charcoal and soot . Except for a few little islands which the fire had capriciously skipped , every blade of grass , every green leaf on the undergrowth , every needle on the smaller trees had been reduced to ashes ; the trunks and branches were left standing , blackened and dirty . Yet the forest had been open enough so that most of the big trees and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glade and gap had been a chimney lettingthe heat drain off skywards , and even when the flames had managed to reach upward , the tree had usually burned without igniting the next one . Thus , in spite of the steady dry wind , no all-devastating crown-fire had swept through the upper foliage . Higher up toward Reverse Ridge , however , came a change of forest . Here , on the north slope , the summer sun beat lessp243fiercely and the shadows stretched out sooner . In this damper ground and cooler air the pines and cedars could not compete with the Douglas firs . As the yellow-orange and red-brown trunks became fewer , the forest grew darker and gloomier . After the habit of Douglas firs also , the trees grew more closely together . The black boles rose high without branches , and then at last shot out into a dense canopy . In the continual shade almost no young trees sprang up , but the underbrush was a thick and deep tangle of fern and berry . The trees themselves competed ruthlessly , and here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been shaded out by their fellows and killed . A criss-cross of fallen trunks testified to the next chapter of the story . Little light penetrated the overspreading foliage , and the black tree-trunks enhanced the dimness . This was like that grim and gloomy forest of the story-books where the horrorstrickentraveler finds himself benighted even at twilight , and meets only a black-faced and boorish charcoal-burner , if not a wolf or an ogre . The fire , entering the thicker forest about mid-morning , soon began to show the difference . It roared fiercely in the thick mat of dry fern . The criss-crossed fallen tree-trunks smoked , ignited , then burned hotly . The fire ran up the dried bark of the snags . By then , no one could have complainedof any lack of light in the forest . At the same time the thick-spread canopy of foliage preventedthe easy escape of heat . As in a furnace with its outlets clogged , the temperature soared . The needles withered and shriveled as their water was driven off ; they began to smoke . Then suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , the tree-tops burst into fire . With a deep roar , flames andp244dark smoke rose some hundreds of feet , whirling upwards the blazing twigs and needles and strips of bark . Tree-tops rocked and swayed in the blast of hot air . A rot-weakened snag tottered , cracked resoundingly , and went down with an echoing crash . When the piling-up of heat was thus relieved , the fire died down somewhat . Once it was established as a crown-fire , however , it remained so . The dry wind still blew into the funnellikemouths of the three canyons which seamed the north slope of Reverse Ridge . Terrain , dryness , wind , and the thick forest thus combined to make the fire more intense . The ground-fire and the crown-fire advanced together . The one burned close to the ground ; the other , high in the air . Between them was a region where the branchless trunks afforded little fuel , so that the two fires seemed to burn independently . Yet they advanced with equal steps , and were not so isolated as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , its rising heat dried out the canopy and speeded the advance of the crown-fire . If the crown-fire gained the lead , burning debris fell among the ferns and bushes , and hastened the march of the ground-fire . Between the two , no living tree or bush or fern or herb was left . The advance was not rapid . Even struggling through the tangle of ferns and scrambling over the fallen trees , a man could have easily kept ahead of it . But though the advance was not rapid , it was steady . It seemed inevitable and inescapable . The towering line of flame appeared massive and heavy , rolling onward by the power of its own momentum . Ahead lay the upward slope and the thick forest ; from behind the dry wind pressed steadily . Advancing in solid front of fire , points ahead in the canyon-bottoms where the wind funneled more strongly , the Spitcat moved terrifyingly against the line of Division III . NINTH DAY 245p2451 Bo Fox 's crew had been the first , that morning , to leave the spike-camp on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had been headed eastward along the fire-line , and had passed along through the men of the night-crews , tired now , and mostly lolling about , waiting to be relieved and to get back to camp for breakfast . Bo had steadily grown more apprehensive . On his left hand rose a curtain of smoke , pressing ever closer ; on his right , he knew , lay the line of the cliff . In the last half hour he had heard various men speak of the trail as being the only way up through the line of the cliff , and he did not realize that this report , now coming back to him as if official , had really originatedin his own mind . The idea was thus firmly fixed and had become an established fact , and the farther he walked eastward the more he felt himself walking into a trap . If the fire burned across the trail anywhere behind , it would be like a door clicking and he would be caught . Bo was no leader . On all occasions he docilely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew more nervous , he merely kept glancing to right and left , and made no protest . When the crew stopped , however , to let a roaring cat pass them , Bo spoke to the man next to him . " If it burns up across this trail , we ca n't get out of here . " " That 's so , " said the man , agreeably . " This trail is the only way up through the cliff . " He also looked at the fire and then toward the cliff and back along the trail , sizing up the situation . But he was phlegmatic , and no worrier like Bo . The fire did not seem very close . Having looked , he merely let loose a few conventionalobscenities to express an opinion of life in general , and relaxed.  |p246After  they had walked about a mile along the ridge , the crew came to their assigned position . Their boss reported to the Sector-boss , and was assigned the portion of the line for which he was responsible . The night-crew , thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since three cats had been working all night with crews cleaning up behind , the line was already eight feet wide and in excellent condition , and needed only the finishing touches . t " Come on , men , let 's get her marcelled ! " said the crew-boss . Under his direction the men began to work along the sides of the line , cutting back the higher bushes , chopping down the young trees , and scattering any piles of debris which would be likely to catch sparks . The dry wind swept steadily across the ridge . The glittering sun , unpleasantly hot , was still so low that it shone in from the east below the overhangingcolumn of smoke . When they had worked for an hour or two , the men became conscious that the fire was burning hotter . Less than a mile away , down the slope , great flames spiraled skyward . They heard the crackle of fire , and the resounding crash as a dead tree went over . " She 's crowned ! " said one of them who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the fire was frightening to look at . Several of the men glanced back along the trail where they had come in . One of them spoke to the crew-boss , as several others listened : " I hear this trail we come in by is the only way up through the cliff . " The crew-boss was not a Ponderosa man , but he knew something about rock-formations , and this one did not look as if it would be unbroken and unscalable.  | " That so ? " he asked . " Who said so ? " The man talking had really thought that the crew-boss himself had said so , but finding that this was not true , he called back along the line : " Say , who said that about there was no other trail up here ? " " Why , the ranger did ! " someone called back . The crew-boss , who was not a ranger though the men thought of him as one , assumed that some Ponderosa ranger must have said so . " Well , it must be so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man to whom he was talking became a little confused , but also decided that the source of the information must have been some other ranger , not his own boss . The crew-boss himself did not think the matter of enough importance even to investigate , and he did not really believe it . He did not think that any fire-boss would put a dozen crews in a position where they might be burned to death . The fire burned closer and hotter , and the flames seemed to toss higher . The sun disappeared into yellowish smoke . " There was a growing restiveness among the men , and they looked backwards now and again . At one end of their line they mingled with the men of the next crew , infected them with their nervousness , and passed their creed on : " This trail is the only way up through the cliff . The ranger says so . " At the other end of their line the men of the crew mingled with those of another crew who were based on the Onion Creek camp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cliff , and walked westward along the ridge . Hearing the casual talk about only one way up , they did not compare notes ; in their general unfamiliarity with the counttry , they assumed that the one way was that by which they tthemselves had ascended . Moreover , their boss was youngp248and much impressed by his responsibility for the safety of his men . Looking at the crown-fire , he was nervous . Once the rumor had made the jump , it ran along the ridge eastward , and men of those crews also began to look nervously backward , although they looked eastward , not westward , for the one way by which they must escape . Downslope , half a mile away by now , the crown-fire sent up sheets of flame from the tree-tops . By this time the fire-organization was so large and complicated that even the Dispatcher could have given , off-hand , only approximatefigures on men and equipment  --  at the fire , in transit , and being mobilized . The totals were growing continually , and it would have been a useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now there were about sixteen hundred men on the fire , and more coming . At the work of transportation there were more than a hundred trucks , buses and cars , three packtrains , and a cargo-plane . Twelve cats were on the lines , and three tankers were ready to go into action if ever the fire got where they could reach it . A scout-plane was on call . The main fire-camp , for Headquarters and Zone i , was still at Onion Flat . The camp for Zone 2 was at Parker Flat . There was also a spike-camp for Zone i , mostly for Division III , at the road-head on Curran Creek . Clear off at the other end of the fire , where the paratroopers had jumped , there was a spike-camp kept stocked with supplies dropped by parachute from the cargo-plane which kept shuttling back and forth from the base at Redding . A work-crew of convicts had a camp of their own down the road from Onion Flat . In addition there were various isolated dumps for supplies , and for oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always with a large fire , more and more men were tied up with staff- and supply-work , and never handled a shovel or McLeod . There was the Dispatcher himself ; except for flying over the fire that first morning , he had never got closer to it than his office in Suffolk . There were headquarters-men , timekeepers , cooks , camp-crews , tool-sharpeners , radio-repair-men , truck-drivers , mechanics . The sheriff came in for a while , just because seeing his badge might keep any tough characters from playing it funny . A reporter came in , but did not like the steepness of Reverse Ridge , and never got beyond Onion Flat . There was a purchasing agent who never got closer than Sacramento , but was on the job to buy whatever was needed for the fire and see that it was sent in . There was a tall **26;3145;TOOLONG working on a book , and a bright young man from the Regional Office doing research on fireorganizationand viewing everything in scientific and objectivecalm . Sweating it out in his familiar office , the Dispatcher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but probably he knew more about what was happening than anybody else did . The fire was still closer . Bo Fox grew more and more restive . Drifting wisps of smoke came across the line ; the men coughed , and their eyes watered . The heat beat upon them . Ashes and bits of blackened bark were falling . A man rubbed his face , and some soot smeared out behind his finger , leaving a black mark across his cheek , giving him a strange and wild look . Seeing it , Bo trembled a little , and looked back along the line . He tried to see whether the fire was closer to the trail there . He thought that it was.  |p250But  looking at the crew-boss , Bo felt less jittery . The boss seemed calm , a refuge and strength . The crew-boss actually seemed a little calmer than he was , but he was more excited than disturbed . Meeting the thrust of such a big fire as this was likely to be touchy . He had seen some good-sized fires , and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the very worst they could take shelter in some of the rock-outcroppings and let the fire go over and around them . There must be , he thought to himself , some pretty shrewd old cookies who were running this fire , and he was ready to trust them . From his own experience he could guess what was going to happen with the fire . He knew that his men were getting nervous , and he considered telling them , explaining things to them . But the crew were taking his orders and seemed to have confidence in him . If he told them what was going to happen , then it might not happen that way , and the men would merely lose the confidence they already had , and things would be worse . And now still another disturbing report began to work along the lines . " Yesterday . . . yes , morning , they say . . . got caught . . . Jesus ! . . . Is that right ? . . . Fella told me that seen a guy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was an ugly idea , especially when you looked at the fire getting closer , and remembered that there was only that one way up through the cliff . A gray-haired , snag-toothed old fellow spat his tobacco juice and considered the question of death with dismal gusto . " Yes , " he said , " he was burned to a crips  --  yessir , to a cries ! "  | " Hell , there ai n't no such word . You mean he was burned to a corp ! " " You guys ! Christ , you 're both nuts ! " But at least there seemed no doubt as to the fact itself . Someone had met a horrible death . The knowledge made no one less nervous . As the climax neared , Ben Roach set up headquarters on a rock-ledge close behind the line and just about the middle point of Division III . His radio-man had rigged a good aerial , and communication was excellent . To the rear he could talk with headquarters at Onion Flat , and he coulu also reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a close watch for spot-fires puffing up anywhere behind the line . Ahead , he could talk to his three Sector-bosses , who were carrying walkie-talkies . On the flanks he could keep in touch with Divisions II and IV . From the ledge also he could see east and west along a quarter-mile of line , and could watch the fire below him . To his practiced eye , the fire was already changing . The ridge was comparatively flat on top , and once the fire reached leveler ground , it lost that part of its vigor which sprang from the up-slope and the funnel-effect of the canyons . Moreover the top of the ridge was in full sun , and the soil was dry and thin and rocky . Ponderosa pines again replaced the Douglas firs , and even they were somewhat stunted and were scattered more thinly . There was underbrush , and some clumps of manzanita grew in places . With a dry wind pushing it , the ground-fire would race ahead rapidly through these , but the crown-fire would almost certainly puff out , once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This was what he could sense , rather than see , was happeningalready . An unpracticed eye would have thought the firep252as strong as ever , but Ben could see little weaknesses in the front . The whole strategy had been planned for this event . For this reason they had not tried to run a line along the slope . The crown-fire would have walked across an eight-foot line without even knowing it was there , and no one could start a back-fire among the tree-tops . But now it might all be over in a little while . He had seen roaring fires met squarely  --  and half an hour later they were nothing but smoking mop-up jobs . He checked with his Sector-bosses to make sure that they had plenty of fusees handy and understood the tactics . From here on , they would be on their own . He called Cerro Gordo : " Keep looking . The next half hour will be it ! " He called Bart . Bart jumped when he knew it was Ben . He had been waiting for the call . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not so bad , " said Ben . " I wish I was up there with you . " " Not a thing you could do , Bart . You know  --  you 're doin ' a lot more back there where y'can be in touch all round .  --  But say , we 'll be lightin ' back-fires pretty soon . The crown-fire is droppin ' down . Just the last few minutes there 's a lot of gaps . The next half hour will be it ! " " Golly , Ben , I wish I was up there with you ! " And suddenly Bart 's voice broke . " I ca n't stand it down here waitin '  --  1 ca n't stand it ! " There was a pause , as if Ben were perplexed by the vehemence . Then his voice came again , almost wheedling . " Now , looky here , Bart . Ai n't nothin ' you could do upp275Then again she was suddenly happy . Maybe something inside her was what had melted . ( Dave , oh , yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening along with so many people had made something break or unloosen inside  --  well , melt might be the right word . She heard a truck grinding up the road below her . She listened  --  yes , there were two of them . The glare of the lights tossed and shifted among the trees . There were many more trucks on that road this evening . The fight was moving in closer to her , and she was more a part of it than ever . Again she knew that she had lost the old tenseness and fear , and t was moving out from herself once more , one among many comrades . " Melted like wax , " she thought . " Yes , melted like wax . " Except that the trees on the flat at the Idylhurst Guard Stationwere mostly oaks , the new fire-camp looked a lot like the old one . There was again the mutter of the generator at work , and the electric-light wires that had been hastily pulled down at Onion Flat had been as hastily run up again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was trying to total up the day . As always after a bad break , reports were fragmentary and conflicting , and he could not tell very accurately just where the fire was burning . The shape on his map , as he outlined it in green , grew into an epitome of the day 's events  --  the solid mass where the crown-fire had crashed up-slope , the two separate arms running down the other side . The southeastern arm , which had burned to the camp-site , had narrowed as it stretched out ; the pumps had kept it from crossing Bacchus Creek along a front of a good quarter mile . But the southwestern arm
