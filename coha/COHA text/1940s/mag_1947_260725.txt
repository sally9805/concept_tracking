In their 15 years as junkmen in New York , brothers Morris and Julius Lipsett had handled such big jobs as scrapping Manhattan 's Second Avenue El , the old approaches to the Brooklyn Bridge , and the liner Normandie ( TIME , Oct. 14 , 1946 ) . So they expected no trouble when they bought the decommissioned battleship New Mexico for $381,000 ( original cost in 1917 : $17,348,200 ) . But last week as the New Mex , shorn of her power plant and with holes bored in her big guns , was towed from Boston toward Newark , trouble hit her like a spread of torpedoes amidships . <P> The Lipsett brothers had a deal with the Navy to moor the New Mex at its Newark dock while they cut her up . But as the battleship approached , the city of Newark declared a blockade . <P> Duffy v. Dreadnought . Newark , which recently agreed to lease its port facilities to the Port of New York Authority ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) for an $11,000,000 development program , thought the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So Newark 's Mayor Vincent Joseph Murphy , egged on by the local press , ordered out the city 's two fire boats , Michael P. Duffy and William J. Brennan , to block the port 's narrow entrance . <P> The tiny ( 30-ft. ) boats duly began patrolling the channel , squirting their 20 nozzles as ominously as they could for news photographers . But the New Mexico did not arrive . In rough weather off the Long Island coast the tugs cast off her tows , and for a few hours the New Mex strayed alone on the Atlantic . Finally the Coast Guard found the battleship wallowing helplessly in heavy seas and the tugs got lines aboard once more . <P> As Lipsett , Inc. arranged for nine other tugs and a Coast Guard cutter for the trip to the graveyard , Newark , spurred by all the publicity it was getting , appealed to retired Admiral Halsey , a New Jersey native , for advice . " Bull " Halsey , a carrier man , who did not have much use for battleships anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about patrolling channels . " The London News Chronicle joined the fun . It cabled to find out if a revolution was impending . Replied Newark : " Let there be no dancing in the streets of London . This is no civil war but a battle with a private corporation which wants to make a junkyard of our seaport . " <P> <P> Negotiated Peace . The Navy , which is trying to speed up the scrapping of decommissioned ships , thought none of this funny . Neither did the Lipsetts , who stood to lose $4,000 for every day of delay , nor the scrap-starved steelmakers . <P> At week 's end , the Lipsetts agreed to a truce . While the New Mexico was kept clear of Newark 's port , all parties met to discuss a negotiated peace . Unless some other berth can be found for the junking job , the New Mex will probably get into Newark , but with a shorter time-six to eight months-allowed to scrap her . And the Lipsetts will have to find another place to scrap the two other battleships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Navy .
