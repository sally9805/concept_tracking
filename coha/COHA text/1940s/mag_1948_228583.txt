Sergei Prokofiev 's little comic opera , The Duenna , * almost got lost in the shuffle . Finished in 1940 , it had reached the dress rehearsal stage in Moscow when the war put a stop to it . After the war , it was put on in Leningrad and Prague , but the score was still in manuscript . <P> Last week , Manhattan opera fans were given a pretty good idea of what The Duenna is all about . Greenwich Village 's aggressive little Lemonade Opera ( TIME , Sept. 8 ) had acquired two vocal scores from which it squeezed out an arrangement for two pianos and a full complement of 19 singers . <P> Prokofiev based his opera on Richard Brinsley Sheridan 's 18th Century comedy : a grandee 's daughter , facing parental opposition to her marriage , slyly marries off her duenna to the parental choice ( a rich fish merchant ) . <P> For the music , Prokofiev had put away the powerful pen that wrote the Fifth Symphony , used instead the light-nibbed one that wrote the delightful Classical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , duets and quartets for laughs - and got them from a cheering , sell-out audience . <P> The Duenna might never be performed again in Russia : its plot is hardly in the acceptable groove , especially after the brisk spanking Russia 's composers got last winter for " bourgeois , Western-oriented ' ' ideas and music . <P> <P> * Also known as Betrothal in a Monestery.
