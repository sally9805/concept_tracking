Republican mayors are a Philadelphia tradition , like scrapple and pepper pot . The tradition , unbroken since 1884 , has been hard on Philadelphia . Corruption and civic stagnation have become chronic ; as often as not , the city 's mayors have been bumbling party hacks . But Philadelphia voters have been too apathetic to throw the rascals out . <P> Last week , with a municipal election coming up on Nov. 4 , the voters were getting an unprecedented shaking-up . A political novice named Richardson Dilworth , candidate for mayor on the Democratic ticket , was giving the slothful Republican machine the roughest pre-election working-over it had had in many a year . <P> The Fighter . Until he started campaigning in mid-September , few Philadelphians had heard of Dick Dilworth . At 49 , he is a handsome , socialite lawyer with a family of eight children ( four by his first wife , two by his second , two stepchildren ) . He fought with the Marines in both World Wars . Between wars , he finished his undergraduate work at Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a law degree , and , in 1926 , settled down to practice in Philadelphia . He subsequently specialized in libel law . Among his clients : the Curtis Publishing Co. , the Inquirer , N. W. Ayer &; Son , Inc . <P> Dilworth , who heretofore had done no more than dabble in politics as a Democratic speechmaker in presidential campaigns , got the mayoralty nomination largely because none of the Democratic regulars were anxious for the job . The party 's fortunes were at a low ebb . In 1946 , the Philadelphia organization had lost all six of the city 's congressional seats . It had little hope , less money and no newspaper support . Even labor was cool . <P> To the Barricades . But Dick Dilworth came out slugging . He hired investigators to rake into the Republican muck , rounded up a bevy of girls to wear " Dilworth for Mayor " streamers across their bosoms , and rented two sound trucks . He scheduled four or five street-corner meetings a night , hoping to cover each of the city 's 52 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aimed directly at his opponent , Mayor Bernard Samuel . Dilworth charged that 67-year-old Barney Samuel , a city payroller since 1903 , tolerated bookmaking even at City Hall . He charged that City Hall workers and some merchants are annually dunned to buy the mayor a birthday present-e.g. , a station wagon and a motorboat . Under Samuel , said Dilworth , a police inspector could easily pick up $30,000 a year in graft-and some inspectors were doing it . As for solving the city 's acute sewage , parking , paving , housing and airport problems , the mayor has not even come close .
