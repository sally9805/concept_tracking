The football professors had been dead wrong , and humanly slow to admit it . Four years ago , coaches labeled the T formation a precarious stratagem suitable only for such star performers as Quarterback Sid Luckman of the Chicago Bears and Fullback Norm Standlee of Stanford . Without such power and polish , said the coaches , the T formation would n't work . <P> Last week , contrary evidence was apparent on almost every college gridiron : pink-cheeked freshmen scurried and whirled out of the T formation to touchdown after touchdown . More than 50% of college coaches now start their football alphabet with a capital T. The other half burn midnight oil devising ways &; means to stop it . Few have succeeded . <P> Theme with Variations . Converts to the T have concocted all kinds of pet variations and exclusive trademarks . Columbia 's Lou Little has a " split T , " Michigan 's Fritz Crisler an " unbalanced T , " Nebraska , Minnesota and Iowa a " part-time T. " The Boston ( professional ) Yanks call theirs the Q.T. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who took on a T with man-in-motion last year , this year dropped the man-in-motion , spread his linemen ( see diagram ) for a basic off-tackle slice , scrambled this formation with the old Notre Dame box style of offense ( a man on each corner ) . In the quiet of the locker room , he calls this conglomeration the " bastard T. " <P> But in all variations , the ball-handling quarterback forms the stem of the T , the other three backs the top crossbar . By any name , its razzle-dazzle pattern of spinners , flankers , man-in-motion , dive-tackle plays pack a wallop that makes scores and delights the fans . <P> At the head of the non-T list are Navy and Georgia Tech , whose conventional single-wing formations clashed last week in a weird , fumbling game at Atlanta . Tech 's gained yardage was minus 6 against the Middies ' plus 221 , but the final score was Tech 17 , Navy 15 . Bo McMillan 's Indiana team is the lone Big Ten eleven shunning the T.
