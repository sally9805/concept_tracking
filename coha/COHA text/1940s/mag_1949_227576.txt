When she was a week old , Sandy Kaplan had a wheeze , and sometimes her breathing made a sort of crowing noise . Doctors at Manhattan 's Woman 's Hospital knew there was something wrong with her , but did not know what . Her first day at home , Sandy turned white , then blue around the mouth , and almost suffocated . Her mother , a practicing attorney , learned to give Sandy only a couple of ounces of food at a time . That meant 20 feedings a day . <P> Muriel Kaplan dared not let the baby out of her sight . She all but gave up her law practice . She and her husband Bernard ( once a pro football player , now in a television business ) were rooted to their home in New Rochelle , N.Y . Three times one of them sat up all night holding Sandy upright-she seemed to breathe easier that way . Twice she had to be rushed to hospitals and given oxygen . The family physician , Dr. Edwin Raymond , often gave Sandy artificial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strong . But after every swallow of food , says her mother , there was an agonizing wait to see whether she would start to choke . <P> Dr. Raymond had recommended a thorough bronchoscopy as soon as Sandy was six months old . The examination , at Philadelphia 's Chevalier Jackson Clinic , showed a rare malformation : the aorta ( great artery ) leading up from the heart normally passes in front of the esophagus ( gullet ) and trachea ( windpipe ) . Sandy 's aorta was divided and formed a ring around the two tubes . When food distended the gullet , the windpipe was squeezed . <P> The Kaplans were told that three successful aortic ring operations had been done at Massachusetts General Hospital . They drove to Boston , with an oxygen cylinder on the seat beside Sandy in case of emergency ( it was not needed ) . <P> Last week , Dr. Richard Sweet opened 61-month-old Sandy 's chest , tied off the front half of the aortic ring and cut it out .
