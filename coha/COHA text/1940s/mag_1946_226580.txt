Anna and the King of Siam ( 20th Century-Fox ) flies in the face of established Hollywood precedent by ignoring Young Love , and proves that a movie can be lively entertainment even if boy does n't get-or even meet-girl . <P> Set in the 1860s , the film is a fairly literal transcription of Margaret Landon 's 1944 best-selling biography . Anna ( Irene Dunne ) is a purposeful widow , handsome in her crinolines , who arrives in Siam clutching her young son by the hand . Having firmly decided against marrying again , she is taking a job as schoolmarm in the gaudy , uncivilized court of King Mongkut ( Rex Harrison ) . The King 's domestic arrangements are already pretty well set , what with his hundreds of wives and concubines and an estimated 67 children . There is never a hint of romance between Anna and her difficult new boss . But their relationship is complex , mature , always threatening to explode . <P> The willful , half-barbaric King yearns to improve himself and his backward country-but without once relaxing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much help from someone who is not only a foreigner but also a lowly woman . To hold and secure her job , Anna has to perform daily miracles of common sense , dignity , humor , forbearance and strength of character . As played by Irene Dunne and Britain 's Rex Harrison ( in his first Hollywood movie ) , the clash of these two kinetic personalities should be more fun for an adult audience than the standard maneuverings toward the classical clinch . <P> <P> After skimping on Love in the plot , Anna 's manufacturers tried to even the score by throwing in an extra helping of Glamor on sets and costumes . One of the first postwar productions to splurge on lavish , prewar-style props , the picture was shot over five acres of lot covered with $300,000 worth ( pressagents ' valuation ) of Oriental rococo background . Notable eye-filling items : the King 's four gold- &-diamond; crowns ( $84,000 ) and 23 silk- &-brocade; costumes ( $23,000 ) ; a coronation scene costing $80,000 ; a well-filled harem stocked with the loveliest of 200 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sarong . <P> <P> Specter of the Rose ( Republic ) is what happened when Republic handed Writer-Director-Producer Ben Hecht the price of a horse opera ( $200,000 ) and left him strictly alone to create-if he could-a work of art . The picture rates solid A for effort , something between A and low D for quality . Parts of it will delight a limited audience . <P> The story is a Hecht original : a great dancer ( Ivan Kirov ) , subject to fits of homicidal insanity , marries a budding ballerina ( Viola Essen ) , who hopes that his dancing and her love will work a cure . Great Teacher Judith Anderson and threadbare Impresario Michael Chekhov , torn between terror and balletomania , hover unhappily in the wings . Another sideliner , Poet Lionel Stander , grates out Mr. Hecht 's own highly debatable views on Love &; Art , and dashes an occasional gruelly tear from his granitic eye . To climax a triumphant tour , the dancer 's mind finally cracks and he turns his own ( and mad Dancer Vaslav Nijinsky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , into a dance of death .
