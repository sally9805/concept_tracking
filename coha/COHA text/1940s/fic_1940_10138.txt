HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYwondered whether the trouble in our family could have happened if my father had gone walking with the other boys as he did with me . If I had only known my father in the house , perhaps I could have spoken to him as the others had done , but knowing him as he was up on the mountains , I was never able to speak to him other than with respect and with love . He never once as far as I remember talked to me as though I were a child . I was always a man when I was with him , so no wonder Bron called me The Old Man . Everything I ever learnt as a small boy came from my father , and I never found anything he ever told me to be wrong or worthless . But perhaps the things that he held to be good and right to do , were not the good and right things for our time , or if they were , then perhaps he carried them out with too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put men against him . That afternoon we walked for miles along the river , first , and then up the mountain . Our village , then , was one of the loveliest you could see . I will say it was lovely , because it was so green and fresh and clean , with wind from off the fields and dews from the mountain . The river was not very wide , only about twenty feet , but so clear you would see every inch of rock through the bubbling water , and so full of fish that nobody thought of using a rod . My father taught me to tickle trout up on the flat rock down by Mrs. Tom Jenkins ' . Hour after hour we have sat there , dropping stones to frighten little ones away , and then watching a big one come up and making plans to have him . First you would have to roll back your sleeve sometimes up to your muscle , and put your arm right in the water , holding your hand open and steady . Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost make you shout to have it in , but no matter , if you wanted a fish you would have to suffer . Then the old fish would come along very soft and quiet , and you would almost feel inside you that he was thinking to himself , watchingyour hand , and knowing that something was the matter and not sure what . Of course , you would not move a fraction , even yourHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 41eyes , while all this was going on , because a good and sensible trout will swim back out of reach and stay there to laugh at you . Indeed , - that is true , for I have seen them do it . Well , then , if he was so silly , he would come up to see your fingers and nose round them , and rub himself against them . Then it would he your turn . Quietly , you would bend your fingers to smooth him under his stomach and tickle his ribs . Sometimes he would flash away and you would lose him , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your fingers along him until your little finger was inside his gill . That was enough . Give him a jerk and pull out your arm , and there he would be , ( lapping on the rock . And there is good fresh trout is for supper . My mother used to put them on a hot stone over the fire , wrapped in breadcrumbs , butter , parsley and lemon rind , all bound about with the fresh green leaves of leeks . If there is better food in heaven , I am , In a hurry to be there , if I will not be thought wicked for saying so . But there I am again , see . The quiet troubling of the river , and the clean , washed stones , and the green all about , and the trees trying to drown their shadows , and the mountain going up and up behind , there is beautiful it was . When birds were nesting we often went out to find the nests and look in at tV.e eggs , though we never took any , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and he would stop the other boys , too . I think because of that , our Valley was never quiet of birds . There is strange you will never notice birds till they are gone . We caught two trout that afternoon and I put them in leaves in my cap to carry them on up the mountain . There used to be a scent at the wind pushed in front of it in those days , which must have me from all the wild flowers and the sweet grasses that grew up ere then . This scent was strong that afternoon , and my fatherOften stopped to breathe in , for he had told me time and time again that trouble will not stop in a man whose lungs are filled with fresh air . He always said that God sent the water to wash our bodies and air to wash our minds . So you r'ould often see us two stop and breathe42 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYin and out , and go on walking up the mountain , perhaps pointing at a small bush we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see if anybody had been at the primrose bed up by Davies the Woodyard 's field . We had gone a little way when I started to feel cold inside me , for we were walking across the mountain toward the field where I had seen Davy talking to the men . It was a Saturday and the men would be off , so I thought they were bound to be up here . " Dada , " I said , " could we walk into the other valley ? " " No , indeed , my son , " my father said , " I am only going to the top . I have got some writing for the Chapel to do . Gracious , what wouldwe do over there ? " " See Ivor and Bron , " I said , " it will be a nice surprise , Dada . " " Yes , " my father said . " If I find myself over by there this afternoonI will have the surprise indeed . To the top , and then home , us . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that field , even to rolling down the mountain . I would have done that , but the hedges would have stopped me . Sure enough , as we climbed the hedge by Meredith the Shop 's field , there we could see the heads of a big crowd of men two fields away higher up . We were getting higher here , and the wind was blowing away from us , so that we could hear nothing of their voices . My father stopped at once . " Is this where you came ? " he asked me . " Yes , Dada , " I said . " Oh , " he said , looking down at me . " So this is why you wanted to go to the other valley , eh ? I will give you credit , my son . " The look-outs must have seen my father because one of them came running over , jumping the hedge as though it was only a foot high . " Mr. Morgan , " he shouted , " Davy wants you to come over if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want with me ? " my father asked back. " 7'he men are over from all the other valleys , " Mog said , walking up , " and a lot of places . There are big things going on , sir . " " Big things , indeed , " my father said , " and empty as drums . Not even fit to put a cap on . Where is Davy ? " HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 43 " Over by there , Mr. Morgan , " Mog pointed . " He is going to address the meeting in a minute . " " There is lucky the meeting is , " my father said . " Very well , Mog , I will go . Take care of Huw for me , will you ? " I knew it was no good to say anything , so I stood by Mog as my father went through the other gate into the pasture land where the men were crowded . But when he had gone , I told Mog I wanted to go to the back , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stones behind some blackberry bushes , and be sure to come back to him in case my father would have his ears for supper . Good . So off I went , but as soon as I was behind those blackberriesand out of sight , I ran off again through the sheep-gap and into the crowd of men , working my way through carefully up toward the front . As soon as I could see my father through a little space in the men , I stopped where I was . There was a lot of talking in whispers going on round about me , as though they had all decided on something serious . Up in front , on a sloping slab of rock , Davy , Dai Griffiths , and a lot of men I had never seen before , were all talking to my father . He was listening to them with his hands folded in front and his eyes shut , so I knew they were talking for the wind to make fun with , and it did make me laugh indeed . One by one they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . At last Dai came forward to the edge of the rock and held up his hands . Everyone became still . Only the wind moved the ferns above us , saying shish to everythingexcept itself . " Boys , " Dai shouted , " before you make up your minds properly to do what we think is right and best , it is certain you should have a word from Gwilym Morgan . Fair play , now . " The men moved about and a deep murmur started , which became a big cheer as my father stepped out and stood on the edge , looking all round , and down at the village , and up at the sky . I knew he was praying , and the others must have known , for there was a low rustle and then every cap was off , and every head was bent. 44 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " Boys , " my father said , " if you were clear in your conscience about what you want to do , you would not be up here out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be listening . Wait . I am here by some happening which I will call the Will of God . I did not want to come , but now I am here I will give you what has been in my mind these months . You are right in what you want , but you are wrong in your ways of getting it . Force is no good to you until you have tried reason . And reason wants patience . And if patience wants a tight belt , then tight belt it should have . You can not ask the help of God with hate in your hearts , and without that help you will get nothing . It is no use to say you will all go together in a Union if you have no notion what that Union is to do . Get better wages ? You will have better wages or as good as can be got without a Union . The owners are not all savages , but they will not give you whatever you want just because there are a lot of you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best weapons . And if your cause is just , and your consciences are clear , God is always with you . And no man will go far without Him . " But the men were becoming restless , and I could hear shouts from all round , though I was so low in the crowd I could hear nothing of the words . I saw my father try to go on , but then a man standing behind me took me by the shoulders and pulled me round . " You are Huw Morgan , " he said , bending down to me , " the youngest of them . Can you hear your old man ? " " My father is not an old man , " I said , " and if he heard you , you would have it . " " 0 , " said another man , laughing , " the old man is in him for sure . Morgan , him , indeed . " Before I could run , the man who had me had picked me up and was holding me above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " here is one who will go without when you tighten your belt . And there are five of mine . " A roar cut my father 's voice in half . All round me I could see men shoutipg before I was put down and forgotten . As quick as I could , I wound in and out of the crowd until I reached the sheep-gap and looked back . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 45My father was talking to Dai Griffiths up on the rock , and Davy was trying to get the crowd to settle down again . I saw my father shake his head and start to walk down the rock , so I ran back to Mog . " Deuce , " he said , " I did think you had taken lodgings , boy . Here is your father , now . " One look at my father was enough for me , and Mog was going to say something , but he stopped and began whistling under his breath instead . My father was so white there were blue patches under his eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his eyes scalded you to look at them . And yet he was smiling . " Come on , my son , " he said . " Thank you , Mog . " " You are welcome , sir , " said Mog , and pulled off his cap . Nothing was said until we got to the top of the mountain , though all the way up the men were plain to be heard , and if we had looked back we could have seen them every step of the way . Over hedges and through gates , across fields and pasture , climbing rock outcrop , rushing through gorse and bramble , every second I tried to keep my es on my father , watching for some change in him , but even after all that climbing , he had not altered . He sat up on the rock at the top of the mountain facing into the other valley , and leaned back on his elbow . " Come and sit over here , my son , " he called , for I had gone off a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your father , are you ? " " No , Dada , " I said , " but I thought you would want to think . " " I have finished thinking , Huw , " my father said . " My sort of thinking has no place now . Awful , indeed it is . " We sat in quiet for a time , looking down into the valley . The wind blew up here as though he had wet his lips to bring them smaller to whistle with more pointed music , but his tune was cold , and before , long I was shaking . My father stared down at the Valley , but I did not put my eyes on him for long because I was afraid of waking him . I remember how cold was the green down there , and how like a patchwork counterpane with all the browns of the ploughing and the iquares of the curving hedges . The farms were small as white match-46 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYboxes and sheep were like little kittens . Indeed , if they kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our Valley was there a colliery to poke its skinny black fingers out of the bright green . Over in here was all peace and quiet content , and even the wind sounded happier to be working down there , coming up from our Valley with a joyful rush and pouring down here , passing us sharp and bitter cold , eager to lie along the warm fields below and tease the manes of the horses browsing in the sun . " Sad it is , Huw , my son , " my father said , after a long while . " Sad , indeed . Here is everything beautiful by here , nothing out of place , all in order . And over with us nothing but ugliness and hate and foolishness . " " How is that , then , Dada ? " I asked him . " Bad thoughts and greediness , Huw , " my father said . " Want all , take all , and give nothing . The world was made on a different notion . You will have everything from the ground if you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not . Those poor men down there are all after something they will never get . They will never get it because their way of asking is wrong . All things come from God , my son . All things are given by God , and to God you must look for what you will have . God gave us time to get His work done , and patience to support us while it is being done . There is your rod and staff . No matter what others may say to you , my son , look to God in your troubles . And I am afraid what is starting down by there , now this moment , is going to give you plenty of troubles in times to come . " My father spoke with his eyes in the sky , and I was glad he was looking so much better . He had a terrible temper indeed , but none of us ever saw it except me , and that only once and outside the house . " Let us go home , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has had enough for one day without more to weigh her down . " Back down the pasture we went , but not toward where the men were still standing . Perhaps it was through looking at the other valleyso long that I got such a worrying shock when I looked again atours . All along the river , banks were showing scum from the collieryHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 47sump , and the buildings , all black and flat , were ugly to make a hurt In your chest . The two lines of cottages creeping up the mountain- side like a couple of mournful stone snakes looked as though they night rise up and spit rocks grey as themselves . You would never think that warm fires and good food would come from them , so dead and unhappy they were looking . Our valley was going black , and the slag heap had grown so much it was half-way along to our house . Young I was and small I was , but young or small I knew it was wrong , and I said so to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and stopped to look . " I told them years ago to start underground , but nobody would listen . Now , there are more important things to think about . That is something that will have to be done when you are grown up . There will be plenty for you to do , indeed . " When we passed through the village nearly all the women were utside waiting to hear what the men were doing up on the mountain . y father took his cap off to wish the time of day down by the Chapel to old Mrs. Rhys the Mill , and he held it in his hand all the way up to the house , because all that way he was wished by everybody . My mother was sitting alone when we came in , and she seemed to ave got over her distress , but the house was quiet , with that sort of stillness that a cat will have when it is waiting to jump with its back in a curl . My father looked at my mother and said nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be silent before he went to change his boots . I went to the cupboard to get my slate , and while I was rubbing it clean my father came in . Then my mother moved , and my father faced her . " Gwilym , " she said , " Angharad has gone . " " 0 , " my father said . " Where is she ? " " Down with the Beynons , I think , " my mother said . " Wait you , " said my father . " I will have a word with her . " When he had gone , my mother asked me to fill the kettle and give the fire a couple of shovels of coal , and when I had done , she called me . " Huw , " she said , " how are you going to grow up , I wonder ? " 48 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " Well , " I said , " however it is , I will never leave this house for one , unless you send me from here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth , Huw , " my mother said , looking right through me . " If any more of my family go from me , I will be sorry I ever had babies . " " Well , " I said , " why did you have them , Mama ? " " Gracious goodness me , boy , " my mother laughed . " Go from here , now . Why , indeed . To keep my hands in water and my face to the fire , perhaps . " But that question started me asking questions about babies , and nobody seemed to know , and if they did , they kept it to themselves . There is strange that a man will act as though money was being lost to tell the truth in such a matter . But that came after . You should have seen my mother when my father came back with Angharad . There is pleased she was , and so gentle to put her in the corner chair and take her coat from her . Angharad was quiet and still full of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was certain she had not been forced to come back . My father went straight out to the back to wash , and came in to shut the door of the next room to do his writing . During that time nothing was said , but I had toasted four rounds of bread which my mother put on the end of the fork as piece after piece was browned . There is good dripping toast is by the fire in the evening . Good jelly dripping and crusty , home-baked bread , with the mealy savour of ripe wheat roundly in your mouth and under your teeth , roasted sweet and crisp and deep brown , and covered with little pockets where the dripping will hide and melt and shine in the light , deep down inside , ready to run when your teeth bite in . Butter is good , too , mind . But I will have my butter with plain bread and butter , cut in the long slice , and I will say of its kind , there is nothing you will have better , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread tidy . " Angharad , " my mother said , " what did Dada say ? " " He said he was sorry if he had done anything wrong , Mama , " Angharad said , " and to tell him why I wanted to leave him . " " Well ? " my mother asked , and very surprised she was . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 49 " I said I wanted to look after the boys because Mrs. Beynon is too fond of her bottle , " said Angharad . " Angharad , " my mother said , holding up her hands . " What next then ? " " It is true , Mama , " Angharad said , and tears coming to sparkle in the fire-light . " Did you see our Davy with a big hole in his stockinghere to-day ? " " Yes , my girl , " my mother said , " I did . And Gwilym is bringing them all up here to-night for me to mend . " " I brought them with me , " said Angharad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you will want rags for the boots , Mama , go you and see the sheets on Davy 's bed . " My mother was still and so quiet , with her plate on her knee and her eyes big and staring into the fire . " Oh , God , " she said , " I will have my boys from there to-night if I will leave this house myself . " She put her plate down on the fender and got up to go to the door of the next room . " Give Huw his tea , Angharad , " she said , in a high voice . Then she opened the door and went in . It was quiet in the kitchen , so that we could hear my father talking low to my mother , and her saying back to him , but the door was so thick we could hear nothing of the words . " Did you go up the mountain , now just ? " Angharad asked me . " Yes , " I said , " and Dada tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Were the boys up there ? " she asked . " All of them , " I said , " but nobody was for Dada . " " Right too , " said Angharad . " Are you against Dada , too ? " I asked her . " Yes , indeed I am , " Angharad said , " though not him , but what he is trying to make them do . " " What is that , then ? " I asked her . " Well , if it will have you any wiser , " said Angharad , with impatience , " he is trying to make them pray for what they want instead of going together and making the old owners give them it . " 50 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " Why is Dada wrong , then ? " I asked her , after I had thought about it . " Be quiet , boy , and eat your toast , " Angharad said . " You are making enough noise with your old teeth to have the house down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Because you will have nothing through prayer , boy , " Angharad said . " I have had nothing yet , and nobody else has , either . Look at Mrs. Mostyn the Grove . Everybody did pray for her and yet she went with her baby as well . " My mother came out just then , and started to pour tea for my father . " Angharad , " she said , and taking the cup in the next room , " g down to Mrs. Beynon 's and get the boys ' things , will you ? Tell h I will pay my owings on Monday morning myself . " " Yes , Mama , " said Angharad , and ran out through the bac clapping her hands and singing . When my mother came out she pointed to the wall bed . " You will sleep down here in the future , Huw , " she said , " and th boys shall have the back room to themselves . You are too small to be up there now they are all men , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night I have never slept anywhere e except for the time when I lived in Bron 's . When the boys came home that night I was in bed with the cu tains drawn , so I could hear all that was said , though I was so sleep I kept falling off and waking up with a jump . They all came in together as though they had feared to come i one by one . There is funny it is to lie in the dark listening to peopl you know , talking and moving , making the little sounds you know , doing the little actions you know , all of it happening in the dark and yet so clear in your mind that you could laugh , and you ask yoursel what is the need of people themselves when only their voices an little sounds are enough . I could hear Davy throwing back his hair before he spoke , because his hair made a soft whish and his chair creaked . Gwilym I knew because his throat made a bumpy sound when he swallowed . OwcHOW GREEN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear . I suppose there is no Mound for that , yet I heard it and knew what he was doing . But though I knew my father was there , I heard nothing from him , although I knew his sounds well . Yet I knew he was there , and even though Davy and Owen had made no sounds at all , I would have known they were there . There is a sort of hot stillness which you can feel , and yet it is not hot , nor is it still , but it will have you on edge . iiicl make you hot if you think about it . This feeling I always had for my father , and it was in my brothers , too . This feeling it was that made the wall bed like an oven to me , and started me sweating till the drops were running down my cheeks into -y ears . They had broth for supper , but I suppose I slept through that , ough I was sure I could hear all they said in a sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never felt unless I thought of them. 11y father it was who woke me up properly , even though he spoke r ry quietly , as though Mama had made a sign to the bed that I was in there and sleeping . Several ways he had of clearing his throat , and well I knew them . He had one way for singing , one way for Inn'aking in Chapel , one way for reading the Bible , and another for ading anything else , except a story book , and that was different gain . But he had a special way of doing it when he had something to say that was serious . That was how he woke me up . " Davy , " he said , " you are the eldest here , and to you I will talk . " " Yes , Dada , " said Davy , and I knew his eyes would be watching my father in the shadow of his hair . " I asked you to leave this house , " my father said , " because I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bad influence on the other boys . But I found that the others were as bad as you , and even a baby like Huw was going out of the house at night . That is not the way a house should live , and I said so . I have that authority because I am your father . " " I will never question that , Dada , " said Davv . " Good , " said my father . " It was hurting me to have to do it . I am proud of my family , and I am proud to think that you are pre- pared to make sacrifice for what you think is right . It is good to suffer in order that men shall be better off , but take care that what you are doing is right and not half-right . My sense is against what you are doing .

I will have you make a sacrifice and I will have you suffer . It will do you good . But no man ever made himself more useful to himself or his fellow men by living in filth and dirt , and I am surprised that a son of mine would allow it . " " They were lodgings , Dada , " said Davy , moving in his chair , " an we could get nowhere else . By the time we had finished work an collected the men , there was little time . " " Where there is little time , " my father said , " there is little us Leave it , now . I will have Mrs. Beynon spoken to .

" " Because I am staying here , " said my father . " But I am not a father because I have no authority . No man shall say he is father of a house unless his word is to be obeyed . Mine is not , so I am not a father , but somebody paying for his keep . I am a lodger , and so are you and the boys , and your mother will look after you and me . That is all .

" Tomorrowis Sunday and early Chapel . Good night all . " " Good night , Dada , " said Davy , and the other boys said with him , but quiet , as though they were so surprised they had lost their tongues . " So now then , Davy , " said my mother , after my father had gone up . " Yes , Mama , " said Davy , " I know . " " Good , " said my mother , " and when you go up , throw that old in down . You , Owen and Gwilym , too . " " Yes , Mama , " said the boys . " And no words round the table , " said my mother . " If I am the boarding-house keeper I will have things my way .

Chapter SixAFTER that there was peace in the house for a time , though I was too small to have the whole picture . I only know what I saw and heard , and I have often wished I had seen and heard more than I did . But there is nothing worse than a small boy with a sharp nose and a loose tongue , and thank goodness I was never that . The family sat down to meals just the same , but there was a differentfeeling in the room always . Even when Bronwen came in it w not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say what was i our minds , I suppose for fear it might start trouble . So instead of th laughing and joking there had been , you would have thought the was a preacher at the table with us . Davy was still going up on the mountain and the boys were goin with him , and coming back with him , openly now , not through th window but in and out of the front door . At that time Davy w meeting men of other valleys and coming to an agreement abou forming a union of them all , so that if one lot came out on a coma plaint , they would all come out and put the coalfield at a standstill . Just as it happens now , so they were planning then . And after weeks of work , Davy got what he wanted . After that it spread like fire over all the valleys . All the younger men were in , but the older men like my father would have nothing to do with it . Davy argued with my father for hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end . He knew he would have won most of the older men if my father had given way , and that is why he tried so hard . " No , Davy , " my father said one night . " Never will I put pen to it . I am a man and I will deal with my own problems my way . I want no help from anybody . " 34HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 55 " But , Dada , " Davy said , " you were spokesman at the last strike . What is the difference ? " " A great deal , Davy , " said my father . " We knew what we all wanted and we were able to point to it . It affected all of us , and I happened to be chosen to speak . " " But that is all we want to do , " said Davy . " We put our demands and back them up with unanimous support . " ' That is the trouble , " said my father .

" " Unanimous , Dada , " said Davy . " It means altogether . And thee is to make the owners give us fair terms . " " Unanimous , " said my father , saying it carefully . " Yes . It do , utind what it is . A collection of dull monkeys who can not thinkr themselves . And the people who speak for them will have tongues yard long and nothing else inside their heads . All the space will be taken to coil up their tongues . I have met them . " " I shall be one of them , Dada , " said Davy . " I wonder , " said my father . " At all events , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There will come a day , Dada , " said Davy , " when you will have to . " " When that day comes , Davy , " said my father , " I will think about it again . " Ivor was with my father from the start . Nothing Davy would say rould move him , and that caused trouble between them . Davy even topped speaking to Bronwen because of it . So indeed for a time we were a happy lot there , with my father acting like a lodger , and my brothers doing everything they could to make him be a father , and my mother trying all ways to keep them together . The owners must have found out that my father was against the56 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYunion idea , because as soon as old Mr. Rhys the Superintendent died , my father was offered his job , and , of course , he took it . Being superintendentmade my father next to the manager , and put up his pay , and made him one of the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men began to think he had gone in with the owners , and that talk hurt him more than his trouble with Davy . He hated to think that anybody would suspect him of being disloyal , especially to the men , but there was no way he could fight the talk because it was never said in the open . He often spoke to my mother at night and I heard every word . My mother was always ready to try to make him happy again , but it was not from her that he wanted it . It was from the men , and there was no way of reaching them , because they never came to him now as they used to . He noticed the change from the moment his name was put on the board . For the first few days the men passed him without greeting , except to touch their caps civil . But when it passed into two days and more and then a week , and still the men were not speaking to him except about matters of work , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was to blame for being made Superintendent . Mama spoke to Davy about it , when she found that nobody would listen to Ivor . " Davy , " she said , " what is this about your father ? " " Well , Mama , " said Davy , and he knew , of course , what my mother meant . " It is this . It is very strange Dada was chosen for Super when everybody knows he is my father . " " Why is it strange , boy ? " my mother asked , with the knife half in and out of the pie . " Because I am his son , " said Davy , " and living in the same house . I am the union rebel to the owners , and Dada is known to be against me . Why did they choose him instead of Tom Davies or Rhys Howells ? They are both senior , though they can not do the job better , it is true . Dada was picked to slap my face and the boys who ar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " my mother said , and putting the plate down with a noise . " You are like a lot of children with you .

You tell those fools of men that your father is as much fur them now as he ever was . Wait you till he do have a chance . " " The men will wait till then , Mama , I am afraid , " said Davy . " It IN useless to talk to them now . And you had better warn Ivor that his life will be in danger if he do go about talking so silly as he have . He had better keep his mouth shut or he will have it closed for him . " " David Morgan , " my mother said , " you can talk of your good rather in such a way ? Indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen to Ivor while he is doing his duty by his father , I will urse you with my last breath . " " Mama , Mama , " said Davy , and he got up to put his arms round y mother , but she wanted to push him away . " Saying nothing ainst Ivor I was , only warning . The men are ugly and they are a mood to be dangerous . " " If Davy had not been strict with them , " said Owen , " they would th have been put over the bridge days ago . " My mother was standing as though in sleep , and new lines coming to her face , and her eyes going wide with a feeling worse than orry . " Is it like that with them ? " she was whispering . " Oh , Davy , my le one , I thought it was only talk . " " No , Mama , " said Davy , kissing her . " It is serious . The men ill have what they are after this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would have them , my father or not . There is a ove to strike for a new Super to take Dada 's place . " " Will you allow it ? " my mother asked . " Who am I against twenty thousand and over ? " asked Davy . " Twenty thousand ? " my mother asked , and her eyes were lighting And shading while she tried to think how many it was . " Twenty thousand , Mama , " Davy said , and very sad he was , " andlikely to be a hundred thousand before the month is out . " " Oh , Davy , my little one , " my mother said , and she sat down in e old chair by the fire . " Where will you end ? What trouble willou cause ?

" " No , Mama , " I said . " Come here , " my mother said , and I went to her . " Do you kn where the men are meeting at night ? " " Yes , Mama , " I said . " Up by Jones the Chapel 's field .

And y will say nothing , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said , and my stomach was turning to see the lo in her face . " Good , " she said . " Angharad and Ceridwen will be here in moment . Not a single word , my boy . " I had been in bed about three-quarters of an hour with the curta ' drawn when my sisters went to bed . As soon as they had gone , heard my mother opening the cupboard to bring out her cloak an bonnet , and the rustle as she brought them from the paper . Then she pulled the curtains aside and looked down on me , hidi the light . " Huw , " she whispered , " are you sleeping ? " " No , Mama , " I said . " There is pity to bring you from the warm , " my mother said , wi tears . " Sleep you , my little one . I will find it by myself . " " No , indeed , Mama , " I said . " You will be bound to fall in thi river . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said , " I was thinking of that . I have been inside the house so long , indeed , I would lose my way from here to the Chapel . " " Let me dress , Mama , " I said . " And I will have you there in ainute . " " Come you , then , " she said , and holding up my trews . " There is your father in you , indeed . " " Good , " I said , and Mama sat down to laugh . L When I had dressed we went through the back door and down the ; ick alley behind Dai Ellis the Stable , and crossed the river by the little wooden bridge that was higher up than the stones . The river was almost frozen and full right up to the top of thet , inks . We had nearly come through winter , but cold was still with s and snow was bound to come , and indeed that night I could smell It like rain only colder , and with a sour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my eyes . " Careful , now , Huw , " my mother said , as we crossed the logs. ou are so small you could slip through . Give me your hand . " I put my hand in my mother 's muff and up we went , with Inc undermother 's cloak and just my face showing to see the way . There was no question in my mind why my mother was going . I , rnnot remember thinking about it . But I could feel her warmth  --  ll round me , and I could hear her speaking under her breath when the way was not too hard . It was darker up this way because there were more trees , but the y was so black there was no chance to see the tops , and we could Ilte the path only because it was blacker than the grass at the sides . y boots struck the hardness like a hammer and often gave up the sparks , and I tried to make more till my mother gave me a ull . " Boots cost , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil about her ce . " Lift your heels , boy . You are like a tinder , with you . " Higher up the mountain we had to stop many times while my mother took her breath , but always she went on . There was no hopeturn back once my mother had started . Even when the snow was dropping wet when we came out of the trees into the pasture she said ti thing , though she held me tighter . We had not gone far when it6o HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY I HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 6iwas snowing so thick it was like trying to go through a rain of bits of paper , but I was sure of the way and I never stopped once . " Are you sure , Huw ? " my mother asked me , and let snow fall on me from her bonnet as she bent . " Is this where it is ? " " Yes , Mama , " I said , and surprised to be questioned . " I would tell you if not . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go you , then , Huw . " Up and on we went , but my mother was tired and leaning on me , and I felt proud to be leading her and helping her like this . So you will know how I felt when we saw the fires the men had made only a little way above us , looking like big red blooms through hosts of blown , streaming , snow shadows that whispered as they fell and squeaked beneath our feet . " There you are , Mama , " I said , " there they are , look . " " Right you are , " she said . " Go quietly , now . " We went round to the side of the two biggest fires and when we got nearer I saw that they were built on the rock , and more fires were burning in the field , and the men were standing round them . Somebody was speaking , not Davy , from the front of the rock , but just as we got to the foot , he finished and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " help me up here , now . " Indeed I have never been more surprised to this day . My mother was scrambling up the rock , with her cloak dragging in the snow . Up and up she went , and turned when she reached the top to look down at me . I could hardly hear what she was saying because the men were still cheering the last speaker . " Huw , " she shouted , through her hands , " wait you by there . " " Right you , Mama , " I shouted back , and I watched her going carefully across the front of the rock to where the last man had stood to speak . The cheering fell when the men saw her standing there , but nobody could see properly who it was because of the snow and being blinded by the light and smoke of the fires . Some men down in the front saw it was a woman and started to shout to others , but theycould see only the shape of her cloak . Her face was hidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had run round the front of the rock to see what my mother was going to do , when she took the muff away and started to speak . Some men had come from one of the fires on the rock to see who it was , but when she started to speak , they stopped where they were . " I am Beth Morgan , " my mother said , and her voice was as deep and strong as any man . " I have come up here to tell you what I do think of you all , because I have heard you are talking against my husband . Two things in this world I do hate . One is talking behind the back , and the other is lice . So you should know what I do think of you . " The only sounds when my mother stopped were the crackling of wood and the hushing of snow . " You are a lot of cowards to talk against my husband , " my mother said with a full voice . " He has done nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . He is Superintendent of the collierynow because every man will have his reward for working , and that is his . And for you to think he is with the owners because he has had his reward is not only nonsense but downright wickedness . How some of you can sit in the same Chapel with him I can not tell . I would look for a flame of fire upon me , indeed . But there is one thing more I will say and that is this . If harm do come to my Gwilym , I will find out the men and I will kill them with my hands . And that I will swear by God Almighty . And there will be no I-Iell for me . Nobody will go to Hell for killing lice . " " Mama , " Davy called from the back of the rock . My mother turned round to look for Davy , but she could not see him at first . " I am not your mother , " she said , " when you arc with these . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to harm , you shall be the first to go . " Davy came out of the darkness to go to my mother but she turned away and started to stumble down the rock . I ran round to help her find her footway , and Davy stood at the top watching in quiet . There62 110W GREEN WAS MY VALLEYwas low talking from the men and not a sound else , and indeed if ever I heard the voice of shame , then it was , while my mother was crying as she felt her way down . I only knew she was crying when we had gone a little way do and she took my hand from her muff to blow her nose . " Mama , " I said , " would you kill men ? " " Yes , Huw , " she said , " I would . " " But Dada said the Bible says you shall not kill , " I said . " What is in the Bible and what is outside is different , " my moth said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Be quiet now , and find the way down . Are you cold ? " " No , Mama , " I said . " Except my feet , and they are like stone with me . " " Huw , my little one , " my mother said , and stopped , " come here and I will carry you . " " No , Mama , " I said , and I could have shouted . " You shall not . I can walk with the next . Come you , and I will show you . " " There is like an old mule you are , boy , " my mother said . " you , then . And be careful . I can see nothing , indeed . " The snow was falling faster now , and we were still out in the pasture , so the wind and snow were both busy about us , and the dark .. ness was thick . I knew my way only because of the slope of the ground , and the sound of the earth under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , but I knew where it should end being hard and where it should start to be soft . Down we went , with my mother leaning heavily upon my shoulder , and stopping often to have breath , and the wind beginning now to have the voice of a woman in grief . It was better , and we went faster when we came to the trees , but snow was piling as we reached the river level , blown down from the branches , so we had to picup our feet and feel them sink again and not know if we were in dee till we touched ground . Just before we got to the bridge , I fell in a mound right up to my shoulders and my mother fell in on top of me when she came to pull me out . I was lying face down , and I could feel her trying to get up , but the more she tried the farther I went down , face first , and I foughtiHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 63to have my breath . I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , I was on my mother 's lap and she was sitting in the drift wall her bonnet off and her hair all covered with snow , and looking gown at me . " Huw , " she said . " Yes , Mama , " I said , and I wanted to cry but I stopped . " Are you hurting ? " she asked , in the same voice , as though she Was sore in the throat . " No , Mama , " I said . " But there is cold . " " Come then , " she said , and she tried to lift me , but she fell back . I was able to stand up but I felt as I had when I won the race , 11 giddy and willing to fall over . But I was sure to stand up straight cause my mother was wanting help , so I went to her and caught cr hand . " Come you , Mama , " I said . " Up a dando . " " Up a dando ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was up a ando just now and frightening his Mama sick ? " " Not my fault it was , Mama , " I said . " It was the old snow .

And it will be having us both if e will not go from here . Up a dando , now . " I found her bonnet while she was tying her cloak , and went on in front , but carefully this time until we reached the bridge . But by the bridge we met the full wind and it carried snow with it so thick that nothing could be seen through it . I felt my way across the logs by holding on to the plank rail , and my mother holding me by the hand . Careful and slow we had to go , and all the time the wind was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found the other side and then we were lost , except to guess . From where we were was not far to our house but we could see nothing except the blackness knitted with snow . From the bridge I was sure I knew which way to go but after we had been walking a few minutes my boots touched stones and I knew that one more step and we would be in the river. 64 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " I am sorry , Mama , " I said . " I am wrong here . " " Very well , my little one , " my mother said , " you had a good try , indeed . Shall we turn round , now ? " " These stones are down nearly by the Chapel , Mama , " I said , " so if we go across from by here , we will go straight in Morris the Butcher 's . " " Go you , then , Huw , " my mother said , " you are the man , here . " So hot I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shine in tho sun . It gave me a new spirit indeed , and I struck out to where I thought Morris the Butcher 's lay as though it was three o'clock on a spring afternoon . But if I was strong and sure , my mother was not . We had got about half-way across the rocks and gravel , and she was heavy on my shoulder and having her breath in pain with her , when she put her hands to her chest and fell down on her face Ha soundless , not moving . Fright took me . I looked at her , black in the snow , and snow going white upon her , ' and I was afraid . But I remembered she had called me a man , and I made tight my fists . What to do , I was asking myself . If I ran for my father , perhaps I would not find my mother again . If I stayed here with her , perhaps we would both not be found and then sh would die of cold . Perhaps if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach my father . And all the time I was thinking what to do , I was kneeling beside her , brushing and scraping the snow from her , hating each piece and handful as though it were living and able to understand , the white , quiet , cold , cruel snow . Then I thought of the boys . They would all be coming down soon , and some would be coming over the bridge . If I could have my mother down by there I would be bound to meet somebody . As soon as I thought , I started . But there is heavy my mother seemed to me . I tried and tried but her arms were loose and slipped through when I tried to lift her by the shoulders . And it seemed too rude to take hold of her by the leg as I would have done with a boy . So I tried and tried , and 1HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 65cried in rage to be so weak and I wished the snow had been hardei and with shape to throw myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms about my mother 's waist and , kneeling in the ' now , clasping her like that , I crawled backwards toward the bridge , pulling and dragging her as I went. flours it did seem , and no feeling or sense was in me , but I was rying to God to help me to save my mother , and I was helped foi sure , or I can not tell where I found the strength . I knew I had reached the bridge when my shoulders came against the rail . I pulled my mother into the shelter of the post and tried to sit her against it but she was far off and her mouth was open and T had to keep closing it . Then I found I could not stand up . Strength ad gone from my legs . So I had to crawl to find the middle of the ridge and scratch away the snow to feel the logs to be sure that I would be near when the boys crossed over , and then crawl back to my mother . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I pulled and pulled to have her back , but she was too heavy , and my arms were weak and there was nothing to be done with my fingers , they were so frozen . And when I knew I would lose her in the river , I knew there was only one thing to be done . I held her flat by lying on her and pressing her , while I rolled over her into the river . I knew it was not deep by there , only about up to my waist because that is where I had learnt to swim . But now it was up to my chest and when I went in , so cold it was , it seemed to open its hands and grip , and so strong that I was without a good breath for minutes . I had my mother with my head in her middle , and my hands holding her chin and leg , so she could not slip , but I was afraid my legs would go from under me , for I was not standing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my chin . My mother made no sound nor did she move , but I was too senselessto be afraid . How long it was I can not tell , but there was a weariness of time66 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYbefore I saw a light , a yellow lantern light swinging near me in the paining dark . I tried to shout but my voice was gone from my throat . Madness was in me to shout , to have that light nearer , to have my mother taken back to the house . So my voice came , but the voice was not mine , for there is no voice that will make the sound I made . All the fury of living kind , fighting against useless pain , was in the cry that brought the lantern to us . It was Davy , but I had only enough in my eyes to see his cold , blue face , lit with yellow light , and his eyes glistening big and staring , and his hand about the lantern to shield it .

Then I heard Bronwen singing , quietly , just near to me . Lightning quick I found myself , and blood rushed warm all overme and brought on such pain that I tried to twist . I was held tightin bandage . My face , arms , all my body and legs , all of me was asausage of so : c slippery bandage . The smell of goose grease was sweet and fat about me , and I knew6-r68 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in goose greas to cure cold . The memory of holding my mother came back to me , and now found time to be afraid . I tried to look at Bronwen , but I coul not move my head , and it was hurting all over . But Bronwen mus have seen me strain to move and speak , for she left her chair quickl as though she had jumped . She did smell always of thyme and lavender because she mad little bags of it for the sheets , and I suppose she put a couple in with her own wash . So that smell was always with her , and lovelier than that you will never have . She knelt by me , whispering , but I could not hear for the bandage She wiped my eyes for me , and rose up to look down at me . Beautiful , beautiful , was Bronwen , indeed . " Huw , " she said , as though she ought not to be speaking , " are you hurting with you ? " I made to nod , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Huw , " she said , smiling so kind and crying soft , " little Huw there is proud I am to have your name . Proud , indeed . " She bent to kiss me , quickly and so lightly , it was the touch of a warm moth , and ran then to call my father , who was upstairs here , sitting with my mother . Dr. Richards came in first to make a fuss over me and feel my pulse and look at his watch with his eyebrows up , and then my father came to stand by his shoulder and look down at me , with his hands in his jacket pockets . " He will do , " Dr. Richards said . " But it is beyond me to say why , indeed . You are breeding horses in this family , Mr. Morgan . This boy should be in his coffin , for my part . " " Thank God he is not , " my father said to him . He looked again at me and smiled . " Your mother is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your new sister . Thanks to you , of course . Your old father is very proud of you , Huw . " He bent down to kiss me and left the smell of him near me , of his pipe and himself . My silence seemed to make him afraid for me , but Dr. Richards pushed him out of the room and told him I was sleepy . " Mrs. Ivor , " Dr. Richards said to Bronwen when my father had gone , " let us undo the bandage now and see what has gone with him . I am afraid of a fracture . " Well , that is the last I remember , for as soon as Dr. Richards pulled back the clothes and put his hand on my leg , I had such a flash of hurt that I suppose I dropped off . I Strange it is to think back like this and be a small boy again , and talk to people who have been gone these years . I had fever in the bones of my legs for nearly five years after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not able to get up , or go out , or move at all . I have had plenty of time to think . For months , at first , I was not quite balanced because of pain . Then it got better , and at last I was having no pain at all . But still I was not allowed to get up because of the fracture , which kept on having to be broken and set . While I was only just living I took no notice of what went on , and indeed I remember nothing very much about it . I only know that it was Bronwen who nursed me night and day , until she had her baby , a little boy . They called him Gareth . The boys were often in to see me . They all had their meals in the parlour during the time I was bad , and sometimes in the evening they were allowed in for a minute , though I still could not speak to them because of a broken jaw . But they were very kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took turns to read books , but they had to stop reading Mr. Boswell 's Life of Johnson because it made me laugh , and laughing hurt too much . There is a man was Dr. Johnson . Indeed I do wish we had a few of his kind living to-day . Mind , I have heard him called an old busybodyand other things , too . But I have always noticed that those who70 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 71said such things were the very ones whom Dr. Johnson would have had under the table with a look , never mind a word . I owe a big debt to Mr. Boswell , indeed . How happy he must have been to write about so great a man . It was during that time that I found out about books . We had not many in the house , but what there were , were good , although a bit solid for me , mind . But my father , and Davy , and Ivor when he had time , were all at pains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy stages I grew with them . But we were in agonies there with Mr. Stuart Mill 's System of Logic . It was so hard that we laughed no end at ourselves . But we got through to the end and all the better for it . There is another man with a head . The Bible , of course , my father and Owen read before going to bed , and I knew it in the end as well as Owen . It was then that I had thoughts about Christ , and I have never changed my mind . He did appear to me then as a man , and as a man I still think of him . In that way , I have had comfort . If he had been a God , or any more a son of God than any of us , then it is unfair to ask us to do what he did . But if he was a man who found out for himself what there is that is hidden in life , then we all have a chance to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall . Indeed , I am going from this house to-night to try and find out wha is the matter with me and the people I know , because there is somethingradically wrong with us all , to be sure . Davy used to say the same thing , and if ever a man had cause to question his fellows , that man was Davy . I used to write his letters for him when I got better , not that he was unable to write his own , but because I had all day to write in . So I got to know all about matters concerning the Union and from the first I knew that things were wrong . Mrs. Tom Jenkins used to come up after school with her little girl , and give me the lessons for the day to follow , and take away the work I had done during the day . There is kind of her to come up all that way day after day , just to earn fourpence a week and do her bestfor a sick boy . And make no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , that my father paid for , so that I would have .1 good hand when I was ready to leave my bed . And I could write beautiful , too . I have never said so , but I can not put in words what came in me when I won a handwriting competition set by a paper in Town . And you should have seen the look in my father 's eyes when he brought in the paper . They were all in the kitchen , for it was reading time , and we were waiting for my father because he was late , and a estrange event with him . But when he came in , breathing a little extra from the Hill , he had the paper under his arm as he carried his Bible , and we knew from the way he came in and sat down in his chair that there was somethingserious to be said . So we all sat quiet . We could hear my mother singing to my new sister upstairs . My father put on his glasses , and picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys , but he gave no look to me at all . I thought I had done something wrong , and I was bruising my brains trying to think what , when my fathee cleared his throat , and then I knew it  --  as nothing bad , but good . " Handwriting Competition , " he read , and my heart bumped almost to the roof of my mouth . " Boys under twelve years of age . First prize of Two Guineas is awarded to Master Huw Morgan , son of Mr. Gwilym Morgan , for an entry of great merit . " Well , everybody was dumb with it . My father put the paper down and took off his glasses and started to tap them on the chair . " And that boy , " he said , " have been lying there for going on three cars and no sound from him but laughing and no words but cheerful . I am afraid , " he said , looking over at me , " I will have to stop by II ( re to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little one , becauseII I went to you now , I would be acting very silly , I am afraid . Bless you , my son . You are a comfort , indeed . " Well , then , they all started . They read the few words in the paper over and over , as though to get more from it each time , or to see if72 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYanything was hidden that had been missed . Gwilym ran down to fetch Ivor and Bronwen , and of course that was the cap for the evening . " There is clever you are , boy , " Bronwen said , pretending to be fainting and smiling in her own way . " You are making me feel like Red Riding Hood in front of the old wolf . Have you got big , strong teeth with you ? " She put her finger-tip in my mouth . My jaw was better now , though a little weak , but I gave her finger a good nip and held on and she screamed. " 0 , dammo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old mule , here . Right , you . I will have you for that . You shall eat your dinner tomorrowby yourself . " Davy came and sat down by me when Bronwen went to get supper ready with the girls , and he looked at me for a moment , saying nothing . " You are a clever boy , Huw , " he said , " and the first in the family to have your name in the paper . Good . Now then , let us turn this to good account . You shall have twopence every time you write a letter for me . How does that suit you ? " " I would rather write for nothing for you , Davy , " I said . " No , no , " he said . " You shall write for the Union . And the twopencesshall pay for your school and for a holiday when you are better . Is it ? " " Yes , " I said , for to be able to pay for myself was a good thought to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but a piece of pie instead of bread and milk . There is good it did taste , too . " If you have trouble with the meat , " she said , " tell me , and I will put the old man back on his old baby 's food . " She knew I would chew all the more for that , and chew I did , restingback in the crook of her arm , with the smell of lavender and thyme about Inc , and her warmth near me , and her face made gold in the lamplight and laugh in her eyes . Perhaps it was wrong for a boy to feel in love with a woman ten years older than himself , but nobody ever knew , even Bronwen down to this day . So no harm was done , HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 73though she has been a sanctuary to me all through my life . And she would have been seventy-two next month . So the years do go . But I never knew I was in love , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about love , and most of all by people who have never known it , who have no spirit within them to inspire it in others . Talk of love in such mouths is a grossness , indeed . I had my first taste of it when Owen met Marged Evans . Marged was daughter of one of my father 's oldest friends , and she came to us because her mother thought she should learn how to run a house for a family . My mother was still too weak to do a day 's work properly , so she stayed on in bed . My father 's orders , and sensible , too . Marged had quiet prettiness with dark blue eyes that would change colour when she laughed , and make you feel so pleased you would want to laugh more than you knew you should . For the first week she was so shy no one would have more than four words from her , and they were yes , please , and thank you . Bronwen tried all ways to have her talking , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use . Marged would hold her head down , and if you tried to make fun , you would see tears and then you would be sorry . How is it that people who have shy strangers to stay never think that home sickness and many strange faces , habits , and voices , may put aches in the heart . You are so used to the house and people yourself. , you never come to think that what is ordinary to you may be a desert of woeful newness to another . She had been with us for four or five days , and she had just got to the stage where she could smile at you quickly and look away in case you spoke , when Owen became her champion . Of course , lying there as I had been , I could have told anybody that Owen was in love with her , because I remembered how Ivor had been with Bronwen . And the signs are all the same with the same family . My father was carving the chicken and he asked Marged what she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Morgan , please , " said Marged , still shy , and with eight pairs of eyes upon her , and going red under them. 74 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " A nice wing , " said Bronwen . " How about the parson 's nose , then ? " asked Davy . " Marged is our guest , " Owen said , and black thunder he was looking at Davy . " If there is any joking , perhaps you will have it out on me . " " What is the matter with John Willie , now ? " asked Davy , knowingwell . " There is a scowl , man . Take it off , quick . You will have a hole in the table-cloth . " " Never mind about the table-cloth , " Owen said . " You leave Marged alone . " " Owen , " said my father , " if there is any rebuking in this family , I will be the one to do it . Davy may have been forward in his remarks , and he knows that the part he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . But there was no wrong in it , and Marged was not offended . Were you , my girl ? " " No , Mr. Morgan , " Marged said . But only I saw the look she gave Owen , except Owen , of course . And you should have seen it . I can not blame poor Owen for falling in love . There was flame in that look , that made you feel as though you had put your eyes too near the fire . It was a couple of days after that , at night , when I had proof I was right . My father and the boys and Bronwen had gone down to choir practice , leaving Marged in the house in case my mother called , and Owen was out in the back doing his inventions . He was sure he would make a machine to cut coal so that colliers could have an easier time of it , and work less hours , with more pay because the machine would cut more coal to be sold . Every night he was hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and running down to Howell the Blacksmith to melt and fashion pieces of iron for him , and calling to someone in the house to come and hold somethingwhile he hit it , and making a nuisance . Well , to-night , Marged was doing her tapestry by the fire and I was in the wall bed as usual , with the curtains drawn in case I would sleep . I could see her well , and I was having games to count how many stitches with one colour , how many with another . But so fast she used the needle , my eyes got tired and I was just going to sleep when theHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 75door opened quietly and Owen came in , black and with a handful of iron . " Oh , " he said , and stood . Marged smiled at her work and said nothing , but kept her back to him and made plain her face . " I had no notion you would be here , " said Owen . There is a liar he was . No answer from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you got any hot water , with you ? " asked Owen , nailed to the floor . Nobody knew better than he that the cauldron was brimming with boiling water , as it always was . You could hear it . Marged said nothing for a moment , then she put her needle in a part she was coming to , and looked up , though not at Owen . " How much do you want ? " she asked him. " 0 , " said Owen , as though he thought it was a miracle she could speak . " I would like a wash . " " I will fill a bucket , " said Marged , and got up . " No , no , " said Owen , as though it was shocking to think she could touch a bucket . " How will you have a wash , then ? " asked Marged , still with her back to him . " In a cup ? " I had to stuff a corner of the blanket in my mouth to have quiet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and very serious . " I will get the bucketmyself . There is no need for you to do things like that for me . " " Where is the bucket with you ? " asked Marged , still not looking . " Out by here in the wash-house , " said Owen . " Good , " said Marged , and she sat down to stitch again . But Owen made no move to the wash-house . He was watching Marged . There is a look in the eyes of a man in love that will have you in fits unless you are in love yourself . If you are , you will feel something move inside you to be of help to him , to try and have him happy even if there is no chance for you . This look was in the eyes of Owen . You will see a part of it in the eyes of sheep fastened to the board and waiting for the knife . The " There is wicked you are , " said Marged , but not a bit stern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Owen . " There is beautifulyou are . " " No , " said Marged , between a sigh and a sob . " Yes , " said Owen . " No , " said Marged , not so certain . " Behold , " Owen said , from Solomon , " thou art fair . Thou hast dove 's eyes . " " Dove 's eyes are small , " Marged said . " Your 's are so big they are all my world , " said Owen . " No , " said Marged , high . " Yes , " Owen said , and put down the bucket . " I love you , Marged Evans . " " There is silly , " said Marged , going cold again , " only five days you have known me . " " I knew from the moment , " said Owen , and I believed him . " I have known you five thousand years . In jewels and gold . " " Jewels and gold ? " said Marged . " Since when , now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen . " 0 , Marged . " Marged 's hands flew up on wings to her throat so pretty was his voice with her name . " I have no jewels or gold , " she said , trying to be cold again . But even Owen knew now . " You shall have them , " he said , and meant it . " Wait you till I sell my inventions . You shall have everything to your heart 's want . And no work about the house . " " No work about the house ? " asked Marged . " No , " said Owen . " What will I do all day , then ? " asked Marged . " You shall wait for me , " said Owen . " When will you marry me ? " " I will have to ask Dada , " said Marged . " Make your own mind to answer , " said Owen . " When ? " " You will wake Huw , " Marged said , shaking . " When ? " asked Owen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leave it , now . " Owen looked at her , and Marged 's hands dropped again . ForHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 7776 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYother part you will see only in the eyes of a good man who has put his heart into the hands of a girl . It is a light that is rarely of the earth , a radiance that is holy , a warming , happy agony that do shine from inside and turn what it touches to something of paradise . Marged felt that look , because she straightened her shoulders and made to shiver . " Arc you going for the bucket ? " she asked him , and making a big swallow. " 0 , " said Owen , as though he had smashed a window . " Yes , indeed . Now , just . " He had no notion where to put his iron , so he put it outside the door while he went for the bucket . Of course , if one of us had only touched his iron , never mind leaving it outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is love for you . Back he came , then , and went forward step by step till he was at the side of her , but still she was stitching . " Ermhh , mhh , mhh , " said Owen , scraping like an old hen , " shall I have some , now ? " " Give it to me , " said Marged , and down went the work again . She stood up , trying not to look , but burning coals are not as hot as the eyes of men like Owen , and so , wanting to or not , Marged was forced to look up , slowly from the bucket , up his arm to his shoulder , and slowly again , so slowly , up his face . To his eyes . At first I could not see Marged in the face because her back was to the fire and the lamp was behind her . But I had no need to see , for I could feel . And I could see her hands tight fast in her apron . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yes , " said Marged . I nearly fell through the bed so cold was her Voice . " I have got my bucket , " said Owen , so silly I was sorry for him . " Here is the water , " said Marged , and waved behind her . " Yes , " said Owen , but no move . " They will be home from choir in a minute , " said Marged , and I could see the shadow bless her throat as she swallowed again . " I wish they would never come back , " said Owen. 78 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYminutes , it did seem , they looked at each other . They were still , hardly a breath , looking . Almost before my eyes could see , Owen caught her by the shoulders and kissed her , so long I thought they were turned to salt . " Marged , " he said , and his voice was rough and sore with him . " 0 , Marged . " " Owen , " she was whispering . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Me , too , " she said . " No , " he said , as though astonished , unbelieving . " Yes , indeed , " she said , and you will never hear deeper truth . " When I saw you first . " " No , " he said . " Like I did ? " " Yes , " she said . " Like you did . And when you stood up for me about the chicken , I wanted to kiss you . " " Marged , " he said , and holding her again . " There is beautiful you are . " " I wish I was , " she said . " Beyond compare , " he said . " I will worship you all my life . You shall be happy every minute . I will stab myself for every tear . " " Owen , " she said , " there is nice things you say . " He would have said more , I suppose , but then my mother tapped on the bedroom floor with her shoe . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Every night , at this time , she spoke to me , but if I had gone to sleep , we would speak in the morning , so nothing was lost . " Yes , Aunty Beth ? " asked Marged , and making a sign to Owen . " Is Huw sleeping ? " my mother called down . Owen turned toward the wall bed . " Are you sleeping , boy ? " he asked me , but so quiet that he would never have had me awake if I had been sleeping . Then I was in a pumpkin jelly , not knowing whether to say yes or no , because I wanted no black looks from either . " Yes , " I said , but dull , as though I had been sleeping . So are liars made . " Mama wants to talk to you , " said Owen . " Yes , Mama , " I called , and they stood looking , hand in hand . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 79 " How are you to-night , my little one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " How are you ? " " Lovely , indeed , " my mother said . " Is your leg paining now ? " " No , Mama , thank you , " I said . " Dr. Richards is going to let me get up soon . " " I will be up on Saturday , " my mother said , " so I will see you . Are you having plenty to eat with Bronwen ? " " Yes , Mama , " I said . " But Bronwen is not such a good cook as Mama , is she ? " my mother asked me , and there was such longing in her voice that I pretended to cough to have time to rid my throat of the stone . Without taking time , I saw the months of lying in bed and thinking of her house and children under the care of another woman all go screeching through my mother 's mind . Bronwen was a cook above good cooks and it seemed unfair to say that my mother was better . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of longing to know that she was missed by us , that she was not forgotten , that she was still Mama , to be wished for and welcomed . Even though a lie had to be said .

" " All of them you shall have , " my mother said , and the sureness in her voice would make you smile to yourself . " Wait you till I am from this old bed , and you shall see what those old pots shall cook . I am going mad here , thinking what I should be doing instead of lying down and nursing this fat old lump of a girl . " Lovely was my small sister , and Olwen was her name .

" Go on , boy , " my mother said , with laughing , " she is sleeping these hours . Go you to sleep , now . " " Yes , Mama , " I said . " Good night , then . " 8o HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 8i " Good night , my little one , " my mother said . " Tell Marged not to put more on the fire . " So it was , nearly every night . That night I remember well , for while we were speaking , Owen and Marged went hand in hand on tiptoe through to the back , and they were still there after my father came in with Ivor and Bronwen from the choir practice . " Where is Marged ? " asked Bronwen . " In the back , " I said . Marged came in looking red , and trying to have her breath with . out a struggle , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I saw Bronwen look at her with that smile that was not a smile , and go to the cupboard for the plates . " I wonder should Owen have a fire out there , " Bronwen asked , and rattling plates . " Yes , indeed , " Marged said . " It is shocking cold there , still . " " 0 ? " said Bronwen . " He told me so , " said Marged , but too quickly . " Never mind , girl , " Bronwen said , and gently . " There is no harm done to go in and find out for yourself . Is there ? " " I have never been , " said Marged , looking at Bronwen with big eyes . " Not once . " " Never mind if you have , " said Bronwen , smiling properly now . " No matter , girl . Put the baking stone on , will you ? I will make milk cakes for supper . " When supper was ready and Owen was called in by Gwilym , you would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marged and him . He seemed not to notice her , and he did not exist for her . But I caught the looks they sent across the table while everybody was eating . Small , quick looks , with everything they were thinking crushed into them , with enough heat to cause blazing . They sat nearer to me than to the others , and since they thought I was asleep they were careless of the gap in the curtains and the eyes that looked from the shadow inside . This it was that went so near to spoil my mother 's coming down that Saturday . My father had made all sorts of surprises for her . He had the choir coming up the Hill to sing outside the door , and the new preacher and the colliery manager and Dr. Richards to tea , and all my uncles and aunts , and all Bronwen 's family , and I can not say how many more , never mind all the village . Four harpists were coming from other valleys , and fiddlers , and a piano was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was going to Bronwen for a present from my father and mother for the first grandchild , Gareth . Then Idris John started to paint the house from top to bottom , inside and out , and furniture , all new and elegant beyond words , came from Town with the piano . If you had seen my mother 's face when she came iii the house , you would have laughed first and then wanted to cry . She 11,1 ( 1 l wen carried on the mattress down to Bronwen 's a couple of days before , to 1w outof the house for Idris to paint the bedrooms . But she t1lollellf , , If (  --  wasbeing taken away to have the wooden bedstead ' ha t ( for it was old , and it creaked to make you hold your teeth , and she had sworn to have an axe up there and chop it up and throw it away through the hack window for the fire , so sour she was with it . There is a fool an old bedstead can be , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it became time to move me , and then Ivor carried me into the front roots . There is beautiful all the new paper and paint looked . The new furniture was in the houses next door , piled up in their front rooms and passages waiting for Idris to finish and the girls to wash down . When I was carried back next morning I knew the kitchen was ours only by the shape . It was so changed with Idris and his brush . The ceiling was white , with paint on smooth boards , and the walls were pale blue and yellow with all the rough places and the cracks filled in . My wall bed was so pretty in yellow it was a pleasure to go back in there and look up at the sun shining upon it as though he was glad to have something his own colour to land on and live with . All that morning my sisters and Bronwen , and the women from the82 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 83Hill , and my aunts as they came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house tidy for my mother . My father was in and out of the kitchen every minute , giving things a little push , or looking at half-made curtains , or frowning at piles of crockery on the floor , with his fingers itching with him , as though impatient to do everything himself , there and then , without waiting . And when he looked round and found me watching him , he pulled his moustache as though he was ashamed of his feeling , and looked down at the floor and up at me and winked , then . " Supervising I am , see , my son , " he said , and pulled his coat down at the back and walked out funny to make me laugh . Well , it was all ready , at last . Hundreds of people there were outside . The choir came up in a crowd and I could hear them singing as they walked up the Hill , beautiful indeed . Everybody joined in the hymn , the girls cooking out in the back , and Bronwen and Angharad and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aunts and uncles in the front room , and the women upstairs hanging the last curtains . Everywhere was singing , all over the house was singing , and outside the house was alive with singing , and the very air was song . My father brought the new preacher in to see me before my mother came from Bronwen 's , and Mr. Nicholas , the colliery manager , and Dr. Richards stood in the doorway because the kitchen was full up with girls and women , all cooking or cutting bread and butter . " This is Huw , Mr. Gruffydd , " said my father . " Huw , this is the Reverend Mr. Merddyn Gruffydd , the new preacher . Bow your head , my son . " " Leave your head on the pillow , " said the Reverend Mr. Gruffydd , and he was looking at me , and frowning . " Huw Morgan , never let that light go from your eyes . Never mind how long you are here . 1 ) o you want to go out with the other boys ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arc you sure you will go from here one day ? " asked Mr. Gruffydd , smiling now . " Yes , " I said . " I am , sir . " " Good , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " And not a doubt about it , never mind what all the doctors have got to say . " Of course , that was a cut for Dr. Richards , in fun , mind , so everybodylaughed except the doctor . " The boy will be no better for those ideas , Mr. Gruffydd , " Dr. Richards said . " Nature must take her course . " " Nature , " said the Reverend Mr. Gruffydd , " is the handmaiden of the Lord . I do remember that she was given orders on one or two occasions to hurry herself more than usual . What has been done before can also be done again , though perhaps not so quickly , indeed . Have you faith , Huw , my little one ? " " Yes , sir , " I said , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reverend Mr. Gruffydd , " you shall see the first daffodil out upon the mountain . Will you ? " " Indeed I will sir , " I said , and his hand was cool on my forehead . " God bless you , little Huw , " said the Reverend Mr. Gruffydd . " I will come to see you every day . Yes ? " " Yes , sir , " I said . " Thank you , sir , " my father said , and strange he was looking , but the Reverend Mr. Gruffydd only shook his head and waved his hand and smiled at me before he went back in the other room . The kitchen was quiet when he went . Bronwen was looking after him with her hands all flour with her and the other girls were nodding at one another and looking as though something serious had happened . " What is wrong , Bron ? " I asked her . " Nothing , boy , " said Bronwen , so I knew there was something . " There is a fine man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chapel , now then . " " Yes , indeed , " said Mrs. Idris , and starting again on the potatoes . " He have had a revival wherever he have been to preach . " " Well , we can do with one here , " said Bronwen , and back she went to her cakes . All this time there had been singing outside , but not all of them together except for the choruses . But now , because my mother was84 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY coming , a shouting and cheering started that made the very pots on the table shake together . Quick as quick Bronwen and the others finished all they were doing and ran to be from the kitchen when my mother came in . There is a rush they made , with a rattle of bowls and a clashing of cutlery , and all of them trying to wipe down the table at once , and leaving it for something else , and then finding everybody had left it half done , and all of them rushing back again to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing flour off the tiles , and putting more coal on the fire , and bumping against one another and laugh- ing , and the cheering growing louder outside , and their faces going straight with them again , and another rush to pat my bedclothes tidy and giving me smiles , and kisses from Bronwen and Angharad , and then they had gone , with a click of the latch and a tapping on the cobbles . And there was left only the chickens on the spit , and the new furniture , and the cheering , and me . You will never know how silly is cheering until you lie on your back , and look up at sunlight stretching itself on a bed of yellow paint , and try to do a bit of cheering by yourself . First you will make a noise in the same key in the back of your throat , but it will sound as though you had an old fish bone by there , so you will try louder . Then you can not make up your mind whether it should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carry the Ay on a few beats till you stop for your breath . If you will have Ay , then you try it louder and louder until you are screaming at the top of your voice , and in the middle of that comes a thought . There is a fool you look , with your mouth wide open , and your throat hard with effort , and your good voice wasting in Ay . For the sake of making a noise . So I stopped cheering and listened for somebody coming in , and presently I heard the front door open . Just then , I suppose because they had been told to watch for it , the choir started to sing . There is lovely after that senseless noise . In dignity and harmony , in rich beauty rose their voices now employed in noble purpose . Glorious is the Voice of Man , and sweet is the music of the harp . I looked round quickly at the doorway and found my mother watching me with diamonds in her eyes , and her hand to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Huw , " she said . " Huw , my little one . " No words would come from me , and I turned my head . My mother came over to me and I heard her skirt sighing across the tiles , but when she bent over me and saw me pulling faces , she began to pull a few , and then we looked at each other and we started to laugh at the same time . There was nothing to cry about , see , so there was no sense in crying . " Wait you , " my mother said , and wiping my face , " there are some blackberry tarts coming up the Hill now in a minute . Wait you . " " Are you better , Mama ? " I asked her . " Better , boy ? " my mother said , and laughing she was , now , with her . " Of course I am better . Do I look better ? " " Your hair is white with you , " I said . " The snow got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your old cap on . " But my mother was only joking , of course . Women arc so brave . " Are you ready to see the house , Beth ? " my father asked . He wasstanding in the doorway , watching us . " Yes , indeed I am , " my mother said , and she got up . " There is beautiful , Gwilym . " She was looking about the kitchen , and then she looked quickly at me and ran , yes , ran , from there , and up the stairs . My father and mother were up there a long time , enough time for the choir to go through four hymns and Comrades in Arms , and then I heard them coming down . Back they came to the kitchen again and they stood by the table . " Well , Gwilym , " my mother said , and looking at him . " Well , Beth , " said my father , and smiling . " There is beautiful , " said my mother . " Glad I am you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is left in the box , now ? " my mother asked 86 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 87 " Plenty , " said my father . " After the doctor and all this ? " asked my mother . " Plenty , plenty , and to spare , " said my father , still smiling and giving a wink to me . " There is kind you are , Gwil , " my mother said , putting her hand on his arm . " There is a wife you have got , staying in bed all this time and leaving her family to strangers . " " Yes , indeed , " my father said , pretending to be angry , " and bring- ing another little sister for Huw , too . Dear , dear , there is a wife . " " I wanted to get up , Gwil , " said my mother . " Sweetheart mine , " said my father . I had never heard him call my mother that before . There is pretty it did sound . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , and white hair . " Sh , " she said , and looked quickly at me , and saw me smiling . and blushed more , looking on the floor and curling her fingers in her chain . " Shall we go out to Mr. Gruffydd now , Beth ? " my father asked her , and frowned at me to say nothing . " Yes , " my mother said , " but there is to be no say from me , mind . " " You will have to have a couple of words with them , girl , " my father said , and laughing . " They will be shouting if you try to run . " " But what will I say ? " my mother said . " You found something to say last time you spoke , " my father said . " It should be easier , now , with friends . " " Right , you , " said my mother , nodding as she did when there was nothing more to be done . " But if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the blame . Then I did talk for good reason to a parcel of dull men . But now , there is no profit to talk . " " Only to say thanks , girl , " said my father , urging her . " I will say that with a good cup of tea , " my mother said . " Have those girls got ready ? " " Yes , Mama , " I said . " Out in the back they are waiting . " " Good , " said my father , " and the rest are out in the front , waiting these months . Come you , Beth . Let me see a smile with you , then , girl . " No good to keep straight your face when my father looked at you like that . So my mother struggled with her mouth for a moment and then she started to laugh . " Go on with you , boy , " she said , and taking his arm from her waist and giving him a little push to the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little one , " she said to me , " blackberry tart for you this minute . " " Thank you , Mama , " I said , " speak so that I will hear you . " " Gracious goodness , " my mother laughed , " there is like your old Dada you are , boy . " Out they went , then , and such a shout to meet them as they opened the front door . A big voice called for silence , and I knew that the Reverend Mr. Gruffydd would not find it hard to be heard over in the next valley if he had notions to try . " Beloved , " he said , standing upon the window sill of the front room , " I give you greeting in the name of the Crucified . " " Amen , " they said , and the deep sound of it slid down the Hill .

But I will have you in Chapel , indeed . " A big laugh from the crowd who knew they would have to be silent in the four walls of the Zion . " Beth Morgan , " he called , and his voice tolled about the Valley , " come into your house . 0 woman , 0 noble mother , enter thou in honour while we give thanks to Almighty God for His many mercies , for the gift of thy life , and for the sparing of thy gallant son . " Again the crowd were shouting , but a different note in the shout . The kitchen went so quiet that I could hear the grease dropping from the chickens on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except the littler sounds of the new paint finding homes in the cracks , and the table getting comfortable on the new tiles , and the chair88 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYresting itself , and my breath coming slow and steady and making the bedclothes hiss .

That I have come home , thanks to God I have said a thousand thousand times , and for somebody else inside here . No more to be said . Come you , now , and have to eat . There is plenty . " Shout , then , shout . Mouth on mouth , open and shouting , that soon will be filled with food . There is patient is the mouth . In a moment the kitchen was full . All the girls ran round the back lane and through the back door , and processions came and went through the front , all taking out plates of bread and butter and pies and cakes and buckets and baths of hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and laughing and pushing and pretending to be stuck in the doorway . My mother came through the crowd with a big blackberry tart in one hand and my tea in the other , carrying them high and with care not to spill , keeping off the people with her elbows and eyes . " Now then , " she said , and put them into my hands , " wait you till I will have a cloth here . " " No i . : , tter , Mama , " I said . " I have been waiting long for this , not the cloth . " " If your Dada will see you eating without a cloth , " said my mother , " what will he say to me ? You are bringing up your son fit for a sty . Wait you , now . " But before she had turned her back , I was into that tart. 0 , blackberry tart , with berries as big as your thumb , purple and black , and thick with juice , and a crust to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and both passing down with such a taste that will make you close your eyes and wish you might live for ever in the wideness of that rich moment . Angharad came over with the cloth while my mother was pouring tea in her place , and Bronwen came to spoon my cup for me . There was no talking to be done for now the house was packed solid with people to see the new furniture and paint , and make a noise , and some to look at me and smile . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 89I was thankful that Bronwen was sitting by my pillow for she hid most of them . But those who had made up their minds to see me , poked in their heads and patted my feet . Strange it was to see tears in their eyes and to feel their sympathy , and yet to be able to say nothing to them in thanks . But the noise was beyond words , indeed . Cups and saucers and plates and knives and forks and spoons and boots and shoes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughing in soprano and contralto , and men were shouting and joking in tenor and in basso , but it was all stirred up as though someone was bent on making a cake out of sound and would have a good mixing for a start . Then it was that I heard Owen shouting out in the back . Almost then , everybody heard him , for a quiet fell , and people near the door were hushing others in the front who were still talking . " I will take no orders from you , " he was shouting , in anger . " Let me find you near my daughter again , " Marged 's father shouted back , " and I will thrash you till the end of your life , you wastrel . " " Leave me go to smash in his head , " Gwilym was shouting , as though hands were holding him . " Close your head , Gwil , " Davy said .

Mr. Evans , please to see my father before you say more . " " I will have my daughter from here , now , " said Mr. Evans , in anger . " I will run away from you , " Marged said , and tears were in plenty . " So now then for you , " mocked Gwilym , " you old fool , you .

" " Let us go now , " said my father , " and have a glass in health . Come , all of you . " Up went the talk again , and somebody started to sing .

" If he will listen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lark and the lamps were rising into yellow flowers and the women had work to do , bile the men went down the Hill to drink healths and sing on their own . Owen was not to be found that night. 90 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYThe crowd in the kitchen made way as my father and the Reverend Mr. Gruffydd moved out of the front room toward the crowd outside the back door . " Beth , " my father called , " what is it ? " " Come you , Gwilym , " my mother said , with relief , " there is an awful thing to happen indeed . I am ashamed of you , Owen . And as for you , young man , I shall never know why you were called after your father . Say you are sorry to Mr. Evans . " " No , Mama , " said Gwilym , stubborn as a pig of iron . " Wait you , " said my father . " Now then , what is the trouble , Mr. Evans ? " " Your son was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Evans . " Eh , dear , dear , " said the crowd to one another . " What were they doing ? " asked my father. " 0 , " said Mr. Evans , as though he had no wish to air the matter . " He was holding her about the waist . " " I was kissing her , " said Owen. " 0 , " said my father , as though that was the end of the matter . And I suppose he started to smile , and the crowd began to laugh . In a moment the whole house was shaking in laughter . But presentlyit drained off , and people in front began hushing again . " Glad I am , " my father was saying , " that it has ended like this . Iwill be very happy to have Marged in the family . " " There are none better , " said her father . " I am sorry , Gwilym , for causing this trouble . But I am strict about such things . " " Right , too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . " " I am not sorry for saying what I did , as he was then , " said Gwilym , " but if I said it as he is now , I would be very sorry indeed , Mr. Evans . " There was quiet for a moment . ' That is the best you will have from that quarter , " my father said , and again everybody started to laugh . " The tea is getting cold , " Bronwen called . " Come you , now , quick . " Bronwen took my cup from me and pinched the crumbs of tart from beneath my chin . Chapter EightI T was many days before Bronwen had chance to speak to Owen because now she was not in our house such a lot , for my mother was having her way about things , and she took care , now that she was downstairs , to see that they were done . Bronwen used to come in at night when Ivor had finished supper , and sit with me to hear my lessons , ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angharad with the food boxes for the men next day . One night , my mother went down to a prayer-meeting with my father , the first she had been to since she was ill , so they were giving her a special meeting and everybody was going . All except Owen , who was hard at work on his invention . He had been very quiet , lately . Several times he had missed his meals , and although my father had said not to worry , I knew that my mother was unhappy about him . But she always was if any of us ever missed having a meal , for it was a certain sign , she said , of sickness in us . Not only my mother was unhappy , but Marged , too . I saw it clearly though she tried not to show it . Often she stood looking through the window toward the shed where Owen was working , and tears were in her eyes for so long that I would start to count the beats before they fell . Then she would shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she were bitten through with cold , and turn to run out in the wash-house , with her hand to her mouth , and the door coming to shut quietly behind her . When my mother had gone with my father , and the house was still , Bronwen came in through the back and took off her cloak as though she had work to do . " Is Marged here ? " she asked me. 92HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 93 " No , Bron , " I said . " Gone with Mama and Dada and the others , she has . " " Good , " she said , and opened the door . " Wait you . I am having a talk to Owen for a minute . " " Good , " I said , and back to my books as she closed the door . I was learning Euclid at the time . Even till now I have enjoyed his theorems . So simple they are , and so wise , and good for the training of the mind . I shall always remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for it was while I was trying to thread lead in the compass that Marged threw open the door , and stood with the wind blowing her cloak against her , staring at me as though she could kill . " Who is with Owen ? " she was whispering , and not blinking . " Bronwen is , " I said . " I will have a knife in her , " she said , and pulled the buttons from her cloak as she threw it from her . " Only talking they are , " I said . " Talking ? " Marged said , in a high voice , as though we should be laughing . " For weeks he has treated me like a ghost . Only talking ? Now I know . " " What , then ? " I asked her , for I was so surprised at her , acting as she was , with her hair all ends against her face , and her eyes staring and froth at her mouth . " Shut up , " she said . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face the shed and lifted her chest to have a deep breath . " Owen , " she shouted , " Bronwen Morgan . Come you out from by there . " She had no need to shout twice . The shed door opened before she had finished and Bronwen came running to her , catching her by the shoulders and pushing her in the kitchen . Owen came in behind and closed the door , standing with his back to it , looking drawn knives at Marged , who was in the lamp shadow , pressed against the wall , facing Bronwen . " There is silly you are , girl , " Bronwen said , looking from Marged to Owen and across at me . L94 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " Not silly I am , now , " Marged said , as though the life had gone from her . " I have watched you these weeks looking at him . " " Hush , girl , " Bronwen said . " You know well there was a better ' reason than the one you thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he was throwing bones to a dog . " Wait now , Owen , " Bronwen said , " there is a child in the room . " " Not much misses him , " Owen said . " Tell her why you cameout there . " " I went to ask Owen why he was so cruel to you , " Bronwen said to Marged . " Tell her what I told you , " Owen said , in the same voice , worse because it was so deep . " Take her outside and tell her yourself , " said Bronwen . " Am I going to be treated like an old bit of rag between you ? " Marged asked . " Pull you , now . Settle it . " " Tell her , Bron , " said Owen . " He said he is not in love with you after everybody had a hand in the courting , " Bronwen said . " After you had finished with him , he meant , " said Marged . " Shut up , and behave yourself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women at the pits . " " You made me , " said Marged . " Owen , was it my fault my fathercalled us in front of them all ? It was you who wanted to kiss . I hadthe teapots to fill and I told you to stop but you only kissed me more . " " Take her outside , Owen , " Bronwen said , looking at me . " No use , " Owen said . " My mind is hard . " " Harden not your hearts , " I said , and had a mind to fly under thebedclothes , quick . But not one of them moved , so I stayed as I was . The three of them looked at each other , Bronwen and Owen atMarged , and Marged at Owen . " Owen , " Bronwen pleaded . But Owen was still . The clock rocked away , seeming to get louder at every stroke , as though it were rowing Time toward us , until I was wondering why it was never heard at other , ordinary times . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen , the minds of men reach out for someHOWGREEN WAS MY VALLEY 95thing ordinary to think about , to try and take the hurt out of the matter , using ordinary little sounds , perhaps the tick of the clock , as a buffer for their mental engines . Marged put down her head and started to cry so hard that when she sobbed , her head bounced up and back to her breast . Her neck at the back was so white it was a lovely surprise . Bronwen looked again at Owen , but Owen looked at the blue tiles that ran round by the table legs . " Right , " she said , as though that was the end of it for one night . " Come you , Marged , my girl . Let us have a cup of tea at my house . " Marged went without a word , and Owen came from the door as they passed out . He stood looking at a cut on his hand for a minute . " Huw , " he said , without looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep this to yourself . " " No , " I said , " but it was pity she should cry like that . There is white is her neck with her . " " Be quiet now , " Owen said , and went to the fire . I could still hear Bronwen talking to Marged out in the back . " How did you come from Hebron , Owen ? " I asked him . " Where , boy ? " Owen said . " Hebron , " I said , looking in my books , " where you met Marged . There is beautiful she must have looked in her jewels and gold . " " Hush , boy , " Owen said . " Long time you did wait , too , " I said . " Five thousand years . I counted five thousand bricks outside here . That was long enough . Indeed , I had my eyes crossed , looking at them . " Owen was looking up at the ceiling . " You can spend your time better than that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too . Good night now . " " Good night , " I said , watching him go to the door . " Tell Bron , I am waiting to do my lessons . " Out he went , quick , and the door shut to wave the house . But Bronwen never came . My mother sent Angharad down to fetch Marged when she came hack from the meeting . But Marged had left hours before , when96 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYMorris the Butcher had come up to ask Bronwen to sit with his wife , / who was waiting , then , for her third boy . All night they searched for Marged , up on the mountain and down by the river , and at last , early in the morning , when the men were going to work , they found out from Ellis the Post that she had met some people going from the meeting the night before who were drivinginto the next valley , and she had gone with them . There is angry were my father and mother . But not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard nothing of it because they met in Bronwen 's house . But when they came home my father was so angry he would eat no supper . So nobody had any , and I had mine after the others had gone to bed . So Gwilym married Marged . They were the same age and Gwilym had always been in love with her , I suppose because Owen was , in the first place . Owen was away from home when the wedding happened , and only my mother and Angharad went . Bronwen was tied to the house because of Gareth at the time , and my father refused to meet Mr. Evans on any excuse at all . Gwilym took Marged to live over in the new houses in the other valley , furnished with money out of the box . Our box . Old Evans gave them nothing , not even a cup and saucer or a bit of fat for the pan . But when he died a couple of years after , he left over three hundred pounds to the Chapel . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had been friends , but something must have altered Evans , or else my father was having more sense . Owen stayed away a long time after that . He was working on his patent models at the steel works , where they were giving him tools to make his invention . He went one night when I was asleep . So the house was nearly empty of boys , except Davy and me , and Davy was away so often that he was almost a stranger when he came home . The Union was climbing . I knew , because I was writing his letters when he was home , and I often read his letters to his friends . who could not read for themselves . He was trying at that time to join withHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 97the men on the Railways , but he had so many enemies among them , and so strong were the companies , that he was unable to make much progress , hard as he tried . But I was making progress , with the help of the Reverend Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes for a minute in the early morning , or at night , and sometimes , but few and far , in the afternoons for an hour at a time . He was a hard-working man , with a conscience that would not allow him to rest idle . Day in and day out , he was over the mountain to see people and ask them why they were not at Chapel , or to sit with the sick , or to talk to old people who could not walk the miles across the gorse on a Sunday to come and pray . From him I learnt our history . Caradog , Cadwaladr , Lud , Coel , Boadicea , all the princely , shining host passed into my keeping and from me to little Gareth , who was old enough now to understand all that was said to him . I saw in his eyes the light that Mr. Gruffydd must often have seen in mine . " Men who are born to dig coal , " Mr. Gruffydd said to me , " need strength and courage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the mole or the blind worm . Keep up your spirit , l luw , for that is the heritage of a thousand generations of the great ones of the Earth . As your father cleans his lamp to have good light , so keep clean your spirit . " " And how shall it be kept clean , Mr. Gruffydd ? " I asked him . " By prayer , my son , " he said , " not mumbling , or shouting , or wallowing like a hog in religious sentiments . Prayer is only another name for good , clean , direct thinking . When you pray , think well what you are saying , and make your thoughts into things that are solid . In that manner , your prayer will have strength , and that strength shall become part of you , mind , body and spirit . Do you still want to see the first daffodil out up on the mountain , my son ? " " Indeed , I do , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said . " Pray , my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year was quiet with us because Davy and Owen were away , and Gwilym had taken Marged over to see her parents . Angharad had gone to the farm where Ceridwen was working tog8 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY take our Christmas presents , and Ivor took Bronwen and Gareth over the mountain to see her father and mother . So it was an empty house , until Mr. Gruffydd brought some people up for a night of singing on Boxing Day . So big was the harp in the kitchen that the harpist had to sit in the doorway so that all might come to have warmth of the fire . Besides my father and mother and mc , there was Mr. Gruffydd and the harpist , Miss Jenkins from over the mountain , Mrs. Tom Jenkins and her two little girls , growing fast now , Morris the Butcher and his wife , Mr. Christmas Evans the Col- liery , Dr. Richards and his wife and daughter , Mr. Bowen ap Rhys , the cashier , Mr. Owen Madog from the new railways , and a couple of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were sucking their oranges in a way that was making my mother to look at them sideways and bite her lips . People heard the singing , and , of course , everybody knew Mr. Gruffydd was in our house , so very soon the front and back of the house was thick fast with people all standing and listening , and any of them who knew my father , even by sight , were trying the old trick of putting their heads in at the door to wish us all well , in the hopes of being asked to come in . But there was soon no room , and as for the air , indeed , you could have stood things on it without them falling down , and for me in the wall bed it was so hot as being in the oven with the geese . But the fingers of Miss Jenkins on the strings of the harp took all feeling from us , excepting the joy of song and the desire to sing . Songs and part-songs , cantatas , arias and dance melodies , hymns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . Now the men singing , now the women . My mother started cradle songs she had taught us years before , and taught the strangers , and the strangers sang their songs and taught us . Then Mr. Evans danced a couple of songs he had learnt from a gypsy , tapping . He had a voice like a little crake with him , and so funny it sounded against the basso of my father that I was bound to push my fist in my mouth not to be rude . In betweensongs , plenty of home-brewed beer , and bottles , and wine for the women , or tea in abundance . And if the songs made them hungry , the table was heavy with every mortal thing that can be made by women who are anxious to please the stomachs of their guests , and their own vanity . Nothing pleased my mother more than to be told how good were her dishes . Perhaps vanity is not the right word , for it pleased her to know that she was a good cook and that people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours in cookingand making new dishes , so she deserved the praise . I had just finished a song when Elias the Shop pushed his way through the crush at the back door and stood pressed in with his face and one shoulder showing , looking at us all as though we were all ripe to be swept into the Pit , and he was ready with the broom . " Gwilym Morgan , " he shouted , above the clapping for me , " you should think shame to be acting like this on such a night . As for you , Mr. Gruffydd , your conduct is fit for a meeting of the deacons . I am surprised and deeply hurt to think that such a man has been teaching my children in Sunday School . Shame upon you . Upon all of you . " " Give Mr. Elias a pint of home-brewed , Beth , " my father said , and put the pipe back in his mouth . " If I will reach it , " said my mother , " I will give him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " Elias said to my mother , " so soon delivered from the jaws of death to repay your Maker by fouling I Iis holy day . " " Strike the note , Miss Jenkins , my dear , " said my father , and everybody looked uncomfortable . " Let us have Comrades in Arms again . " " A moment , Mr. Morgan , " said Mr. Gruffydd , looking at Elias . " What is your object in making this outburst , sir ? " " It does not concern you , " Elias said , " till you will meet the deacons . " " There are eight deacons present , " said my father . " Shall we have a session now , then ? " " Shame on you , " Elias shouted , and struggling to come more to the front , but the crowd leaned against one another to hold him tighter . " Profaners of the holy days , what next will you do in your iniquity ? " " Well , " said my father , " if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leg of that goose if Beth will pass the plate . " too HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYMr . Gruffydd got up while we were all laughing , and went as close to Mr. Elias as the crowd would allow , looking not at him , but into him . Fine eyes had Mr. Gruffydd , and bright , sharp points to them like the needles poking from my mother 's apron front . " Mr. E ; as , " he said , " I am very sorry if you have been hurt in your good conscience , by any conduct of mine , which you may have judged to be out of keeping with the time . But you must not forget that the Man Himself attended at Cana , and also provided the best wine . What do you find wrong in this meeting ? " Mr. Gruffydd 's quiet voice , so filling in the close space , sent everybodyso still and soundless that I could hear the water coming from the stream above the garden . " If you do not know , " Elias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not , " it is not my place to tell you . This is a holy day . That is enough . " " It is far from enough , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " You have forced your way into this house and you have been abusive , and you have chosen to take your authority from the Bible . There are too many of your sort walking the earth . Now go , before I take you by the neck and throw you . I will have a word with you in Chapel , sir . " How could we have known , then , that what happened that night , so small , so foolish , would be the cause of misery to us all . Elias never forgot that night . But his revenge was the sweeter when he had chance to have it . Sweet it was , and greatly he relished it , and every morsel of it he took . But even of him I can think of with sorrow , now at this moment . Those times , those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters and their shop , have gone . How can there be fury felt for things that are gone to dust . Chapter NineI I ERE in this quiet house I sit thinking back the structure of my life , building again that which has fallen . It do seem to me that the life of man is merely a pattern scrawled on Time , with little thought , little care , and no sense of design . Why is it , I wonder , that people suffer , when there is so little need , when an effort of will and some hard work would bring them from their misery into peace and contentment . The slag heap is moving again . I can hear it whispering to itself , and as it whispers , the walls of this brave little house are girding themselves to withstand the assault . For months , more than I ever thought it would have the courage to withstand , that great mound has borne down upon these walls , this roof . And for those months the great bully has been beaten , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were craftsmen . Stout beams , honest blocks , good work , and love for the job , all that is in this house . But the slag heap moves , pressing on , down and down , over and all round this house which was my father 's and my mother 's and now is mine . Soon , perhaps in an hour , the house will be buried , and the slag heap will stretch from the top of the mountain right down to the river in the Valley . Poor river , how beautiful you were , how gay your song , how clear your green waters , how you enjoyed your play among the sleepy rocks . I shall always remember the day I saw you after I had been in bed so long . That morning Mr. Gruffydd came to the house early and opened the door of the kitchen so that the sun shone in all round him . Big he looked , and full of happy purpose . " Good morning , Mrs. Morgan , " he said . " Good morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprise . " There is good to see you . " tot102 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " I have come for Huw , " he said , as though he was asking to take a loaf for old Mrs. Llywarch . " Huw ? " my mother asked , and looked over the table at me with her eyebrows almost touching this little blue cloth . " Yes , " said Mr. Gruffydd , " this is the morning he has been waiting for . " I jI looked at Mr. Gruffydd and knew . But my mother was still in fog with her . " The daffodils are out , Mama , " I said . " Oh , Huw , " my mother said , and put down the bread knife , and turned her head away . " Where are your clothes , Huw ? " he asked me , but quiet , and look- , ing at my mother 's back . " Under my pillow , sir , " I said . " Your pillow ? " he said . " For these months , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come you , then , " he said , and smiling he was . " You shall bring back a posy fit for a queen for your brave mother , is it ? " " Indeed I will , " I said , and back I pulled the pillow , and out came my clothes that I had made ready ever since I had put my mind to the matter . Pain there was , and a helpless feeling in all my bones , but I was determined to have those clothes on . On they went , and no nonsense , though the stockings were big and the trews too short , but I had grown and got thin , so it was no use to grumble . There is a sight I must have looked when I put my legs out and stood up . But neither Mr. Gruffydd nor my mother looked at me , so I was spared to blush and very thankful . " Up on my back , Huw , " Mr. Gruffydd said , and bent his knees so that I could put my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked I was to find myself up on the shoulders of a minister . It seemed wrong to be so familiar . But there I was , and carried to the door . " Ile will be back in two hours , Mrs. Morgan , my little one , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " God bless you , " my mother said , and still not looking . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 103 " Good-bye , our 1 , lam , " I said , with my legs falling about at the back . " Get ready the big pot for the daffodils . I will have an armful for you , and some for Bron . " Outside , then , and through the blessed curtains of air , spun with morning mist and sunshine , blown upon us by wind from the southeastand the draughts that played in the Valley . " Are you right , Huw ? " Mr. Gruffydd asked me . " Am I too quick ? " " No indeed , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said . " Go , you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the road , and up by there are the daffodils . Tight , now . " For the first few minutes I was shutting my eyes to get used to the sunshine , so raw and pure and shining white . Then I got used to it and less tears came and I was able to see without screwing up my eyes and having to blink . The first thing I saw was the slag heap . Big it had grown , and long , and black , without life or sign , lying along the bottom of the Valley on both sides of the river . The green grass , and the reeds and the flowers , all had gone , crushed beneath it . And every minute the burden grew , as cage after cage screeched along the cables from the pit , bumped to a stop at the tipping pier , and emptied dusty loads on to the ridged , black , dirty back . On our side of the Valley the heap reached to the front garden walls of the bottom row of houses , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , screaming and shouting , laughing in fun . On the other side of the river the chimney-pots of the first row of houses could only just be seen above the sharp curving back of the far heap , and all the time I was watching , the cable screeched and the cages tipped . From the Britannia pit came a call on the hooter as the cages came up , as though to remind the Valley to be ready for more filth as the work went on and on , year in and year out . " Is the pit allowed to do this to us , Mr. Gruffydd ? " I asked him . " Do what , my son ? " Mr. Gruffydd asked . " Put slag by here , " I said . " Nowhere else to put it , my son , " he said . " Look up by there at1 04 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY the top of the mountain , by the Glas Fryn . There are the daffodils , see . " And indeed , there they were , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , and the yellow blooms belling in the wind , up by the Glas Fryn and all along the Valley , as far as 1 could turn my head to see . Gold may be found again , and men may know its madness again , but no one shall know how I felt to see the goldness of daffodils grow- ing up there that morning . The Glas Fryn was the nearest place to our house where they grew . It was later that I pulled bulbs to grow in our garden , but the garden was so small and the earth so blind with dust from the slag that they gave up trying and died . But that morning Mr. Gruffydd put me down among them all , close to them , where I could take them in my hands to breathe the cool breath of them and give thanks to God . Below us , the river ran sweet as ever , happy in the sun , but as soon as it met the darkness between the sloping walls of slag it seemed to take fright and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And on the other side it came forth grey , and began to hurry again , as though anxious to get away . But its banks were stained , and the reeds and grasses that dressed it were hanging , and black , and sickly , ashamed of their dirtiness , ready to die of shame , they seemed , and of sorrow for their dear friend , the river . " Will the salmon come up this year , Mr. Gruffydd ? " I asked him , He was quiet a moment , feeling for his pipe . " I am told , " he said , " that no salmon have been seen these two years . " " And no trout either , then ? " I said . " I am afraid not , Huw , " he said . " They can not face that black stretch , there . " " Good , " I said . " No one shall tell me again that fish have got no sense with them . Pity , I do think , that more of us are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Huw , " he said . " Two hours I said to your Mama . She will be waiting . " There is pity that we can not dig all round the growing flowers andtake earth and all with us . It is hurting to have to break the stems of blossoms and see them lose their rich white blood only for the pleasure of putting them in a pot of water . Still , I had promised , and there it was . So break them I did , an armful of them , and up on Mr. Gruffydd 's back , and off home , down the mountain . There is pleased were the people to see me , indeed . Every door was open , and as we passed , the women ran out to wave to me and wish me well . Up at our house , my mother was waiting with Bronwen and Angharadin the doorway .

" Good , " said Mr. Gruffydd , and my mother was making noises under her breath . " There is hungry I am , " I said . " Wait you , " said my mother . " You shall have a breakfast like your father now this minute . Cup of tea for Mr. Gruffydd , Angharad . You are standing there fast to the floor , girl . " Bronwen came in with the daffodils in the pots and beautiful she looked with the gold shining into her face . " Soon you shall take little Gareth for walks , is it , Huw ?

" Mr. Gruffydd asked me . " Why not to school and college , then university and then a doctor or a lawyer ? " " Yes , " said my mother . " Indeed that is beautiful . Dr. Huw Morgan , and your own house and a lovely horse and trap . With a good black suit and a shirt with starch . Oh , there is good , Huw , my little one . There is proud would I be .

" Say what is in your mind , Mrs. Morgan , " he said , and smiling he was .

If Dr. Richards is an old fool , does it mean that you can not go to school and do better ? Have sense , boy . You are not old enough to talk .

To-morrow morning , Huw . " " Yes , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said , " and thank you . " " God bless you , my son , " he said , and smiled at my mother and went . Chapter TenWELL , I disgraced myself for ever that Sunday I sang the solo , and I have never been sorry . Every night of that week , as soon as my father was back from the pit and bathed and a good supper inside him , he brought out the tuning-fork and practised with me . " Now Thank We All Our God , " I sang , and before the first verse was over my father was in tears with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I meant it , not because it was to be sung . Be without your legs for more than two years and then stand upright to walk the earth again , and you will find your heart bleeding thanks with every step you take . On Sunday morning everybody was up early . When I looked out of the window while my father was lighting the fire , I saw all the chimneys start rolling smoke almost together , as though all had risen early to have a good seat . We had cold breakfast as usual , but my mother boiled me an egg in the water made hot for little Gareth 's bath and excused her conscienceby having a glass of cold water instead of her tea . Down to the Chapel , then . I went first with Angharad . Ceridwen , home for Sunday from the farm , with Gwilym , behind us , then Bronwen and Ivor , and then my father and mother . And every door opening as we passed down , and men coming out in their best , and smiling and greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tall hats like my mother 's , and some with bonnets , like Bronwen 's and Angharad 's . On the way down we passed other families like ours , but ours was one of the smallest . But if all the boys had been home , it would have been another tale . Mr. Gruffydd was waiting outside the Chapel , shaking hands with all who went inside . He lifted me up and gave my sticks to my father. 107 " Up in the choir , you , " he said to me . " Are you in good voice wit you ? " " Splendid , " said my father . " The tuning-fork has been useless a the week . " " Good , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " Something good for God this morn ing , then . " The Chapel was bigger than I had thought it , so used I was to ou kitchen . White , and built solid , with a varnished wood gallery roun , the top , and a scrubbed floor you could have your meals from . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high above the heads c the people , and below it a platform for the deacons and head mer To the right and left , four rows of seats , each raised higher than th one in front , for the choir , women on the left , men on the right . An , a smell of best clothes , and polish , and inside old hymn books every where from top to bottom . But I was put on the platform next to Dr. Richards , and there i shy and funny I did feel with all the people looking at me and smilin , and whispering to one another . I thought it was my thin legs the were laughing at , and tried to put them round the chair legs , but was so weak in my grip that I almost fell out and head first on th floor . " Sit straight and put your feet flat , " Dr. Richards whispered t me , " or you will split your head on the floor . Once more like tha and I will tie you with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after that a prayer from Mr. Gruffydc More hymns , and everybody singing strong and deep and marvellou on the beat , with the last two words of each verse falling upon us fror the roof , and the pauses for breath filled in by the sounding glory c the tone just flown . Then Mr. Gruffydd leaned over to look down at me , and I stoop while Mrs. Tom Harries played the opening . There is a fright you will have to stand up before lines of face that have become wet and shaky through the nervous water in you ayes . Your mouth is dry , with sand on the tongue and in the throa so that your breath comes hot and sore with you . Then it is time t sing and you have forgotten the words . Each one has grown a whetand rolls away from you down into the pit of Forgot . You reach out for the welcome feel of words well remembered . If you could think of the first word , all the others will hurry to form behind it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind , and you can put them to the tune and sing . But the first word hides behind the bonnet of Mrs. Phillips the Glas Fryn , and although you are ready to go on your bended knees to have it safe in your mouth , that big feather hides it too well . Three times Mrs. Tom Harries struck the notes ; and then I opened my mouth to show them I was willing , and as though they had taken pity , back came the words and I threw my voice up to the back row of the gallery into the laps of the Prossers , who were bending double because the roof came down almost to the floor . After Mr. Gruffydd gave his sermon , and then the collection , then another hymn and the blessing , and then we should have gone home . But after the blessing , hardly anybody moved except young women and some of the unmarried elder women . My sisters and Bronwen went , and so did my mother , but all round me on the platform , deacons and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richards lifted me down to be ready for my father to help me outside , but before he could reach me , Mr. Parry the Colliery was on his feet and addressing the people , so I had to sit still and my father stayed where he was . I thought it was the usual Chapel notices , but since they never troubled me , I spent a few minutes multiplying the number of the first hymn by the second and dividing by the third , an old game my brothers used to have with sixpence from my father for the quickest right answer , and fines for mistakes and slowness . But then Mr. Parry turned his eyes so sternly and his voice was so sharp that the figures jerked from my head and I thought he was after me , but instead , I heard a girl crying behind mc and then she passed by , and went up the steps to the platform . A girl from the pits she was . Tidy in her dress , not good , but very tidy , and a good little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and risen with weeping that I could have gone to her straight to give her comforti10 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " Adulteress , " Mr. Parry shouted , and all the men , young as well as old , nodded and said " Ha " or " Hmm " and some of them shook their heads and wrinkled their eyes and foreheads as though a shockinghurt had been done to them . The priests and the scribes and the pharisees were in session , and bitterly enjoying themselves . " Your lusts have found you out , " shouted Mr. Parry , and thump went his fist on the handrail , " and you have paid the price of all women like you . Your body was the trap of the Devil and you allowedtemptation to visit you . Now you bring an illegitimate child into the world against the commandment of God . Thou shalt not commit adultery . Prayer is wasted on your sort and you are not fit to enter the House of God . You shall be cast forth into the outer darkness until you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the sins of the fathers shall be visited upon the children unto the third and fourth generation . Meillyn Lewis , do you admit your sin ? " Meillyn Lewis coughed terror into a sopping rag and made noises to say Yes , She Did . " Do you wish to make your peace with the Eternal Father ? " Mr. Parry asked her . Yes , Meillyn Lewis wished to make peace of any sort with anybody , even the Devil himself in a stink of sulphur , only to be out of that Chapel and running up the mountain away from those nodding heads and Ha 's and Hmm 's and the eyes of Mr. Parry and his voice . " But before you make your peace you shall suffer punishment , " Mr. Parry said , dropping his voice down into the flower-pots , for at that level it did sound like the Last Trump , and indeed Mr. Parry knew it . " Oh , there is sorry I am . " Meillyn Lewis bled into the rag . " Have pity . I will never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Name of God in vain , " Mr. Parry said , two tones up in surprise . " Be quiet , girl , and listen to your betters . You shall have nothing from the Father , and we are here to see to it . " That is when I disgraced myself . I can think of nothing that caused me to jump up and shout back at Mr. Parry . All I had learned was against such a thing , especiallyHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY IIIin Chapel , and my mother would have died to think of it . But such anger took me in the throat that the very air before me went red with it and I could hear my good heart doing its work double strong inside me to pump blood and give strength . " Thou hypocrite , " I shouted up at him , and indeed surprised at my high voice . " First cast out the beam out of thine own eye and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of thy brother 's eye . But woe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ye shut up the Kingdom of Heaven against men , for ye neither go in yourselves , neither suffer ye them that are entering to go in . Woe unto you , Scribes and Pharisees , hypocrites , for ye arc like unto whited sepulchres , which indeed appear beautiful outward , but are within full of dead men 's bones , and of all uncleanness . Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men , but within ye are full of hy pocrisyand iniquity . Ye serpents , ye generation of vipers , how can ye escape the damnation of Hell ? Behold your house is left unto you desolate . " If you could see the face of Mr. Parry . Then I was sorry . Quickly , before Mr. Parry could close his mouth or shut his staring eyes , before Mr. Gruffydd moved , before I heard my father coming , I was sorry . For Mr. Parry was a good man , none better . He paid his men better than most , and gave plenty away to those who needed it , besides paying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So like that , I was sorry , and my voice cracked in half and fell to pieces and the bits went to breath . Then Mr. Parry shut his mouth with a sound you could hear , and Mr. Gruffydd came down from the pulpit very slowly , while the dead cons and head men looked at each other and at Mr. Parry , and Mr. Parry stared at me , and my father ran up behind me and took me by the shoulder . " You rascal , " he said , " you rascal . You would dare do such a thing . " " Leave it now , Mr. Morgan , " said Mr. Gruffydd , and very gently . " Take the boy home and let nothing be said . There is no need to bring him to Chapel to-night , and this afternoon , take him up onII2 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYthe mountain . Huw , " he said to me , without feeling , " I will see you to-morrow morning . " " Yes , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we went out in the pale , cool , sunny silence , but feeling the heat of the thoughts of those who sat so still . Not one head turned as we passed . The people who had heard in the lobby looked at me and made a serious face at my father , and their lips moved to greet him but they said no words . It seemed that even speech was at an end , so great was my disgrace . " Did I do wrong , Dada ? " I asked my father , when we were a bit up the street . " Wrong , my son ? " he said , and stopped to look at me with surprise . " Wrong ? For a bit of a boy to say such things to Mr. Parry ? I am so ashamed I could dig a pit for myself and you , too . " " But they were cruel to Meillyn Lewis , " I said . " That is one thing , " said my father , " and the business of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But you are a deacon , " I said , " and every bit as much as Mr. Parry . But you were not sitting in the big seat ? And why not ? " " Shut your mouth , and home to your dinner , my son , " said my father with weariness . " Eh , dear , what a nest of scorpions came from that back room there . Not one of you with thought for others . Always ready with the tongue . What will become of you is beyond me to tell . " Up the Hill we went in quiet , and although curtains moved in windows , and I knew faces were looking out from the shadows in the open doorways , nobody came out , and nobody was in the street . Even the birds kept away from me , it seemed , and the sun was hot to make the quiet quieter . So we went into our house and my father went into the kitchen to talk with my mother , and closed the door . Angharad looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fearful light in her eyes , and with much wagging of the head . " Wait you till Mama hears , " she whispered . " Who told you ? " I asked her . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 113 " Mrs. Prosser told Bron , " Angharad said , " and I was there . " " What did Bron say ? " I asked her . " She sent me out of the house , " Angharad said . " And why should she ? I heard the worst , anyhow . " I sat down and felt a river of fright rushing through my stomach . I wondered what would be done to me . I had thoughts of the policemancoming from over the mountain to take me down to the jail . My father 's voice was deep from the kitchen , then it was quiet . My mother came in to get plates from the cupboard . There was more pink in her face than usual , and I thought for a moment she was too angry to speak . But in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me and a smile was on her mouth and tears were in her eyes . Her skirts made circles with hurry as she ran to me and knelt with her arms about me , almost lifting me from the chair . " Good , " she said . " Good , my little one . Your Mama is so glad , she could scream . " My father came in and stood to put his hands in his pockets , helplessas helpless . " Well , Beth , " he said , as though the air was going out of the world , " you are as bad as he is , girl . " " Yes , Gwilym Morgan , " my mother said , up on her feet and going to the plates , " and you are as bad as that pack down by there . " " There is a nice thing to say , " said my father . " No wonder . Now I know . " " What , now ? " asked my mother , stepping by him , both looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why I have got such a tribe of sons , " said my father . " It is you . That is the trouble . Beth Morgan is the cause . " My mother looked at him and he looked back at my mother . And Mama smiled . " Go and scratch , " she said , and went quickly to the Kitchen . My father clucked his tongue and looked across at me , and the laugh in his eyes ran down the cuts in his checks and poured in his mouth . " There is a family , we are , " he said . " Come and wash , my son , and let us eat . " Chapter ElevenWHEN we were almost on top of the mountain that Sunday afternoon my father stopped to fill his pipe while he was having back his breath and looked down into the Valley . " You see , my son , " he said , " you can not say what you like . There are things to be done , and things not to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judges are those who have lived longest , and thought most . " " Yes , Dada , " I said . " Yes , " he said . " I am not liking the sound of that , at all . What you mean is no , Dada , is it ? " " Yes , Dada , " I said . " Say your mind , boy , " my father said , with anger . " Always say your mind to me . How will I help you if you speak lies ? " " But , Dada , " I said , " you called me a rascal when I said my mind this morning . " " Yes , " said my father , " but that was another story . Then , you were speaking of things outside you . You had no business to speak this morning . If your legs were right with you , you would have gone home with your mother and Angharad . " " Then poor Meillyn Lewis would have had all that and worse , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Meillyn Lewis is a bad girl , " said my father , and pulling on his pipe . " Because she had a baby ? " I asked him . " Be quiet , now , " said my father , " you are talking of things you know nothing about . " " Yes , I do , Dada , " I said . " Meillyn Lewis went up on the mountainwith young Chris Phillips , and now he lets her be spoken to in Chapel like that . " " Ilow do you know ? " my father said. 114HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 115 ' " How many times have they passed our window ? " I said . " And how many times have the women said there would be trouble before long if he saved his money , instead of buying a ring and the furni-ture . " " Well , indeed , " my father said , " you are an old mother 's meeting on your own . I will have you out of that kitchen in future . Your ears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning is the first time I have opened my mouth , " I said . " I have hopes it will be the last , " said my father . " One more set-to like that and we will be thrown out of the Valley . " " Why , now ? " I asked him . " Because , my son , " he said , and earnest indeed , " it is not fit and right for a boy like you to make remarks . We have never had trouble in the Valley because we have always been strict . Men have thought twice before doing a wrong . The same with women . If all the women like Meillyn Lewis were allowed to go their own way , what would happen to us ? " " What ? " I asked . " You would have a police station in the Valley , for a start , " said my father , " there is a nice thing for you . As though we were all a lot of jail-birds waiting to be taken off . And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you like Angharad to have the same as Meillyn Lewis ? " " Oh , Dada , " I said . " Not Angharad . She never goes up the mountain . " " Gracious God , " said my father , and dropped his pipe . " There is a boy you are , man . I never meant to talk about Angharad . Only saying if , ' I was . And if I caught her I would strangle her . " " Would you , Dada ? " I asked him . " Yes , indeed I would , " he said , and he was meaning it . " Let all things be done in order , with right and decency . Those things are worth a man 's life or two . Life without would be a hell , indeed . Meillyn Lewis was an example . I will swear that what happened this morning will make many a girl think twice before she makes a slut of herself . " 1 16 HOWL ' GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " She is a slut , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mountain with a man , instead of to her bed with her husband . Is it , Dada ? " My father was quiet for a little , with his back to me , looking down into the Valley . Bright shone the sun , but brighter shone the Valley 's green , for each blade of grass gave back the light and made the meadows full of golds and greens , and yellows and pinks and blues were poking from the hedges where the flowers were hard at work for the bees . May and almond were coming , and further down , early apple was doing splendid in four tidy rows behind Meirddyn Jones ' farm . His herd of black cows were all down in the river up to their bellies in the cool quiet water , with their tails making white splashes as they dropped after slapping flies , and up nearer to us , sheep were busy with their noses at the sweet green . When the wind took breath you could hear the crunching of their jaws . Beautiful was the Valley this afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then you saw the two slag heaps . " Yes , " my father said . " That is why she is a slut . " " Then what is Chris Phillips , then ? " I asked . " He did very wrong , " said my father , but there was no body in his voice . " Mr. Gruffydd will have a word with him . " " But not in front of all the people , " I said . " If Meillyn Lewis is a slut , Chris Phillips is a coward . And I know which of them is the worst . " " Tongue again , " said my father . " Leave it , now . And say no more on the matter . You are not old enough and you have said too much as it is . More sums and books , and less tongue . Let us go back for a cup of tea . " Flalf the women on the Hill had been in to see my mother while we were out , so my mother said when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to say how sorry they were , and they had all gone away with the same answer . " Nothing to be sorry about , I told them , " my mother said , while she was cutting bread and butter , with the knife flashing red in the firelight , and the kettle having a little whistle on the hob . " And nothing to be done . " HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 117 " Was that all you said ? " asked my father , looking up at the lamp . " Well , " said my mother , " I said that , and other things , of course . " " Good , " said my father . " I will hear them later . But now , the matter is ended . He can go into Bron 's to-night and do his lessonswhile we are at Chapel . " " I am going to no Chapel to-night , " said my mother , and put the dripping down flat on the table to make the cups jump . " Are you starting , now then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Chapel , Beth , for both of us to-night . And no nonsense . Never mind about the people and what they say . It is the home of the Word of God . Chapel for us both to-night . " " Yes , Gwilym , " said my mother . Next morning I was waiting for Mr. Gruffydd long before he came , for I wanted to know what he would say . I had slept nothing all night , making ghosts for myself , filling my mind with them and giving myself pale frights . All the ghosts had a different punishment for me , some of them shocking , indeed . Foolish is the mind of man to make bogeys for itself and to live in terrors of fear for things which lack the substance of truth . But Mr. Gruffydd called as though nothing had happened . Indeed , the only sign that something was wrong was made by my mother . She was shaking so much that she had to put clown the pot , and Angharad poured Mr. Gruffydd 's tea for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for I was stronger and using only one stick , now . So to the top we went , where we could see the Valleys all covered with pale blue mists , and with long rolling grey shapes and deeper blues where the mountains rose up to guard them . Cold it was , and wonderful the song of the north-cast wind . " Now , Huw , " said Mr. Gruffydd , " good lungfuls , now . Breathe deep , and count five slowly before you are full . Then count five full up . And then five to breathe out . Is it ? " " Yes , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said . " Good , " he said. 1i8 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYSo we breathed , both of us up on top of the mountain , while the mists went to purple and rose , and the sun burnt through and covered us both with warmth and came out across the Valley in such strength that we could not bear to look . So it may be , I think , when we meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorts to Mr. Gruffydd 's hair , and his nose had grown a gem that glistened to fix your eyes , making you count how many before it would fall . But he took out his handkerchief for a good blow , and then I knew he was going to speak . Big in the shoulder was Mr. Gruffydd , and in his black clothes a figure to make you afraid . But I never felt any fear of him , though I was always afraid of losing his goodwill , and having the sharp side of his tongue . " Huw , " he said , " let us sit by there , my son . " We went over to the rock that marked the top of the mountain , where everybody using the path stopped to have their breath , and thank the stars the road was downhill all the way after . We sat in the sun , on a turf as soft as my mother 's tablecloth and greener , with the wind kept away by the rock , and angry because of it . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " I want to speak very seriously to you. , , " Yes , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said . " Something happened yesterday in the House , " he said , " which I still think I dreamt . A boy spoke in a matter of which he was ignorant . He raised his voice . He spoke without permission . He interrupted . He was offensive . " " Yes , Mr. Gruffydd , " I said . " Why ? " he asked me , and looking over the Valley as though it was of no consequence . " Because , " I said , trying to make my voice small , " I was sorry for Mcillyn Lewis . It came out of me . I was sorry after , sir . " " You did wrong , Huw , " said Mr. Gruffydd , taking me by the chin , end looking at me , " and you must make up your mind not to do such a thing again . Once is more than enough . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like No , Sir . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 119 " Make up your mind , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " There is a right way and a wrong in everything . Your father was very worried about you . If you will do that in Chapel , what will you do outside ? What will become of you ? " " They were cruel to her , " I said , and the heat was in my throat again to think of it . " And all those men were groaning and nodding to make her hurt more . That was not the Word of God . Go thou , and sin no more , Jesus said . " " You know your Bible too well and life too little , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " Let there be moderation in all things , Saint Paul said , and a more sensible man never trod the earth . " " But why did you allow it , Mr. Gruffydd ? " I asked him , and I was feeling injustice stiff in me . " Because I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sadness in his voice . " But I will change their foolishness in my good time and without the help of Huw Morgan . " For a little time the wind snarled and tried to put cold fingers on us round the rock , but always the sun pushed him back . Mr. Gruffydd looked far across the Valley above the tops of the mountains , and his eyes were blind with thought . " You must realize , Huw , " he said , speaking in his blindness , " that the men of the Valleys have built their houses and brought up their families without help from others , without a word from the Government . Their lives have been ordered from birth by the Bible . From it they took their instructions . They had no other guidance , and no other law .

I was sorry for Meillyn Lewis , too . But that session of the deacons was helpful as a preventative . It was cruel , but it is more cruel to tallow misconduct to flourish without check . " " It is not right to do it before all those men , " I said . " It is not , Huw , " said Mr. Gruffydd , " but we must act according to the times . and I am just as much a servant of the Chapel as ofIto HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYGod .

" And I am sorrier , now , too . " " Well , now , Huw , " said Mr. Gruffydd , smiling wide and showing good long teeth .

" " Come you in , Mr. Ellis , " said my mother , running for her purse . " Angharad , put the pan on and bacon , quick . A good cup of tea , Mr. Ellis , to warm you . " " Well , indeed , this will be the third breakfast I have had this morning , " said Mr. Ellis . " There is good to have a belly to hold it .

Oh , Ianto , my little one . " Ellis started to shout and hit the table with his knife and fork , and my mother danced round the table holding Angharad and jogging from side to side , with her eyes full.

Then back , straight , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing that happened-to the house when Angharad came back , settle is not the word . The house was in uproars all day with soap and water , and the next day Angharad and me white- washed front and back . Ianto was coming the next day , so the night before , everybody who knew him met at our house , and walked down with my father to the Chapel house to make up their minds what to do for the wel- come . Ellis had sent telegraph messages to Davy and Owen , and Gwilym he had told on his way over the mountain . Ceridwen had come home for a couple of days , Ivor and Angharad and me were home , so there was the family together all one again . There is pleased was my father . As soon as he got in the door when he came back from the meet- ing , with Mr. Gruffydd , he went on his knees in prayer to give thanks .

" Then we all sat down to supper and after , Mr. Gruffydd and my father drew up the procession , starting with the band and ending with Twm Pugh 's coal-cart to carry the bottles and casks . Up early next morning , and my father home an hour before the night shift finished to go with Thol.ias the Carrier in the wain down to the railway station to meet Ianto and the boys , with Ivor . No climb on the mountain for me that morning , indeed . Washing cups and saucers and plates and cutlery out in the back , me . All the women on the Hill were bringing their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain , we always borrowed china to have enough , and my mother would always have it washed before using , That was my job , anal though I harl no liking for it , I Crl it because of Ianto and the boys . The hooter had just blown for noon at the pit when we heard the band down in the Valley , where the procession was meeting my father and Ianto and the boys . Well , there is excitement . My mother stopped putting butter on the bread and put down the knife to hold her chest . " There they are , " she said . " Ceridwen , help me with my dress . Angharad , finish the bread and butter . Bronwen , watch the pots . " Then everybody made haste to finish what they were doing so that when the band came up the Hill they would be outside watching . When Ifan Owen came round the corner at the bottom by the railings with his big silver stick and the cord round it , : uul the brass blazed up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped to beat . The band was not very big , only ten all told , but they played all together , and all of them by car , and all very good , too . Up they came , and blowing to push down a house . After them a procession of our friends from all roii ! nl the valleys , and from the pit , of course , and from the farms . Four choirs were there , all from over the mountain , and our choir , and then the footballclubs in their jerseys , and the women in their tall hats and red petticoats , and then everybody from the Chapel , and all the other chapels , with the preachers all walking together , then the children 's choir . And behind them , on Thomas the Carrier 's wain all dressed up with flowers and grasses and coloured cloth , my father was standing with his five good sons . I was standing in our front room.1 at the open window but so great was the crowd that once the band was passed I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my brothers , and when they got down , nothing except hats . So , knowing my brothers , I went through the kitchen and out in the back and met them coming down through the back lane , dodging the crowd , sec. 124 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY Ianto was even bigger than Ivor . And 41 gclod clothes , too , from London . There is strange you can tell London in a man 's suit . Why is London such a wonderful place that it will speak to you even in a piece of cloth ? " Well , " he said , " there is a big boy you have grown , man . How old , now ? " " Twelve , " I said , " and a birthday next week . " " Oh , " he said , " like that , is it ?

" And mine , " said Owen . " You will have mine on your birthday , " said Ivor . " And I will give you a sixpence now , " said Gwilym , " and I will see about your birthday when it is your birthday . " " How are you liking married life , Gwil ? " asked lanto . Gwilym 's eyes went once to Owen and down on the mat. " 0 , all right , you know , " he said . " How is your wife ? " " Dead , " said Ianto . " Dead ? " said Ivor . " We heard nothing of that . " " I chose to say nothing , " said Ianto , and put me on my feet very kindly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago ? " " Six months , " said Ianto . " She and the baby . But say nothing to Mama . I will tell her to-morrow . And keep close by me or she will be asking questions . Quiet , now . " The singing and shouting outside was something to marvel at , and now a press of people were all round the house , shouting for Ianto , and all the women were coming in to get the food and make the tea . The boys were dragged away by their friends and I was left stand- ing in the corner to watch . But the room was so hot , and so many people were trying to get in and so many in already , that I climbed out through the window and went in the back shed out of the way . 11V .. V1.1/1J1 V 11 . AJ 1.11 V 1J1JL1 143There was a little loft up in the back , a quiet little place full of the smells of soap , and oil , and coal , and wood , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother put the blankets and linen when she had no use for them . A little window let you look right up to the top of the mountain if you lay flat on your back on the blankets . Here I looked at my school lessons and read during the day when my mother had friends in , or wanted the kitchen so that she and the girls could bathe . So I was up there , in quiet , and resting , with the sound of the crowd a long way off , when Marged came in quietly and shut the door . I made no sound but turned my head to watch her going to the bench where Owen had worked while she had been in the house with us . Some of his tools were still in the racks , and the brace and bits and the vice were shining as though Owen had only just been in . I was at them every day with sandpaper . Marged sat on Owen 's little stool and put her hand on the vice and started to turn the screw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I knew she was crying . Even while I was wondering what to do , the door opened again and Owen was standing there looking at her . For a moment he stood with the door open wide and then , knowing that people were all over , he came in and shut it , and stood again , with his back to it , very still , and in his black suit almost hidden in the darkness . " Marged , " he said , in a whisper . " I saw you come in . I had to come . " " Owen , " she said , and the words were riding on her tears , " I have starved for you . " " Marged , " Owen said again , and went nearer . " Many and many a time I would cut my throat but I am a coward . My life is a curse to me . I loved you , Marged , my beautiful one , but I loved too much . I love you still . " " There is nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am married . That is the end . " Owen was kneeling by her . She was still holding the vice . " Do you remember when you kissed me in here the first time ? " 126 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY she said , with smiles in her voice . " You pressed me against this old thing and my back was nearly cracked in pieces . " " Is Gwil good to you ? " Owen said , with hunger . " None better , not even you , " said Marged . " And he is so like you sometimes it is like being married to you , indeed . " " Why were you crying just now ? " Owen said . " Because the old ache was back , " said Marged . " I had it with me too long to forget it . Ache , ache , ache , for days and weeks and months . And only one voice , one kiss would have burnt it away . But it went on aching . Then it stopped . " Owen got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was higher than her 's . " Stopped , " said Marget , solid as a house . " One night I was in torments and going mad and shouting , and poor Gwil going mad , too , trying to soothe . And I prayed for strength to forget you . " " And you did ? " asked Owen , with a full throat . " I will never forget Owen Morgan , " said Marged , and got up to settle her cloak , and I saw her waist that a man 's hand could span . " Owen , who kissed me , and said I was his before the times of the Pyramids . Never . I will love him with my soul till the day I die . " " And now ? " said Owen . " And now I am Mrs. Gwilym Morgan , " said Marged , " and Owen Morgan has gone away and will never come back . " " But , Marged , " said Owen , " here I am , girl , look . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Owen , full in the face and shook her head . " No , you are not Owen Morgan . There is no man like Owen Morgan . He went away . He will never come back . And he gave me away to his brother . " " Oh , Marged , " said Owen , and turned his back . " Yes , " said Marged , " and I am living in that little house with him . " " Would you come away with me if it will make you happier ? " said Owen . " Nothing will make me happy , " said Marged , " only Owen Mor- gan . And he will never come back . " " Have sense , Marged , " said Owen , and turned quickly to catch her by the shoulders and look down into her face , as though to beg . But he spoke to himself and his words went to powder , and his eyes went wide and then tight shut . His hands fell from her , and quickly , with a cry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Marged , " he was sobbing . " Oh , Marged , my beautiful one . What did I do to you , devil from Hell that I am ? What did I do ? " He went out and closed the door . Marged stood . Then boots ran across the cobbles and Gwilym threw open the door and stood to hold his breath . He went quietly to Marged and put his arm about her shoulders . " Come , my pretty one , " he said , and indeed I had never heard him in that voice before . " We will get in the trap and go home , is it ? And I will bathe your head and nurse you to sleep , is it ? Come you , my little heart , and have rest . " And talking like that , Gwilym took Marged quietly outside and shut the door . I was boiling with heat and dry for a cup of tea , so I climbed down and went into the house among the people . Most of them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , with the women hiding under umbrellas afraid of the sun , and the air full of talk and laughing . In the kitchen my mother was looking white , and Angharad was crying in the corner , with Bronwen standing beside her patting her shoulder . My father and the boys were in the front room with Mr. Gruffydd and the other preachers . " Huw , " said my mother , standing quickly and holding out her hands to keep me from the front room , " take what you want and go out on the mountain like a good boy . " " Yes , Mama , " I said , and Bronwen came smiling to help me choose and pack . " No use , " my father said , in a voice above all the noise , that made my mother turn to hold her mouth . " No doctor can do her good , Mr. Gruffydd . We have spent much on them . The poor girl is mad , and I am worried from my life for my poor boy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , in a hurry , " and be tidy for a couple of hours , will you ? " 128 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEYSo out I went , and down to the river to tickle a couple of trout , and eat and drink on a rock in the sun with the river all round me . Tidy , indeed . That night we had supper all over the house . The tables were not big enough for all to sit down at once . So we had to manage . I was in the kitchen with my father and mother and my brothers and Mr. Gruffydd and a couple of other preachers , and Mr. Evans the Colliery , Dr. Richards , Mr. Parry , Mr. Owen Madog , and a number of the deacons and elders . We were all with our elbows under the ribs of the next one , but there was plenty to eat and drink so nobody was troubling . Ianto was telling about London and what he had done up there . He was in the counting-house of Hopkin Jones , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western sheds , and then clerk of works on a road-building job , and goodness knows what , he said . " There is a jack of all trades for you , " said one of the preachers . " Why not one job ? " " Because I was never in the right job , " said Ianto . " So I went on looking till I found it . " " Did you ? " asked the preacher . " No , " said Ianto . " We were treated like dirt . In the clerking jobs we were supposed to dress like princes on the money of a maggot . And in the rough jobs we got more pay , but the conditions of living were worse than the animals out at the back here . So I left one for the other and kept on looking . " " But you never found it ? " asked the same preacher , who was one of those men who enjoy making an ill-natured joke of all that goes against his understanding . " No , " said Ianto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . " " So , " said the preacher , " you are going to be a rolling stone all your life ? Not much credit to that , at all events . " " At all events , " said Ianto , with the lights in his big grey eyes set stone-still at Danger , " I am going to have credit for not squatting on my bottom like you , talking a lot of rubbish three times every SunHOWGREEN WAS MY VALLEY 129day , and mouthfuls in the week . Thank God I am not a limpet on society . " Down went everybody 's knife and fork , except mine and Davy 's , and Owen 's , and Ianto 's . I had known what was coming so I was ready . " I am not prepared , " said Mr. Gruffydd , " to sit here while my colleague is insulted . His observations might have been put in a happier manner , it is true . " " His observations , " said Ianto , " should never have been made . I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , indeed , " said the preacher , and very distressed , " I am sorry to cause such trouble . If I have said anything , I am deeply sorry . " " Good , " said Ianto . " Now I am sorry . Have some more of my good mother 's blackberry . " After that , it was like trying to talk through a net . Words seemed to stick in the air . Nobody seemed willing to look at anybody else . And when somebody laughed , you could tell how hard they were trying . Mr. Gruffydd had been rolling little pieces of bread for minutes on end , looking straight at the butter . Many times my mother took up the butter to help people , but his eyes never moved . My father kept looking at him out of the side of his eyes , and trying to talk business with Mr. Parry . Presently Mr. Gruffydd blinked his eyes as though coming from sleep and cleared his throat , and at once the room was still . Ang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates , first stood still , and then at a sign under the table from my mother , quickly went out backwards . " Ianto , " said Mr. Gruffydd , " at any other time , and in any other house , I would not start this discussion . But this matter to-night requires airing . Why am I a limpet on society ? " " Because you are doing useless work , " said Ianto , quick as that . " Ianto , " said my father , across the table , and angry , with my mother 's hand on his arm . " Mr. Gruffydd healed Huw . " " Mr. Morgan , " said Mr. Gruffydd , " Huw healed himself . Ianto , " he said , " why is mine a useless work ? " 130 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " Because , " Ianto said , with knife and fork idle , and his eyes on fire , " you make yourselves out to be shepherds of the flock and yet you allow your sheep to live in filth and poverty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say it is the Will of God . Sheep , indeed . Man was made in the image of God . Is God a sheep ? Because if He is , I understand why we are all so damned stupid . " " I can not tolerate this , " said the preacher who had not yet spoken , a little man with glasses , who sniffed when he spoke and had a little cough with him that he used all the time . " True , " said Mr. Gruffydd . " Perhaps , Ianto , you would come down to my lodgings to-morrow and talk there . I am interested in your views . " " But , Mr. Gruffydd , " said the sniffing preacher , " your dignity surely will not allow you to talk with him . " " Go from the house , " Ianto said , looking knives at him , " before I will throw you , and your dignity . I will be with you at eight to- morrow morning , Mr. Gruffydd . " " Good , " said Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this night . " " Amen , " we all said . J WENT down the hill with Ianto next morning before eight o'clock to start school again with Mrs. Tom Jenkins . A big morning it was for me . More than two years had gone by since I was last in the little front room , but nothing had changed , not even the curtains , though they had been washed , of course . Eunice and Eiluned had grown nearly big enough to wear their mother 's dresses without cutting , but they still went about the house in bare feet to save their shoes and stockings for going out . The blackboard was still cracked across at the top , and with all the lessons chalked on and rubbed off into the minds of the boys and girls since , greyer still than I remembered it , so that the alphabet , which Mrs. Tom always wrote at night for us to copy first thing in the morning , was barely to be seen . Even the smell was the same , of frying bacon , baking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burnt for Mr. Tom Jenkins ' comfort , and chalk , old books , airing washing and mice . It was not the smell of , our house , and I was always a stranger to it for it reminded me of the purple head of Mr. Tom Jenkins and his noises . When Mrs. Tom came in we had prayers , and then a prayer for sending me back to school nothing worse except for thin legs , and then we sang " Let my life be all thanksgiving . " But when we started lessons I had a shock , for there was nothing Mrs. Tom could teach me . All the days I had been in bed I had either read books or listened to Bron or my father and brothers , and hour after hour I had talked with Mr. Gruffydd . Mrs. Tom tried me with the names of the kings , starting from Canute , but I could go back hundreds of years and tell her of British kings who ruled before Rome became nasty with us . Oceans , seas , continents , islands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew all of them she asked me , and at last she put down the pointer. , t3z132 HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY " I had better see your father , Huw , " she said . " You are wasting time coming here . Only your sums want a bit of help from me , and I can give you that every night after tea . Go to your dinner now , and stay home . " So back we all went up the Hill , and the boys and girls looking at me as though I knew everything . Ianto was in the house when I got there and looking very straight . Owen was in the back doing a bit of filing and putting my mother 's teeth in brine , and Angharad was peeling apples in the wash-house . When I got a wink from her I knew there was trouble to come , so I went in with Owen. " 0 , " he said . " You , is it ? " " Yes , " I said . " Do you want help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Can you ? " " Give me the file , " I said . While I filed , Owen was fitting together a lot of parts all new and shining and looking beautiful indeed , when they were fast and whole . " What is this , Owen ? " I asked him . " An engine , " he said , " to drive people instead of a horse and trap . But say nothing . " " No , no , " I said . " Why is Ianto looking at the wall in by there ? " " To rest his eyes from the faces of fools , " Owen said . " Why are you home so early ? " Then I told him what Mrs. Tom Jenkins had said , and he laughed . " Right , you , " he said . " You shall go to a proper school . It is time , too . No man ever learnt anything from a woman . " " Mrs. Tom has taught me a lot , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Figures and names and facts . You have learnt nothing very much . But you have a splendid memory . It will help you when you start to learn . " When my mother called us in the house for dinner , I told her about Mrs. Tom . She was so surprised that she stopped with her spoon in 1 the sprouts and a leaf sticking to the thumb on the plate . " Eh , " she said , with round eyes . " Another worry , now then . School for Huw . Where , then ? " " Technical school . " said Davy . HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 133 " Boarding school , " Owen said . " All he will learn in that kind of place , " Davy said , " is how to look down on his father and mother . " " His Dada shall say , " my mother said . " Perhaps Mr. Gruffydd will say a word about it , too . " " Perhaps , " Davy said , " this family will do something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one day in the future .

" " He is a good man , " Ianto said , " but I wish he was out of the Chapel . " " Did you get a slicing this morning , then ? " Davy asked him . " No , " Ianto said . " But I found out how much I have to learn . " " About what ? " asked Owen . " Men , " said Ianto , " and the way we live , and treat each other . " " 0 , " said Davy , " that should be interesting . What are Mr. Gruffydd 's views ? " " The Sermon on the Mount , " said Ianto . " Brought up to date , and given out with a fist on the end of each arm , and a good voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Davy .

" " I have heard those words before , at any rate , " Owen said . " When will it be time ? Shall we know ? Will it be given for a sign ? Did you ask him ? " " No , " said Ianto . " I listened . I have a good mind to join the Chapel . " " But , Ianto , " my mother said , while we all looked at him , " you are in the Chapel now , boy . Since you were born .

" There is beautiful . " " It would be more beautiful if there were sense and purpose in what he wanted to do , " Davy said , and put his knife and fork together , though his dinner was steaming . " There is plenty to be done outside the pulpit , " Owen said , and stopped eating , too . " If Ianto thinks he can do more from the pulpit , " my mother said , " he shall try , and I will help . We can do with a few more like Mr. Gruffydd . " " Mr. Gruffydd . Mr. Gruffydd . Mr. Gruffydd , " Davy said , and pushed back his chair to stand . " I am tired of his name .

" " I am sorry to leave your pudding , Mama , " Owen said , and fol- lowed Davy out . " I suppose I am to look to you for a few words , now ? " my mother said to me . " I will say them after I have had my dinner , Mama , " I said . " O ? " said my mother . " Well , let me warn you . One word from you and you shall have a good couple round the ears . Now then . " " Mama , " Angharad said , " Mrs. Beynon is having her baby in the old shed down by the ironworks . " " Which baby ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have before they put her from the house , " Angharad said , and put gravy over her potatoes . " Eh , " my mother said . " How do you know ? " " Tegwen told me now just , " said Angharad eating fast . " I gave her a sheet for tearing and the two old red blankets . " with her eyes in slits and her lips together and puffed up . My mother put down her knife and fork and looked at Angharad " Do you mean to sit there , " she said , very slowly , " with that sheet in pieces and two good blankets gone from the house , without a word from me ? " " They had nothing , Mama , " Angharad said , and no sign of fear . " The landlord 's men put her from the house with nothing . Not a stick or stitch . And the new baby is coming to-day . Only straw she has to lie on . And the seven other children . " " Hisht , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many . I will see to it . But no more sheets and blankets behind my hack .

" I suppose , " my mother said , as though her mind were over the mountain , " nothing else went with the sheets and blankets ? It would be too much to expect of Miss Angharad Morgan , of course ? " " Well , Mama , " Angharad said , and so pretty your mouth would run , " there were some old pots and pans out in the back . " " Go on , " Mama said . " Pots and pans .

" Hisht , now . I was angry because I was not asked . Ask in future . Is it ? " " Yes , Mama , " Angharad said , and reached out for my handker  --  chief . " What shall we do for the new baby ? " " Go you and ask Bron for some of little Gareth 's baby clothes , " my mother said . " I will have a basket of food now in a minute . Huw , go you up and down the Hill with a basket and ask for anything to eat they can spare . " " Yes , Mama , " I said . Well , if you could have seen the collection . The clothes would have covered a shift in the pit . The food was enough for the village . And by the time the furniture was all together , two houses would not have held it . Well , there it was , and no lack of hands to take it down to the old shed at the ironworks , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of food , and indeed it was a poor place . Mrs. Beynon was lying on one of our old red blankets and another one hanging over her to keep out the water coming in from the roof . Evan Beynon had broken a plank to make a fire , and an old bucket was heating water . Rusty iron wheels , and broken rods of iron were red among the growing grass and dandelions . Puddles were plenty and a rill ran right through to the river . Cold and damp , too . The three youngest children were sleeping by Mrs. Beynon 's feet , and two more little ones were playing shop with stones at the window . Tegwen and her smaller brother were putting straw in sacks to make beds for the night . " Hulloa , Teg , " I said , and stopped by the door , though there was no door . " Hulloa , Huw , " she said , and looked shame . " Putting straw in sacks , we are . The straw do go from under you if you turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make fun . " Yes , yes , " I said , as though I slept on straw every night of my life . " Here is a pie in by here . " " Good , " she said . " Mama will be glad of the taste . " HOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 137 " And tea , " I said . " Tea ? " said Tegwen. " 0 , God . Let me have it in the kettle , quick . " " How is Mrs. Beynon ? " I asked her , for as far as I could see , she was in pain with her , and mumbling , with froth on her mouth , and red in the face , with sweat binding her hair . " Mrs. Price will be down now just , " Tegwcn said , and blowing the fire . " Then she will be better . " " What has Mrs. Price got to do with it ? " I asked her . " Then the new baby will come , boy , " Tegwcn said , laughing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Does Mrs. Price bring the baby , then ? " I asked her , and surprisedI was , see . Tegwen sat down laughing out loud , and then put a hand over her mouth and looked at her mother . " There is dull you are , boy , " she whispered , with lights in her eyes . " The new baby is with Mama , see . But Mrs. Price do know how to have it from her . Bring cups , quick . " The only cups I could find I would not have drunk from , but Mrs. Beynon drank and drank though with no sign she knew where she was , or what it was she was drinking . " Where is the new baby , then ? " I asked Tegwcn , for I could see no signs . " Are you going to sit fat by there and say you know nothing about new babies ? " Tegwen asked me , and looking as though she thought I was a fool . " No , " I said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , but I thought Dr. Richards brought them in his bag . " " Who told you ? " Tegwen asked . " My mother and Bron , " I said . " Lies , " Tegwen said . " How do you know ? " I said . " You are only twelve , so you can still do with a lesson or two . " " Lies , " Tegwen said . " Wait , you , and you shall see . " " How , then ? " I said . " When Mrs. Price comes , she will send us from here , " Tegwen138 1IO1V GREEN WAS MY VALLEYsaid , " so we will go round the back and look through that hole up by there . " I looked up where she was pointing and saw a piece of wood hanging down from rot . There was darkness at the back . " Right , you , " I said . Then everybody started to come in with the collections , and all the women were saying 0 and Eh and clicking their tongues , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chop grass , and move iron . Then the men started coming in and knotting ropes to put up canvas over the bad places , and boards over the open window and doorways . Indeed , in a couple of minutes it looked so good I could have lived in there myself . Mr. Beynon came in and looked for a moment and went outside to cry , and then Mrs. Price came in with a bundle and an elegant bag with patterns on it , made from carpet . " Now then , " she said , with her foot barely inside the door . " Let us be having a couple of you outside , please . All the children , this minute , for a start . " " Come you , " Tegwen whispered to me , and off we went , out in the yard , up the steps of the works and inside where the bats were thick in the roof , and flying like angry whispers . We went close to the hole and looked in . Mrs. Price had put the smallest children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman with her was pulling their clothes off . Mrs. Beynon was crying , not quietly , but out loud , like a boy who had fallen and hurt his knee . She was kicking at the clothes and her face was swollen , with veins . " Poor Mama , " Tegwen said , below a breath , " she always has this for a new baby . " It was in my mind to ask why , but it was no business of mine . There was something ugly and cruel in it that I could feel but not describe . Mrs. Beynon was a big , fat woman , always very cheerful , but to see her like that was like being in a dream . I found myself getting not and having trouble to breathe. 7 acre was a strange smell coming up to us , too . I have often smelt it about the house where a baby has just come . It is a deep smell , anHOW GREEN WAS MY VALLEY 39early smell , with the secrets of blood and milk in it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire and brought back the bucket to the bedside . Mrs. Penry had finished the children and had come to stand at Mrs. Beynon 's head . Mrs. Price pulled off the blankets as Mrs. Beynon started to scream , and Mrs. Penry was guiding her hands to the wooden rail above the head of the bed . The children awoke and began crying , but nobody took notice of them . Mrs. I3eynon'slegs were like white stalks , and they made little kicks , and her toes curled in , and her heels dug in the bed . Her mouth was open with shouting and her eyes wide , and wild , and terrible to sec upside down as she was to me . Mrs. Price and Mrs. Penry were doing something to her , but what I was not sure , for I could see only their bae ks beneath there , and the bats were all round us , pulled from sleep by the crying and wailing and sobbing and shrieks , and flying at us as though we were something to do with it . " There , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm to be closer to the hole . " There you are , see . The new baby " But I looked only enough to see a redness in the deepening light , and stained cloths in Mrs. Price 's wringing hands above the hu ( ket and Mrs. Beynon 's toes set at peace . And I turned away in shame and sickness for I felt I had been where only fools do tread . " Let me go from here , " I said . " Wait , you , " Tegwen said . " There is plenty more to be seen . " " I am going from here this minute , " I said , and went on hands and knees to the doorway . " Do you believe now ? " Tegwen said , with laugh in her voice . " Yes , " I said , sick , and looking down the dark steps . " Tell nobody , mind , " Tegwen said . " Else there will be trouble , sure . " " Well , good-bye , now , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Savage glad I was to be in the air and feel it freezing me . I felt I deserved more than freezing . I felt I should throw myself over a pit mouth or go under the wheels of a hay wain or get tangled up in the cables of the big winding wheel , so low I did feel . But instead I went inside Bron 's , and sat down in the usual chair. ,
