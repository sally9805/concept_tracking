Aboard a Spanish cruiser , fat Francisco Franco steamed up the Tagus River last week , accompanied by three cruisers and four destroyers . Amid fanfare and foofaraw , he went ashore at Lisbon for a five-day state visit . Along with 200,000 cheering Portuguese , Franco 's wife was on hand to greet him ; she had come ahead , by train . Said she : " We arrived radiant and enchanted . " <P> The Portuguese visit looked like a further Franco effort to cure some of Spain 's ills by wangling Western support and aid . Portugal , a signer of the Atlantic pact , has been agitating for the admission of her good friend &; neighbor . But , said Franco , his visit was merely a return call for one paid by President Oscar Carmona to Spain just 20 years ago . Spanish courtesy , it seemed , was slow but sure .
