THE WIDE NET A STORY BY EUDORA WELTY W ILLIAM WALLACE JAmmsoN 's wife Hazel was going to have a baby . But this was October , and it was six months away , and she acted exactly as though it would be to-morrow . When he came in the room she would not speak to him but would look as straight at nothing as she could , with her eyes glowing . If he only touched her she stuck out her tongue or ran round the table . So one night he went out with two of the boys down the road and stayed out all night . But that was the worst thing yet , because when he came home in the early morning Hazel had vanished . He went through the house not believing his eyes , balancing with both hands out , his yellow cowlick rising on end , and then he turned the kitchen inside out looking for her , but it did no good . Then when he got back to the front room he saw she had left him a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone 's back . He took out the letter , pushed it open , held it out at a distance from his eyes . . . . After one look he was scared to read the exact words , and he crushed the whole thing in his hand instantly , but what it had said was that she could not put up with him after that and was going to the river to drown herself . " Drown herself . . but she 's in mortal fear of the water ! " He ran out front , his face red like the red of the picked cotton field he ran over , and down in the road he gave a loud shout for Virgil Thomas , who was justgoing in his own house , to come out again . He had almost got in , he had one foot inside the door . They met half-way between the farms , under the shade tree . " Have n't you had enough of the night ? " asked Virgil . There they were , their pants all covered with the dust and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man home flat between them . " I 've lost Hazel , she 's vanished , she went to drown herself . " " Why , that ai n't like Hazel , " said Virgil . William Wallace reached out and shook him . " You heard me . Do n't you know we have to drag the river ? " " Right this minute ? " " You ai n't got nothing to do till spring . " " Let me go set foot inside the house and speak to my mother and tell her a story and I 'll come back . " " This will take the wide net , " said William Wallace . His eyebrows gathered , and he was talking to himself . " How come Hazel to go and do that way ? " asked Virgil as they started out . William Wallace said , " I reckon she got lonesome . " " That do n't argue  --  drown herself for getting lonesome . My mother gets lone-some . " " Well , " said William Wallace . " It argues for Hazel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her was married ? " THE WIDE NET " Why , it 's been a year . " " It do n't seem that long to me . A year ! " " It was this time last year . It seems longer , " said William Wallace , breaking a stick off a tree in surprise . They walked along , kicking at the flowers on the road 's edge . " I remember the day I seen her first and that seems a long time ago . She was coming along the road holding a little frying-size chicken from her grandma under her arm , and she had it real quiet . I spoke to her with nice manners . We knowed each other 's names , being bound to , just did n't know each other to speak to . " I says , ' Where are you taking the fryer ? ' and she says , ' Mind your manners , ' and I kept on till after while she says , If you want to walk me home take littler steps . ' So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the field and full of blackberries , and from the top of the hill there was Dover below , looking sizeable-like and clean , spread out between the two churches like that . When we got down , I says to her , ' What kind of water 's in this well ? ' and she says , ' The best water in the world . ' So I drew a bucket and took out a dipper and she drank and I drank . I did n't think it was that remarkable , but 1 did n't tell her . " " What happened that night ? " asked Virgil . " We ate the chicken , " said William Wallace , " and it was tender . Of course that was n't all they had . The night I was trying their table out , it sure had good things to eat from one end to the other . Hcr mama and papa sat at the head and foot and we was face to face with each other across it with , I remember , a pat of butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawed down it , elegant-like . Her mama eats like a man . I had brought her a whole hatful of berries and she did n't even pass them to her husband . Hazel , she would leap up and take a pitcher of new milk and fill up the glasses . I had heard how they could n't have a singing at the church without a fight over her . " " Oh , she 's a pretty girl , all right , " said Virgil . " It 's a pity for the ones like her to grow old , and get like their mothers . " " Another thing will be that her mother will get wind of this and come after me , " said William Wallace . " Her mother will eat you alive , " said Virgil . " She 's just been watching her chance , " said William Wallace . " Why did I think I could stay out all night ? " " Just something come over you . " " First it was just a carnival at Carthage , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and after that . . . " " It was nice to he sitting on your neck in a ditch singing , " prompted Virgil , " there in the moonlight . And playing on the harmonica like you can play . " " Even if Hazel did sit home knowing I was drunk that would n't kill her , " said William Wallace . " What she knows ai n't ever killed her yet . . . . She 's smart too for a girl , " he said . " She 's a lot smarter than her cousins in Beula , " said Virgil . " And especially Edna Earle , that never did get to be what you 'd call a heavy thinker . Edna Earle. could sit and ponder all day on how the little tail of the C ' got through the ' I , ' in a Coca-Cola sign . " " Hazel is smart , " said William Wallace . They walked on . " You ought to see her pantry shelf  --  it looks like a hundred jars when you open the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and jump in the river . " " It 's a woman 's trick . " " I always behaved before . Till the one night  --  last night . " " Yes , but the one night , " said Virgil . " And she was waiting to take advantage . " " She jumped in the river because she was scared to death of the water and that was to make it worse , " he said . " She remembered how I used to have to pick her up and carry her over the oak-log bridge , how she 'd shut her eyes and make a dead-weight and hold me round the neck , just for a little creek . I do n't see how she brought herself to jump . " " Jumped backward , " said Virgil . " Did n't look . " When they turned off it was still early in the pink and green fields . The fumes of morning , sweet and bitter , sprang up where they walked . The insects ticked softly , their strength in reserve ; butterflies chopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ birds flew carelessly and sang by fits and starts , not the way they did in the evening , in sustained and drowsy songs . " It is a pretty day for sure , " said William Wallace . " It 's a pretty day for it . " " I do n't see a sign of her ever going along here , " said Virgil . " Well , " said William Wallace , " she would n't have dropped anything . I never saw a girl to leave less signs of where she 's been . " " Not even a plum seed , " said Virgil , kicking the grass . In the grove it was so quiet that once William Wallace gave a jump , as if he could almost hear a sound of himself wondering where she had gone . A descent of energy came down on him in the thick of the woods and he ran at a rabbit and caught it in his hands . " Rabbit . . rabbit . . . " He acted as if he wanted to take it off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He laid a palm against its pushing heart . " Now . . there now . . " " Let her go , William Wallace , let her go . " Virgil , chewing on an elderberry whistle he had just made , stood at his shoulder . " What do you want with a live rabbit ? " William Wallace squatted down and set the rabbit on the ground but held it under his hand . It was a little , old , brown rabbit . It did not try to move . " Sec there ? " " Let her go . " " She can go if she wants to , but she do n't want to . " Gently he lifted his hand . The round eye was shining at him sideways in the green gloom . " Anybody can freeze a rabbit that wants to , " said Virgil . Suddenly he gave a far-reaching blast on the whistle , MAGAZINE and the rabbit went in a streak . " Was you out catching cottontails or was you out catching your wife ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I come along to keep you on the track . " " Who 'll we get now ? " They stood on top of a hill and William Wallace looked critically over the countryside . " Any of the Malones ? " " I was always scared of the Malones , " said Virgil . " Too many of them . " " This is my day with the net , and they would have to watch out , " said William Wallace . " I reckon some Malones and the Doyles will be enough . The six Doyles and their dogs , and you and me , and two little nigger boys is enough , with just a few Malones . " " That ought to be enough , " said Virgil , " no matter what . " " I 'll bring the Malones and you bring the Doyles , " said William Wallace , and they separated at the spring . When William Wallace came back , with a string of Malones just showing behind him on the hilltop , he found Virgil with the two little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As soon as he walked up , Grady , the one in front , lifted his hand , as if to signal silence and caution to his brother Brucie , panting merrily and untrustworthily behind him . Brucie bent readily under William Wallace 's hand-pat and gave him a dreamy look out of the tops of his round eyes , which were pure green-and-white , like clover tops . William Wallace gave him a nickel . Grady hung his head ; his white hair lay in a little tail in the nape of his neck . " Let 's let them come , " said Virgil . " Well , they can come then , but if we keep letting everybody come it is going to be too many , " said William Wallace . " They 'll appreciate it , those little old boys , " said Virgil . Brucie held up at arm 's length a long red thread with a bent pin tied on the end ; and a look of helpless and intense interest gathered Grady 's face like a drawstring ; his eyes , one bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he snapped his jaw and tried to speak . . . " Their papa was drowned in the Pearl River , " said Virgil . There was a shout from the gully . " Here come all the Malones , " cried William Wallace . " I asked four of them would they come , but the rest of the family invited themselves . " " Did you ever see a time when they did n't ? " said Virgil . " And yonder from the other direction comes the Doyles , still with biscuit crumbs on their cheeks , I bet , now it 's nothing to do but eat , as their mother said . " " If two little niggers would come along now , or one big nigger , " said William Wallace . And the words were hardly out of his mouth when two little Negro boys came along , going somewhere , one behind the other , stepping high and gay in their overalls , as though they waded through honeydew to the waist . " Come here , boys . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Come along with us , we 're going to drag the river . " " You hear that , Robbie Bell ? " said Sam . They smiled . The Doyles came noiselessly , their dogs made all the fuss . The Malones , eight giants with great long black eyelashes , were already stamping the ground and pawing one another , ready to go . Everybody went up together to see Doc . Old Doc owned the wide net . He had a house on top of the hill and he sat and looked out from a rocker on the front porch . " Climb the hill and come in ! " he began to intone across the valley . " Harvest 's over .. . slipped up on everybody .. . cotton 's picked , gone to the gin . . hay cut . . . molasses made around here . . . . Big explosion 's over , supervisors elected , some pleased , some not . . . . We 're hearing talk of war ! " When they got closer he was saying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday , including a Doyle , ought to counted two . Hope they 'll be a blessing to Dover community besides a shining star in Heaven . Now what ? " he asked , for they had arrived and stood gathered in front of the steps . " If nobody else is using your wide net could we use it ? " asked William Wallace . " You just used it a month ago , " said Doc . " It ai n't your turn . " Virgil jogged William Wallace 's arm and cleared his throat . " This time is kind of special , " he said . " We got reason to think William Wallace 's wife Hazel is in the river , drowned . " " What reason have you got to think she 's in the river drowned ? " asked Doe . He took out his old pipe . " I 'm asking the husband . " " Because she 's not in the house , " said William Wallace . " Vanished ? " and he knocked out the pipe . " Plum vanished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened to her , " said Doc and he lighted the pipe . " Hand him up the letter , William Wallace , " said Virgil . " We ca n't wait around till Doomsday for the net while Doc sits back thinkin ' . " " I tore it up , right at the first , " said William Wallace . " But I know it by heart . It said she was going to jump straight in the Pearl River and that I 'd be sorry . " " Where do you come in , Virgil ? " asked Doc . " I was in the same place William Wallace sat on his neck in , all night , and done as much as he done , and come home the same time . " " You-all were out cuttin ' up , so Lady Hazel has to jump in the river , is that it ? Cause and effect . Anybody want to argue with me ? Where do these others come in , Doyles , Malones , and what not ? " " Doc is the smartest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stolidly waiting Doyles , " but it sure takes time . " " These are the ones that 's collected to drag the river for her , " said Virgil . " Of course I am not going on record to say so soon that I think she 's drowned , " Doe said , blowing out blue smoke . " Do you think . . . " William Wallace went up a step , and his hands both went into fists . " Do you think she was carried op " " Now that 's the way to argue , see it from all sides , " said Doc promptly , " But who by ? " Some Malone whistled , but not so you could tell which one . " There 's no booger around the Dover section that goes around carrying off young girls that 's married , " stated Doc . " She was always scared of the gypsies . " William Wallace turned scarlet . " She 'd sure turn her ring around on her finger if she passed one , and look in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and carry her off . They come in the end of summer . " " Yes , there are the gypsies , kidnappers since the world began . But was it to be you that would pay the grand ransom ? " asked Doe . He pointed his finger . They all laughed then at how clever old Doc was and clapped William Wallace on the back . But that turned into a scuffle and they fell to the ground . " Stop it , or you ca n't have the net , " said Doe . " You 're scaring my wife 's chickens . " " It 's time we was gone , " said William Wallace . The big barking dogs jumped to lean their front paws on the men 's chests . " My advice remains , Let well enough alone , " said Doc . " Whatever this mysterious event will turn out to be , it has kept one woman from talking- a while . However , Lady Hazel is the prettiest girl in Mississippi , a golden-haired girl ; you 've never seen a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his feet with the nimbleness that was always his surprise , and said , " I 'll come along with you . " The path they always followed was the Old Natchez Trace . It took them through the deep woods and led them out down below on the Pearl River , where they could begin dragging it upstream to a point near Dover . They walked in silence round William Wallace , not letting him carry anything , but the net dragged heavily and the buckets were full of clatter in a place so dim and still . Once they went through a forest of cucumber trees and came up on a high ridge . Grady and Brucie who were running ahead all the way stopped in their tracks ; a whistle had blown , and far down and far away a long freight train was passing . It seemed like a little festival procession , moving with the slowness of ignorance or a dream , from distance to distance , the tiny pink and gray cars like secret boxes . Grady was counting the cars to himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brucie watched his lips , hushed and cautious , the way he would watch a bird drinking . Tears suddenly came to Grady 's eyes , but it could only be because a tiny man walked along the top of the train , walking and moving on top of the moving train . They went down again and soon the smell of the river spread over the woods , cool and secret . Every step they took among the great walls of vines and among the passionflowers started up a little life , a little flight . " We 're walking along in the changing-time , " said Doc . " Any day now the change will come . It 's going to turn from hot to cold , and we can kill the hog that 's ripe and have fresh meat to eat . Come one of these nights and we can wander down here and tree a nice possum . Old Jack Frost will be pinching things up . Old Mr. Winter will be standing in the door . Hickory tree there will be yellow . Sweet-gum red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He went along rapping the tree trunks with his knuckle . " Magnolia and live oak never die . Remember that . Persimmons will all get fit to cat , and the nuts will be dropping like rain all through the woods here . And run , little quail , run , for we 'll be after you too . " They went on and suddenly the woods opened upon light , and they had reached the river . Everyone stopped , but Doc talked on ahead as though nothing had happened . " Only to-day , " he said , " to-day , in October sun , it 's all gold  --  sky and tree and water . Everything just before it changes looks to be made of gold . " William Wallace looked down as though he thought of Hazel with the shining eyes , sitting at home and looking straight before her , like a piece of pure gold , too precious to touch . Below them the river was glimmering , narrow , soft and skin-colored , and slowed nearly to stillness . The shining willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn out , so old and so long-used , it too looked golden , strung and tied with golden threads . Standing still on the bank , all of a sudden William Wallace , on whose word they were waiting , spoke up in a voice of surprise . " What is the name of this river ? " They looked at him as if he were crazy not to know the name of the river he had fished in all his life . But a deep frown was on his forehead , as if he were compelled to wonder what people had come to call this river , or to think there was a mystery in the name of a river they all knew so well , the same as if it were some great far torrent of waves that dashed through the mountains somewhere , and almost as if it were a river in some dream , for they could not give him the name of that . " Everybody knows Pearl River is named the Pearl River , " said Doc . A bird note suddenly bold was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's deep here , " said Virgil , and jogged William Wallace . " Remember ? " William Wallace stood looking down at the river as if it were still a mystery to him . There under his foot which hung over the bank it was transparent and yellow like an old bottle lying in the sun , filling with light . Doc clattered all his paraphernalia . Then all of a sudden all the Malones scattered jumping and tumbling down the bank . They gave their loud shout . Little Brucie started after them , and looked back . " Do you think she jumped ? " Virgil asked William Wallace . Since the net was so wide when it was all stretched , it reached from bank to bank of the Pearl River , and the weights would hold it all the way to the . bottom . Juglike sounds filled the air , splashes lifted in the sun , and the party began to move upstream . The Malones with great groans swam and pulled near the shore , the Doyles swam and pushed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best ; Grady and Brucie with his thread and pin trotted along the sandbars hauling buckets and lines . Sam and Robbie Bell , naked and bright , guided the old oarless rowboat that always drifted at the shore , and in it , sitting up tall with his hat on , was Doe  --  he went along without ever touching water and without ever taking his eye off the net . William Wallace himself did everything but most of the time he was out of sight , swimming about under water or diving , and he had nothing to say any more . The dogs chased up and down , in and out of the water and in and out of the woods . " Do n't let her get too heavy , boys , " Doc intoned regularly every few minutes , " and she wo n't let nothing through . " " She wo n't let nothing through , she wo n't let nothing through , " chanted Sam and Robbie Bell , one at his front and one at his back . The sandbars were pink or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , in a wandering from shore to shore , it was leaf-shaped spangles that trembled softly , while the dark of the river was calm . The willow trees leaned overhead and their trailing leaves hung like waterfalls in the morning air . The thing that seemed like silence must have been the endless cry of all the crickets and locusts in the world , rising and falling . Every time William Wallace took hold of a big eel that slipped the net , the Malones all yelled , " Rassle with him , son ! " " Do n't let her get too heavy , boys , " said Doc . " This is hard on catfish , " William Wallace said once . There were big and little fishes , dark and light , that they caught , good ones and bad ones , the same old fish . " This is more shoes than I ever saw got together in any store , " said Virgil when they emptied the net to the bottom . " Get going ! " he shouted in the next breath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stayed ahead on the river . Brucie , leading them all , made small jumps and hops as he went , sometimes on one foot , sometimes on the other . The winding river looked old sometimes , when it ran wrinkled and deep under high banks where the roots of trees hung down , and sometimes it seemed to be only a young creek , shining with the colors of wildflowers . Sometimes sandbars in the shapes of fishes lay nose to nose , without the track of even a bird . " Here comes some alligators , " said Virgil . " Let 's let them by . " They drew out on the shady side of the water , and three big alligators and four middle-sized ones went by , taking their own time . " Look at their great big old teeth ! " called a shrill voice . It was Grady making his only outcry , and the alligators were not showing their teeth at all . " The better to eat folks with , " said Doc from his boat , looking at him severely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know , " said Virgil . " Get going ! " When they started off again the first thing they caught in the net was the baby alligator . " That 's just what we wanted ! " cried the Malones . They set the little alligator down on a sandbar and he squatted perfectly still ; MAGAZINE they could hardly tell when it was he started to move . They watched with set faces his incredible mechanics , while the dogs after one bark stood off in inquisitive humility , until he winked . " He 's ours ! " shouted all the Malones . " We 're taking him home with us ! " " He ai n't nothing but a little old baby , " said William Wallace . The Malones only scoffed , as if he might be only a baby but he looked like the oldest and worst lizard . " What are you going to do with him ? " asked Virgil . " Keep him . " " I 'd be more careful what I took out of this net , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bucket , " the Malones were saying to one another , while Doc was saying , " Do n't come running to me and ask me what to do when he gets big . " They kept catching more and more fish , as if there was no end in sight . " Look , a string of lady 's beads , " said Virgil . " Here , Sam and Robbie Bell . " Sam wore them round his head , with a knot over his forehead and loops round his ears , and Robbie Bell walked behind and stared at them . In a shadowy place something white flew up . It was a heron and it went away over the dark treetops . William Wallace followed it with his eyes and Brucie clapped his hands , but Virgil gave a sigh , as if he knew that when you go looking for what is lost everything is a sign . An eel slid out of the net . " Rassle with him , son ! " yelled the Malones . They swam like fiends . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virgil . It was about noon that there was a little rustle on the bank . " Who is that yonder ? " asked Virgil , and he pointed to a little undersized man with short legs and a little straw hat , who was following along on the other side of the river . " Never saw him and do n't know his brother , " said Doc . Nobody had ever seen him before . " Who invited you ? " cried Virgil hotly . " Hi . . . ! " and he made signs for the little undersized man to took at him , but he would not . " Looks like a crazy man from here , " said the Malones . " Just do n't pay any attention to him and maybe he 'll go away , " advised Doc . But Virgil had already swum across and was up on the other bank . He and the stranger could be seen exchanging a word apiece and then Virgil put out his hand the way he would pat a child and patted the man to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as quickly , lifted his shoulders , turned round , and walked away with his hat tilted over his eyes . When Virgil came back he said , " Little old man claimed he was harmless as a baby . I told him to just try horning in on this river and anything in it . " " What did he look like up close ? " asked Doc . " I did n't study how he looked , " said Virgil . " But I do n't like anybody to come looking at me that I am not familiar with . " And he shouted , " Get going ! " " Things are moving in too great a rush , " said Doe . Brucie darted ahead and ran looking into all the bushes , lifting up the branches and peeping underneath . " Not one of the Doyles has spoke a word , " said Virgil . " That 's because they 're not talkers , " said Doc . All day William Wallace kept diving to the bottom . Once he dived down and down into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred , not even a fish , and so dark that it was no longer the muddy world of the upper river but the dark clear world of deepness , and he must have believed this was the deepest place in the whole Pearl River , and if she was not here she would not be anywhere . He was gone such a long time that the others stared hard at the surface of the water , through which the bubbles came from below . So far down and all alone , had he found Hazel ? Had he suspecteddown there , Iike some secret , the real , the true trouble that Hazel had fallen into , about which words in a letter could not speak . . . how ( who knew ? ) she had been filled to the brim with that elation that they all remembered , like their own secret , the elation that comes of great hopes and changes , sometimes simply of the harvest time , that comes with a tittle course of its own Iike a tune to run in the head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they knew  --  and so it had turned into despair ? It could be nothing but the old trouble that William Wallace was finding out , reaching and turning in the gloom of such depths . " Look down yonder , " said Grady softly to Brucie . He pointed to the surface , where their reflections lay colorless and still side by side . He touched his brother gently as though to impress him . " That 's you and me , " he said . Brucie swayed precariously over the edge , and Grady caught him by the seat of his overalls . Brucie looked , but showed no recognition . Instead , he backed away , and seemed all at once unconcerned and spiritless and pressed the nickel William Wallace had given him into his palm , rubbing it into his skin . Grady 's inflamed eyes rested on the brown water . Without warning he saw something . . . perhaps the image in the river seemed to be his father , the drowned man  --  with arms open , eyes open , mouth open . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . And when William Wallace came up it was in an agony from submersion , which seemed an agony of the blood and of the very heart , so woeful he looked . He was staring round in astonishment , as if a long time had gone by , away from the pale world where the brown light of the sun and the river and the little party watching him trembled before the eyes . " What did you bring up ? " somebody called  --  was it Virgil ? One of his hands was holding fast to a little green ribbon of plant , root and all . He was surprised and let it go . It was afternoon . The trees spread softly , the clouds hung wet and tinted . A buzzard turned a few slow wheels in the sky , and drifted upward . The dogs promenaded the banks . " It 's time we ate fish , " said Virgil . On a wide sandbar on which seashells lay they dragged up the haul and built a fire . Then for a long time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doc , they cooked and ate catfish . They ate until the Malones groaned and all the Doylcs stretched out on their faces , though for long after Sam and Robbie Bell sat up to their own little table on a cypress stump and ate on and on . Then they all were silent and still and one by one fell asleep . " There ai n't a thing better than fish , " muttered William Wallace . He lay stretched on his back in the glimmer and shade of trampled sand . His sunburned forehead and cheeks seemed to glow with fire . His eyelids fell . The shadow of a willow branch dipped and moved over him . " There is nothing in the world as good as . . fish . The fish of Pearl River . " Then slowly he smiled . He was asleep . But it seemed almost at once that he was leaping up , and one by one up sat the others in their ring and looked at him , for it was impossible to stop and sleep by the river . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Virgil , setting his head on one side . " The excursion is the same when you go looking for your sorrow as when you go looking for your joy , " said Doc . But William Wallace answered none of them anything , for he was leaping all over the place and all over them and the feast and the bones of the feast , trampling the sand , up and down , and doing a dance so crazy that he would die next . He took a big catfish and hooked it to his belt-buckle and went up and down , so that they all hollered , and the tears oflaughter streaming down his cheeks made him put his hand up , and the two days ' growth of beard began to jump out , bright red . But all of a sudden there was an even louder cry , something almost like a cheer , from everybody at once , and all pointed fingers moved from William Wallace to the river . In the center of three light-gold rings across the water was lifted first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a voice cried ) and then in an undulation loop after loop and hump after hump of a long dark body , until there were a dozen rings of ripples , one behind the other , stretching all across the river , like a necklace . " The King of the Snakes ! " cried all the Maloncs at once , in high tenor voices and leaning together . " The King of the Snakes , " intoned old Doc , alone in his profound bass . " He looked you in the eye . " William Wallace stared hack at the King of the Snakes with all his might . It was Brucie that darted forward , dangling his little thread with the pin tied to it , going toward the water . " That 's the King of the Snakes ! " cried Grady , who always looked after him . Then the snake went down . The little boy stopped with one leg in the air , spun around on the other , and sank to the ground . " Git up , " Grady whispered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He went off whistling . Git up . It was n't a thing but the King of the Snakes . " Brucie 's green eyes opened , his tongue darted out , and he sprang up ; his feet were heavy , his head light , and he rose like a bubble coming to the surface . The thunder like a stone loosened and rolled down the bank . They all stood unwilling on the sandbar , holding the net . In the eastern sky were the familiar castles and the round towers to which they were used , gray , pink , and blue , growing darker and filling with thunder . Lightning flickered in the sun along their thick walls . But in the west the sun shone with such a violence that in an illumination like a long-prolonged glare of lightning the heavens looked black and white ; all color left the world , the goldenness of everything was like a memory , and only heat , a kind of glamour and oppression , lay on their heads . The thick heavy trees on the other side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a wind touched each man on the forehead . At the same time there was a very long roll of thunder that began behind them , came up and down mountains and valleys of air , passed over their heads , and left them listening still . With a small , near noise a mockingbird followed it , the little white bars of its body flashing over the willow trees . " We are here for a storm now , " Virgil said . " We will have to stay until it 's over . " They retreated a little , and hard drops fell in the leathery leaves at their shoulders and about their heads . " Magnolia 's the loudest tree there is in a storm , " said Doe . Then the light changed the water , until all about them the woods in the rising wind seemed to grow taller and blow inward together and suddenly turn dark . The rain struck heavily . A huge tail seemed to lash through the air and the river broke in a wound of silver . In silence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tree , which in the push of the storm rose full of a fragrant and unyielding weight . Where they all stared , past their tree was another tree , and beyond that another and another , all the way down the bank of the river , all towering and darkened in the storm . " The outside world is full of endurance , " said Doc . " Full of endurance . " Robbie Bell and Sam squatted down low and embraced each other from the start . " Runs in our family to get struck by lightnin ' , " said Robbie Bell . " Lightnin ' drawed a pitchfork right on our grand-. pappy 's cheek , stayed till he died . Pappy got struck by some bolts of light-nin ' and was dead three days , dead as that-there axe . " There was a succession of glares and crashes . " This'n 's goin ' to be either me or you , " said Sam . " Here come a little bug . If he go to the left , it 's me , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next Hare a big tree on the hill seemed to turn into fire before their eyes , every branch , twig , and leaf , and a purple cloud hung over it . " Did you hear that crack ? " asked Robbie Bell . " That were its bones . " " Why do you little niggers talk so much ! " said Doc . " Nobody 's profiting by this information . " " We always talks this much , " said Sam , " but now everybody so quiet , they hears us . " The great tree , split and on fire , fell roaring to earth . Just at its moment of falling , a tree like it on the opposite bank split wide open and fell in two parts . " Hope they ai n't goin ' to be no balls of fire come rollin ' over the water and fry all the fishes with they scales on , " said Robbie Bell . The water in the river had turned purple and was filled with sudden currents and whirlpools . The little willow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another down the bank and breaking under the storm . A great curtain of wet leaves was borne along before a blast of wind , and every human being was covered . " Now us got scales , " wailed Sam . " Us is the fishes . " " Shut up , little old colored children , " said Virgil . " This is n't the way to act when somebody takes you out to drag a river . " " Poor lady 's ghost , I bet it is scareder than us , " said Sam . " All I hoping is , us do n't find her ! " screamed Robbie Bell . William Wallace bent down and knocked their heads together . After that they clung silently in each other 's arms , the two black heads resting with wind-filled cheeks and tight-closed eyes one upon the other , until the storm was Over . " Right over yonder is Dover , " said Virgil . " We 've come all the way . William Wallace , you have walked on a sharp rock and cut your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town looked somehow like new . The wavy heat of late afternoon came down from the water tank and fell over everything like shiny mosquito-netting . At the wide place where the road was paved and patched with tar it seemed newly embedded with Coca-Cola tops . A few wet wagons and cars stood like a sparkling puzzle down the middle of the street . The old circus posters on the store were nearly gone , only bits , the snowflakes of white horses , clinging to its side . Morning-glory vines started almost visibly to grow over the roofs and cling round the tics of the railroad track , where blucjays lighted on the rails , and umbrella chinaberry trees hung heavily over the whole town dropping their first fall berries on to the tin roofs . Each with his counted fish on a string , the members of the river-dragging party walked through the town . They went toward the town well , and there was Hazel 's mother 's house , but no sign of her yet , coming out . They all drank a dipper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the street . Even the bench in front of the store was empty . But something told them somebody had come , for after one moment people began to look out of the store and out of the post office . All the bird dogs woke up to see such a large number of men and boys materialize suddenly with such a big catch of fish , and they ran out barking . The bluejays flashed up from the track and screeched above the town , whipping through their tunnels in the chinaberry trees . In the caf ? a nickel clattered inside a music-box and a love song began to play . The whole town of Dover began to throb in its wood and tin , like an old tired heart , when the men MAGAZINE walked through once more , coming around again and going down the street carrying the fish , so drenched , exhausted , and muddy that no one could help but admire them . William Wallace walked through the town as though he did not see anybody or hear anything . Yet he carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seen by all . Virgil came next , imitating William Wallace exactly , then the modest Doyles crowded by the Malones , who were holding up their alligator , tossing it in the air , even , like a father tossing his child . Following behind and pointing authoritatively at the ones in front strolled Doc , with Sam and Robbie Bell still chanting in his wake . In and out of the whole little line Grady and Brucie jerked about . Grady , with his head ducked , and stiff as a rod , walked with a springy limp ; it made him look forever angry and unapproachable . Under his breath he was whispering , " Sty , sty , git out of my eye , and git on somebody passing by . " He traveled on with narrowed shoulders , and kept his eye unerringly upon his little brother , wary and at the same time proud , as though he held a flying June bug on a string . Brucie , making a twanging noise with his lips , had shot forth again , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , running in circles round William Wallace pointing to his fish . A frown of pleasure like the print of a bird 's foot was stamped between his faint brows , and he trotted in some unknown realm of delight . " Did you ever see so many fish ? " said the people in Dover . " How much are your fish , mister ? " " Would you sell your fish ? " " Is that all the fish in Pearl River ? " " How much you sell them all for ? Everybody 's ? " " Three dollars , " said William Wallace suddenly . The Malones were upon him and shouting , but it was too late . And just as William Wallace was taking the money in his hand , Hazes mother walked solidly out of her front door and saw it . " You ca n't head her mother off. , " said Virgil . " Here she comes in full bloom . " But William Wallace turned his back on her , and on them all , for that matter , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun went down , Doc climbed his back steps , sat in his chair on the back porch where he sat in the evenings , and lighted his pipe . William Wallace hung out the net and came back and Virgil was waiting for him , so they could say good-evening to Doc . All in all , " said Doc , when they came up , " I 've never been on a better river-dragging , or seen better behavior . If it took catching catfish to move the Rock of Gibraltar , I believe this outfit could move it . " " We did n't catch Hazel Jamieson , " said Virgil . " What did you say ? " asked Doc . " He do n't really pay attention , " said Virgil . " I said , ' We did n't catch Hazel . ' " " Who says she was to be caught ? " asked Doc . " She was n't in there . Girls do n't like the water  --  remember that . Girls do n't just haul off and go jumping in rivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . " " Did n't you ever think she was in there ? " asked William Wallace . " Not once , " said Doc . " He 's just smart , " said Virgil , putting his hand on William Wallace 's arm . " It 's only because we did n't find her that he was n't looking for her . " " I 'm beholden to you for the net , anyway , " said William Wallace . " You 're welcome to borry it again , " said Doc . On the way home Virgil kept saying , " Calm down , calm down , William Wallace . " " If he was n't such an old skinny man I 'd have wrung his neck for him , " said William Wallace . " He had no business coming . " " He 's too big for his britches , " said Virgil . " Do n't nobody know everything . And just because it 's his net . Why does it have to be his net ? " " If it was n't for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive , " said William Wallace . " I guess he do n't really know nothing about wives at all ; his wife 's so deaf , " said Virgil . " He do n't know Hazel , " said William Wallace . " I 'm the only man alive knows Hazel : would she jump in the river or not , and I say she would . She jumped in because I was sitting on the back of my neck in a ditch singing , and that 's just what she ought to done . Doc ai n't got no right to say one word about it . " " Calm down , calm down , William Wallace , " said Virgil . " If it had been you that talked like that I 'd have broke every bone in your body , " said William Wallace . " Just let you talk like that . You 're my age and size . " " But I ai n't going to talk like that , " said Virgil . " What have I done the whole time but keep this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You could n't have drug the river a foot without me . " " What are you talking about ! " cried William Wallace . " This was n't your river-dragging ! It was n't your wife ! " He jumped on Virgil and they began to fight . " Let me up . " Virgil was breathing heavily . " Say it was my wife . Say it was my river-dragging . " " Yours ! " Virgil was on the ground with William Wallace 's hand putting dirt in his mouth . " Say it was my net . " " Your net ! " " Get up then . " They walked along getting their breath . On a hill William Wallace looked down , and at the same time there went drifting by the sweet sounds of music outdoors . They were having the Sacred Harp Sing on the grounds of an old white church glimmering there at the crossroads , far below . He stared away as if he saw it minutely , as if he could see a lady in white take the flowered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little slant in the shade , dust the keys , and start to pump and play . . . . He smiled faintly , as he would at his mother , and at Hazel , and at the singing women in his life , now all one young girl standing up to sing under the trees the oldest and longest ballads there were . Virgil told him good-night and went into his own house and the door shut on him . When he got to his own house , William Wallace saw to his surprise that it had not rained at all . But there , curved over the roof , was something he had never seen before as Iong as he could remember , a rainbow at night . In the light of the moon , which had risen again , it looked small and of gauzy material , like a lady 's summer dress , a faint veil through which the stars showed . He went up on the porch and in at the door , and all exhausted he had walked through the front room and through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he smiled , as if no matter what he might have hoped for in his wildest heart , it was better than that to hear his name called out in the house . The voice came out of the bedroom . " What do you want ? " he yelled , standing stock-still . Then she opened the bedroom door with the old complaining creak and there she stood . She was not changed a bit . " How do you feel ? " he said . " I feel pretty good . Not too good , " Hazel said , looking mysterious . " I cut my foot , " said William Wallace , taking his shoe off to show the blood . " How in the world did you do that ? " she cried , with a step back . " Dragging the river . But it do n't hurt any longer . " " You ought to have been more careful , " she said . " Supper 's ready and I wondered if you would ever come home , or if it would be last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen , " she said and ran away from him . After supper they sat on the front steps a while . " Where were you this morning when / came in ? " asked William Wallace when they were ready to go in the house . " I was hiding , " she said . " I was still writing on the letter . And then you tore it up . " " Did you watch me when I was reading it ? " " Yes , and you could have put out your hand and touched me , I was so close . " But he bit his lip and gave her a little tap and slap and then turned her up and spanked her . " Do you think you will do it again ? " he asked . " I 'll tell my mother on you for this ! " " Will you do it again ? " " No ! " she cried . " Then pick yourself up off my knee . " It was just as if he had chased her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his arm . It was the same as any other chase at the end . " I will do it again if I get ready , " she said . " Next time will be different too . " Then she was ready to go in and rose up and looked out from the top step , out across the yard where the chinaberry tree was and beyond , into the dark fields where the lightning-bugs flickered away . He climbed to his feet too and stood beside her , with the frown on his face , trying to look where she looked . And after a few minutes she took him by the hand and led him into the house , smiling as if she were smiling down on him .
