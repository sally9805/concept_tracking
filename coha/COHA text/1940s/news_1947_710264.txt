txt BOARD DEFERS VOTE ON AIRPORTS PLANS Experts ' Report Attacks Port Authority Proposal , Urges Continued City Operation By ROBERT W. POTTER The Board of Estimate received cautiously yesterday a strong report from its special three-man committee of legal , financial and engineering experts that recommended that the city continue to operate and improve its three airports and listed many legal objections to the plan under which the Port of New York Authority offered to take over the airports . The board once more deferred decision . Mayor O'Dwyer , with the consent of the board , appointed Controller Lazarus Joseph and Corporation Counsel Charles E. Murphy as a committee to try to reach an agreement with the Port ' Authority on the objections raised . The only change in the confused situation that this move appeared to make was that the Board of Estimate had come out into the open in a move to bring the Port Authority to terms on points on which private negotiation had failed . No time was set by the board for taking final action on the same old choice  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt with the offer of the City Airport Authority , no time was given to it in the open.session of the board . The report , as presented by Mr : Murphy , said th%t the city could develop Idlewilc Airport as a six runway field , open up Floyd Ben // net Field for operations and make the necessary extensive repairs and improvements to La Guardia Field ? all within the limits of the capital budget . It has been the contention of the Port Authority and the airlines that the city could not swing the financing necessary for completion of Idlewild and repairs to La Guardia . Legal Objections Presented Legal objections to the Port Authority plan , which contemplates an additional expenditure of $198 , - 656,000 , were that the city 's rights would not be protected because the lease would give in effect all control over the airports to the authority for 100 years and that the authority by statute is immune from suit by the city to compel it to live up to the contract . Mr. Murphy told the board that the authority has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deems necessary to safeguard the city 's interests . These amendments would have to be made , he said , in legislation pending before the New York and New Jersey Legislatures that would authorize the authority to take over and operate municipal airports . The New York Legislature has passed the bills and is working to adjourn today . When this was pointed out to Mr. Murphy after the hearing , he said he believed a special session would be necessary to effect an immediate change . The committee report was received first by the board in executive session and was discussed for nearly three hours . Then , more than an hour after the 4 o'clock starting time scheduled for the open session , the members filed into the Board of Estimate room . Most of an audience had grown tired and gone away . Authority 's Immunity Stressed At the request of the Mayor , the Corporation Counsel , standing outside the rail , began reading the first part of the report .

Mr. Murphy said that as a sovereign instrumentality of two states the Port Authority " enjoys complete immunity from suit in the courts , " and that this immunity has been upheld ay state and Federal courts . It is also immune from state and municipal regulation , he said . In effect , he said , the lease proposed was a ninety-nine-year lease . The city , he said , does not have the authority to lease its property for so long a time , but the pending legislation would enable it to do so . The city would have no power of enforcement of the terms of the lease , he continued , except that it would have the right to an action for a judgment to determine the amount , if any , owed by the authority to the city . The authority would pay the amount only if it had funds available , which it alone could determine , he said . Under the lease the city would have no right of re-entry or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , would give the city any power to enforce any agreement it made with the authority . It would have no power of fiscal inspection , no control over rents , fees , construction or operation . The proposed abandonment of Floyd Bennett Field , Mr. Murphy said , was " indefensible , " as $30,000,000 was invested in the field . Amendments Explained Mr. Murphy said that Port Authority officials had objected to a proposed amendment to pending state legislation that would give the city ? possible relief against the authority in the event of a dispute , on the grounds that it would affect the marketability of the authority 's proposed airport bonds and might reflect on its traditional claim of immunity from suit . But the city feels the amendment is essential , he said . The city also contended that the authority should be subject to state and municipal laws and regulations governing construction , maintenance , zoning , fire and police protection , in so far as operation of the airports was concerned . But the authority officials held this , too , would affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Mr. Murphy had been hailed by Mayor O'Dwyer as a synthesis and analysis of all the manifold reports and studies made on the city 's airport problem . It was prepared by Mr. Murphy , John C. Riedel , chief engineer of the Board of Estimate , and Deputy Transportation Commissioner WilliP.M . ' Reid , a finance expert . Mr. Murphy stressed the flexibility of the opening recommendation , which was as follows : " It is recommended that the City of New York itself continue to operate , maintain and improve its airport facilities for the next few years , or until such time as your board has before it actual facts and scientific data which are sufficiently certain , definite , reliable and comprehensive upon which a longrange plan may be based and effectuated . " It said statistics and figures on the needs of airport facilities in the future were greatly at variance and that consequently no " grandiose " plan should be entered into at this time .

In analyzing the financial aspects of the Port Authority plan the report said that the indicated annual revenue at La Guardia . Field was now more than $1,000 , - 000 and that in return for giving this up , by turning the three fields over to the authority , the city would get only $350,000 a year to 1960 . Howard S. Cullman , chairman of the Port of New York Authority , said last night that the Authority " would be glad to sit down with the city authorities at any time and work this thing out " Neither he nor any spokesman for the Authority would discuss the detailed objections to the Port Authority 's plan raised by Corporation Counsel Murphy . While airline men also were equally unwilling to comment on yesterday 's action , some of them were described as delighted that the dispute had gone a step further toward solution . They believe the city 's financial situation makes it impossible for it to provide adequate facilities and that speed i providing them is essential to the community 's place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
