At almost the moment the massive Baruch report on reconversion problems ( see p. 79 ) reached Franklin D. Roosevelt 's desk last week it turned into a red-hot issue in the running fight between Congress and the President . This was the last thing that Author Baruch had expected . Though his report came out as opposed to a separate Office of Demobilization , the proposal of the Senate 's Postwar Planner Walter F. George , Baruch had honestly and significantly buttered up Congress throughout his 120-page tome . <P> To Walter George such talk was just cover-up stuff . ( Baruch 's literary interest in Congressional cooperation did seem at a minimum in sections recommending creation of two new high Federal reconversion posts . ) All the Senator saw was that Franklin Roosevelt had at hand a ready-made new opportunity to by-pass the Congress . <P> Thus , after a cool compliment to Baruch 's free-enterprise ideology , Senator George warmly advised the press that he and Baruch were unalterably at odds on " the question of whether the economic destiny of the country is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elected representatives of the people . " Grimly he added that his bill to make Congress the postwar boss would be introduced early this week . The bill 's coauthor , 100% New Dealer James Murray of Montana , merely mumbled something about " Mr. Baruch 's admirable report " and " the need for broad legislative action by the Congress . " <P> Offense . To make matters worse , it became apparent that Baruch , Hancock &; Co. had inadvertently offended another potent political force . Their warmhearted words about " the human problems " of reconversion contained no mention of consultation with labor , no specific recommendations on dismissal pay for workers , etc. , though it did contain a detailed blueprint for paying off war contractors . <P> To the White House came angry we-want-in letters from union leaders . Nonetheless the Soldier 's President this week signed a sheaf of papers designed to implement the Baruch report by strictly unilateral executive order . <P> These alarums &; excursions were ironic wormwood to Elder Statesman Baruch , whose political philosophy is a good deal closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Throughout his report Baruch had repeatedly cautioned the U.S. against divisive pressure-group politics . He had labored valiantly to present a set of policies that would impress Congress and the nation without depressing the President , to whom his report was of necessity addressed . But he forgot the one great issue that transcends all others in 1944 Washington , D.C. Implacably Republican Senator Arthur Vandenberg blurted it out at week 's end : " It would be very tragic if we had to detour into that sort of fundamental conflict between the Legislature and the Executive . But I see no insuperable conflict between them - unless the Fourth-Term dynasty has ideas . "
