The time-honored precedent of making a top party politician the Postmaster General of the U.S. got its bow from President Truman . To replace Postmaster General Frank C. Walker , the President appointed jut-chinned , 42-year-old Bob Hannegan , who had risen to the top of the Democratic National Committee in twelve years from a start as a Committeeman in St. Louis ' 21st Ward . <P> But the precedent of appointing professional Army &; Navy officers as Presidential aides was broken . President Truman had already replaced Colonel Richard Park Jr . of the regular Army with Colonel Harry H. Vaughan , emergency officer and World War I comrade of Captain Harry S. Truman , Battery D , 129th Field Artillery . Last week the President announced that his new Naval aide ( replacing Vice Admiral Wilson Brown ) was Captain James K. Vardaman . <P> Reserve Officer Vardaman , 50-year-old son of the late rabble-rousing Senator James K. Vardaman of Mississippi , is a St. Louis lawyer , banker and shoe manufacturer ( Vardaman Shoe Co . ) . He was also commander of Battery A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truman , that was a recommendation too .
