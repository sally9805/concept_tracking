How to Float a Loan <P> Sirs : <P> ... In our rural retreat we have time to mull over our contacts with French people of all casts and classes , and to ponder over the events which are plunging our unfortunate country in the depths of despair . We wonder that no one has come forward to say that if the Government of France is poor and reduced to expedients , it is because the war-weary people have lost confidence and interest . Though they sadly need the aid that the U.S. might proffer , they know that it is not reasonable of such a government to ask it . But we feel certain that if the U.S. Government or any responsible organization would float an American loan in France , at almost any exchange rate , and almost any interest , it would be covered overnight by the French people , who would thus guarantee the sums necessary to provide what they so greatly need . . . . <P> <P> ( NAME WITHHELD ) Poncey-sur-L'Ignon France <P> Brooks 's Union Suits <P> Sirs : <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generals ' uniforms , or for that matter all Union uniforms , particularly privates ' , were the ugliest , bulkiest misfits of all military history ? Far snappier were those of the Confederate officers . <P> <P> JOHN F. O'CONNELL Andover , Mass . <P> I Snappier , but not so winning. - ED . <P> <P> What 's Wrong with the Army ? <P> Sirs : <P> . . . During this entire war the War Department has , by its actions and activities , acknowledged poor morale in the enlisted man 's ranks . Some of the possible causes of this trouble : <P> The vacillating policies of the Selective Service Board in Washington and the local draft boards . . . . <P> The E.M . frequently found that his officers were considerably less intelligent than he ... but had more extensive facilities for living and recreation . . . . <P> E.M . with a pay of less than $100 a month often worked side by side with physically fit but deferred civilians drawing $3,200 per annum . . . . <P> The personal actions of officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ E.M . ... If an officer becomes particularly odious , his superiors merely transfer him . ... Punishment of officers is considered oldfashioned . . . . <P> I recommend the following changes : <P> 1 ) Reduce the types of physical disability which cause deferment to a point where any man who can hold any job in civilian life will be inducted if there is a similar activity in the Army . <P> 2 ) Do not change draft board regulations without giving all men previously inducted an opportunity for release from the Army if the new regulations would exempt them from service . <P> 3 ) Eliminate civilian employes in military establishments where enlisted personnel are employed . <P> 4 ) Select officers for candidate schools and for promotion to a higher grade on the basis of : a ) a verbal examination by three disinterested field-grade officers chosen for this special work and assigned permanently to this activity ; b ) a written examination ; and c ) the recommendations of the immediate commanding officer with emphasis on the individual 's ability to get along with men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War promptly and with justice . This . . . will necessitate a thorough cleansing of the War Department in its highest branches . . . . <P> <P> ( SIGNAL CORPS CAPTAIN 'S
