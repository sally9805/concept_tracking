NIGHT FLIGHT A Story JOSEPHINE W. JOHNSON B EATING slowly , a little wearily back across the long Kansas pastures , Joe thought it all over and decided it was good . Almost the real thing . He thought of her face when she had finally seen him sitting there on the bed , and forgot the creeping ache in his arms as he shot on forward . Only five hundred miles to go , but the air had the warning cold of dawn . He smiled a little to himself . God , the things that a woman thought of to do before she let herself go to bed 1 And the nightgowns she wore when he was n't there ! ? long-sleeved cotton , with buttons down the front . She 'd looked like a cute little shoebox in it . And the ironing , ironing , ironing , while he 'd paced up and down half-wild , and she 'd stood there mashing down a tablecloth , pleating up a skirt , looking straight at him and not knowing he was there . Then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken off her shoes He 'd noticed how little her feet looked in the damp stockings with three runs up the side . Then she 'd got up and gone to the icebox and made herself a little sandwich of bread and butter and a slice of cold sweet potato , and drunk some milk straight out of the bottle , and wiped her mouth on her sleeve . It had made him hungry and he 'd almost reached over her shoulder andgrabbed a cold slice of ham , but remembered Polocheck 's warning just in time : " Do n't cat , Joe . Do n't drink . You might ground yourself coming back . It has happened . " He had shaken his head in an ominous and warning way , and in his silence Joe read some unspeakable fate . Then Charlotte had puttered and puttered and puttered . Washing her stockings and hanging them first in one place and then in another , and brushing her lovely , thick black hair and looking at herself in the mirror to see how much bigger she 'd got round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid making faces at herself and whispering . He loved her so much he thought his heart would crack , and then he thought he would let loose and crack her too if she did n't quit dawdling . Then , finally , she 'd turned out the lights and sat down on the bed facing west , and looked out at the moon and spoken his name once or twice , and that was all the praying she seemed to do ; and then she 'd gone to sleep and found him there . " Jesus ! " Joe said quietly to the Kansas prairies , " she was sure surprised ! " It had n't taken as much explaining though as he 'd expected . Apparently she had thought of it too and wanted him to teach her how . But he 'd said no , he was n't going to have her flying around at night , and besides , his bunk was n't very big , and for God 's sake suppose they had a night alarm and inspection . " This is n't like the Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's for adults only , and all of those adults male . " She had thought him wonderful to have learned so quickly , and since she pointed it out he realized it was pretty wonderful , come to think of it . This was only Monday , and Sunday morning Polocheck had told him of his dream . " . . . And in the dream I ran from these dogs  --  but I see no reason why I ran . I could have flown . " He looked at Joe and slowly lifted his glass of beer . " I often fly . " " Home ? " " Home to Czechoslovakia . " He looked calmly into Joe 's grinning eyes . " Tonight when it is dark I will teach you how . " He raised a round , warning hand above his glass : " Hush . " His blue eyes glittered behind his glasses : " We want no more fliers . The nights are wide and peaceful now . " Joe had leaned forward and whispered behind hi- hand : " When ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many know ? " " Some . " " Who ? " Josef 's eyes had twinkled . " You would be surprised . " " Okay , " Joe said . It had been a bad morning . He wanted to forget it . Even acting like nuts out in the middle of the desert in a madman 's prank was preferable to remembering . " It was n't so much that it happened to me , " he growled into her warm and patient ear , " but that it could happen at all ! The fool  --  the damn young fool ! " He re-enacted the scene . The Major 's office , young pudgy Major Lewis whose wife once offered Joe a bag of peanuts and who summered in New England and earlyautumned in New York . It had all been trivial and nasty . The matter of a desk . The desk drawer stuck , and the Major wanted another desk and he knew where another was , He wanted it moved in , and his own desk moved out , and he needed a truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communications all over the place . Joe had been standing there and listening and finally he said : " Why do n't you just have the desk drawer fixed ? " Somewhere along the line he had put in a " sir . " And the Major had turned with his vapid young face suddenly interesting with hate , and shouted : " Who spoke to you ? Wait till you 're spoken to , soldier ! " Well , that was that . But it was there like a ten-word brand . ? . . . And then I just went out with Josef , and he showed me how . . . " " You learned so quickly , darling ! " She had looked at him with love and adoration . Sometimes Charlotte got God and Joe confused . He laughed and hugged her and muttered that it was something that any fool could do . He told her how it had felt , his spirit slipping quietly between the beds , shuffling out into the moonlight desert . .. . He had paused and taken in the incomparable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow-streaked peaks , beautiful and barren in the white moonlight . The clean icy air poured down his lungs . All round him the silent tarboard barracks and the sand , sleeping in the great white flooded light . The army trucks huddled row on row like shrouded beasts . Quietly Joe had lifted one long arm and then the other . He whirled them round like a ship 's propeller , and felt the blood race through his veins . " Contact , " he whispered , grinning . Then , warmed up , he had started taxiing across the sand , his long mountain legs casting wild shadows from the moon . He aimed for the eastern fence and planned to take off and soar above the spiked wire in a gesture of derision . But halfway down the road he slowed down suddenly and crouched . By shadowy sound his spirit 's sensitive ears detected another traveler , and he whirled and flattened against a barracks building . From a door of the officers ' quarters a short and heavy form came striding , and paused in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing only the dry , unspeaking sand , the bright expressionless autumn moon , seemed satisfied . Over his face came a silly , expectant look , and his mouth opened and shut like a toad devouring flies . After a few minutes Joe realized that the Major was singing as he flailed his arms and warmed up for the flight : " From the desert I come to thee , " he was singing , " On a stallion shod with fire . . " " Oh , my God , " Joe muttered . " Oh , my God . " Then the Major was running , beating his arms in perfect form , and heading for the gate with terrific speed . Breathless , Joe watched him and saw him suddenly leap , click his heels together and soar upward with a roar like a little four-engine bomber . The perfect take-off of long practice . Joe sighed with envy and slid out from the shadow . " Bastard , " he murmured . " Bastard ! " Then his eyes filled with a deep and cynical scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not toward the high towers of Manhattan , which seemed an odd thing for a man whose wife never went farther westward than Hot Springs , Virginia . " From the desert I come to thee , " Joe whinnied derisively , " On a stallion shod with fire . " He stamped his big feet in the sand . " Did I speak to you ? " he muttered fiercely . " Wait till you 're spoken to , soldier ! " A flame of intolerable hate flared up in him and then he remembered it was growing late , and started to run , forgetting the Major and concentrating with all his might on Polocheck 's lesson and his warnings : " Flail those arms . Pick up the feet . Then jump  --  so  --  leap . Beat . Beat . Right , left , together : a comet for the sky . " Watch you level off ! " Polocheck had warned him . " Once I forgot . My God , the stars ! " He had leveled off then and flown eastward in the moonlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the dry autumn fields of Colorado , the bony creek beds twisting whitely , the forms of sleeping cattle soaked in moonlight . The cold pure air whistled by his ears . It was an extraordinary and exhilarating experience . He felt as though he had been doing it all his life , and wanted to try a nose dive just for the hell of it . Josef was too cautious . " Keep level , " he 'd said . " Do n't fuss round . You got to go fast . " But Indiana was n't Europe , and Joe turned down his right hand , raised his left , and bore down with a mighty rush . The cattle lifted up stricken faces and poured over the pastures , their wet hooves glittering . Joe grinned and swept on eastward . Above the SoIbtrion River he had hit an air pocket and dropped downward with a sickening rush , but recovered himself and pulled up again , beating his way above the cold , scaly water , the river smell chilling his throat . Sometimes he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers passing , but was not sure . Not till he pulled past Topeka , lights burning like a handful of embers on a plain , did he meet another nocturnal flier close enough to speak . Here he was overtaken by a young Negro sergeant bound for Carolina and traveling fast . Joe acknowledged his coming with a right-arm sweep and motioned as though to shake his hand . " Cold , Sergeant ? " " Cold ! " " Been at this flying long ? " " Learned last week . Been home every night since . " He laughed as at something secret and very pleasant . " First flight for me , " Joe said . " I do n't know how it 'll be . Not sure of all the rules . " The sergeant laughed . " Me neither . " He winged in closer . " You learn something new every time . Las ' night I landed late and I walked up the backyard after my wife was asleep  --  she ca n't see you till she sleeps  --  and the lights were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see everything white , and the moonflowers hanging on the fence . Well , I walk up and past that old broken swing the kids still use , and suddenly I stop . I 'm not kidding you : I stopped like a man shot dead . And there , sitting down on the swing , scuffing his boots and looking all out of joints , was the mortal soul of my First Lieutenant ! " He laughed very loudly , and after a moment of uncertainty Joe laughed too . " He could n't get in ! " the sergeant gloated . " That 's one of the things you learn : She never thought about him . She did n't never know he was there ! " Joe took an exulting leap . " What 'd you do ? " The sergeant shrugged . " Jus ' let him swing . A man 's got a right to dream , I guess . He was gone when I come out again . Only a scuff place under the swing . " He laughed again . They flew on for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lights of St. Louis and the sluggish silvery mud of the Mississippi . " Here 's where I leave you , brother , " the sergeant said . " Take it slow and easy . Do n't eat . Do n't drink . And a long night to you ! " He was gone , winging darkly southward , and soon lost in the shadows . Not long now for Joe . Fly east , young man . Familiar hills and farmlands going under , but he could not see them well in the night . " I was sure afraid , " he told Charlotte . " I thought I 'd pass over and land in Brooklyn ! ' You 'll know , ' Josef kept telling mc , but I got the jitters . No map , no compass  --  how 'd 1 know Brownsville from Ashtabula ? " " How did you know ? " Charlotte whispered . He held her and laughed . There had been no question about his finding her . He had flown lower and lower , peering at highways and little billboards and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized that he was gliding slowly downward as in the grip of a thick , receding tide . " I just knew , " he said . Now , crossing the Kansas border and beating on , he knew he would find the camp all right , not by any love-gravity of the heart , but because it was so damn big that he could not miss it . He felt calm and happy . To-morrow was to-morrow , and to hell with yesterday . He saw the white , shining , snow-cold peaks and the canyoned towns . And then the camp stretched out far below him . There was n't much time , but he circled slowly above it , hunting hawklike for signs of some living thing on the outskirts of the plain . Then he saw what he was seeking . A mile westward from the camp , a small fat form , like a two-legged dusty beetle , scurried across the sand . Leisurely , heartlessly , like a falcon over a wounded hare , Joe circled nearer and lower . He knew the Major 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he drank too much , and a lot of other things too much , and he foundered all right , " he thought . " On the wings of the desert , I come to thee ! " Joe sang in a loud , sweet voice . He swooped low , and the wind of his swooping swept the Major 's hat from his round , blond head . It gleamed like a moonflower opening wide in the pale gray desert air . " Get a horse , Bud ! " Joe shouted coarsely . " Get a horse ! " Then happily Joe soared upward with firm , triumphant strokes and plummeted swiftly toward the barracks , taking care to avoid the soul of Josef , returning in haste from Europe , the dawn like a white Gestapo at his heels .
