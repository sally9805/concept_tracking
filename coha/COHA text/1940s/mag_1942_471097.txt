IT MAY well be that when the history of I human flight comes finally to be written in long-term perspective , it will consist of only three chapters with all the rest as footnotes . The first chapter might be about the Wrights and how they stabilized the wing , made it controllable , and harnessed machine power to it . The second chapter might well be about Howard Stark , the unhonored American who in 1930 discovered how to fly blind through clouds merely by the indications of some dials on the instrument board ; both modern airline flying and longdistance bombardment stem from his work . The third chapter might record how the airplane was finally tamed so that it became handy and obedient and foolproof , like the automobile or even more so , and fit for anybody to step right in and fly away . That taming has already been at least partly accomplished . And although the spotlight of urgent attention is now fixed on military aviation , and civilian flying has virtually come to a stop , the new developments are of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about them . For when the war is over they may affect you intimately . They may help to determine whether you fly your own flivver plane . In any case they will help to determine whether the hundreds of thousands of newly trained flyers will be able to continue flying , for business or recreation , without incessant practice and in reasonable safety . And they may be of utmost importance to the economic well-being ofthe whole nation , for they may determine whether our giant aircraft industry , with its hundreds of thousands of workers , will be able to produce a product salable in peacetime . There are a number of things that have so far kept the average man from flying his own ship ; but most of them boil down to the brutal fact that if he should make a mistake while doing it he would break his neck . Training , for instance , is too expensive and long-drawn-out ; but the accident record shows that at present you simply can not get away with skimpy training . Again , the small private airplanes to-day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real , railroadbeating , space-eating speed ; but designers have to keep them meek and mild , big-winged and therefore slow , in order to keep the risks of flying within bounds . Yet it has only been quite recently that attention has turned on the question of just how civilian pilots die . Within the aviation industry the subject used to be taboo . Accident record ? There was no such thing . There was only a safety record . A few attempts by aviation periodicals to report accidents and analyze their causes were promptly hushed up . The published government reports were unenlightening . Then a pilot named Leighton Collins ? who had been a salesman of small private airplanes and previously an insurance expert ? conceived the plan of air accident research as a private commercial enterprise , and started in 1938 a monthly information sheet devoted entirely to second-by-second descriptions of fatal air accidents : Air Facts . The grotesque publishing idea of selling an account of his demise to the prospective victim should by all the rules have been a flop ; instead , Air Facts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a sales appeal whose strength would be the envy of many a circulation manager : while about ten out of one thousand flyers die in crashes each year , the rate among Air Facts subscribers was 8 out of 1,000 the first year , 6 out of 1,000 the second year , 4 out of 1,000 the third year , and 2 out of 1,000 the fourth year . Air fact number one to emerge from Collins ' files is that a crash as such need by no means be fatal . Airplanes have cut swathes through forests , skidded through stone fences , landed on top of trees , and slid on to steep mountainsides with all the occupants surviving , though the ship was in most cases utterly wrecked . All that is needed to accomplish a safe crash landing is a chance to slither to a gradual stop , even if the slither is only for a few yards ; all that is needed to get that chance is that the pilot bring the ship down under control and hit the ground a glancing blow . An @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on rough terrain , just imagine that it is a beautiful airport and go ahead and make your landing . Such a crash landing is actually not unlike a ski-jumper 's manner of hitting the ground ; and the fact that such landings are not mortally dangerous is no more miraculous than that a man on two boards can survive being catapulted two hundred feet down a mountainside . Only if an airplane hits the ground nose first is the impact almost certainly fatal . For , as the vulgar airport saying goes , it is n't the coming down that kills ' em , it 's when they stop coming down . Of fatal accidents , there is virtually only one type which happens ? in three or four variations ? over and over again . It is the accidental stall or spin . Other types happen , but too rarely to matter : in private and miscellaneous flying there are a few cases each year of fire in the air , of mid-air collision at the training fields , of structural failure while doing acrobatics . In airline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severe icing , or by some mechanical failure , or by pilot error . That type of accident , the freak combination of bad luck and human fallibility , is hard to eradicate completely ; and equivalent misfortunes happen on railroads and highways . The characteristic flying accident , the one that has killed pilot after pilot and has kept the average man from flying his own airplane , is the stall and spin . For it is when it comes down in a stall or a spin that the airplane hits the ground nose first and stops right there . II A stall is n't what the word suggests . It is not a stoppage of the engine ; in fact not a stoppage of anything . It is a breakdown of the airflow that does the lifting work on the airplane 's wings , a sudden burbling that changes the smooth , powerful , lift-producing rush of air into a chaotic swirling of eddies that are impotent to hold the airplane up . It happens ? rather suddenly ? when you try to fly an airplane too slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply . In an automobile driver 's experience perhaps what feels most like it is the sudden loss of traction on a slippery pavement when he puts on his brakes too hard . In a car you lose your hold on the road and you skid . In an airplane you lose your hold on the air and you drop . Not like a stone , but fast enough to feel the bottom drop out from under you . For the first couple of seconds the ship sinks through the air flatly , " mushing " ; presently it noses down at forty-five degrees or so and it shivers and squirms and shakes and sinks even faster . A stall is actually easy to remedy , but not by the ordinary use of the controls ; the harder you pull back on the stick ? an action that ordinarily makes the plane nose up ? the more obstinately the ship continues its squashy , erratic descent , and it is almost certain to whip off into a spin ; but even when it does n't spin , if it hits the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to kill . The spin ? popularly called the tailspin ? is a more vicious form of the ordinary stall ; any gust , any error of control will turn a straight stall into a spin . In a spin one of the ship 's wings is burbled while the other regains its lift , and there results a motion that is like nothing else on earth . With the nose pointing steeply down , the ship twists down in a corkscrew pattern , and the harder you fight it by the ordinary use of the controls the more firmly you lock yourself in that motion . Just like the stall , the spin is not a simple drop ; it is more like a downward burrowing that is comparatively slow ; but like the stall , it brings you to the ground nose first and hard enough to kill . All this has long been fully understood . To get a pilot 's license you must show that you can spin and recover at will . You practice recoveries , not by shrinking back from depth , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trying to pull the nose up , you push it down into a dive , and then with speed regained and the airflow again smooth and powerful , you can level off with the greatest ease . Steering downward to stop a downward motion goes against the grain at first but constant practice makes it just another maneuver . Yet there has always been one deadly mystery about all this : if a spin is really so hard to get into and so easy to stop , then why do pilots keep spinning into the ground with such awful statistical regularity ? Not only beginners die that way : for example , a Western flying school sent an advanced student out alone ; when he did not return , an instructor flew to look for him and found the wreck somewhere in the hills ; the student had spun in . The instructor returned to report and took off again to circle over the wreck and guide the official investigators to the spot . They arrived just in time to watch him spin down on top of the student 's wreck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Facts ' detailed chronicling , we can now tell . We know , for one thing , that death sneaks up on a pilot . The context of the fatal accident ? astonishing though this may seem ? is usually gay ; the weather good , the engine running smoothly , the pilot having a good time gamboling around at low altitude , not stunting but just doing a few mild zooms and steep curves . He may be hunting coyotes or chasing wild horses . The student of that Western flying school was probably doing just that . He may be taking pictures , or perhaps he is calling down to friends on the ground to meet him at the airport with a car . Perhaps he is showing off his newly bought airplane to the airport boys ; perhaps he is taking the farmer 's daughter for a hop and giving her a few mild roller-coaster thrills . Or perhaps he is trying to prove his worth not to others but to himself . A young Marine who flies for sport on the side is told officially that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturday , in a rented ship , he spins in . Whatever the pilot 's personal reasons may be , the typical situation at the time of the accident is that he is flying low , where the air is often turbulent ; as Collins puts it , he is playing round in the surf of the air ocean . Furthermore , he is turning ; almost no fatal accidents happen out of straight flight . And finally , his attention is fixed on the ground instead of on his ship and any small warning signs the ship might give . This is what presumably pulled down that Western flying-school instructor : the intense interest with which he studied the wreck under him . What happens is that while the pilot 's attention is diverted the plane begins to stall , becomes lazy to obey the controls . By the time he notices the trouble , he does exactly the wrong thing . He tries to pull back into normal flight , and under these special circumstances this is the one thing that he should not do . Suppose that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lie down ! " by coming and jumping up on you , and the command " Come here ! " by lying down . Think how long it would take you to catch on to that " reversal of controls . " An airplane , in a stalled condition , develops exactly this sort of reverse obedience . Unfortunately though , an airplane even in sound flight rarely obeys the controls with mechanical strictness . It seems to have all sorts of ideas of its own . In turns , a good hefty pull on the controls is required merely to hold it where you want it . In turbulent air it sometimes takes quick thrusts of the stick to fight off the gusts . Just as you would with your dog , the pilot whose plane is beginning to stall suspects disobedience rather than control trouble . When , in a steeply banked turn , the nose suddenly wo n't stay on the horizon , but droops , and the wings start to capsize all the way over , he does not suspect that he is doing the wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the right thing , and tries to make the ship behave by a good hard angry jerk with the stick ? and the ship whips off . Why does n't he immediately discover his error , push the stick forward , and dive out of trouble , as he has trained himself to do ? It does happen , especially in very slow , very light ships , that the occupants survive a spin into the ground , and their testimony suggests that often the doomed pilot fails to recognize the spin . Such survivors are apt to report that the ship simply refused to fly or that there was some mechanical failure of the control system . Sometimes their first question is : " What happened ? " One student reports that he did two complete turns of a spin ? which in his type of ship meant a drop of perhaps eight hundred feet in perhaps ten seconds in a twisting motion that one might think would have been unmistakable ? he did all that before he realized : " Heck , this is a spin . Guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasting valuable time in a feeling of : " This is unfair . This ca n't be happening to me What finally keeps the pilot locked in the spin is probably a cramp of fear . Again we have the evidence of a few survivors and of many who bestirred themselves in the nick of time . " I knew I should n't pull that stick back so hard , but I just could n't help it . " One says : " I could think of only one thing : I must get that nose up . I must n't hit nose first . " Another remembers his terror when , with his ship making a motion as if to fall off into a spin , he realized : " I am now going to pull that stick back . / know it will be the last thing I ever do , but I will do it . " He did , and was lucky in that the ship 's motion was not a spin after all but merely the effect of a gust . To pull the stick back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the left in order to lift the right wing , is a reflex action a pilot uses perhaps ten times in every single minute of flight ; it becomes " instinctive . " In a stall or a spin it does n't work , but it is still " instinctive . " What happens to the pilot at this point you can study in mild miniature on one of those doors that open for you by action of an electric eye . Walk at it very briskly , and try to keep your step from hesitating , your arm from preparing to fend off ; and observe how your reflexes will override your knowledge and your will . To keep this from happening in a spin is the purpose of all the spin practice in flight training . But when you are practicing at a safe altitude you do not see at all vividly the main fact of the spin : that the ground is coming at you fast . The nose-down attitude is there and so is the dizzy wheeling but , as Collins puts it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until it starts coming . Get into a spin at 200 or 500 or even 1,000 feet , and it comes up at you like a blow . It is then that the self-preservation instinct and deeply ingrained reflexes overpower all judgment . It is then that many of the victims use the stick as if it were a crowbar , trying to pry the nose up ? use it with such fear-crazed strength that sometimes the controls are found bent . III That , then , is the mortal danger in flying : the reverse obedience of the airplane when slowed up and the pilot 's instinctive impulse to do the wrong thing in the emergency ? to pull the controls as far as they will go , and thus pull himself into a spin . Once this was clear it opened an entirely new approach to the problem of making the airplane behave . Round the airports the feeling had always been that if you wanted to sell airplanes to the lay public there would have to be airplanes that could fly more slowly without stalling . But this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in train wrecks the last car usually takes the heaviest punishment , and therefore proposed to make the railroad safer by simply leaving off the last car . As long as there is any bottom speed at which the airplane will stall , pilots will play round at the edge of the abyss and will finally fall into it . Consequently many competent airmen thought that the truly popular airplane would never come . The new approach was this : we do n't need an airplane that can fly slowly ; what we need is an airplane that can not be slowed up at all , or at least not enough for reverse obedience to develop . It was beautifully simple reasoning . An airplane , it went , always wants to go fast ; if slowed up , it wants to nose down and regain its speed . An airplane will never stall on its own volition . What stalls it is the pilot 's excessive manhandling of the controls . If you want to put a stop to the typical air accident simply put a stop quite literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that stops the further travel of the pilot 's hands and feet at the point where itbegins to invite a stall . If the pilot ca n't pull back any farther he ca n't slow himself up . If he does n't slow himself up he ca n't stall . If he does n't stall he ca n't spin ; if he does n't spin he wo n't die . It was a simple idea ; in practice , it took much tricky engineering to keep the restrictions from interfering with normal take-offs , maneuvers , and landings , and with that uninteresting but important side of piloting ? handling the ship on the ground . Some of the first experimental ships felt like ears without brakes . Others were so logy and slow that they were n't worth flying . Still others looked too strange for pilots ' tastes ; a fellow is just naturally conservative in picking an airplane to fly . The first restricted-control airplane that not only flew well but also sold well was the Stinson 105 , a three-place cabin job that cruised at 100 mph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( as small private ships go ) , and conventional except that the sting had been taken out : the nastier phases of the stall and all of the spin . About one thousand of them have been sold since 1939 . And did this " built-in safety " work ? Actually it is almost impossible to measure an airplane 's safety by statistics . Different airplanes appeal to different people : there are stodgy ones and flashy ones , young ones and old ones ; they arc used for different kinds of flying ? training , stunting , cross-country , etc . There are tricky airplanes that never kill a man because pilots hold them in respect , and easy-going ones that invite carelessness and then kill . Thus we ca n't say how many fatal accidents there " should " have been in the Stinson 105 's . But disregarding the control restrictions , those in the know would have expected perhaps twenty deaths to date . Actually , there have been three ? and two of these were freak cases . One pilot hit the ground while doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alleghenies and finally flew into a fog-covered mountainside . Only in one case was there loss of control resembling the usual type . And that is not to say that those ships have n't had the normal quota both of fooling round over girls ' houses and of emergencies . There have been cnginc failures over " impossible " terrain and all the usual " pilot error " type of accidents that have strewn those ships , just like those of other makes , into forests and gravel pits , rice fields and farm fences ; but they have always come down with their wings still maintaining a hold on the air ; they have always hit the ground a glancing blow and slithered to a stop . From pilots ' accounts we know that some of them came down in a typical accident manner with the controls clenched back as far as they would go ; but they did not crash nosefirst . It proves that we know now how to keep the pilot of the post-war air flivvers from killing himself . IV But then there was still the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controls only lifts the death penalty on sloppy piloting . It leaves the art of piloting itself almost untouched . To make an airplane go where you want it to go , sit down where you want it to sit , still takes more skill than the post-war airplane buyer probably cares to develop . And the penalty for incompetence is still a cracked-up ship . This problem too is solved . We have airplanes right now that make the skilled pilot with his expensively developed coordination , his highly refined sensitivity , his experienced eye , the master of a useless art . The brain work which did this was the same sort that had solved the fatality problem : detailed analysis . To say in a general way that conventional airplanes are difficult to handle makes no more sense than to say in a general way that they are dangerous . Much of the time there is literally nothing to flying . It is not merely as easy as driving a car , but much easier . At other times ? and they occur on every flight ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger factorwas finally found to be one small thing , namely , a certain motion of the pilot 's hand in a certain situation , so has the skill factor been broken down into specific detail . Take , for example , the turn . Almost half the time you spend in learning to fly goes into learning how to turn right and left . The conventional airplane has three separate controls . One , worked by fore and back motion of the stick , to steer the nose up and down ; one , worked by the right and left motions of the stick ( or in some ships by turning a wheel mounted atop the stick ) , to roll into right or left banks ; and one , worked by foot pedals , to swing the nose right or left . It sounds simple but it is n't . To make a turn to the right or left , to achieve , in other words , what in a car we achieve by the simple twist of the steering wheel , all three airplane controls must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right degree at exactly the right time , and each fading out again in exactly the right manner . A turn in an airplane is a highly skilled performance . Merely learning to make gentle ones safely enough so that you can solo uses up all of five hours ; in later training you learn to make tight ones , gliding ones , and climbing ones ; you endlessly practice figure eights to learn how to fly a turn correctly even in a strong wind ; how to fly one safely under all conceivable conditions that might take your attention off your work ? for instance , being silly with anxiety or doped with fatigue or fascinated as you look down at your girl 's house and watch her look up . And the fact that almost all fatal spin accidents develop from turns seems to prove that even all this training is not quite enough . Upon sharp diagnosis , the core of the trouble turns out to he distinct and small . It is " co-ordination " of handwork and footwork . Just when to put on foot pressure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just when to take it off again , the pilot is supposed to know by " feel , " an awareness of balance that pilots call simply " the feel of the seat of your pants . " Unfortunately for flying as an art but fortunately for flying as a popular means of getting about , the thing that this " saddle sense " feels out for the pilot can also be figured out ? and with more accuracy ? by the slide rule which dwells in the vest pocket of Fred E. Weick . Weick was a research scientist in the NACA Laboratories at Langley Field , Virginia ? the official U. S. Aeronautical Research Institute ? when he conceived the idea of an airplane designed radically and specifically for private flying . It had then never been done ; the very idea was so far off the beaten track of aviation research that it could not be an official project . Instead , Weick formed a club with some of his fellow-technicians . The designing was done co-operatively in the evenings and the construction ? in Weick 's garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , except for its slowness , the one-stroke solution to the whole problem of making the airplane behave . It not only had restricted controls ? being in fact the first plane to use the idea ; it not only had a new-fangled landing gear which will figure later in this account ; but it also had nothing for the pilot 's feet to do , nothing for the seat of his pants to sense . Weick had mathematically analyzed the supposedly elusive " feel " of a turn and designed a mechanical linkage between the various controls , which flies a turn more correctly than the best pilot can do it via the seat of his pants . To-day Weick is chief engineer of a firm that manufactures a sleek , commercial version of the same ship ? the Ercoupe . It is steered by turning a steering wheel , almost exactly like a car . It is probably the prototype of the postwar air flivver . Its most popular characteristic is its high speed : though it is so simple to fly , though it is spin-proof and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the standard light-plane engine , it cruises just as fast ( 100 mph ) as the fastest conventional light plane . It was formerly thought that speed and fool-proofncss were mutu ally exclusive ; and in the conventional airplane they tend to be so . Weick reasons that with restricted controls , simplified handling , etc. , the private flyer will be able at last to fly a ship that is fast and therefore useful as a means of transport . A first hop in an Ercoupe is a scary experience ? for the experienced pilot . His feet are frantically groping over the naked floorboards for something to push . The recommended remedy is to pull your legs up and sit on them , Oriental fashion . Then you can relax and discover that you have full control for all ordinary flight . You also realize that this new style of airplane would take care both of the ineptitude of some middle-aged office worker and of that cockiness of the young buck pilot which is aviation 's greatest risk factor . You try , for instance , steep turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some crazy , wrong-looking attitude ; but when you check your instruments you find it is doing a correct job of flying and that the seat of your pants and your eyes would have tricked you had you been allowed to do the " co-ordinating . " You try , say , a sharply twisting approach to a simulated forced landing . Swinging round in a tight curve , aiming perhaps for a certain small clearing in the wooded country under you , you suddenly miss your rudder pedals ; the ship wo n't let you get around quickly enough . Were this forced landing real and not simulated you would not make it into the clearing ; you would have to make ' a slithering crash landing in the brush . " No percentage in this , " you think , but that 's exactly what there is in it ? a statistical chance . For it is when you start tightening a turn unduly , or forcing it by excessive footwork , that in the conventional airplane you ask for a spin and an early death . Given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round this time ; but out of ten such attempts to force a turn one would certainly end in a spin . Any real , calm old-timer in such a situation would voluntarily refrain from doing what Weick restrains the scared one or the cocky one from trying . He would voluntarily land in the brush . The margin of control that is gone is a margin that the competent pilot does not use anyway . It is provided in the conventional airplane only for stunting , for the last phase of the landing , and for ground handling . The novice is of course not bothered by any of this . He does n't know better , or rather , he does n't know worse . As he sits down behind an Ercoupe 's steering wheel he is quite at home and he drives the ship down the field and up into the air and all over the countryside as if it were merely a super de luxe car . V Depending on the standards you apply , it takes from 50 to 200 hours to learn how to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used up in learning how to turn right and left , almost the whole other half goes into learning how to get down . Pilots judge one another 's competence almost entirely by the ability to set a ship down accurately into a small space . If that were not so difficult most other problems of flying would dissolve : engine trouble , for instance , bad weather , getting lost , getting caught by nightfall , running out of fuel . They all happen to the automobilist too , but to him they are mere nuisances . To the pilot , captive in the air , they are a constant strain merely by threatening to happen : he knows he ca n't get out and walk ; he ca n't ask his way , and no mechanic can fix him up unless he can first get down . This is not serious in airline flying where you have two engines and two pilots , familiar routes , and a fantastic fuel reserve ; where you have speed and power to climb over bad weather or detour around it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the itinerant private pilot it 's another story . Sometimes when there is no place to sit down , the relentless sinking of the gasoline gage , the gradual lowering of the ceiling , the deepening of the dusk can squeeze your soul until you wonder why you do n't sell your ship and enjoy life . Because landing is so difficult , cross-country flying always requires much planning , and it sometimes requires courage ? not the high-pitched courage of the low-altitude recovery from a spin , but the tenacious kind . Weick 's diagnosis of the problem of landing a plane turned long-accepted reasoning prettily upside down . Most people saw high speed as the trouble with an airplane landing . Since the airplane will stall if slowed up too much , contact with the ground must be made in fast forward motion , and that makes for a violent impact , a long landing roll , worse chances of misjudgment , and in case of a mishap , a more vicious crack-up . Hence the conventional landing gear is designed to touch the ground after the pilot has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is capable . Take , for instance , the familiar nose-high attitude of an airplane on the ground . It is the attitude of an airplane in very slow flight , just before it stalls . Take the " three-point " landing in which the tail wheel and the two main wheels touch the ground simultaneously : it is nothing but a gentle stall brought on while the ship floats a few inches above the runway . The accepted idea , in short , was that you can measure the fool-proofness of an airplane by its landing speed , or rather by its landing slowness . While an airliner 's slowest possible landing is at 65 mph , which is considered too fast for the business man flyer to handle , present light planes land at 35 , and this is considered the main reason why , in the past few years , all sorts of people have proved able to handle them . But if you really want to see the public take to flying ? so the accepted reasoning went ? wait till we get a ship that lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first place , he reasoned , a slow-landing airplane is a slow-flying one and hence is not so useful . In the second place , it is not really landing speed that troubles us . With modern tires , shock absorbers , and brakes in the landing gear and with a pair of American , highwayexperienced eyes in the pilot 's head , a mere 35 or 40 miles per hour on a spacious airport can not really trouble a public that manages 80 on narrow highways . What makes landing difficult , he reasoned , is actually the slowness of the three-point landing ; more precisely , the fine timing , feel , and eye required to perform a slow , three-point landing and not come to grief in the process . For if the pilot misjudges and allows the ship to touch the ground before its wings are beginning to stall , the landing gear ? by forcing him into that nose-high attitude ? gives a new lift to his wings and back he goes into the air to stall 10 or 20 feet up and come down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really an involuntary take-off followed by a stall . If the pilot misjudges and stalls the ship while it is still too high he gets a " dropped in " landing that jars his teeth ; or even a " pancake " landing that flattens his landing gear and costs a pretty penny . And even that is n't all of the difficulty : if the pilot approaches the landing in too fast a glide he will float clear across the landing field before the ship is ready to settle to the ground ; the ensuing landing roll will likely take him into the airport fence and break his propeller . And if he should try to stop it by putting on his wheel brakes too hard he will nose over and wreck his ship . If , on the other hand , he tries to swindle his way across the trees and telephone wires at the field 's edge in too slow an approachglide , he will sooner or later stall his ship , come down nose-first , and break his neck . What the flying public really needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow the pilot to make contact at any speed he chooses , even at high speed when there is a lot of potential lift left in the wings ( as pilots put it , you want to be able to " burn it on hot " ) ; and that will allow him then to put on his brakes hard and kill his speed on the ground . Glider pilots had developed the same idea independently . Gliders , with their big wings , can land very slowly ? at 25 or even 20 miles per hour -- yet glider pilots prefer to dive at the ground , flare out and skim on at high speed ; some of them use more speed in the actual landing than they use for cruising around aloft . Airline pilots too have said good-by to the three-point landing ; with the strong inhibition that any experienced pilot has against stalling his ship , they just ca n't contemplate stalling their twelve-ton monsters down on to the runway , threepoint fashion ; they fly them down with plenty of speed and burn them on " hot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and much safer , but with the usual landing gear it requires extra skill . To make the same sort of landing possible for the less skilled private flyer you would have to take that ballooning bounce out of high speed ground-contact , and take the nose-over out of sharp braking . Weick , turner upside-down of ideas , solved this problem by putting the usual landing gear hind-side to . Instead of setting his ship on two main wheels , forward , and a third wheel under the tail , he put it on two main wheels , set fairly far back , and put the third wheel under its chin . Instead of sitting on the ground in the familiar , haughty pose , such a " tricycle " geared ship assumes an attitude much like a Walt Disney dog sniffing a trail : the nose is close to the ground , and the whole ship is actually pointing slightly down . Thus ground contact slaps the ship down in front into a position in which , regardless of speed , its wings can not lift it off again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship will bear down hard on its nose wheel , but it can not nose over . Weick refined the arrangement by making the front wheel steerable and linking it up with the Ercoupe 's steering wheel . Thus the ship can be driven on the ground as if it were a car , and the nerve-racking job of " taxiing " the conventional airplane is , like saddlesense , among the skills that are on their way out . So also is the job of getting down out of the air . In the Ercoupe you simply steer down , flare out a bit , and " feel her on . " It is , in the up and down sense , exactly the same sort of maneuver as pulling a car smoothly alongside the curb ; it requires no more judgment . To the novice it will seem perfectly natural and common sense ; but that 's exactly what flying has never been . The approach glide and the landing ? the way back home have always required an especially crazy logic of their own . Now with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you realize you are too high , you simply steer down more steeply . This means you will pick up speed , and with the conventional landing gear that speed would make you overshoot your landing ; but with a tricycle gear you c , - ti touch at any speed . The wheels will hut the ground . All the delicate speed cont-ol of the conventional landing ? forget about it ! No more the nightmare of finding that you have come down with to much speed and are floating helplesly across the field while the trees at the far side come at you ; just slam her down and pull the hand brake . You need n't even flare out for landings . If you do n't knew where the ground is ? a frequent trouble with beginners and night landings just let her glide until she hits . She will take it without stumbling , bouncing , bucking , ballooning . There is a slight bump , and just when the conventionally trained pilot thinks that surely now he will have his hands full of airplane gone crazy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he realizes he is merely driving an air-going automobile .
