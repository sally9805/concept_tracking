During the war the bones and buildings of Ancient Man slept soundly . With almost every promising digging site out of bounds for one reason or another , the world 's archeologists-many of whom were engaged in military intelligence work - had a long breather . Now , having evaluated such new , war-perfected tools as mine detectors , stereoscopic air photography and explosive microcharges , they are on the prowl again . <P> Roman Relics . In a way , the war was a help to archeology . Bombs , shells and fires wrecked many European cities , sweeping modern structures from the ancient remains beneath . British diggers , of course , pounced on blitzed east London , site of Roman Londinium . So far , they have found little , but they are excavating furiously-before the stone jungle of the rebuilt city swallows their opportunity . <P> At Canterbury ( Roman Durovernum ) , many feet below the leveled shopping district , the diggers found a 3rd-Century mosaic floor , as perfect as when its Roman builders set down their tools 1,700 years ago . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Low Ham , Somerset , complete with prancing mosaic horsemen , naked ladies , and amorous Roman warriors . <P> French archeologists also profited by war 's destruction . Last week the French were busily clearing away the rubble of the German-demolished " Old Port " of Marseilles , turning up traces of ancient Greek Masillia ( 6th Century B.C. ) . <P> Donkey Bones . More exciting to French diggers is the art-crammed neolithic cave at Montignac-sur-Vzre . Named after some donkey bones found near the surface , the cave was first explored in 1940 by schoolboys . A few pictures of it leaked out through Vichy ( TIME , July 28 , 1941 ) , but detailed study had to wait until after the war . Last week scientific investigation was going full speed ahead . <P> Archeologists believe that the Montignac cave 's deep , twisting chambers were occupied between 10,000 and 30,000 years ago by successive races of cave-dwelling men who covered its walls with many layers of spirited , colorful drawings . It will take years of hard work to trace the half-erased lines and chart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Probably the greenest diggers ' pasture at present is the Western Hemisphere . During the last Ice Age , some 15,000 years ago , the now arid U.S. southwest was a well-watered temperate paradise swarming with bison , camels , mammoths , horses , giant ground-sloths . Clad in skins and armed with puny , flint-pointed darts , Ancient Man scurried about this dangerous , Pleistocene zoo . <P> Of these earliest Americans-Folsom Man , Sandia Man , Cochise Man-not a single bone has yet been found . But weapons , gnawed animal bones and camp sites indicate his existence beyond dispute . The first archeologist to find the authentic bones of a Pleistocene American will be the most famous digger in the Western Hemisphere . <P> Hot on the trail last week was Dr. Frank C. Hibben of the University of New Mexico . In 1941 he followed the trail to Alaska , where he found the characteristic Folsom dart points . This summer he will dig in Saskatchewan . His dream is to ransack Siberia , where the earliest Americans presumably came from .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
