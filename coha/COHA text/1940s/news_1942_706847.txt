txt Vice Admiral William F. Halsey Jr. , making his first visit to what he calls the " first front ' in the Pacific , this morning described the naval situation as " fine from our point of view " despite the loss of ships , which must be expected . Asserting that control of the seas is the key to the situation in the Pacific , he refused to relegate the battleship , in the fight for that control , to the category of obsolete weapons . The carrier is the ' great offensive weapon , he declared , but the battleship also still retains its role and will continue to play a decisive part in the Pacific warfare . Admiral Halsey while here decorated thirteen officers and men of the United States Marines and Navy who had distinguished themselves in recent fighting in and over the Solomon . Standing in the early morning sunlight in front of Major Gen. A. A. Vandegrift 's headquarters , the grizzled new commander of United Nations forces in the South Pacific told the group of ten officers and three enlisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you in my life . " " I wish to God , " he said , " that every man , woman and child in our great country could know and see what you are doing here . God bless you . " All but one of the men  --  Dr. Thirl E. Jarrett , who won his Navy Cross for his gallantry in treating wounded under heavy shellfire during the battleship bombardment on the night of Oct. 13 ? won their citations for doing what the admiral had told correspondents the night before was the only way to win the war ? " kill Japs , kill Japs and keep on killing Japs . " The admiral made his visit to watch the Marines , Army and Navy doing just that during a comparative lull in the Guadalcanal fighting . He went , however , with General Vandegrift to visit one of the more active sectors , passing through an area over which there had been recent fighting and where there had not yet been time to bury the enemy dead . His boots and khaki uniform still splattered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the members of the Guadalcanal press club on the screened porch of the general 's headquarters . His talk was punctuated at times by the distant sound of artillery fighting . " You ca n't make an omelet without breaking eggs , " he said , explaining that losses must be expected . " You ca n't fight a war safely or without losing ships . " " The man who controls the sea will be the man who wins the war , " the Admiral said in his remarks on the role of surface naval craft . " And I 'm an airman , " he added . Speaking directly on the Solomons situation , Admiral Halsey said he believed it would be possible in the near future to make It impossible for the Japanese to continue to reinforce their troops on Guadalcanal . Just how that would be done he refused to say , pointing out that that was a tactical problem . " It will have to be a united operation , " he explained . This interview , of course , took place before the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15 . The Admiral could not say too much in praise of the Marines who took the islands and held them without reinforcements for more than a month . He seemed especially proud of the Army , Navy and Marine fliers who have held control of the air over the islands without a rest , except when they were short of aviation gasoline , for more than three months , and most 9f the time against heavy odds . " I think they are the most superb gang of people I have ever known , " he said feelingly . " I knew they were good , but they are so damn good they have surprised the hell out of me . " He refused to commit himself on the duration of the war . " How long do you think it will last ? " he asked his questioner . " How long do you think they can take it ? " The admiral did say he thought eventual victory would not be won without an invasion of the Japanese home islands . " I hope so , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The visit of the admiral to Guadalcanal was a big psychological lift for the people here . He slipped . in so quietly with only two aides and rode around in a mud-spattered jeep so inconspicuously that a lot of the men did not know he was on the island until the scuttlebutt drinking fountain , or source of rumors brought the news to them . The presentation of the awards was made before breakfast , so that the men , some of whom had come from the front lines , could return to their posts . The admiral had a personal word for each one as he pinned the medals on their stained , unpressed shirtfronts . To Private Joseph D. R. Champayne of Lewiston , Me. , a thin youngster who seemed to be not over 17 or 18 years old , Admiral Halsey expressed the conviction that " you will undoubtedly be more than a private the next time I come here . " Private Champayne mumbled an embarrassed " Thank you , sir . " He had won his Navy Cross for staying in his foxhole during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right on top of him .
