Addressing the British Trades Union Congress at Brighton , Prime Minister Clement Attlee last week succinctly outlined certain peculiarities of Communist thinking in a way that helped explain why Russia has failed to divide Britain and the U.S. Said Mr. Attlee : <P> " . . . ' Democracy ' is becoming a much-abused word . It is often used by those who have never understood or practiced democratic principles to mean the achievement of power , by hook or by crook , by the Communist Party , while freedom means the denial of liberty to all those who refuse to accept the Communist philosophy . . . . <P> " If in any part of the world the Communist Party , by no matter what means , is in power , that is democracy . If anywhere the Communists fail , then , however fair the conditions , it is regarded as Fascism . . . . <P> " Russian newspapers give fantastic misrepresentation of the world outside Soviet Russia . A wall of ignorance and suspicion is built up between the nations . One would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ achievements in peace and war , believing that their system is the best for the workers , would have welcomed every opportunity for closer intercourse . . . but the contrary course is followed . . . . " <P> World Tour . Two days earlier Foreign Secretary Ernest Bevin had made the strongest and clearest expression of Britain 's foreign policy for several months . He took the House on a tour of the trouble spots , stating where Britain must stay until the air clears ( e.g. , Greece ) and where she can get out ( e.g. , Indonesia , from which the last British soldiers will be gone by Dec. 1 ) . In this tour , both directly and by implication , Mr. Bevin emphasized Anglo-U.S. solidarity on fundamental issues . He praised General MacArthur 's achievements in Japan , General Marshall 's efforts in China ; and as regards Germany , the most crucial problem , he said he was in " almost complete agreement " with Secretary Byrnes 's policy as laid down at Stuttgart ( TIME , Sept. 16 ) . Nevertheless Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play second fiddle to the U.S. in the concert of Western nations ; and this led him to state Britain 's case in terms that would have horrified the 19th Century Empire builders , who took British power for granted . <P> " Great Britain , after all , has a great past . . . . Her sacrifices in two great wars for freedom and her ability to practice it in war and peace , entitle her to a proper place and the adequate consideration of her views in the councils of nations . She can not and will not be dismissed . . . . "
