Richard Julius Herman Krebs , alias Richard Anderson , alias Richard Peterson , alias Richard Williams , alias Rudolf Heller , alias Otto Melchior , alias Jan Valtin was born in Germany 37 years ago . Last week the Justice Department ordered him sent back there after the war . <P> As author of the best-selling Out of the Night , which he wrote under the name of Jan Valtin , hulking , gap-toothed Richard Krebs had shocked U.S. readers with his offhand account of a lurid , turbulent life as an agent of both the Ogpu and Gestapo . He later admitted he had added the experiences of other men " to make the book as effective as possible , " was roundly denounced by Communists as a faker . But his fame was his undoing : he admitted that he had once before been deported by the U.S. , that he had committed perjury - both grounds for deportation . <P> Said the Board of Immigration Appeals : " His life has been so marked with violence , intrigue and treachery that it would be difficult , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reliability and good character have been established . ... It appears that he has been completely untrustworthy and amoral . " <P> Arrested at the snug Connecticut country home which he bought with his literary earnings , Richard Krebs was taken to Ellis Island . Next day his 18-year-old wife began a battle for his freedom .
