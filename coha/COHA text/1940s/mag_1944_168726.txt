Cabled a U.S. correspondent last week : " They are just as frightening today as they were the first night . " Some Britons and propagandists still bravely belittled the " buzz-bombs . " But the world 's scientists were not taking them so lightly . None asserted that the new weapon would seriously affect the outcome of World War II , but many regarded the buzz-bombing of England as a crude preview of World War III . <P> Many a scientist was sure that it was only a question of time-perhaps five or ten years-before vastly bigger , farther-flying bombs can be dropped accurately on a target by radio control . The No. 1 U.S. expert on remote-controlled weapons , Inventor John Hays Hammond Jr . of Gloucester , Mass. , recalled a 1929 prediction : " The war of the future will last hours instead of years . " <P> Military students who remembered similar predictions about the machine gun , the airplane , the tank , and poison gas remained skeptical . But none could doubt that terrifying new vistas of destruction had been opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Stockholm report , is Hermann Oberth , 50 , professor of physical astronomy at Berlin University . A stiff , old-fashioned pedagogue , Professor Oberth has long been famed in Europe as a writer on occultism and a pioneer in the study of interplanetary rocket flying . In 1923 , when he published one of the first schemes for projecting a rocket into interplanetary space , he was nicknamed " the moon professor . " He also predicted murderous rockets capable of being sent halfway around the earth and exterminating whole populations . <P> UFA , the German film trust , hired the Professor to help produce a spaceship movie called The Girl in the Moon . As a publicity stunt for the movie 's premiere , Oberth was to launch a tremendous rocket of his own design at a deserted spot on the Baltic coast . The rocket failed to go off and the humiliated professor retired from public view . <P> In 1937 Oberth , now an ardent Nazi , emerged from his seclusion and called on Colonel Albert Kesselring ( now Field <P> Marshal in command of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazing blueprints and photographs . They comprised a design for the long-distance mili tary rocket he had predicted . U.S. Army ordnance officers had brushed aside robot-bomb designs by such established invent ors as Hammond , Charles F. Kettering , the late Lawrence B. Sperry . But Kessel ring and Hermann Gring gave Oberth a big staff of technicians and the run of German laboratories . <P> The buzz-bomb which the professor finally produced is not a rocket ( rockets are propelled by gases generated by their own fuel ) , but a jet-propelled missile which carries 136 gallons of gasoline , has a range of about 150 miles and a speed of 200 to 300 m.p.h . The length of its flight is regulated by a timing device which tips the robot into a 60-degree dive . Oberth presumably abandoned his rocket design because the necessary weight of fuel made it unpractical . Since his jet-propelled bomb is dependent on air , it can not soar above the stratosphere like a rocket hut must remain within range of enemy flak and planes .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
