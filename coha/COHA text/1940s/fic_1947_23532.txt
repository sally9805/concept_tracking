MAYBE JUST A LITTLE ONE A Story R. BRETNOR M AXIMUS EVERETT , who taught physics at Woodrow Wilson Union High School for nearly twenty years , was the first man to accomplish nuclear fission in his basement . It really was n't much of a basement either . Along one side was the work-bench , littered with tools and wire and dusty old books . On the other side was an empty birdcage and a stationary tub with a dripping faucet . A couple of shabby trunks stood in a corner next to a broken lawnmower , and some baled magazines the Red Cross people had forgotten to call for were piled up behind the cyclotron . The final result of his scientific labors pleased Mr. Everett . After observing it quietly for a while , he went upstairs to the kitchen , where his wife was making chopped-olive-and-egg sandwiches , He sat down on a stool , wiped his long bald forehead , and remarked that it certainly was hot in the basement . Without turning around , his wife assured him that this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " right near the border , it 's always hot in summer . " Mr. Everett did not dispute the point . " Oh , it 's not only that , " he told her . " I 've just been working pretty hard . It 's been a tough job . " He leaned back with a little sigh of satisfaction . " I 've invented atomic power , hon. " " So that 's what you 've been doing , " said Mrs. Everett . " I thought it was still perpetual motion . " She cut the last sandwich diagonally in half , put some sliced pickle on the platter , and turned around , smoothing her ample apron . Then suddenly she looked accusingly at her husband . " Why , that 's ridiculous ! " she exclaimed . " What do you mean , you invented it ? How about Hiroshima ? " " That was different , " said Mr. Everett simply . " That was.just a big bang . Anybody can invent that kind . " Mrs. Everett -- a librarian , and rather dogmatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she declared , " say that you have to have uranium , and that it 's very rare . Then you have to make it into something else , and it costs millions and millions of dollars . " " That 's what they think , " replied Mr. Everett , shaking his head mildly . " Well , they ought to know , if anyone does ! " " I have the utmost respect for them , " he conceded . " After all , their work did help to make mine possible . It 's just  --  well , you see , it 's just that I do n't need uranium . I discovered a new element about a week ago , and . . . . " Mrs. Everett was wearing the expression she usually reserved for people who tried to explain away overdue books . " Just how could you discover a new element when they 've all been discovered ? " she asked bleakly . " And what is it called ? " " Frijolium , " said Mr. Everett . " I discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything . " " Yes , but where did you get it ? " " I made it . That is , I purified it . Pure frijolium , for the first time in history . " " Well , it sounds sort of familiar to me , " mused Mrs. Everett . " Frijolium  --  now wherever . . . ? " " Sort of familiar ? " echoed Mr. Everett . " Well , it should be ! Frijolium . You know , from frijoles . " Marriage and the public library had hardened Mrs. Everett ; she took it all in her stride . " Maximus Everett ! " she snapped . " Do you mean to sit there and tell me that you 've found a new element in plain old Mexican beans ? " Mr. Everett hooked his thumbs in his belt and tilted the stool back on its hind legs . " We-ell , " he said , obviously weighing the question carefully , " it would not be quite correct to say that frijoles contain a new element . As a matter of fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frijoles are just beans ! " protested Mrs. Everett , rather loudly . " Anybody'il tell you that . They contain proteins , fats , and carbohydrates . " " Those substances , " said Mr. Everett , " are impurities . Fresh frijoles are 92.733 per cent pure frijolium . I have isolated it . It has a relatively iow atomic weight , but is adequately unstable . The nucleus may be split quite readily by . . . . " " Oh , never mind ! " cried Mrs. Everett , stamping her foot . " Do you really expect me to believe that ? Why , there would have been an explosion . " " No , there would n't . I did n't want an explosion . I used the frijolium from one small frijole  --  that 's the minimum critical mass  --  and it 's really quite easy to control . You can turn it on and off just like a vacuum-cleaner . " " Well , I do n't believe a word of it ! All the experts say atomic power ca n't be controlled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's what they think . I 've had it running the washing-machine for three hours . . . . And , " he added , " if I did n't turn it off , it would run for almost exactly seventy-two years . What do you think of that ? " After this , of course , Mrs. Everett followed him back into the basement to see for herself . The washing-machine wasbusily churning away next to the cyclotron , quaking and rattling just as it always had . Mrs. Everett sniffed , Warily , she walked around it , peering at the chipped enamel of its framework . As far as she could determine , its appearance had not changed  --  and she said so rather acidly . " If this is your idea of a joke , " she said , " I do n't think it 's at all funny . Of course , if you have n't broken my washer , there 's no real harm done , but . . . . " Mr. Everett interrupted her . He pointed to the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with great dignity . J OOKING closely , she saw a small alu-minum box , with a round hole in j the top and an insulated cord leading to the motor . " Was n't it there before ? " she asked . " It was not ! " said Mr. Everett . " That is the generator . You drop the frijolium through the hole . That little switch on the box works a shield inside that turns the energy on and off . " He flipped the switch , and the washing-machine chugged twice and was silent . He flipped it again , and the machine came back to life . " See ? " he said triumphantly . Mrs. Everett was still dubious . " Where do you plug it in ? " she inquired . " You do n't , " replied her husband patiently . " That 's the whole idea . The generator converts atomic power from the smashing of the frijolium nuclei directly into 110 volts A.C. , just like the house current . " " You  --  you mean we wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beginning to be impressed . " Not a penny . Not after I get the rest of the house wired . " " Why , Maxie ! Why , that 's wonderful ! And we could put it on the car too , could n't we ? " Mrs. Everett patted the washing-machine with genuine affection . " Just wait until I tell Mrs. Myers , " she exulted . " Ever since they made Henry principal , she 's been acting as if we were below them socially or something . And it was she who told the grocer-boy that you were all thumbs , not handy around the house like Henry was . " " Oh , Henry 's all right , " said Mr. Everett . " I think he 'll be pleased when he hears about it . After all , it 'll be nice for the school , too ; it 'll help to keep up interest in the physics classes . " " I should think he ought to be pleased , " snorted Mrs. Everett . " He could n't invent atomic power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " maybe he 'll let me give up coaching basketball . " " I 'll phone her right after lunch , " said Mrs. Everett , with a gleam in her eye . M RS . EVERETT was as good as her word . She was sweetly condescending to Henry Myers ' wife , who responded with a gratifying display of irritation , awe , and envy  --  and this reaction encouraged her to call up quite a number of other people . It was Saturday , and she did n't have to go back to the library , and so she was able to spend the rest of the afternoon at the telephone . She was still there at five o'clock , when the reporters started to arrive . The first journalist was a brash young man with an unhealthy complexion . " I 'm from the Bulletin , " he announced , cleverly getting his foot in the door as Mrs. Everett opened it . " There must be some mistake , " said Mrs. Everett coldly . " We paid the boy two months in advance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake , " said the journalist . " Here 's the card . " He thrust a card at her menacingly and , as she retreated , thrust himself after it , craning his neck to peer around the room . " Where 's the guy with the atom bomb ? " he demanded . " Oh , you 're a reporter ! " said Mrs. Everett , wide-eyed . " Where 's the atom bomb ? " repeated the journalist , peering into the fireplace . " Atom bomb ? " gasped Mrs. Everett . " Dear me , no . There is n't any . It 's just atomic power . It 's running the washing-machine . " The journalist seemed disappointed . " You sure ? " he said . " Why , of course , " replied Mrs. Everett . " Maximus  --  that 's Mr. Everett  --  will be here in a minute or two . He 'll explain it to you . If you 'll just have a seat for a minute , I 'll go and get him . " She started out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geographic , " she offered , " it 's on the mantel . " The journalist grunted politely as she left the room . Then he took a quick look at the bookcase , discovered two volumes by Jules Verne and one by H. G. Wells , noted down their titles . Having done so , he opened the door for his cameraman , and together they began examining Mr. Everett 's desk for matters of scientific interest . Mr. and Mrs. Everett , entering , did not notice this investigation ; they were momentarily blinded by the flash-bulb that greeted their return . Mr. Everettt tried simultaneously to rearrange his hastily-assumed necktie with one hand and to shake hands with the journalist with the other , and succeeded in looking quite confused and slightly wild . Mrs. Everett blinked and said something about how clever Mr. Everett was . The journalist promptly asked about the atomic bomb again , and did not conceal his resentment when Mr. Everett assured him that there was nothing so dangerous in the house . He slumped down into the nearest chair , muttered indignantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notebook closed . " Well , " he said to Mr. Everett , " give . " ' And , modestly enough , Mr. Everett gave . He told of his search for practical atomic power . He exhibited his homemade cyclotron and the converted washer . He posed for a dozen or more photographs , and he answered all questions with the utmost patience . " Of course , " he said , " I could have made a bomb if I 'd wanted to , but I think this is so much more useful , do n't you ? " The journalist made a note of this remark . " Yeah , " he said , " sure . But all the big shots say it ca n't be done for ten or twenty years . " Mr. Everett grinned . " That 's what they think , " he said . " You see , they have n't heard about my new element . It 's the new element that does the trick . And it hardly costs anything ; that 's the nice thing about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it frijolium. " said Mr. Everett . " From frijoles , you know . " The journalist 's face twitched suddenly . He darted a quick , covert glance at his companion . " No kiddin ' ! " he said , with a nasty smile . " You mean it comes from frijoles from beans ? " " That 's right , " Mr. Everett assured him . " From common old Mexican beans . They 're full of it . " " Say , that 's something ! That 's really something ! " The journalist slapped Mr. Everett heartily on the back . " Is n't that something , Pete ? " he cried . Pete took another photograph . The first journalist did n't stay very long after that . He remembered that he was in a terrific hurry , and he delayed only long enough to use the telephone very briefly . Mrs. Everett , overhearing part of the conversation , marvelled at the strange jargon of his craft , " . . . Yeah , " he said , ? . uh-huh , a squirrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . runs the washer on frijolium . . . from frijoles . . . you heard what I said , as in beans ! . .. Willie 'll eat it up . . . . " But that was all Mrs. Everett heard , because just then the other journalists started to arrive . There were a lot of them , male and female , and they gave the Everetts a very busy evening . As a matter of fact , it was two and a half hours past midnight when the last journalist  --  a heavily-mustached lady who had been questioning Mrs. Everett about the more intimate details of her married life  --  folded her notes and departed . After the door had been securely bolted , a strangely demure Mrs. Everett looked up at her husband . " Oh , Maxie , " she fluttered , " that woman asked me the most embarrassing questions . " " Dear me , " said Mr. Everett uncomfortably . " I wonder why ? " There was a moment of silence . Then Mrs. Everett sighed . " Well anyhow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she suggested . " They . . . they may even ask you to go to Washington . " " That would be nice , " said Mr. Everett , " but I do n't see how I possibly could before the end of the semester . " Mentally reading future headlines , Mrs. Everett ignored the objection . She glimpsed a brief and garbled vision of honorary degrees , speeches , movie contracts . " All those newspaper people were so disappointed because you had n't made a bomb , " she reflected . " It does seem a shame , too , after they went to all that trouble . Do n't you think you could make just one ? Maybe just a little one . . . " " No , " said Mr. Everett , " I 'd rather not . I do n't like to seem obstinate , but whatever would we do with it ? " T HE Everetts were given no chance to stay in bed that Sunday morning , for the press returned in force on the heels of the milkman , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night before . The telephone was constantly in use ; light-hearted journalists came and went ; and Mrs. Everett whispered a thousand confidences to ladies who knew just how to contrive high romance from the most unpromising materials . At fifteen minutes to twelve , Maximus Everett was perched on the pile of old magazines in the basement , rather hoarsely lecturing on the peculiar merits of the frijole as a fissionable material , while several members of his audience examined and photographed an assortment of rusty plumbing installed for an experiment long since abandoned and forgotten . It was here that Mrs. Everett found him when she descended the stairs to announce the arrival of Henry Myers . " I do hate to interrupt , " said Mrs. Everett delicately but firmly , " but could you come upstairs for a minute , dear ? There 's someone to see you . " " Tell him to come down , " replied Mr. Everett . " I 'll start over again so he wo n't miss anything . " " But it 's Henry ! " protested Mrs. Everett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says it 's important ! " Mr. Everett came suddenly alive . " Henry ? " he cried . " I told you so ! He 's changed his mind about my coaching basketball . I 'll be right up . Tell him I 'll be right up ! Boys , " he said to the journalists , " do you mind waiting down here ? Just browse around . I wo n't be a second . " " Go right ahead , " they answered , as one man . And they followed Mr. Everett enthusiastically as he took the stairs three at a time . Henry Myers was waiting in the living-room , standing with his broad back to the MAYBE JUST A LITTLE ONE 14 1 fireplace . He held his hat in one hand , a folded newspaper and an envelope in the other . His eyebrows slanted down toward the bridge of his nose with administrative severity  --  and they relaxed neither at Mr. Everett 's entrance nor at his hearty greeting . " Henry , old boy ! " At the head of his escort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm sure glad to see you ! Come on down and . . . . " ND then Maximus Everett was checked in full career . Henry Myers spoke . His voice was sharp and metallic , an unkind voice , the voice of a man who for years has dealt none too gently with refractory adolescents . " Everett , " he said , " I had hoped . to see you privately ; I see that privacy is impossible . However , I anticipated such a contingency . I came prepared , and I shall do what is necessary without further discussion . " He thrust the newspaper and the envelope into Mr. Everett 's welcoming hand . " One , " he declared , " will explain the other . " Then he turned on his heel , jammed his hat on , angrily brushed aside two questing newsmen  --  and the front door banged behind him . Now , quite understandably , this interview knocked Maximus Everett slightly off-center . He stared open-mouthed at the quivering door , only remotely conscious of a buzz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand  --  until a voice morestrident than the rest made itself heard . " Let 's see ! " it shouted . " Let 's take a look ! Take a look , Maxie ! " So Mr. Everett looked . Mechanically , he started to unfold the newspaper , recalling vaguely that it was the first he had seen since his discovery was made public . As the black headlines appeared , there was a sudden hush . - At first , Mr. Everett only realized that he was reading about himself ; though the meaning was seeping through , he was still protected against its full import . WHOOPS ! yelled the headlines gaily , BEAN ATOM BUSTED . Below that , two lines of smaller type proclaimed : Frjole Fission Runs Washer For Basement Einstein : Clean Undies Prove Plutonium Now Obsolete . And there , to illustrate the point , was a picture of the Everetts , grinning idiotically as they displayed the significant article of apparel against the side of the cyclotron . Still functioning mechanically , Mr. Everett by-passed the caption to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona 's old-timers have always suspected to lie lurking in the redoubtable Mexican frijole have at last been liberated , according to Maximus Everett , high school physics teacher and self-proclaimed basement genius of Concho County , who yesterday took the wraps off his home-grown Oak Ridge project for the first time and let everybody in on the swell new world now looming up ( says he ) on the bean horizon . . . Numbed as he was , Mr. Everett might very well have gone on to read the rest of the story , but just then some more black type , off to one side , caught his notice : BEAN-BUSTER MAXIE NO GOLD FISH , SAID MRS . Atomic Love Brings . . But that was as far as Mr. Everett got . Full comprehension , long delayed , hit him with a solid rabbit-punch . The paper fell from his fingers to the floor . A large round tear , forming at the corner of his eye , began to slide slowly down his cheek . Observing these phenomena , Mr. Everett 's audience found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per-Imps by an intuitive appreciation of the fact that the really worthwhile part of the show was over . One by one , unnoticed by their host , they made their departure , until only two or three of the unregenerate were left . These waited patiently until Mr. Everett recovered enough to open Henry Myers ' letter . Then they read it over his shoulder , finding it brief and to the point : MY DEAR MR . EYERETT : In view of the scandalous events of the past two days , the Board of Trustees has instructed me to notify you of the termination of your contract . The Board is granting you an extended leave of absence ( without pay ) until the end of the present semester , at which time the termination will take effect . The Members of the Board and I agree that , under the circumstances , no additional explanation of this action can be necessary . Very sincerely yours , HENRY T. MYERs , Principal Nobody said anything . After a moment , Mr. Everett carefully folded the letter again and returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and held it open until the last of his remaining visitors had filed out , and only when it was locked behind them did he permit himself a brief outburst of emotion . He tore the letter in half . He threw it on the floor . He said , " That 's what you think ! " angrily several times . B EAN-BUSTER MAXIE was a nine-days wonder . The press , finding him suddenly unco-operative , confined its efforts to questioning friends and neighbors , fell back on its already large store of photographs , and explained the working of the Everett washer by hinting broadly at hidden wiring and compressed air . Before fresher wonders forced frijole fission back through the want-ads into oblivion , its every aspect had been thoroughly explored . There had been several jolly interviews with lesser physicists , several with screen and radio comedians , one with the spiritual leader of a vegetarian cult , and one with a rather bawdy admiral . But the giants of the scientific and political worlds had held themselves aloof , refraining from all comment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No academic senates had honored him . No universities had invited him to join their faculties . Even the FBI , hastily checking up on all known foreign agents and finding them uninterested , had dropped him from its social register . During the weeks that followed this brief period of international notoriety , the Everetts kept very much to themselves . scarcely stirring out of the house , and greeting even their oldest friends with a frigid reserve . Mr. Everett buried himself in his work , first converting the house-circuit to frijolium-power , then installing a generator in the family car . Mrs. Everett , who had resigned from the Public Library after a determined but futile resistance , was his constant companion ; and many were the long evenings they spent together , reading Walt Whitman aloud and making nebulous plans for a frijolium factory . Even after small boys stopped hooting at Mr. Everett in the street , they hesitated to venture far abroad ; only the inexorable operation of economic law finally forced them out of the fancied security of their retreat . Mr. Everett had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moderate means who invest in cyclotrons  --  no matter how small  --  seldom retain respectable bank balances . After about two months , Mr. Everett started job-hunting . He hunted in person and he hunted by mail , and he found both methods equally fruitless . Whatever he tried , there were  --  curiously enough  --  no vacancies . Once he was offered temporary employment as a sheepherder , but this was while he still was rela-tively solvent , and the chance did not come along again . In six more weeks , the Everetts found themselves reduced to exactly seventy cents in cash and a dubious charge account . They discovered this just after lunch , and they moved to the living-roam to discuss the matter . " All this would never have happened , " said Mrs. Everett bitterly , " if it had n't been for that Henry Myers . I warned you against him the first day you met him , Maximus . " " Oh , Henry 's not so bad , " protested Mr. Everett . " It was n't his fault , dear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing with such a complete lack of understanding . " He shrugged . " Well , I guess we 'll just have to take out a second mortgage to tide us over . I hate to do it , but . . . " " What ? " cried Mrs. Everett . " And stay in this town ? I 'd sooner scrub floors ! We ought to sell the place , and go away where nobody knows us , to . .. . " But Mrs. Everett was not fated to reveal her intended destination , for at that instant the doorbell rang . It rang once ; then it rang again . It was starting its third summons when Mr. Everett opened the door , blinked into the sunlight , and found himself looking at three strangers  --  all of whom were dark and obviously foreign . " What do you want ? " demanded Mr. Everett rudely . There was a tall dark man with a mustache and a black Homburg hat . There was a small dark man with a mustache and a black Homburg . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark man bowed profoundly over his stick and gloves ; so did his small companion . The very large dark man kept his hands in his pockets and looked straight ahead . " Do I address Doctor Everett ? " inquired the tall dark man with grave courtesy and a marked accent . Mr. Everett , who had obtained his B.A. with some little difficulty , was pleased in spite of himself . He blushed , cleared his throat , and coughed affirmatively . " Then permit me to introduce myself , " said the tall dark man , handing him a visiting card . Mr. Everett took the card . Antonio L. Macjones , he read , Ph.D. , LL.D . ( Columbia ' 22 ) , Minister of the Interior , The Raptarian Republic . " Wo n't you come in ? " mumbled Mr. Everett . Once inside , the Minister of the Interior presented his colleague to Mr. Everett . " This , " he announced , " is our General Troppo . In our country , he is Minister of ? of Education . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Education ? " said Mr. Everett suspiciously . " And he 's a general ? " The Minister of the Interior explained that in his tranquil land military rank was largely honorary . " . . . in memory of our great liberator , who died in battle one hundred and twelve years ago , " he added . o MR . Everett introduced them both to S Mrs. Everett , who was properly im- pressed ; and everybody sat down except the very large dark man , who stood with his hands in his pockets , and kept peering out of the windows . There was some further exchange of formalities , with flowery Raptarian solicitude for the good health , past , present , and future , of Mr. and Mrs. Maximus Everett . Then the Minister of the Interior spoke at length about what his government was doing for the Common Man , and about a President so well-beloved that no other had been elected for nearly thirty years  --  and throughout his speech the dove of peace cooed a gentle obbligato . The Everetts were enthralled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ groves and verdant jungles of Raptaria . They beheld the clean , hard-working Raptarian peasant leading his chubby children to a new and splendidly-appointed school provided by a government whose watchwords were Benevolence and Progress . The Minister of the Interior paused , and the Everetts sighed longingly  --  and as they did so he rose suddenly to his feet , lifting a hand to heaven . " That is why we are here today , " he cried out . " So that you , Maximo Everett , can aid us in our great humane task ! In our country we have a physicist , a good man , He tells us that his work confirms your wonderful discovery . Already we have formed a Frijole Control Commission ! ? Come to us ! Though we arc poor , you will have everything you need . You will be Vice-Minister of Education . You will work directly under General Troppo ! " Having finished , the Minister of the Interior opened his arms in a magnificent gesture of ardent welcome , bowed , and sat down , quite winded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " expostulated General Troppo with equal fervor . " Not under me ! Say rather as a colleague , a comrade ! " He smiled , radiating good fellowship . " Of course , " he said to Mr. Everett , " you can make explosives ? " Mr. Everett frowned , but before he had a chance to reply Mrs. Everett answered for him . " Mr. Everett could make an atomic bomb just as easy as pie , " she told the general , " but he does n't want to . He thinks they 're very destructive , and he ca n't see any point to making them . " Mr. Everett nodded vigorously while the Raptarian dignitaries exchanged swift glances ; then the Minister of the Interior stepped into the breach with hearty laughter . " My friend ! " he exclaimed , as soon as his amusement had subsided . " My very good friend ! I fear that you mistake the general 's meaning ! What use would we , in poor Raptaria , ever have for an atomic bomb ? But we have mines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so-swift rivers . We need many roads and bridges . That is the kind of explosives the Minister of Education means  --  for blasting ! Is that not so , General ? " " Yes , yes , " said the general blandly . " But of course , " smiled the Minister of the Interior , " for that  --  and for our national holiday , when the happy people celebrate with fireworks . That is why we may want a very few explosives , though MAGAZINE we want power-plants even more . " " Power-plants ? " echoed General Troppo . " Yes , yes . " " We-ell , " said Mr. Everett , scratching his head , " I guess that is sort of different . " He hesitated . " I . . I wo n't have to coach basketball , will I ? " he asked diffidently . OMB time has passed since the Everetts went to the Republic of Raptaria . As Vice-Minister of Education , Mr. Everett naturally did not have to bother with any of the details of his departure . Everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arranged by the Minister of the Interior , and it all went off very smoothly  --  so smoothly , in fact , that for a long time even the Everetts ' neighbors did not know that they had moved out of town permanently . Nobody ever dreamed that they had gone abroad . Nobody . Not even Henry Myers , who happened to mention the Raptarian Republic when he delivered his weekly speech on world affairs in the assembly hall of Woodrow Wilson Union High School a few days ago . ft. . . and by contrast , " he informed the student body , " we have news of another quiet , orderly election in Raptaria , a little country many of you may not even have heard about . " He paused , to smile benignly at the upturned faces . " A lucky little country , too , " he told them . " Too small to worry about the great quarrels that rend the world . Too poor , " he continued , " to follow any ways but those of peace . " That 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
