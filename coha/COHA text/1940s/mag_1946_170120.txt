All over England last week , people were whistling in pubs and dancing in ballrooms to a tune written by two old ladies . Cruising Down the River was No. 2 on the English hit parade . Its gooey lyrics : <P> If you will go along with me , we 'll travel with the tide <P> And I will always keep you on the sheltered side . <P> However rough the way may be , the waters dark and low <P> Through all the stormy weather I will always steer you home . <P> Cruising down the river . . . * <P> Cruising was written by stout , spinsterish Eily Beadel ( who calls herself " officially 48 " ) , a retired music-hall accordionist , and her chum , greying , triple-chinned Nellie ( " Tolly " ) Tollerton , a onetime actress of the silent films . Eily lives with her twelve-year-old cat , " Spot , " in Hammersmith , and Tolly Tollerton lives with her husband , who is a Swedish foot juggler . <P> The two met ten years ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner in a conservative English club . They began writing songs which never got any further than the three-piece ladies ' band ( violin , viola and piano ) which <P> Tolly conducts at a decorous tea shop in Wimbledon . Last fall they wrote Cruising and entered it in a contest ; it won first prize over 58,000 entries . It has now sold over 380,000 copies of sheet music , and earned 5,000 in royalties . <P> Eily still takes her crocheting down to afternoon tea at the restaurant where Tolly 's trio-which specializes in light classics-will play Cruising only by request . The two chums have already written a new Skaters ' Waltz , but , says Eily , " We 'll never write another Cruising . It was just a flash in the pan .
