The nation 's investment bankers set a number of records last week swapping new pieces of paper for old . In the busiest underwriting week since 1929 , bondmen offered $378 million of corporate and municipal bonds to an easy-money market that gulped the flotations and bid for more . <P> Two of the largest corporate offerings ever made hiked the week 's business to its record-breaking activity : 1 ) $180 million worth of Commonwealth Edison Co. and 2 ) $130 million of Philadelphia Electric Co. bonds . Like most big issues since 1934-when the easy-money era began- these two utility issues were for refunding purposes . <P> But this week investment bankers will have the kind of new issue they like . Morgan , Stanley &; Co. are heading a syndicate offering $100 million of American Tobacco debentures . The company will use most of the new money to build up its depleted tobacco inventory . <P> The American Tobacco deal will climax two months of day &; night work for investment bankers . They timed the bulk of their financing to fall between the Fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in November . Since the first of the year , bondmen have marketed more than $2 billion of corporates and municipals-the largest total since 1940.
