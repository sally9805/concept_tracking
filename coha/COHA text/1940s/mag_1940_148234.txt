Astounding to Egyptologists , and not entirely convincing , was a story which last week rode the press wires out of Pittsburgh . The story : a 34-year-old University of Pittsburgh professor named Jotham Johnson had fixed the date when the ancient Egyptian calendar began . Sensationally simple was the Johnson voyage of discovery : he had had a Zeiss planetarium projector turned " back through time " to show the position of the stars and the phase of the moon on his chosen date . <P> After collating various scraps of evidence , he decided that June 18 , 3251 B. C. was the likeliest date . Ancient Egyptian records indicate that on the first New Year 's Day the Dog Star rose at dawn ; Johnson felt there should also be a new moon in the west . Dr. Johnson asked the Buhl Planetarium to turn their big projector back through nearly 52 centuries . The planetarium did it , although the job required 20 hours . On the first try , the sky was not as it should have been . Then Johnson realized that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going by the Julian calendar of Julius Caesar . When a correction for this difference was made , the moon and the Dog Star were just where he wanted them . <P> Said Dr. John Albert Wilson , Director of Chicago 's Oriental Institute , when he heard of the Johnson theory last week : " If Professor Johnson has finally set the beginning of the Egyptian calendar for us , we owe him a debt for the next 52 centuries to come . . . . Unfortunately it appears that he went to the planetarium with one or two dangerous assumptions e.g. , that the Egyptian calendar started in June . We shall have to agree with his assumptions before we can present him with a starry crown for achievement . "
