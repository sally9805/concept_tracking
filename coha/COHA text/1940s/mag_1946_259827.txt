President Truman had something positive to say , and he said it in the most forceful language he has yet used in a foreign-policy pronouncement . As in New York City on Navy Day ( TIME , Nov 5 ) , he spoke from under a sounding board of military power : Chicago 's Army Day celebration . <P> The Army had arranged a big show . Chicago turned out , some 1,000,000 strong , on a cold and windy morning . They gathered along streets of the Loop to watch the President 's party drive to Michigan Boulevard 's Blackstone Hotel . There were some cheers as smiling Harry Truman 's car passed . For the car behind his , carrying General Dwight Eisenhower , Admiral William D. Leahy and Treasury Secretary Fred Vinson , there were prolonged huzzahs . <P> Might on Parade . At the Blackstone the President told about 100 high school reporters that he favored giving voting rights to 18-year-olds . He said that youth , by its war services , had proved its ability to handle the highest duties of citizenship . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President , his wife and daughter stood stiffly in the cold as tanks , armored cars , sleek green guns and some 14,000 soldiers passed his reviewing stand on Michigan Boulevard . <P> After a warming lunch ( thick tenderloin steaks ) and acceptance of a medal from Chicago 's Mayor Kelly , * the President rode in an open car , its safety glass raised to full height , to Soldier Field . There , as his car edged around the arena , he returned beaming smiles for the cheers . But as he alighted at the north end of the amphitheater , somebody threw a tomato at the President of the U.S. If Harry Truman noticed it as it squashed on the cinder track he gave no sign . <P> Might of Peace . But he could hardly help noticing the crowd 's behavior . Some 65,000 people were in the windswept stadium ( capacity 116,308 ) as the President arrived . Many had waited three or four hours ; the temperature was 46 . The crowd gave Eisenhower its biggest cheer of the day , listened attentively to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is assured , maintain and constantly improve the perishable machines of our security " ) . <P> By the time the President was introduced , the crowd had begun to thin out . The President 's high , flat voice was strong as he emphasized his theme : " We are determined to remain strong . . . to exercise our leadership on behalf of a world of peace . . . . " Slowly he measured off the three points on which he said U.S. power for peace depends : 1 ) unification of the armed services ; 2 ) temporary extension of Selective Service ; 3 ) universal military training . " Now , even in an election year like this , nobody should play politics with the national safety . " There was no audible response . <P> The President went on to his major pronouncement : " The immediate goal of our foreign policy is to support the United Nations to the utmost . " There was a feeble cheer , a few seconds of applause for this implicit answer to Winston Churchill 's call for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its power behind the United Nations ' " right to insist that the sovereignty and integrity of the Near and Middle East must not be threatened by coercion or penetration . " No response from the crowd .
