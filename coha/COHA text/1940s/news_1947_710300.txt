txt MAYOR 'S FORMULA BARS ANY STRIKES ON TRANSIT LINES Letter Calls for Parleys With 1 Unions but Stresses Ban on Exclusive Bargaining Rights BOARD TO RESTATE POLICY Head of TWU Local Commends Stand as Wholesome Step in Stabilizing Relations Declaring that " strikes against the Board of Transportation and the city can not be tolerated , " Mayor O'Dwyer recommended a formula for a sound labor relations policy yesterday to the Board of Transportation with the aim of stabilizing labor relations in the field of municipal transit . The Mayor 's policy was expressed in an interchange of letters with William H. Davis , Transportation Commissioner , who has been working on a formula since last September . The Mayor 's declaration came within twentyfour hours after he had announced a " no closed shop " policy for the 120,000 city employes directly under his control . The Board of Transportation and the Board of Education , as autonomous agencies not directly responsible to the Mayor , were not covered by last Tuesday 's announcement . The Mayor informed the Board of Transportation that no single agency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all transit employes and recommended a system of plural negotiation in which the rights of all 32,000 workers would receive equal treatment . The Mayor laid down the principle that any transit worker could join any union of his choice , or could refrain from joining any union without jeopardizing his rights . TWU Leader Commends Plan The Transport Workers Union , which has threatened a transit strike three times , greeted the Mayor 's announcement with a mild rejoinder that reflected its confidence that it could act as the dominant bargaining agent in the transit system . Austin Hogan , president of Local 100 of the TWU , issued a statement last night calling the Mayor 's action " a wholesome step in the direction of stabilizing labor relations and improving public service . " " While the plan does not include all the recommendations made last summer by the Mayor 's Advisory Transit Committee , it does contain some of the essentials of the committee 's report , namely , collective bargaining , union representation , voluntary check-off and advisory arbitration , " Mr. Hogan said . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O'Dwyer 's express approval , that the Board of TransIportation shall give greatest weight to the views of the union having the greatest membership . We commend the Mayor for his positive contribution to the solution of labor problems of civil service employes , in marked contrast to the hysterical and repressive Condon-Wadlin Bill that Governor Dewey has jammed through the State Legislature . " Union Membership Optional On the matter of union membership , the Mayor 's advice was that ( the board weigh the rights of nonunion members as well as those of union members . A union asserting a claim to majority representation , he said , must be prepared to prove its contention . This provision , to some observers , opened the door to an examination of the books of any union claiming to represent transit workers . The Mayor 's recommendations coincided in the main with those advanced by Mr. Davis . Commenting on the plan , the Board of Transportation said : " The Board of Transportation has today received a proposed plan presented by Commissioner Davis to the Mayor , and the comments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 , 1947 . The board will study both , together with the plan the Mayor has presented to govern other city departments in order to determine if any modification should be made in the board 's established policy . To clarify the matter , the board will restate its labor policy publicly without delay after decision . " TEXT OF MAYOR 'S LETTER Acknowledging Mr. Davis ' suggestions for a labor formula , Mayor // O'Dwyer expounded his own labor licy in the following letter : . Dear Commissioner Davis : I have read carefully and with a great deal of interest your letters to me of Feb. 14 and Feb. 27 , 1947 , wherein you state a proposed policy or plan of labor relations which you support and which you say could be administered to the benefit of the Board of Transportation and its employees . You believe this proposal gives full recognition to the duties and responsibilities of the members of the board as fixed by law . You outlined four essentials which I stated were necessary in any policy or plan which might be adopted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggestions . They are : 1 ? In carrying on negotiations on wages , hours and working conditions the board will consult with each of the representative organizations and will in this way endeavor to find out , and so far as possible give effect to , the needs and desires of all'its employees individually and collectively . During these negotiations and in making its decisions , the board will give proper weight to the number of employees represented by each organization , so as to give the greatest possible amount of satisfaction to the largest number of its employees . For this purpose you propose the board will examine the credentials of the various representative organizations , in appropriate units , and will announce for each unit the organization which represents the largest number of employees in that unit as well as the minority representation . Tinder no circumstances , you state , will there be an election . 2 ? On the handling of grievances you mention certain principles which have been adopted and state that the Bureau of Labor Relations of the Board of Transportation will make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , caused by management making decisions and taking action which it regards as necessary and proper but upon which employees look with dissatisfaction , you state that I have referred such disputes to an impartial board for an advisory opinion , and that you consider this sound procedure and believe that it ought to be understood that it will be followed , if future occasions arise . 4-You recommend there be granted a voluntary check-off of employee organizational dues , cancelable at will , the cost of which is to be borne by the beneficiary organization . No Exclusive Bargaining Rights You indicate that the determination of the extent of representation of the various organizations is for the purpose of enabling the board , in making decisions on wages , hours and working conditions , to give the greatest possible satisfaction to the largest number of its employees . It is desirable for the board to seek to fulfill , within the framework of its own needs and obligations , the desires of the largest number of its employees . I see no objection to the type of determination of representatives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be clearly stated , however , that this is the purpose and that exclusive bargaining rights may not be granted to any organization of employees under the constitution and laws of this State . Individual employees views and rights must be respected and weighed . Furthermore , as you state , " The rights , privileges and benefits to be granted to an organization which the board recognizes as having the largest number of employees in a - unit would not be different from the rights , privileges and benefits which inure to the organizations representing minorities in the unit , except in the relative weight to be given to the views expressed . " It must also be clearly stated that each employee is free to join any association or any other representative group that he desires to join and that he is equally free to refrain from joining any such organization . I see no reason to comment upon the procedure for handling grievances , in view of the fact that a further study by the Bureau of Labor Relations of the board is contemplated . With reference to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hesitated on occasion to call upon outstanding citizens for consultation , advice and recommendations regarding various labor problems . I see no reason to alter this course in this respect in the future . In this connection , I am sure you realize that a public official has statutory obligations . In the last analysis , within the area of his responsibility , the decision must be his own . He can not by implication or otherwise , constitute any board or individual to act for hire . Legality of Check-Off in Doubt You state that there is a difference of opinion as to the legality of your fourth proposal , that is , that there be granted a voluntary check-off of employe organizational dues , cancelable at will , the cost thereof to be borne by the beneficiary organization . If the legality of your proposal is established , I see no objection to the board granting such a checkoff . For yeur information , I am forwarding to you herewith copy of a directive which I have issued to establish a policy and plan of labor relations between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This policy , applying to 120,000 city employes , exclusive of the school and transit systems , was announced Tuesday . I understand that , under a resolution adopted by the Board of Transportation on Oct. 1 , 1946 , the board assigned to you initial responsibility for the conduct of personnel and employe relations . The Board of Transportation , under the law , is an autonomous body and the board itself must make , and be responsible for , the policy of labor relations between the board and its employes . I urge that you now confer with your associates on the board with a view to adopting a sound labor relations policy which will bring about cooperation between the board and its employes and under which both will perform their duties as required by law . However , in adopting and applying any policy , the best interests of the people of the City of New York must be , at all times , paramount . Very truly yours , William O'DWYER , Mayor .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
