Senator Joseph F. Guffey , most vociferous of the Senate 's tiny handful of New Dealers , set off a political volcano last week . The volcano might be just the Democratic Party , or it might be the nation . The oratorical lava which seethed out revealed a shocking depth of Senate bitterness against President Roosevelt and his inner circle-at the least . At its worst , it widened a split between Congress and the President which may be symptomatic of national disunity . <P> Slick , sleek Joe Guffey , in a press release , asserted that the Senate vote rejecting the Administration soldier-vote bill ( TIME , Dec. 13 ) had been the work of " a combination of Northern Republicans , under the leadership of Joe Pew , and of Southern Democrats , under the leadership of Harry Byrd . " He called this an " unpatriotic and unholy alliance . " <P> Three Southern Democrats rose up in the Senate to reply , in an extraordinary spate of oratory-Virginia 's Harry Byrd , North Carolina 's Josiah Bailey , South Carolina 's Cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe Guffey to shreds , came close to out- &-out; denunciation of Mr. Roosevelt . Senators Bailey and Smith talked threateningly about a new Southern Democratic Party . <P> Reverse Pyrge . Was the South really going to secede again-this time from the Democratic Party ? Not even Joe Bailey thought that probable . " I have been thinking over the burden of that speech for a long time , " he said afterward , " and I felt that the time had come to utter it . The important thing is not that the announcement was made . The important thing was that , for the first time in 79 years , it could be justifiably made . " <P> But what did the Southerners expect to accomplish ? In their private talk they said : election of a Republican President in 1944 , giving Democrats four years to purge the New Dealers , might be the best thing for the Democratic Party . <P> Roosevelt henchmen scoffed . They hold that when the dissidents squarely face the loss of their patronage , their Congressional chairmanships , and in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But after nearly eleven years , the Southerners are gorged with patronage , and many expect their party to lose control of the House , possibly of the Senate , and perhaps of the Presidency-even if Roosevelt runs . And the inner circle 's analysis ignored , too , the fact that the recent Kentucky elections gave Southern politicians reason to believe that the Southern masses are now ready to follow them . It also underestimated , as Northerners did in 1860 , the quality of Southern hatred . <P> The hatred now directed against the New Deal is clearly deep and sincere . The list of Southern grievances is long : " coddling " of the Negro , " coddling " of labor , attacks on the poll tax , upping of Southern pay scales , failure to redress discriminatory freight rates , the 1938 Purge . But the Southerners ' anger is also compounded of resentment against long-continued rebuffs and slights . And their passion is fiercely personal , not only against the President but even more bitterly against the White House inner circle-Harry Hopkins , Dave Niles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Congress has long been notorious .
