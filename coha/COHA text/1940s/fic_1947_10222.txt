get pushed around . I might go to a place down in the Berkshires where some of the girls go . ' You should n't do that , ' Abe said earnestly . Let them run you out ? You would n't be such a spineless thing . Peoplehere are mostly okay . You should stay and have a good time . ' People here are okay , ' Miss Liebowitz said , but you 've been lonesome ever since you came . ' Abe shrugged . Is anybody ever not lonesome ? I do n't know . ' He felt suddenly sad and tired and as if it were n't worth talking any more . Sure , I admit it , ' he said . Sure , I 'm lonesome , why not ? ' Off across the water a girl laughed again , and he felt Miss Liebowitz shiver . So I 'm lonesome , ' he said angrily . What is that to anyone else ?

' I saw it from up on the hill . ' Oh , up on the hill ! ' Abe said . That is n't seeing anything . ' When he started to urge her down a path to the left , she held back , and for a minute he saw it as it might look to her : a strange man trying to get a girl off into the woods . He dropped her elbow . Of course , maybe you 're scared , ' he said . There is nothing to be scared of . See , this is a path down to the lake . ' Stepping in front of her , he scratched a match on his shoe . The yellow flame bloomed weakly , brought up the weathered rails and the sagging cross of the turnstile , the dark of trees . With the sulphur smell in his nostrils Abe waited . What would I be scared of ? ' Miss Liebowitz said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teeth on edge . Once in a while that New York superiority was more than ap31man should take quietly . And my name is Ruth , ' she said . Without his guiding hand she groped her way off the road and put her hands on the turnstile . Ummmml ' she said , and lifted her face . Is n't that a heavenly smell ! ' Cedars and firs , ' Abe said . He was walking so anxiouslyclose that he bumped into her twice . You 'll see , ' he said . This village is n't as bad as it looks from that inn . There are fine people here , lots of them , good friends of mine , summer people and natives and all kinds . For instance , I can borrow a rowboat . Would you like to take a row on the lake ? I can borrow a rowboat as easy as you would borrow a pencil . ' They came out of the woods , the dark cool smell of water was in their faces , and as their feet left the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fleeting , visible-and-gone-again movement of light from the surface of the lake . Under the planks the water stirred like something sleepy and alive . A jangle of laughter and falsetto yips came across from the lost shadow of the far shore . Abe put his hands on Ruth Liebowitz 's shoulders and pressed down , as if to settle her feet firmly onto the dock . Wait here . Just wait a minute , please , ' he said stammering , and was gone . She waited a good while above the uneasy stirring of the water , hearing the rodentlike gnawings and lappings under the dock and trying to see into the dark . The cool breath of the lake touched her again , and she shivered , wishing she had stopped at the inn for a coat . For a moment she contemplated leaving , just going on back to her room , but that would have been mean . He was such a funny , pompous , angry , nice man , and so kind of pathetic . She turned to look the way he had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a swinging lantern . Kaplan came up , breathing hard , saying , Ah , ah , I did n't like to keep you waiting , I hope it was n't long . ' Shadows tipped and swung around him as he stooped and hunted for something at the edge of the dock . She heard him grunt , saw him pulling on a rope . A pulley rose dripping to the surface as the line fed through it , and the sharp nose of a white rowboat slid into the lantern light , the oily water parting with deep glints of lemon and ruby , lifting the boat a little as Abe held its bow against the planks . Kaplan stepped in after her , set the lantern in the bottom , and settled himself to rowing . The lantern threw a diffused glow upward on his pleased and satisfied smile . As he swung the oars he kept nodding at her , and his large even teeth glinted . You see ? ' he said . What did I tell you ? ' Tell me about what ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't tell me anything about it . ' Rowing , he bent so that his puzzled eyebrows netted light as a spiderweb nets dew . I did n't tell you ? Then how did I persuade you to come out here ? ' You did n't . You just went and got the lantern and brought me . ' He stopped rowing . This is funny . Do you want to go back ? ' Why , because you did n't persuade me first ? ' I do n't know what is the matter with my head , ' he said , and beat it softly with his fist . She laughed aloud . A little thrill went through her at the thought that maybe someone , maybe a couple in love , somewhere around the lake , would hear her laugh across the water and it would say something to them of love and pleasure and the sadness of being young at night , the wayp83the other girl 's laugh had spoken to her . I would n't go back for anything , ' she said . Kaplan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no kidding . You live alone , you never know when you 've said something and when you 've just thought it . Plenty of things you want to say bad enough , you just have them on your mind and never quite know whether you 've said them or not . Did you ever do that ? ' Ruth never had , but she thought it was interesting because it showed how really all by himself he was . She told him about Garbstein 's , how it was the other way around there . A lot of things you should n't say you just spilled out , talking with the girls , and first thing you knew they had you all by heart . Still , she guessed it was better than having no one to talk with at all . ' Well , ' Kaplan said , I apologize . I am sorry . I thought I told you how I liked to row at night and how the stars slide down the little hills of water the oars make , and then whirl just under the surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any of that ? ' No . Go ahead , though . It sounds as if maybe you wrote poetry about it . ' Poetry ? ' Abe said , and stopped rowing to make a repudiatinggesture with one hand . Not poetry , not me . Poetry is all right , there is a girl in the village writes some , but not me . ' As he bent and lifted the lantern the light spread out wide , but showed no shore . The dragging oars cut the water as if it were gelatinous . I can show you how I like it best , ' Kaplan said . The light spoils it . ' Ruth said nothing . She was leaning over the gunwale , looking down into the green-amber gelatinous water with the light drowning in it far down . A miraculous trailing frond of water weed flowed across the light and was gone again.  | Have I your permission ? ' Kaplan 's angry voice said . She jerked her head up . He was still holding the lanternhigh , ready to lift the shade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , sure , certainly . ' Now that they were out in open water a faint light seemed to come from somewhere , out of the sky or from the lake itself , and Ruth made out the dark shore on the right , the cloudy sky with only an occasional star showing . In the almost-luminous water she saw once or twice the thing Kaplan had mentioned  --  the stars that slid down the glassy hill of water before the oar blades and floated just under the whirlpooled surface . She sighed , listening to the regular creak and chock of the rowing . You know , ' she said , I never had a boatride at night , never in my whole life . Not in a little boat like this . ' It is something I like , ' Kaplan said . When I am lonesome , I borrow this boat . Having friends here , I do n't have to own one . All I have to be is a good borrower , leave it tied up and not dirtied . ' It seems funny , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somehowit does n't seem right that Jewish people should live in the country . Generally if they get out at all it 's just for a vacation , like me , but here you live here the year around . ' I am a bad Jew , ' Kaplan said . And you know the names of things , like a country person . You know sweet fern and what kind of trees things are . You must have lived in the country in Russia , did n't you ? ' I told you , ' Kaplan said . Kharkov . And that is not country . That was a ghetto . When I was a child I was in jail . ' You mean when you were a revolutionist ? ' No , no , that is n't what I mean . ' Talking with his hands ,  |p35he  splashed her skirt with water . As a child I lived as if in jail . Stone , iron , synagogues , my grandfather , beatings and black bread . That is a black place , that Russia . Maybeit is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess orphans have it about the same anywhere , ' Ruth said . Poor orphans , at least . ' The rowing sounds went on in the cool silence . Near the boat a fish splashed heavily , and in the stillness that followed , there was a noise of frogs somewhere under the black shore . A little dog was yipping off on the hill . You hear that ? ' Kaplan said . That is a fox . ' Really ? ' Ruth said . It sounded just like a little dog . ' Kaplan 's misty figure half rose on the thwart , and his coat fell softly into her lap . Put this on , ' he said . You 'll be cold . ' They went in silence again , and Ruth sat remembering how Connie had been homesick for this lake and the farms and the village and country things . She wondered if it were possible ever to be homesick for an orphans ' home or a settlement house or the face of old Mrs. Malevinsky , for the baking brick walls and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the steps , for the loud boys and the tipped ashcans and the black and dirty snow . It seemed to her that Connie had grown up infinitely richer , and for a moment , holding Kaplan 's coat around her shoulders , she felt almost the pang of homesickness she wanted . But it was Connie 's homesickness she felt , not her own , and she knew that if she had grown up Connie Brown she would never have left this place even for New York . In the dark she even felt her eyes sting with tears , and she did n't know what for , unless it was for all homesicknessand all loneliness and the memory of her own stony childhood or the black-bread-and-beatings childhood of Abe Kaplan . Perhaps the tears that wet her eyes werep38for the low dark line of shore and the almost-invisible water , for the bark of a fox on the hill and the chorus of frogs under the bank , for beauty that she felt and yet did not know . It seemed to her pathetic , almost a personal wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bark of a fox from the bark of a dog , and not know sweet fern when she smelled it . It was late when they came back , groping toward shore with nothing to guide them except two arc lights back on the village street , several hundred yards from the lake . Ruth could n't see the dock , the beach , anything . Land was a dike of shadow that might be rods away or might be a boat-length . Abe lighted the lantern and stood up to hold it high . All it did for Ruth was dazzle her and hide the shore in an obscurity of light rather than an obscurityof darkness , but Kaplan grunted and sat down , and after three or four strokes the bow choked suddenly in sand . Ruth stood on the beach while he pulled the boat to the dock and tied it up . The gestures of his enormous shadow were polite and jerky as he moved around the lantern . Then the lantern rose and came toward her and they started up toward the village lights . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the posts of a roadside fence , came out of the dark to stare palely . When they struck the square Kaplan took a good hold on Ruth 's elbow and walked her up the street under the hill . They were , she saw , almost directly under the high spire of the church . From down below it looked amazinglyhigh , carrying the hill upward in a thin pointer against a blackboard speckled with stars . Abe walked her up the road a few yards and held the lantern high . She saw first a woodpile with an axe stuck in the block , its new handle white as china . Beyond the woodpile was a gray tent with a patched roof and wooden sides . A stove/pipe came up through a tin patch on the roof , and the front flaps were tied down across a framed doorway . Behindthe tent the hill went up in a dark , almost vertical wall . The lantern swung down , lighted briefly on tall grass and a half-strangled squash vine with yellow flowers on it . ' This is where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brusquenessor anger , which had n't been in his voice for more than an hour , was back . He stood close and shouted at her , ' This is where I have lived for five years ! ' ' In a tent ? ' ' Well , ' he said , if I want to live in a tent whose business is it ? ' ' Nobody 's , only ... ' ' So anybody who thinks it is funny can mind his own business , ' Kaplan said . ' I could build a house if I wanted to . I like this . ' Impatiently he steered Ruth down to the square , where the one arc light spread a misty yellow light around . A single globe burned above the doorway of the inn . ' I could build a house , ' Kaplan said . ' As a matter of fact , I have thought of it . But when you get a house you get water pipes to freeze . It seems like a lot of trouble . ' The lantern swung in a wide gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fool yourself . Friends I have got here would help , it would go up like nothing . ' He was walking sideways and staring at her . With the light on his face from below and his big eyebrows full of it he looked like a comic mask . ' Well , I should think ... ' she said . ' All right , I will tell you , ' Abe said . ' I had reasons for living in a tent . When I came up here I was sick . Boston did that to me  --  tuberculosis . All the first winter I slept in that tent with all my clothes and an overcoat on and quilts over my head . And when I had done it once I could do it again . I could have built a house any time , but the last two winters I went to Florida instead and kept a little cleaning and pressing shop . By now , instead of Saint Petersburg I am thinking of a house . ' Stamping past the post office he snorted as if his nostrilswere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a tent , ' he said . On the lawn before the dark inn they faced each other like awkward high-school children after a date . Finally Abe reached out and shook her hand  --  not pressed it or squeezed it , but shook it as if he were greeeting a farmer friend . Well , ' he said , I have enjoyed meeting you . I hope you are not mad because I followed you . ' Of course not , ' she said . It 's been lots of fun . ' Also I hope you will stay right here until you have had your vacation . This is not a summer resort , but there are some things we could do . ' He was looking at her so earnestly , his teeth showing in a formal smile , his body inclined from the waist , that she did n't know quite how to answer . He was n't her notion of a Romeo , but still he was terribly nice , really ... He was still shaking her hand . I do n't know , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I insist . You should stay . ' Well , ' she said , mocking him , you insist ! ' He dropped her hand and stood back and when she went in the door of the porch he was still standing there with his hand raised in farewell , up to his knees in the round shadow of the lantern base . The next morning , Saturday , it was raining when Abe appeared after breakfast . As he was talking with Ruth at one end of the porch , away from the inn guests , Mrs. Brown came down the stairs . She was a drab little farm wife , too busy for her strength , and everything worriedp39her . She wondered now what Miss Liebowitz and Abe had in mind . Maybe they would like a picnic lunch made up . Abe looked at her , and as he looked his elbow jerked outward and his lips began to stammer . But he did n't say anything nasty . He just nodded down at the dripping maples and the gray slant of rain over the square and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still looking at the landlady in triumph , daring her to reply , when he had another thought . He frowned at Mrs. Brown , who stood there as if not quite sure how to excuse herself . We changed our minds , ' he said . You should put up a lunch for Miss Liebowitz , yes . ' He added , holding Mrs. Brown 's eye , A good one , eh ? ' Mrs. Brown went away . Where do I come in on this ? ' Ruth said . Do I have anything to say about where I eat ? ' Not today . ' He smacked his hands together , beaming at her . Today you will see how the other half lives . ' There were eyes on them from down the porch . Abe cleared his throat noisily , and smiled at Ruth in a secret , confidential way . When Mrs. Brown finally came back with a basket he took it from her and hooked it over his arm . I put in an extra half of chicken , Abe , ' she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very much , ' Abe said . Well , you wo n't see us again today . That will be good , eh ? ' Ruth yanked him outside before he could say anything else . She did not like to watch the helpless , worried face of Mrs. Brown , and her thin pointed lips feeling for words to say , reaching out like a snail 's foot to see what was rough , what sharp , what safe ; or hear the thin tired voice feeling its way through an empty sentence to die on an unfinished phrase . Ruth felt sorry for Mrs. Brown . Snobberyshould be administered by people who believed in it . Where are we going ? ' she said.  | Up to my place . ' Together , Abe holding his umbrella over them , runningsideways with the basket of lunch on his other arm , his feet slipping and swerving in the puddles , they ran down into the square and up the shining wet road . The floor of Abe 's tent was raised , and it was snugger inside than Ruth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though it had been raining for over an hour . The bed , back against the rear wall , made a sofa with an auto robe over it , and there were two chairs , a dropleaf table , and a small square stove , and along the other side an ironing board and a rack made of galvanized pipe , on which hung dresses and suits with cleaner 's slips pinned to them . The stove was still warm from Abe 's breakfast fire , and even with the flaps down there was a pleasant gray light . The roof moved now and ' then under a blast of wind and rain , but altogether it was warmer , lighter , and pleasanter than she would ever have anticipated . Abe stirred around , putting wood on the fire , moving chairs . As he reached out and tied back one of the door flaps he nodded to her . In case people went by , ' he said . It would look better , you understand . People come here all the time with cleaning and mending . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ankles , Ruth nodded . Ile was so fussy about little things like this that he amused her . Punctilio in a tent , ' she said . Eh ? ' Nothing . I should think you 'd get awful cold in the winter . ' Abe shrugged himself into a canvas chair . A few times I have seen it forty below . That is cold , I tell you . I bank up the sidewalls with cedar branches , and I keep the stove redhot and on really cold days I run an oil heater too , but forty below , that is too cold . You ca n't sit around , no matter how much you have on . Somewherep41the cold will find a crack and get at you . I spill water on the floor , it freezes ssssssssppt ! like that . The store is a better place to sit those days . ' His eyebrows cocked up at her , his large brown eyes met hers almost as if pleading . Of course , with a house , that is a different thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big kitchen stove keeps things warm and heats water , and in the pie . ' Well , I do n't know , ' she said . I should think you 'd miss books , and music , and things like that . I would . In New York I only live three blocks from a branch of the New York Public , and I read all the time . I could n't live without books . I should think you 'd just perish . ' Books ? ' Abe said . I 've got books . ' He reached under the bed , saying , Sorry , excuse me , please , ' as he moved her feet aside , and pulled out a long narrow box . Inside were books . He pulled them out one at a time , blew dust from them , whacked them on his bent knee . Sumner , Folkways , ' he said , and passed it over . John Reed , A Daughter of the Revolution . ' He got out another . ' Lynd , Middletown . The Writings of Nicolai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bending to see titles in the box . She never could help looking over people 's books to see what they read . Have you got any novels ? ' she said . ' Galsworthy , or Aldous Huxley , or Sinclair Lewis , or Thomas Wolfe or anybody ? ' Novels ? ' Abe said , and brandished a book at her . Why should I waste time on novels ? When I read I want to work my brains , get some exercise . I read serious literature . Novels , no . I have n't got novels . ' Ruth 's brows drew down , and she looked at him hard . ' What do you mean , waste time on novels ? You do n't mean to say you do n't think novels are worth reading  --  good novels ? '  |p42Well  , ' Abe said , what are brains for ? To be used , eh ? And what works your brain reading a story about somebody ? Why not read something that tells you something ? ' He stuck a book in her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is a book that tells you something . What do you know about this country from readingnovels ? ' I would n't attempt to tell you , because you would n't understand , ' Ruth said tartly . But anybody with any sense can learn more from novels than he can from all the textbooks in your box . Novels give you an understandingof people , they open your eyes to all kinds of things . Who do you think Sinclair Lewis is , some writer of children 's books , maybe ? ' I suppose he is some novelist , ' Abe said , and shrugged . You suppose , ' Ruth said . You do n't know . You sit up here in your canvas house and read your textbooks and stuff your head with sawdust when you could be reading something good like Arrowsmith or the Forsyte Saga . ' Say , listen ! ' Abe said . Sawdust , is it ? Let me tell you . Into this tent , every summer now for five years , come all sorts of people , fine people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinds . How many college presidents do you know , ha ? I know three . I make their clothes . How many historians do you know ? None ? Almost every day comes in here Stephen Dow , the best historian in America except maybe Beard . Every day I talk to him , I argue with him , I sharpen my brains discussingthings with him and with deans from Harvard and Princeton and Yale . I sit here and stuff myself with sawdust , eh ? Let me tell you , Miss Liebowitz ... ' Tell it to the Marines , ' Ruth Liebowitz said through her teeth . She stood up and grabbed Abe 's umbrella . I guess I do n't have to stay here and be yelled at  --  and in a tent at that . '  |p43She  started out , Abe right with her . A tent is as good a place for brains to grow as anywhere else , even maybe Rockefeller Center , ' he shouted . This tent is always full of brains . Is it religion you want to discuss ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ economics ? All right . Is it revolution ? I am an old revolutionary , I know all about that business . Is it history ? Okay , I have read history . But if it is novels , I resign . Novels I do not consider brains . Storytelling is for children 's bedtimes and silly women . ' Oh , it is ! ' Ruth said , because she was so mad she could n't think of anything else to say . She ducked out through the flap and stood for a moment on the single step with the rain in her face while she fought the umbrellaopen . Abe came up behind her and spread his hands , grinning . Say now , listen ... ' But Ruth pulled the black umbrella close down over her head and marched out the path through the grass , hopped the muddy stream flowing down the roadside ditch , and went on down the road to the inn . About eleven o'clock the rain blew to a stop , the clouds fogged off northwestward leaving pools of blue sky , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tent and read in the book he had happened to have in his hand when Ruth Liebowitz left . It was Beard , and Beard was a great historian . But his eyes kept lifting from the page , looking outside into the clearing weather . Twice he waved at people going by ; once a cottager brought a child 's coat for mending . The blue pools in the sky grew , the roiled clouds thinned . Abe looked over his shoulder at the picnic basket . He was getting hungry , and there was a whole chicken in there , bread and butter , maybe pickles , potato salad , pie or cake . It would serve the girl right if he ate everything . But he kept thinking that any time she went into thatp44dining room she would meet the snobbery naked and unmistakable , and if he did n't get the basket to her she would have to eat in the dining room . At the same time , suppose he went up to the inn carrying this basket . What kind of nonsense would that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picnic in the pouring rain , and a half hour later the girl coming home alone , and an hour after that Abe Kaplan with the untouched picnic basket ? There were enough ways of making a fool of yourself without trying that one . He threw the Beard angrily into the box and kicked the box under the bed . Angrily he clapped his hat on his head and went down the rainwashed street and up the U-drive to the inn . At the door , kicking his feet back and forth on the steel mat , he looked through the screen and saw Mrs. Brown in the kitchen and beckoned her . Hello , ' he said , when she came . Would you maybe go to Miss Liebowitz 's room and ask her to come down ? It is important I should see her . As a special favor to me , please . ' He saw bewilderment spreading in Mrs. Brown 's face , and it enraged him . Miss Liebowitz came home because she was not feeling well . But tell her please it is importantI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and out on the lawn . I will be by the croquet place , ' he said . He got a mallet and started a croquet ball around the terrace . The ball kicked up a risingtrail of drops , and left a dark streak on the wet lawn . Abe played carefully all the way around , hit the home stake and started off again , and he was almost around the second time when the screen clicked . Ruth Liebowitz came out on the step , her lively eyes very careful and cool and polite like the eyes of a clerk who must wait on everyone but who does not like the person she is waiting on now . Abe beckoned . Miss Liebo/witz did not move . Using his mallet like a cane , he went and planted himself before her . I appreciate it that you would come down , ' he said . Would you walk this way , please , so we can talk ? ' We can talk here . ' Not confidentially , ' Abe said , and looked at the bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped down and followed him over to the croquet wickets . Her eyes were still cold . Now look , ' Abe said . It is like this . You should n't get mad at a little argument . Every day I have arguments ten times worse . Does anybody get mad ? Not once . We laugh and part friends . ' Maybe so , ' said Miss Liebowitz indifferently , but I did not come up here on my vacation to be insulted . ' Oh , insulted ! ' Abe had lifted his spread hand to count off some logic for her , but something in her eye stopped him . He let the hand drop . If you 're insulted , I am sorry , ' he said . Novels or history , what does it matter ? If it is novels you want , you should come not to me but to the village library , which is open Wednesday and Saturdayafternoons . If it is history or religion or arguments you want , I am your man . ' All right , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Abe stiffened his back . There is one other thing . Up at my place is that basket . I did n't bring it here because that would look funny . But I thought now the rain has stopped you might rather eat that than eat at the inn . So if you will tell me some place you want it , I will take it there . ' Ruth Liebowitz looked down over the square . Her nostrils pinched in momentarily . I guess we 'll just forget the lunch . I would n't want to bother you . ' It 's no bother . ' It 's a lot of trouble to go to for a woman who reads novels . '  | Abe blinked , but let it pass , and the moment it passed he knew that everything was all right again . Ruth Liebowitzsmiled , her eyes filled with light , her good broad fresh face crinkled and curved , and they stood on the croquet ground laughing at each other . Well , ' Abe said , that is some relief , I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me all my life . ' I will , if you ever say anything like that again . You were positively insulting . Besides , you were absolutely wrong . ' Yes , ' Abe said . I suppose . I remember something about sawdust , too . But I tell you , this is no place to squabble . We can take that basket and eat down by the lake . And after lunch I will do penance , I will take you to the library and let you see some novels . ' The library occupied the front half of the firehouse  --  a bare room with shelves around three sides , and a table and a chair for old Mrs. Budd . Ruth was squatting against the wall reading titles on the lower shelf when she heard the door open and heard Abe 's voice in loud enthusiasticgreeting . She turned to see him shaking hands with two very tall men and a pretty woman in a red corduroy suit . Well , well , well ! ' he said . Hello , hello ! Just the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eh ? I want you to meet somebody , a friend of mine . ' Ruth stood up and fixed her face for introductions , and Abe rushed to grab her arm and lead her up to the older man . Mr. Stephen Dow , ' he said , this is Miss Ruth Liebowitz , a friend of mine from New York . ' The old man had a graven , rosy face and pure white hair , and his hands were brown from the sun . His smile was kindly and warm , his voice a resonant bass . Ruthp47shook his hand diffidently , feeling young and shy and a little ashamed of Abe 's boisterousness , and wondering where she had seen the old man before . His face and voice were both familiar ... . And Mr. and Mrs. Peter Dow , ' Abe said . Last night when you went walking you walked up their road . ' Oh , yes , ' Ruth said . The view is lovely from up there . ' She shook hands with Mrs. Dow , and with almost a pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-caredfor , well-loved charm she wore as casually as the red corduroy . Peter Dow was very tall and rawboned , with a long homely face and a big laugh . But where had she seen the old man ? Oh , I know ! ' she said . I knew I 'd seen you before . I heard you lecture once at the New School . ' Abe was standing back , unable to conceal his pride at having brought these friends of his together . New School , is it ? Have you lectured at the New School , Mr. Stephen Dow ? ' I 'm afraid I have , Abe , ' Mr. Dow said . Is it something I should be ashamed of ? ' He winked at Ruth Liebowitz . Maybe , maybe not , ' Abe said . Tell me this . Did you lecture on history , or did you lecture on novels ? ' I might have lectured on either . When did you hear me ? ' Last winter , ' Ruth said . About February , I think . ' Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , Abe ! ' Ruth said . No , ' Abe chortled . You are in good . Miss Liebowitz is a novel reader , she thinks history is sawdust . ' Is n't it ? ' Peter Dow asked , as if surprised . He in turn winked at Ruth Liebowitz . His wife laughed . Ask Dad what he comes in here for twice a week , " Peter said . Go on , ask him . Embarrass him . ' All right , ' Abe said , grinning . What are you after to read ? I suppose it is novels . '  |p48Ste|phen  Dow bent over close to Abe 's ear . I hate to admit it , but the village is so full of professors who donatetheir summer books to the library that this little room we 're in right now is probably the best library of detective novels in America . I come in twice a week and take away three at a time . ' Ruth pointed her finger at Abe and screamed with laughter . For a minute she had a horrid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dow and all the rest were laughing too . We had an argument , ' Ruth said . You know how he loves to argue ! Well , you know what he told me ?

' And you , ' said Stephen Dow gravely , a confirmed novel reader , attend lectures on American history at the New School for Social Research . ' Oh , yes , ' she said , not quite sure how to take him . I used to take courses there all the time . I think it 's won-derful . ' Abe was trying to make himself heard . From the librarian 's table old Emma Budd stared bleakly across the room . All right , all right , ' Abe said . So you jumped on me two onto one . All right . I give up . But the question is does reading use your brains , and there I wo n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I play croquet or go for a walk . But in our serious times when it means brains should be used , we all study history , even you , my friend Miss Liebowitz from New York . ' He skipped about them , his face stretched with a delightedgrin . Ruth looked at the Dows and saw that they all liked him ; they were amused by him and they liked him . For the first time since she had met him she began to think that perhaps he did have friends up here , perhaps he did have some kind of good life . It made her feel goodp49just to see how much he liked and admired the Dows , and they kidded Abe and gathered up the old man 's detectivestories and walked to the door with their hands on his shoulders . ' I tell you , ' he said when they were gone , ' those are fine people . The very best in the world . That is what it means to be civilized . To be as good as the best , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very distinguished-looking man , ' Ruth said . ' Looking ? ' Abe said . ' He is more than looking . He is distinguished . Also he is one of my good friends . We argue every day when he comes down for his mail . There are others too , professors and writers . In the New School you can hear them lecture , but here I can argue with them every day . ' ' That must be fun for them , ' Ruth said . He grunted . ' You bet it is fun for them . I give them as good as I get , I tell you . Such arguments we have . ' With a strange little smile he fell silent , watching her sidelong . ' There are worse places in the United States to live , ' he said at last . ' This might look like Hickville , but all summerit is full of brains , and even in winter there are plenty of fine people . ' ' Well , ' she said , ' you 'll convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hall . You produce some good music and I 'll move right into the inn and stay the year around . They 'd be delighted to have me , I 'm sure . ' ' Music ? ' Abe said . ' Music , hey ? You like music ? Say , listen ! What are you doing tomorrow night ? ' ' I do n't know . Maybe you think you can talk me into going out with you again . ' ' Say , where would you be in this village if I had n't shown up ? '  |p50I  would n't be in this village . I 'd be down in the Berk-shires . ' Maybe you 're right , ' Abe said . Should I take it as a compliment that you stayed , answer me . ' ' I may not stay much longer . ' But you have to stay until tomorrow night , anyway , ' he said . Tomorrow we will go to the Westwick Philharmonic . You wait . I will show you this place has everythingNew York has except maybe Chinatown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an hour high when he picked her up Sunday evening . They were delayed ten minutes while he introduced her to four farmers in front of the creamery  --  farmers who grinned sourly and looked at the ground and said monosyllabic words in accents so marked she could hardly understand them . They do n't fall all over themselves being cordial , ' she said when they were walking again . That 's just the way they are . ' Well , ' she said , what are they that way for ? ' Why are you the way you are ? ' Abe said . People aredifferent . Farmers do n't mix with summer people much . ' Why not ? ' Maybe they are snobs . Maybe the summer people are snobs . Maybe nobody likes to let anybody else into his gang . I do n't know . Here it is just like anywhere else . The natives are one crowd , they keep to themselves prettymuch . The summer people are all pretty much one kind , and they make this place in the summer like New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with the natives and ca n't make it , and natives who want to be like summer people and are n't accepted . There is even one woman , you will see her place tonight , who has spent fifty thousand dollars around here trying to get her/self accepted among the university people . But they wo n't have any of her . She is just a rich widow , why should they let her in ? It is like totemism , or Calvinism . You have to be elected , or born lucky . ' They were at the dock by now . A man she recognized as Martin Bentham was putting his two daughters and his tall thin wife into a rowboat . Abe pulled in the white boat they had used before , got her settled in the stern , and dug out the oars . Where is this music ? ' she said . Across the lake somewhere ? What 's all the mystery ? ' Here , ' Abe said , and tossed her an auto robe . You can sit on this now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got out in the open lake Ruth could see rowboats , canoes , two or three sailboats , all coming like toy boats pulled on strings toward the big island that cut the lake almost in two . She could imagine some Gulliver on the island with all the strings in his hands . Abe laid to his oars . The sun was behind the hill , but the broad field of mackerel sky was purest silver and blue . Two boys in a double kayak , their paddles dipping in swift unison , shot past them and pulled away . A sailboat far out tacked and cut into the procession as smoothly as a gull . Ruth relaxed and let her fingers trail over the edge . From up ahead around the point of the island something  --  radio or orchestra  --  opened the Egmont Overture . Well , my goodness ! ' she said , and sat up straight . You really were n't fooling . ' Why should I be fooling ? ' She could see how even her momentary excitement tickled him . Every Sunday , unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put up money for records , it is a big music library now , and Mrs. Weld , this widow I told you about , she plays the concerts from her dock . You can hear it clear across the lake , it is some kind of big expensive machine with a fancy speaker . ' I thought the summer crowd would n't accept her ? ' Ruth said . She is another kind of fish , another tribe , ' Abe said . She should go somewhere else in the summer , that 's all . She thinks the way to show off big is to get a big speedboatwith an American flag on it . What she does n't get through her head is that all these professors think there should n't even be fishing motors on the lake . They sit out in their think-houses and they want it quiet . It 's the same with everything Mrs. Weld does . She tries like anything but she does everything wrong . All the professors think she 's vulgar . ' He pulled into position a hundred yards off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and paid out clothesline until the gray rope slackened and bent in the green water . People were coming through the cedars on shore , and boats were anchoring all around them . Abe fussily helped her get down in the bottom and folded the robe over her . The Egmont Overture had been over three or four minutes when a man 's voice said over a publicaddresssystem , The first number on tonight 's program will be Tchaikowsky 's Sixth Symphony , the Pathetique , played by Leopold Stokowski and the Philadelphia SymphonyOrchestra . ' That other , that was the theme song , ' Abe said . They always start with that . People never pay any attention . ' Ruth was snuggling into the angle of thwart and gunwale , huddling the robe around her and getting set . Tchaikowsky ! ' she said . This is wonderful ! Imagine ! Oh , I just love the Pathetique ! ' All right , ' Abe said . How is it ? Is it all right ? Is Westwick as good as New York , or is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to concerts in New York ? '  |p53Shhhhhhh  ! ' she said fiercely . She closed her eyes to listen better . Now as the light faded the mackerel sky went deep rose along its fluted edges , and then dulled to gray . A whisperof after-sunset breeze stirred wavelets against the sides of boats and rocked the quiet canoes and flapped the edge of a furled sheet on a sailboat . The stirrings and low talk in the boats fell away to a murmur , to silence ; the music grew stronger across the water . The sense of being among people was lost ; boats dissolved gradually in the dusk , and except when someone on the dock changed records there was no light except a remote glimmerfrom the cottage back among the cedars . Over the liquid world the music crept like some soft whimpering beast , self-pitying and affectionate . When it was finished there was movement , the clunk of an oar against a boat , voices , a widely-spaced spatter of applause . A boy swung his canoe closer inshore , keepingthe paddle blade deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ruth Liebowitz sighed . That was wonderful , ' she said . Oh , I think this is simply a grand idea . ' Every Sunday , all summer long , ' Abe said . The announcer , his voice too big for the intimate dark , announced the Fifth and Sixth Brandenburg Concertos by Johann Sebastian Bach . Ruth looked up at Abe on the center thwart , his battered hat pulled around his ears and his coat collar up . The sky was blue and dark behind him . You 're cold up there . Why do n't you come down and use part of the blanket ? ' ' I 'm not cold . ' Do n't be silly . My one hand I had out is like ice . Come on , there 's plenty of room . I do n't want to sit here snug while you freeze . ' I 'm not freezing . I 'm perfectly ... '  | Shhhhhl ' she said . Come down here . He came , crawling along the teetery boat , and slid cautiously down , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solidly snug against his . Now , is n't that better ? ' she whispered . Across the water the Bach was beginning , cool and preciseon the surface , but with a pulse in it like the regular warm pulse of the blood.  |p55FOR  THREE DAYS they had been clearing Peter Dow 's hillside , topping cedars and thinning out small trees and widening the steep footpath . Their hours were warm with sun and the smell of summer woods . Sometimes they came upon patches of wild strawberries in sunny openings , and crouched to pick a handful . The ground was glossy with trillium , and the flower shafts of greater Solomon'sseal stood up from the throats of the plants . The cedars were edged with a lace of new growth . At midday they had lunch on Peter Dow 's porch . This was the third time Andy had eaten with the Dows , and he liked it . He could sit and look down over layers of blue air , over the light-sown summer hilltops , and see far off the bare granite peaks of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinct with each crest , the minor ridges of hills came in folds of blue toward him until the foot of the last range touched the shore of the lake . A boat rowing in the south channel around Weld Island was like a legged waterbug from this height . Mrs. Dow brought coffee and left them , and for a while they sat sipping , just looking out at the view . Just as Andy was beginning to feel halfway at ease , and to feel that his embarrassment at eating with summer people would eventually disappear if he let it alone , Peter Dow startled him with his booming voice . Well , Andy , would you be as big a fool as I was , and build a house so high on a hill you had to pack in food on your back every time rain washed the road ? ' It 's nice to look at , ' Andy said cautiously . Wind 'd blow like sixty up here in winter , though . ' That 's the penalty you pay for seeing a long way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stained with pitch and as calloused as a farmer 's . Andy watched him , thinkingthat he neither looked nor talked like the headmaster of Dryden Academy . He talked just like anybody , and he could work like a horse . But he had a habit of speaking sometimes as if he meant more than he said . He fixed Andy with a quizzical eye . The village of Westwick is a sample of what happens when people make a virtue of staying out of the wind , ' he said . E-yeah , ' Andy said doubtfully . Mr. Dow boomed out a laugh and slapped the boy 's leg and rose . You 're too agreeable when I run down your village . Why do n't you ask me how come I 've spent almost every summer for forty years in it ? ' Lifting his head , he sniffed the air and looked amazed . How would you like to pitch hay for Thurson this afternoon instead of clearing any more ? ' All right with me . ' I owe him a few days ' work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' There 's only one thing , ' Andy said . What ? ' Mr. Richie might think if I 'm out haying I ought to be haying for him . He 's short of help down there as ' t is . ' The hell with Mr. Richie , ' Peter Dow said . If he 's willing to hire you out like a livery horse it 's none of his business where I work you . ' At the crossing of the brook behind his house , Mr. Dow took out his knife and cut a willow switch and walked along peeling it carefully . Up along the meadow he slashed the heads off daisies with it . Tell me something , ' he said . E-yeah ? ' lDoes Richie take the wages you make when you work out ? ' He puts half the money away for me . ' And keeps the other half ? ' I guess . ' That 's interesting , ' Mr. Dow said . How old are you ? ' Sixteen . ' Graduated from high school pretty young , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of grades . ' Mr. Dow began whacking at daisies again . On the other side of the meadow they looked over the snake fence into the thigh-deep timothy with the wind loose over it . The whole field lay on a slope facing east and north . The north end of the village , the flash of water from the old mill dam , the looping road to the Corners , the long trough of the valley of the Ammosaukee , and beyond all those the rampart of Sunday Mountain , lay out like something painted . The lower half of the field had been mown . Mrs. Ed Thurson , in a flowered dress and a big hat , was riding the rake , and her husband , bare to the waist and with his head done up in a red bandanna , was cocking up . Above them the haywagon leaned on the hill behind a span of black and white oxen . Every color was sharp and clean . Even the slopes of Sunday , fifteen miles away , glinted bright emerald where the sun picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a sight like that ? ' Peter Dow said . It might as well be the year 1800 . ' As they threw their legs over the snake fence the schoolmaster'sbig hand reached out and tried to push Andy from the top rail . For a moment they sparred , grinningp58and watchful , until Andy leaped sideways and got clear . While they walked down the fence along the edge of the timothy he was thinking  --  feeling , rather , as he felt the sun and the drift of wind and the perfect haying weather  --  that of all the people he knew Peter Dow was the one he respected most and liked most . A city man , he could do practically anything a farmer could do , and he could do so much more that a farmer could n't even imagine . And he had a way of making even a half-mile walk an occasion of special friendliness . Thurson 's piratical figure came up the hill brandishing a hay fork . He lobbed it like a spear , and Andy caught it before it dug into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do , nor did Andy ask him . He simplyfell to cocking up , swirling the hay into place and locking it there with a jab of fork and foot . But there was a special joking tone in Ed Thurson 's voice as he spoke to Peter Dow . Do n't s'pose you know how to pitch on . ' Do n't know much , ' Dow said . But I reckon if you can do it I can learn . ' Thurson forked a whole haycock up onto the wagon and vaulted up after it . He spit on his hands and rubbed them on his pants . All right , Mr. Dow , ' he said . Let the sonofabitchin ' hay fly . ' About three , Mrs. Thurson finished raking and turned her horse toward the barn . The first load went in right behind her . By the time the second load was on the wagon Andy had finished cocking up . After that he and Mr. Dow kept Thurson humping . Ed would touch his fork to where he wanted hay , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Corner to corner to middle to corner , they laid it where Ed wanted it , and faster than he could take it sometimes . They tried to make him holler for time , but he waded around neck deep in the upbuild/ing hay and managed somehow to make his loads , and when he set the teeth of the hayfork into the load and ran the great gobbets high into the mow where Andy and Mr. Dow stood ready to mow up , he got even by dumping hay on their heads a quarter ton at a time . As the fifth load turned on the precarious hill and started toward the barn , Peter Dow tossed his fork up on top . You can mow this one up alone , ' he said . See you tomorrow . ' He sat down on a ledge of outcropping stone that went like a wall across the field , and Andy sprawled in the stubble . They were both sweating after the furious pitching on . At forty-two , ' Mr. Dow said , you do n't rally as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed Thurson hurry just a little , at that . ' Andy said nothing . Pretty soon he should be getting back for chores , but he was willing to kill a few minutes just resting here with Mr. Dow . He looked down to the foot of the meadow , dammed by snake fence and cedar swamp , and up to where another higher outcrop of stone made a wall across the top . When he became aware of Mr. Dow again he found the schoolmaster watching him , leaning back on his elbows and fishing for a cigarette . I 've been making myself a snoop , ' Dow said . Asking questions about you . ' Me ? ' I find that you 're the brightest boy who ever graduatedfrom the local high school . ' Andy grunted , embarrassed , and could not hold Mr. Dow 's eye . You have the further reputation of being about as good help as there is in the village , ' Dow said . I know you 're a good hay hand and a good hand in the woods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-cutting crew than any grown man in the village . Moreover , they say , you 're a slow-boil sort of boy , you keel your mouth shut and do n't talk away your time . '  |p60For  a painful instant Andy met the blue eyes set in wrinkles of brown skin . His own face was warm with creeping blood . People expect things of you , ' Mr. Dow said . So I 've been wondering if you ever thought about going to college . ' Very carefully Andy rolled over on his belly and propped himself on his elbows . Had he ever thought about it ? What else filled the time between bedtime and sleep ? He studied the stubble under his nose . How could I ? ' he said . No money ? ' Well , that . Mr. Richie too . He takes care of me , you might say . ' You might say , ' Mr. Dow said , and knocked one bony hand lightly against the ground . Do you earn your keep ? ' I guess . ' You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Maybe , ' Andy said . But . . . ' Richie has never adopted you , has he ? ' No , not exactly . He . . . brought me up after my mother died . ' He was hunting words carefully , because he did not know how much Mr. Dow knew . Everybody in the village knew well enough , but summer people lived in another world , and maybe Mr. Dow did n't . How long have you lived with Richie ? ' Since I was ten . ' How long have you been working out ? ' The last couple of years . ' But you 've done the chores right along . ' Oh , yes , right from the start I did chores . ' He looked again , briefly , at Mr. Dow 's long face . I could n't get into a college , could I ? Are n't there college boards , and Latin , and stuff like that ? ' Coming from this high school , you 'd have to tutor or study for the boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where are you planning to go ? '  |p61Andy  felt the heat beating back into his face . It was a joke , then . I guess you know where I 'll be going , ' he said . Abstractedly burying his cigarette butt , Peter Dow looked over the meadow . His face wrinkled into a grimace , the same sort of grimace Andy had seen him put on when he talked in town meeting . You just sit still , ' the schoolmaster said . Do n't move fast , or startle me . I feel a proposition coming on . ' He spoke slowly , as if he were talking to himself , or making a speech to an audience he could n't see . There is the obligation that goes with having brains , for one thing , ' he said . An intelligent man in a community like this touches maybe a hundred people . Intelligence of the same grade in a larger world can touch millions . This business of mousetraps and the world beating a path to your door has something to it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't afford to wait twenty years for the world to come pounding through the brush . The world needs mousetraps too desperately . ' It came to Andy quietly , while he watched Mr. Dow talk and listened to the seriousness in the big quiet voice : This is what it might have meant to have a father . But immediately upon that thought came the images of some of the farmers he knew , the fathers of his friends . They gave their boys something , but not this. ... loved this place , ' Mr. Dow was saying . I do . But niy reasons are special , I was n't born into this and I do n't have to stay . This is a static society , Andy , a dying village in a dying state . In spite of everything wonderful in it , stability , laboriousness , traditions as binding as laws , the whole state 's in a backwater . It 's a little tribal backwater , u survival , and it does n't lead anywhere . History touched it once , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we like it or not , the world went another way . '  |p62E-yeah  , ' Andy said , and dug in the matted grassroots with a sliver of sharp stone . If you left here , ' Mr. Dow said , you would n't be any happier . Maybe you would n't be as happy , because the world you 'd go into would n't be as certain of its values as this one is . But I 'm not talking about money or fame or happiness or anything personal to you . I 'm not speaking of rewards , but of what you do to earn the rewards , the obligation you owe the world for endowing you with brains . You just ca n't develop far enough in a society this narrow and this static . Does that make any sense to you ? ' I guess so , yes . ' I doubt it , ' Peter Dow said . It would n't have to me at sixteen . At sixteen I thought of nothing but girls and football . I flatter you by assuming that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Ahh ! ' Andy said , and let a smile slip sideways over to Peter Dow . Peter Dow slapped dust from his overalls and laughed . You 'd make a good farmer , ' he said . You might even get a farm around here and make it pay . A few do . But I 'm advising you to get out of here and go to college . ' Andy dug at the matted roots , keeping his face down . His mind kept wanting to bound away like a lively horse , but he kept snubbing it in . I 'd like to , no question , ' he said cautiously . But you said I 'd have to study somewhere to pass the boards . How ... ' That 's the proposition , ' Peter Dow said . I 've got as many chores at home as Allan Richie has . We 've also got a spare room . And one of the pleasant things about being headmaster of a school is that you can generally arrange a scholarship for somebody good . ' Scholarship ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was up now , and his mind was an its hind legs . After a year you 'd be in shape to take the exams , ' Mr.p63Dow said . If you come out as I hope you will , we can try to wangle something for you at college ,  --  Harvard or Yale or Princeton or Williams or wherever you decide to go . Harvard , Yale , Princeton ? ' Andy said . Thunderation , you do n't expect me to get into one of those ! ' Why not ? ' said Mr. Dow . I did , ' Andy sank back on his elbows , chewing a hay stem and letting his mind loose to run as it wanted to . To go down country , live with the Dows , go to a school like Dryden ( it was all monumental granite out of the quarries at Milford , the way his mind saw it , with a mile-long arch of elms ) . To go to classes with boys who had had that sort of chance all their lives , to go into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that anything he wanted was likely to be there ... . It did not occur to him to doubt that he could do it . Mr. Dow thought he could ; he himself knew he could . But then it turned strange on him , a daydream he would have to put aside , a vision with a sour ending , and it seemed to him incredible that he should be lying there in the stubble taking it seriously , letting himself get taken in . I 'd be scared green , probably , ' he said . Of course , ' Peter Dow said . Andy had expected something else , encouragement perhaps . He rolled again onto his belly and stared across the stubble to the bright cutbank of unmown grass halfwayup the slope , and beyond the cutbank to the undulationsof timothy shadowed by the lightest possible of winds . He watched a tiny stir begin far up , under the topmost outcrop of ledge . It twisted down a dip in the field , faded as the breeze lost itself or went dead , reappearedfarther down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came almost as if it had purpose , winding a narrow shadowy stir down the field.  | Andy watched it half-aware , wondering how Mr. Richie would react to a notion like this , estimating how much there might be put away from his working for the past two years . What if Mr. Richie would n't let me go ? ' he said . Why should n't he ? ' Well , I owe him something , I guess . He 's kept me for six years . ' And had your services , ' Peter Dow said . I ca n't answerthat one , Andy . That 's between you and Richie . I 'd say the account was more than even , but I do n't know . ' The wandering shimmer of wind had come down almost to the mown edge , and was moving erratically as if unwilling to spill over and be lost . Andy 's eyes followed it while he thought . He opened his mouth to speak , and then abruptly the wall of grass parted , thirty feet from where he lay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it was pointed : the sharp nose , sharp ears , sharp eyes in which a pointed light like candleflame glittered . No other part of the fox was visible except that questing alert face , abrupt as a question mark , shocking as an idea that comes suddenly and by stealth . Andy moved slowly , laying a hand on Mr. Dow 's foot . Look ! ' he whispered . But when Mr. Dow turned his head the wall of grass was empty . The tips waved gently , as if brushed by wind , for only a moment . The movement of the retreating fox blended with the wind shadows and was gone . What was it ? ' Fox . ' Andy took his hand off Mr. Dow 's foot and stood up . The sharp face was still a presence in his mind ; he still felt cold from the suddenness and stealth of its appearance . It was perfectly clear to him what he should make of this visitation , and when he turned his head andp65saw Mr. Dow watching him he felt guilty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just poked his head out and disappeared again , ' he said , knowing as he said it that Mr. Dow was not fooled . Something had come into their conversation , an intrusion had been made , a warning given . I 'd have to talk it over with Mr. Richie , ' he said desperately . He 's . . . I do n't know . He might not think it was the thing to do . I could let you know . ' His eyes searched Mr. Dow 's long seamed face and he felt like crawling under something . I thank you for thinking of it , ' he said . It was nice of you . I could let you know . ' No hurry , ' Mr. Dow said . We 're not going back until the middle of September . ' E-yeah , ' the boy said . Well , thanks , Mr. Dow . ' He looked uncertainly down the meadow . I guess I might 's well go home this side , it 's shorter . ' He nodded and strode off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run to jolt the kinks out of himself , when he heard Peter Dow yelling . Do n't take that propositiontoo solemnly , eh ? Some of it might even be fun ! ' Andy walked steadily , neither hurrying nor lagging . There was a bar of fatigue across the small of his back , and his mind was sore with the things that fretted it . Goingdownhill , he dropped steadily into twilight ; only the hilltops over toward Sunday were still sunlit . When he hit the road that ran up around the hill to George Pembrook 's farm , he moved into deeper twilight under the maples . He was late for chores , and Mr. Richie would be mad , but still he did not hurry . Walking , he watched the sun lift off the hilltops , and by the time he came to the junction with the swamp road the color was all gone , the green hills and the farms had gone slatecoloredand cold , the valleys between the ridges were beginning to fill with gray mist.  |p66It  was such a cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shirt . His mother had always hated that time of evening when the light went and the gray came up out of the ground and the warmth left the earth . He remembered her saying that the world went as gray sometimes in the dusk as if it had been brushed by the wing of the angel of death . So by the side door his thoughts finally came out in the open . The shame that had come out of hiding when the fox thrust its questing muzzle out of the timothy was acknowledgednow . And when his mother 's mood came across to him from other gray twilight days years ago she was close to him in fact as well as in thought . On the left , through the hedgerow of spruce and chokecherry and cedar bordering the road , he saw the white rails of the cemetery fence and the steep slope of cemetery hill . Without any conscious intention , he stopped at the gate . The cemetery climbed steeply , a broken ladder of granite and marble handholds , almost to the top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of black spruce , and over the tips of the spruce , embedded in the metallic sky , a steely chip of moon looked straight down between the gravestones into Andy 's face . With his foot on the lowest rail he stood watching , and the curious feeling grew in him that the dead were watchingtoo , that from the steep burial ground they observed him like spectators from an amphitheater . Men who had fought in the Revolution lay there , and women who had died under the knives of the Iroquois . Men who had helped blaze Hazen 's Road to Canada and farmers who had heated musket barrels at Lundy 's Lane were side by side with Grand Army men and hired hands who had died last year in an accident with a potato digger . Father , grandfather , great-grandfather , great-great-grandfather , they lay there freed from time , and looked down fromp67their spruce-and-moon-tipped hill on what had always been there : A village no bigger , no wealthier , no different in appearancefrom what it had been in the years after the Revolution when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names were Bradford and Wills and Page and Calvert and Hunt and Mount and Goodale and Kent , the same names the earliest gravestonescarried . A village , still half-colonial , clustered around its square ; and around it , on the hills , farms that were still half wilderness after a hundred and sixty years . Nothing changed in Westwick . The teachers read off the same names from the roll , the farms went on from father to son to grandson , the girls married local boys so that everybody was everybody else 's cousin . Nothing changed , unless it grew a little tireder and older and less patient with intruders and intrusive ideas ; unless all those calm eyes from the burial ground weighed more heavily on the village as the generations passed ; unless under the pressure of the static years little by little of what had been won from the wilderness was given up . Back in the hills , too far off the roads for profitable farming , too far off for farm women to keep their sanity , too far for the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned houses and barns the color of tarnished silver rotted slowly in the quiet , and every summerthe goldenglow sprang up tall and yellow around their untrodden doors , and little by little the spruce marched in from the woods and engulfed the meadows , took them back . Every year the banks gave up on some of those farms , tired of the struggle to find a tenant ; and every year the hedgehogs found new sheds to nest and gnaw in undisturbed . Every spring the hazel brush was closer to screening off the blind openings of what had once been roads.  |p68Everybody  in Westwick worked hard , worked himself to the bone , barring a few like his uncle , James Mount . And most found themselves poorer in the end than in the beginning , their whole lifetime of callousness and rheumatismgone in the effort simply to hold their father 's ground , or not quite hold it . The dead watched from their stony hillside , his mother among them , and his father whom he had never known . They waited unhurriedly to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unless everything he knew of their lives was a warning , unless the sharp face of Mr. Richie which poked into his thoughts as suddenly and alertly as the foxhead emerging from the grass was a warning . Mr. Richie , old Foxy Grandpa , was certainly warning enough . And how had he happened to get tied up with Mr. Richie ? How had his mother happened to die as she had died , in disgrace and alone ? It was all there , every shameful detail of it , waiting just behind a little door in his mind . He was looking at the Foxy Grandpa book that Mr. Richie had given him when he heard the lock click . Instantlyhe shoved the book under him and crowded back against the wall , his feet just sticking over the edge of the cot , his arms hugged tight around his body . In his terror his body felt small and insufficient , hardly enough to hang onto . They came in just the way they had come in every day since they brought him here , Mr. Richie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sharp little face poked forward , smiling , his eyebrows moving up and down , and the detective behind him tall and solemn , red-nosed , with his handkerchief in his hand . The detective had hay fever , and his eyes always looked red-rimmed like a hound 's . The boy watched them comep69in and shut the door ; he felt the rough plaster wall through his shirt , and the bulge of the overall straps up his spine . Mr. Richie sat down and thumped his knees . Well , Bub , ' he said cheerfully . The detective also sat down , blowing his nose . It was all the same as it had been before . In a minute they would start asking him , and proddinghim , and sticking their faces out at him , trying to make him say something that had n't happened . Treating you all right ? ' Mr. Richie said . His little foxfacewas grinning , and he twinkled under white eyebrows . The boy nodded . You like being in jail , uh ? ' the detective said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bub , ' Mr. Richie said , We ai n't tryin ' to be mean to you . You just tell us the truth about how that fire started and you 'll be out of here in a minute . ' I already told you ! ' the boy squeaked . You told us something , ' the detective said . How about telling us the truth ? ' Without taking his sharp blue twinkling eyes off the boy , Mr. Richie dug into his pocket , got a cigar , bit off the end and spit it out , found a match , lighted it under his chair , puffed , and said through the smoke , Still an accident , was it ? ' Andy nodded . You just went down with a candle to the barn and the swallows flapped around the light and scared you and you dropped the candle and run and that set the barn afire . ' The boy nodded , swallowing . You lived on a farm all your life , ' the detective said heavily , and you do n't know no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know swallows 'll fly at a light . You do n't know enough to make sure a light 's out before you go . ' The boy said nothing . Why 'd they send you down there with a candle ? ' the detective said harshly , and stuck his face forward . There was n't any oil for the lantern . ' " Tis n't as if Branch Willard was any kin of yours , ' Mr. Richie said mildly . He ai n't but your stepfather . You do n't have to protect him . He never treated you very good anyway , did he ? ' Andy did not answer . Did he ? ' the detective said . The boy jumped , but said nothing . Why had n't Branch put any hay into that barn yet ? ' the detective said . He had . ' " Bout five load , ' the detective said . You think we 're silly , boy ? Everybody 's got a barnful of hay in , and here 's Willard with a twenty-acre meadow he has n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andy said , and drew his knees up under his chin , crowding himself against the wall . He was selling the calves . ' And you know why , ' the detective said . He blew his nose , wrenching the end harshly . He wanted ' em out of that barn when he burned it down . He wanted his insurancebut he did n't want to lose his stock . ' The boy hiccoughed . A nerve in his cheek twitched , and he put his hand over his face . He looked at Mr. Richie for help , but Mr. Richie was rolling his cigar in his lips and looking out the window . He 's a slick one , ' the detective said . I never seen any slicker trick . Sending a kid down to the mow with a candle and then saying the swallows scared him . He sent you , did n't he ? ' The boy kept still . Fox in the Hayfield 71p71Did n't he ? ' Yes , but ... What for ? ' Some pitchforks . ' What 'd he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . ' Savin ' his pitchforks too , ' the detective said . He leaned back and reached for his handkerchief . Mr. Richie blew half a dozen rings and said , ' Tis n't as open and shut as all that , Rufe . How in thunder would he know the swallows 'd fly down and scare the boy ? How 'd he know the boy 'd drop his candle and run ? ' There 's a fifty-fifty chance of a fire any time you send a kid into a mow with a candle , ' the detective said . Andy was grateful to Mr. Richie . Mr. Richie lived in the village , and even if he did sell insurance and even if he had been helping the detective all along , he was somebodyfamiliar at least . And he was n't as rough as the detective , and he smiled all the time . Just the same , ' Mr. Richie said , standing up and pointingthe cigar at him , we know Branch Willard burned down that barn a-purpose . You might as well tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . Honest , Mr. Richie ... ' We might 's well go , ' Mr. Richie said , and put the cigar back in his mouth . The detective rose grumbling . Three days , ' he said . ' Three days in this damn place where every meadow looks as if it 'd been planted to goldenrod . You 'll never get anything out of this kid . ' Never did expect to , ' said Mr. Richie cheerfully . Then what are we keeping him for ? ' Got a right to hold him , ' Mr. Richie said . Long as he says it was him set the barn afire we got a right to hold him . ' What good will that do ? '  | Mr. Richie held the door open and twinkled , past the detective at the boy . Trouble with you , ' he said , you ai n't got the imagination to bait a hook . ' The door snapped shut behind them , and Mr. Richie 's voice went down the hail . If you was Martha Mount , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an insurance fire ; and they come and put your boy in jail for it , what would you ... ? ' The voice dwindled and went away , and Andy relaxed a little against the wall . He pulled the Foxy Grandpa book from under him and looked at it stupidly . What if Branch had wanted to burn the barn down ? But he could n't have . Everything had happened just as Andy had told them . Big with terror as that night was , he went over it , trying to remember something new . He went out with the candle after Branch shook the oil can and found it empty , and went creeping through the blackness that blanketed sky and ground . Holding his hand around the candle flame to shield it from the wind that wandered down the hill toward the swamp , he went in the cow stable and through the milk room and up the ladder to the high drive . Then just as he stuck the candle on a beam the things came , beating at the light , at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he screamed and ran through the black mow , banging into the double doors , ripping a fingernailgetting the bars up . Then he ran across the back lot toward the kitchen window , and slammed into a leaningwireless fencepost in the dark , knocking his wind out , and the next he remembered was Mumma picking him up off the back stoop and carrying him inside . He was still crying , not yet over his scare , when Branch came running in the back door and said the barn was afire . His candle must have dropped off the beam into the hay . So it had been an accident , plain as that . I-low was hep73to know the terrible fluttering things were only swallows ? The memory of the awful black loom of the mow , and of the unseen squeaking things that swooped down , contractedhis whole body like a chill . He flapped the pages of the Foxy Grandpa book . He wondered if the detective would put him in jail for a long time . He thought that probably Mr. Richie would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let a boy be put in jail for an accident . Mr. Richie was always makingjokes . Andy remembered the way the men in the store had laughed one day when Mr. Richie was telling about a joke he played on a city man . The city man had bought a cow and had brought it to Mr. Richie to make sure he had n't got stung . Mr. Richie had looked the cow over , opened her mouth and looked in , and said , My gosh , man , this cow ai n't got any teeth in her upper jaw . She 'll starve to death in a week . ' The city man was so ashamed to have been beaten in a deal that he sold the cow to Mr. Richie for forty dollars , to make beef out of , and when he found out how Mr. Richie had fooled him he sold his cottage and moved away and never came back . Mr. Richie would n't let him get put in jail for very long . Maybe Mumma would come and get him out . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't Mr. Richie go up to the farm and see Mumma if that was what he wanted ? He swallowed as he remembered how the two men had come up to the farm three days ago and asked a few questions and taken him away , and how Mumma had hung onto him and cried . He shut his eyes tight to squeeze the two big tears that oozed into his eyes . Lying down on the cot , he craned under to look at the rusty springs , put his hand tentatively around the iron leg . Then he sat up and listened . Someone was coming again . The door opened , and it was Mumma . Andy ! ' she said.  |p74Oh  , poor Andy boy ! ' She grabbed him in her arms and hugged him , and he smelled the store smell of her shirtwaist . Have they scared you ? ' she said . Have they been mean to you ? ' They keep trying to make me say Branch burned down the barn on purpose . ' Her arms tightened . She kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at him . There were tear streaks in the flour she had used to powder her face . Did they feed you ? ' she said . Did you have enough to eat ? You look thin . ' Oh , yuh , ' he said vaguely . He looked at the faces of Mr. Richie and the detective in the doorway . Mr. Richie winked at him . Do you mind staying here a little while longer ? ' Mummasaid . I want to talk to Mr. Richie . ' Ca n't I go ? ' I 'd rather you stayed here , ' she said . Mumma ! Do n't you tell them anything just to get me out ! They tried to make me say it was n't an accident , but it was . ' Do n't you worry , ' Mumma said . Her eyes blinked and she turned away . I 'll be back in a little while , Andy . ' She turned back , took him by the shoulders and shook him gently . You wo n't mind , just for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time coming back , and when they came he saw that his mother had been crying again . The boy stood up , and his mother came across the room very fast and hugged him tightly . Her voice sounded choked . You 'll hate your Mumma , ' she said . That 's what I ca n't stand , you 'll hate your Mumma . ' He clung to her , trying to look into her face , but she kept her head turned . Mr. Richie had lighted another cigar  |p75They  're going to put your Mumma in jail , ' she said . Andy 's eyes went from his mother 's twisted , averted face to Mr. Richie 's . You do n't have to pretend any more , Bub , ' Mr. Richie said . Your Mumma 's told us all about it . ' But it was the things ! ' Andy said . The swallows , they came down and knocked the candle over ... ' And it went out , ' the detective said . Branch went out afterwards and stuck a match @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the time and then plannin ' to lay it on you for bein ' careless . ' Andy 's hands clenched in his mother 's coat . Mumma , he did n't , did he ? ' She nodded . But why are they going to put you in jail ? ' he wailed . You never did it , it was Branch . ' I helped him , ' she said . You 'll never forgive me , Andy , but I was even going to help him lay it onto you , because I thought if it was an accident and we did n't blame you for it you would n't feel bad . If there 'd been any other way we could see . . . We were awful hard up , Andy . ' The boy wet his lips . Why do n't they put Branch in jail ? ' He 's left . I do n't know where . They 'll put him in too if they can catch him . ' He stood very still , letting the detective 's long face and hound-eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's pale flour-streaked face twisted with crying , go around him in a confused blur . It was all a part , a continuation of the terror he had felt when he went out into the pitch blackness with his candle . It had sent him blind and screaming across the high drive under the black loft when the things came down , it had left him throatdryand frozen when he looked out and saw the flames licking from both doors of the barn and knew that he had done it . It had been with him for three days in the jail while the detective 's face and Mr. Richie 's face thrust out at him , sharp-lipped , saying sharp words . I 'm ashamed , Andy , ' his mother said . I 'm so ashamed I could die . ' He swallowed , only half hearing her , and a thought came beating down like the terrifying wings from the dark mow . What 'll I do ? ' he said . Where 'll I go , Mumma ? ' Mr. Richie smiled and winked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . You 're comin ' to live with me . I ai n't so mean I can see a boy thrown out in the world like that . You 'll go to school in the village . Think you can make yourself useful enough to earn your keep ? ' He smiled widely and winked again , his fox-face full of good humor and friendliness . Andy tugged at his mother 's coat , still watching Mr. Richie . Mumma ? ' Mr. Richie 's very kind to offer it , ' she said . He 'll take care of you till I come back , and you 'll be a good boy , wo n't you ? ' Andy looked at Mr. Richie 's lips . Mr. Richie 's hand came up and took the cigar out of them , and the lips smiled . The boy stared at him , hardly seeing him at all , seeing only the smiling lips . He smelled the store smell of his mother 's clothes . Yes , ' he said . He laid his face against the store smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes shut tight he screamed into the muffling cloth , But I 'll hate him ! I 'll hate him as long as I live ! ' And there she lay among the quiet dead , her bequest to her son not even a dying farm with a sagging barn and meadows grown to paintbrush and redtop , but only ap77shame that all the village knew , a heritage as heavy and inescapable as a mortgage . When your mother dies in prison you start your life not merely empty-handed but with your hands tied . Suppose he stayed and did his best to live down that shame , what then ? Eventually , maybe , he could get togetherthe down payment on a farm , and from there he could fight back to where his father had been fifteen years ago  --  chiseling at the face of a hard country and picking at the durable surface of a debt , marrying a secondcousin and leaving his children the shelter of his roof and the burden of his obligations , and eventually joining the others of his name under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , staring up the broken tiers of stone to the ridge and the moon-tipped spruce , caught a movement along the black horizon , and a deer went up over the ridge , clearly outlined , delicate-footed and jerky , and dropped out of sight on the other side . It would be so wonderful if he could do that , climb up out of this and escape , just go over the ridge and never have to look back . . . . He looked around quickly , afraid that someone might be watching him . It was almost wholly dark in the road . The sky was laced with branches . Between the trunks of the roadside trees he could look down toward Calvert 's and see the valley filling with slatey mist . At a dogtrot he started down the last quarter-mile to the village.  |p78IN  HER mm , deep in the defensive skull , Helen Barlow had a hiding place . When she was in it , it was like being in the lagoon of an atoll behind protective reefs , or in a hidden valley among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying open sesames before the entrance . Any passage of sibilant , lullingpoetry would do , but the one she liked most , the one that brought tears to her eyes with its sweetness , was from Tennyson 's Lotus Eaters . ' There is sweet music here , ' she would say in her mind , and the spell would begin . There is sweet music here that softer falls Than petals from blown roses on the grass , Or night-dews on still waters between walls Of shadowy granite , in a gleaming pass ; Music that gentlier on the spirit lies , Than tired eyelids upon tired eyes .. . Like a sleep that she could summon at will , like a drugged dream , the private world would open and let her in . Sometimes she went to bed early for the sake of lying warm in bed and inducing her day-dreams . But sometimes she slipped into the hiding-place without consciousintention , when she was bored or tired or waiting , and then there was always the danger of awaking to find that she had been watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated the thought of being spied on in the bathroom . This time she awoke with her heart fluttering and found her mother already standing , the congregation alreadymoving up the aisle . Quickly Helen stood up and sidled into the stream of people , holding back there to let her mother go ahead . In the jam at the door , where Mr. Tait was shaking hands with people , she got shoved against her mother 's broad back , and with something like loathing she felt the rubbery roll of flesh across the fat woman 's shoulder blades above the constriction of the corset . She shook hands with Mr. Tait and got his warm paternalsmile and stepped down to the lawn . A voice said , Have a nice sleep ? ' and she turned to see Flo Barnes . In the ten days since Helen had seen her , the secretary had got startlingly tanned . Among the golden-tan of the cottagersand the sun-hating whiteness of the village women she looked like a barbaric foreigner . In her dark face her eyes were like blue ice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello . You scared me . ' She laughed an abrupt little cautious laugh . What do you mean , sleep ? ' I was watching you . You were a million miles away . ' I did n't mean to be . I do n't even think I was . ' You were , all right , ' Flo said . You were lucky . ' With a smile in the corners of her mouth she looked around at the crowd , and Helen , seeing for a moment with the outsider 's eyes , noticed the black straw bonnets with violets or daisies on them , looking , she thought , straight out of the 1910 Sears Roebuck catalogue . She saw the stiff heavy suits of the men , the differences of ease and grace , even in this ultimate Christian citadel of village life , between the city people and the villagers . Quite a little town , ' Flo said . Utterly unspoiled . I can see how Mattie felt . '  |p80Helen  let her eyes meet those of the secretary . More bitterness than she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the level brows above the ice-blue eyes went up . The red mouth twitched . But it 's your home town , ' Flo said . That makes a lot of difference . ' Helen swung around and started across the lawn . Flo followed . At the roadway she began to laugh . Did I say something funny ? ' Helen said . She was angryat being spied on , angry that this woman in two minutesshould know more about what she felt than anyone else in the village . There was something so irritatingly adept in the way that confession , if it was a confession , had been extracted . The wire loop had been lowered , the fish had swum in , and up it came with the wire around its gills . Miss Barnes was still laughing . She seemed greatly amused . A bird in a gilded cage , ' she said . Why do n't you get out of this jerk town if that 's the way you feel ? What 's holding you , the golden opportunities ? ' Oh , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive that continued up the crest of the hill to Helen 's house , and she stopped uncertainly , searching the other woman 's brown face . For no reason she could name , she felt all gone to pieces inside . This is where I live , ' she said lamely , and after a moment added , ' Would you come in a while ? ' You do n't want to go in . Why do n't you come and paddle around with me ? I came over in a kayak . ' Oh , I could n't . ' Why not ? ' Dinner 's in about an hour . ' Skip dinner . I 've got some candy bars in the boat . ' Oh no , I ... ' Go get your bathing suit and come along . '  |p81I  really could n't stay out but a little while ... ' That is n't important , ' Flo said . ' Run in and get your suit . Let 's go somewhere where we can talk . ' On the north side of the lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore , there was a stretch of almost a mile of steep shore without a single cottage . A New York millionaire had bought it as a wedding present for his daughter years before , and the daughter had never come back to claim it . From waterline to county road the hill was clothed in belts of heavy timber , maple and beech and hemlock stepping down to a strip of tall cedars along the shore . Many of the cedars had been undermined by waves and ice and had fallen outward , some of them clear in , some only far enough to lean precariously against the air . Those which had fallen outward , some of them clear in , some only far from floating free , made underwater gardens , and perch swam through their branches and around the stubs of old waterlogged cedars from many years ago that now lay on the rocky bottom , brown and wavery through ten feet of clear water . Above these submarine gardens the leaningcedars made another sort of garden in the air , and a boat or canoe drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was fairly easy , if you leaned over the side of a quiet boat and let your eyes go out of focus , to confuse the subaqueous gardens with the aerial gardens above , and the reflection of the hanging cedars and the wavering shapes of the sunken ones swam together into a single image . Helen and Flo Barnes , resting after the hard paddle against the open-lake wind around the point , came through the cedar gardens as quietly as the perch . The kayak , low in the water , rode its own reflection , and a face that leaned over to look into the water , or a handp82trailed over the side , met a face or hand coming up . For a long time Helen hung over the gunwale looking deep into her own eyes , and seeing beyond the reflection of her face the hallucinatory sunken snags and the drowned cedar fronds and the bright quick perch . Flo moved her paddle against the boat , and a frog hit the water from shore . Helen saw his green shape kick itself down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hind legs and long webbed feet trailed out behind . She could see the bump of his eyes move as if he were looking up at her . When she dropped her hand in the water the frog swam away in a spurt of sand , and she lost him among the shifting light-shadows on the bottom . How about a swim ? ' Flo said . Helen turned , her eyes still misty and her mind dazed with the remoteness that came over her sometimes . As her eyes and mind cleared , she saw Flo Barnes , strong and confident and armored against weakness or regret or indecision , and the realization of the woman 's tidal strength and confidence and resourcefulness brought her a pang of envy so black and ugly that she turned her face aside . All right , ' she said . Shall we go over to the Welds ' ? ' What 's the matter with here ? ' Where would we dress ? ' We might dress in the woods here , but the rocks are better . ' But they 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not , ' Flo said . Before anybody is up in the morning I swim out to the rocks and back . There 's a good place . ' But ... ' What are you scared of ? ' Flo said . Swinging the kayak on a stiff left paddle she shot it out of the cedars toward the turtleback granite rocks a hundred yards offshore.  |p83Helen  helped pull the kayak up out of the water , and stood up in her bare feet . On the rock she felt as exposed as a mouse in a white empty room . With her toes grippingthe granite she looked at the secretary , who went on unbuttoning the front of her white dress while nodding down between the two biggest rocks . Right down there . You stand in the water and the rocks hide you from shore . Throw your clothes up here . ' Obediently Helen scrambled down until the cold water tightened around her ankles . The angle of the rock shielded her on three sides , but left her exposed to the open lake . There were three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , nervously . This needs a front door . ' Flo leaned over the rock . Her dress was unbuttoned to the waist ; below the taut brassiere her stomach was as brown as her face . Lord 's sake , ' she said , those boats are a half mile away ! ' Helen stood hesitating . She would almost as soon have undressed before an open window in the village square . The sense of unbearably bright light on her made her fingersclumsy , but she stepped out of her pants and into her bathing suit , pulled the suit up around her waist , and then quickly pulled the dress over her head . With a last wriggle she unhooked the brassiere and pulled the straps of the suit over her shoulders and was safe . Flo Barnes slid down over the rock in her underwear , and unhurried , with no attempt to hide either from Helen or the open eye of the lake , she stripped and tossed her underwear up with her dress . She filled her lungs with air , stood on tiptoe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . All unconcerned she exposed herself , front , back , and sides , and Helen 's fascinated eyes saw that she was not tanned as a bather gets tanned , from the breast up and the thighs down . She was evenly brown all over.  | Standing like a ship 's figurehead , strong and shapely and the color of stained wood , Flo slanted an oblique look at Helen . You 'll remember me next time ! ' Helen flushed painfully . I 'm sorry . I did n't . . . You 're so brown . ' She slid up until her back was against the sloping rock , and Flo took one white ankle in her big brown hand , squeezed it , moved down over the slim arch . Pretty little feet , ' she said . You 're like a white mouse . ' Get your suit on and let 's swim . ' Suit ? Are you nervous ? ' Flo dove in and switched in the water and came up facing Helen , flinging her short mop of water-dark hair sideways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was foreshortened , and looked wide and blocky . Come on , mouse , ' she said . Careful to keep her hair dry , Helen slipped in and swam twice around the rocks . Flo played around her , swimming breast stroke , crawl , dog paddle , putting her face in the water and blowing like a playful horse in a trough , chugging around Helen with a burst of speed , beaver diving , rolling over and over . Later they stretched out in the water with their hands on the shelf where they had dressed and their feet kicking gently . The tightness in Helen 's chest had gone , and her blood was racing . She felt alive and happy and not nervous any more about Flo 's nakedness and the possible eyes on shore or in the boats . She looked at the secretary , . and Flo rolled in the water slowly , an inexpressibly voluptuous movement like some blonde Juno yielding herself to wantonness , and stretched her arm against Helen 's , brown against white . We make a nice contrast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How did you get so brown in a few days ? ' I lie out on the roof after lunch . The old lady and allp85the family retainers are believers in the afternoon nap . Come over sometime . I 'll get you brown . ' Helen met the ice-blue eyes , almost too blue to be looked into , for only a moment . She felt tingly and excited , and kicked her feet in the water so that her palms pushed against the granite . I freckle , ' she said . I burn and blister and then I freckle . ' Flo 's hand moved and touched Helen 's shoulder . You 've got a nice skin . You come over , I 'll guarantee to get you brown . ' I guess I 'm not the type , ' Helen said , and laughed a little . The secretary snorted into the water and rolled over on her back with the back of her head on the ledge and the water lapping at her ears . Her nipples , contractedin the water , were puckery red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little white mouse , ' she said into the air , absently . Scared of people , scared of excitement , scared of herself , scared of anything new . Why do n't you get out of this place and learn not to be scared of things ? ' Yes ? ' Helen said . How ? ' Just go . You know you hate this stuffy little burg You 're just scared to cut loose . ' Who 'd look after my family ? ' Ca n't your family look after themselves ? ' My father 's paralyzed . ' Oh , ' Flo said . What , stroke ? ' I guess . ' You guess ? Do n't you know ? ' He 'd never let us call a doctor , ' Helen said . He just came home one day saying he felt terrible , and next morning he could n't move his legs . He 's never been up since . ' How long have you been Winnie the Breadwinner ? ' Oh , I 'm no breadwinner , ' Helen said . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I was in my last year of college . I had to come home . I never would have finished , only they let me do the last semester by correspondence , I was so close . That was four years ago . ' Talking about it agitated her so that she had to crawl out on the sun-warmed rock . The sleek mermaid shape of Flo Barnes slid out after her , and Helen looked in alarm at the distant boats , then over toward shore where walkersmight be passing , or boys fishing . Flo watched her with amused eyes . What would you do ? ' she said abruptly . If you could do exactly what you wanted to , what would you do ? ' I would n't even dare think about it . ' Come on , you think about it all the time . What ? ' I honestly do n't know . It 's so impossible . ' Forget how impossible it is . You 've got some notion . ' Well , ' Helen said , and looked almost coquettishly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nose , the strong throat , the sprawling naked body . Without real embarrassment or any other cause she felt herself going dull red . I do n't know , ' she said . I 'd get away . ' Where to ? ' I do n't know . New York . Boston , maybe . ' And do what ? Get a job ? ' I suppose I 'd have to . But all I can do is teach , or do some kind of clerical work . Neither one appeals to me , though . ' She shook her shoulders . I do n't know , honestly . It 's all so silly . ' The secretary 's hand came out and took hold of Helen 's instep , shook her foot slowly . She was smiling a strange warm smile . So what is it ? ' Letting her knee wobble as Flo wagged her foot , Helen put her face down on the other knee and smiled and shook her head . I bet if I told you you 'd think I was the craziestperson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' I think you 're all right , see ? ' I am crazy , though , ' Helen said . ' I know it , but I ca n't help it . ' She took a deep breath , glancing sideways into the secretary 's face . ' I want to write poetry , ' she said . She ducked her head as she said it , hugging her knees . A flaw of wind crossed the rock and goosepimples popped out on her arms and legs . ' I guess that 's crazy enough to hold you ! ' she said , and with her hot cheek pressed against her knees she looked up again sideways at the woman who was so thoroughly everything Helen Barlow was not  --  who was poetry in herself , and did n't have to hunt in secret places for words to put her longings into . ' Sure , ' Flo said , her mouth smiling faintly , her eyes on Helen 's face . ' Of course , I should have seen it . You naturallywould , it 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white and dainty . It would n't be natural if you did n't write poetry . ' ' I have for a long time , ' Helen said gratefully . ' Publish any ? ' Helen held up three fingers . ' Where ? Could I see them ? ' The conversation was getting painful and exciting and difficult , so that Helen bent her face away and studied the crystals like miniscule snowflakes in the granite at her feet . ' They were just in the Woodsville Gazette , ' she said . ' I just got a notion once and sent them in and they printed them all . They were n't in any magazine . ' ' Why do n't you send in some more ? ' ' I 'd rather  --  you know , the Gazette is n't such a good place to publish poetry . If I could get some in magazines , you know , where you could feel they were really published ... ' When can I see some of your poems ? ' Flo said . ' Oh , would you like to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd really like to . I 've got a notebook full of things . '  |p88That  's a promise , ' Flo said . They were silent for a while in the baking heat of the rock . Out on the lake a fisherman shouted something to another boat , and the other boat answered . Clouds like sheep grazed along the crest of the western hill . Of course I 'll never write anything worth reading , ' Helen said . I 'm no good . I just do it because I want to , for fun . ' It sounds as if you had a lot of time to yourself , ' Flo said , and the blue eyes sharpened , the strong neck bent a little with her intent stare . Helen jerked her eyes away . Who would there be to spend time with ? ' she said bitterly . Last winter there was Mattie , at least . But now there wo n't be anybody . The other teachers are no good , they 're as bad as the rest of the village . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her eyes to Flo 's face . Would you believe it , ' she said , there 's only one person in the village , outside the teachers , who 's been to college , and he 's an old turkey farmer out on the Corners road . ' She bit her words off before her voice got away from her entirely . After a little silence she heard Flo 's soft warm voice . Poor kid ! ' it said , and the brown hand came out again to tighten around Helen 's ankle . As if that touch and those two words of sympathy were what she had been waiting for , Helen felt the words coming , welling up as water comes lifting in a pump , until they spilled over and poured in a stream . She felt the long-awaited luxury of tears coming up with the words , spilling over with them while she told Flo Barnes about the miserable shut-in winters , the narrow village piety eating on itself , needing victims to justify itself upon as acid needs metal before it can etch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent squeamish father and the mother whose life went always in the ways other peoplep89directed , not in any way she thought up for herself . How every move in the house was conditioned by what folks would say , what the village would think . There was no freedom , she cried ; you could n't live in the village unless you lived by the village pattern , and their eyes were on you all the time ... . While she poured this accumulated grievance into Flo 's listening sympathy , she felt the sun-warmed skin of the secretary , and the arm that went around her shoulders . Some time later , when she came out of her babble of confession and complaint and tears and self-pity , she moved with obscure shame out of the hugging ann . Flo let her go . You 've had it tough , ' she said . I 'm glad you got it off your chest . It 's holding in things like that that makes you scared of everything . You get all wound up in yourself and you 're afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know why I told you all that , ' Helen said , and laughed and wiped a knuckle below her eyes . She looked at the brown face of Flo Barnes with gratitude and affectionand shyness . Flo sat up straighter , yawned , scratched herself contentedlyon the thigh . You know something ? ' she said . You need treatment , honestly you do . You need to be tossed right out into the world and made to swim . You 've been hiding too long in a mouse-hole . ' Tapping her teeth with her nails , she pretended to study Helen as a doctor might before prescribing something . The skin around her eyes crinkled . I 'll bet you , ' she said , that you do n't dare take off that suit and swim around the rock in the altogether , and then climb up here on the rock and let the wind blow on you a minute . I 'll bet you do n't dare . ' Her hand reached out impulsively to the shoulder strap , but Helen resisted . Her face was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let go , shrugged , stepped down unto the flooded shelf . Suit yourself . It 's the only way you 'll ever get out of this shrinking-mouse stage , though . ' She dove in and swam aimlessly around , watching the rock . Helen sat with her hand still on the shoulder strap . It was hard for her to breathe . The sunny air bore down on her with an inexorable weight , and it struck her with a peculiar impact of shame that it was Sunday . Out on the lake the three fishing boats had moved perceptibly closer to the tip of the island . She started to open her mouth to tell Flo Barnes that she was n't afraid to , it was just that she . . . Just that she what ? That she was afraid . She closed her mouth , watching Flo kick her brown legs froglike out where the rocks shelved off into deep green water . Flo 's face was closed and expressionless . She filled her mouth with water and spouted it out . Every move she made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , spoke of health and freedom and bright physical enjoyment . Helen looked at her own white legs , at her white upper arms just beginning to grow unattractively pink with sunburn . The mouse had crept out of its hole for just a moment , but now when it heard a noise , saw sunshine and creatures playing , it shook with fright and started to creep back in . In one wiggling , desperate motion she stripped the flowered rayon down and over her hips . In the ankle-deep water she forced herself to stand up straight and naked , fully exposed to the lake and the distant boats and the uncompromising sun and the eyes of Flo Barnes . With her arms stiff at her sides she stood there for what seemed minutes , and her voice was as stiff as her arms . Is this the way ? ' From the water Flo was laughing . Now you 're shouting ! ' she said . Now you 're shouting , mouse . Oh , beautiful , beautiful ! '  |p91Helen  dove , careless of her hair , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The secretary grabbed her , they sank bubbling , and as they sank Flo planted a wet kiss on Helen 's lips . Their bodies touched , cool in the water . Then they were on the surface again , laughing , and as if they had rehearsed it , as if they had planned a deliberaterecklessness , they were off swimming , Flo pulling ahead and rolling over , waiting while Helen caught up , then sprinting again . They swam straight for the steep shore and the cedar gardens , and when they reached the first drowned tree they hung to the branches that grew up out of the water . Half in the sun , half in the cold grip of the water , they hung there with their heads close together , laughing and getting their breath.  |p92THE  FIRST SENSE of the enormity of what she had done , the first dismayed realization of how thoroughly she had given herself up into the hands of strangers , struck Ruth as the bus turned around the edge of the golf course and came down the easy slope toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ragged woodpile , and it was while those images slid past her eyes and Abe was already standing up fussily , ready to get off before the bus stopped , that her belly froze with absolute panic . That ragged piece of cloth on a two-by-four frame , that was now home . Her life would now be circumscribed by patched canvas walls and a front yard grown knee high to witch grass ; her world would be bounded by the unknownhills around this barely-known village . And beside her in the terrifying isolation of the new life would be the man now helping her down the aisle of the bus  --  a grizzled , middle-aged man , a gentle , impetuous , kind man , but a stranger . They were the only passengers getting off . Ruth 's knees almost buckled as her feet touched the ground , and Abe grabbed her elbow . Two village women in front of the post office stopped talking while they watched . Across the street Martin Bentham , carrying reels of barbed wire in the side door of his store , nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to haul Ruth across . But she held back , pulling loose from his hand . Please , Abe . Let 's go right on home . '  |p93I  just wanted to tell Martin Bentham .. Take me home , please ! ' If he insisted any more , or asked for any explanations , she would fly apart like a smashed alarm clock . She saw his face pucker with anxiety , and then he picked up the suitcase and they went up the street past the two women , who eyed them as they passed . Abe lifted his hat ceremoniously , said , Hello , hello ! ' and steered Ruth past them . When they were past the last billow of the inn 's lawn he hissed in alarm , What is it ? Are you sick ? I should have known it , that bus is bad on the curves . We should have come by train . ' No , ' she said . I 'm not sick . I 'll be all right . ' They stepped across the roadside ditch and she stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a lank head of hair , while Abe fumbled the tent flaps open . In the few seconds she stood there , her eyes and ears registeredand tested the village . Turning her back on the rank weedy hillside , she saw the boy who lived with Allan Richie spreading gravel on the driveway across the street , and she heard the stone-and-iron sound , the metallic dry swish , as he swung the loaded scoop sideways scattering gravel in a short , controlled arc . A tractor was coming across Pratt 's meadow with a load of hay lumbering behind it , and over on the Corners road the noise of the mill was a busy irrelevance . She heard these sounds , and yet over them and under them , packing them in as if in cotton batting , there was a soft country quiet that dismayedher . The thought of what it might be like if the busy little noises stopped was terrifying . It was not her world : it was another planet , inhabited by strangers whose language she neither understood nor spoke . When Abe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she ducked in past him as if escaping something . Inside the tent it was stifling . Layers of superheated air pressed up toward the even fiercer heat that beat down on the canvas roof . The light was the kind of reddish , internal light she remembered from the beach , when she had lain for a long time with the sun beating on her closed eyelids . Abe pushed a chair forward , and she sat down . She tried not to look at him , but he was hovering over her . This is not so good , ' he was saying . Eh , will you tell me what is the matter , please ? ' It 's hot , ' Ruth said . Immediately he was at the back of the tent , leaning over the bed and tugging at the canvas . It came up above the board wall , letting a flat current of delicious cool air through the tent . Abe propped up the canvas with a stick and went around raisingother openings at the sides . Then he tied back the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-whitenedgravel street . Maybe if you should lie down , ' he said . It is probablysome stomach thing , something that upsets you . ' I 'll be all right . Just let me be a while . ' Well , but I do n't like this ! ' he said . I want to fix you up , whatever is the matter . ' There 's nothing the matter ! ' she said , almost in tears . Just let me alone , will you ? Let me get myself together . ' She went over and lay face down on the bed , pressing her face into the auto robe . The robe was scratchy on her face , and warm as the coat of an animal , so that her face steamed slowly as her breath moistened the wool . But on the back of her neck she could feel the cooling draft from the raised tentwall , and after a few minutes she found that she was listening to hear what Abe was doing . She heard the scrape of metal coat hangers on the pipe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crackle of paper thrust into the stove , and the careful clunk ofp95the lid being replaced . She lifted her mouth off the wet wool and propped her face with her wrist . I 'm sorry , Abe , ' she said into the bed . I guess I just got scared all of a sudden . ' Sure , ' he said . Well , so long as you do n't stay scared . ' I 'll be all right . It was just so strange , it hit me all at once . ' Sure , sure . ' His voice comforted her , though he did not come near . You lie there a while , you 'll feel better . ' The small comforting sounds of his activities went on , and she lay with her face on her wrist , letting the breeze cool her blood gradually . A calf blatted somewhere , and a car came down the road in front . After it passed she could hear again the swish of gravel from the scoop shovel across the street , and at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The country quiet was still there , but she began to be ashamed of the way it had frightened her . She supposed that being brought up among millions of people , in a place where noise never really stopped any time during the twenty-four hours , she would naturally be disturbed by quiet . In a little village like this there were so few people around that every move was noticeable ; there was so little sound that every word would be heard . Hearing the stealthy ssssssssp ssssssssp of the broom , she sat up . Abe , sweeping the tent floor , looked toward her guiltily . Oh , Abe , ' she said , you do n't have to do that ! ' Well , ' he said , his eyes uncomfortably on her face , I thought , you are n't feeling good , and if somebody should come around ... Who 's likely to come around ? ' He shrugged . Anybody . Everybody . People bring work to be done , and now people will know we are married , and they may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these village housekeepers found dust on your floor , tent or no tent . ' Well , you put that broom down , ' Ruth said . She stood up and took it from him , and standing close to him , seeinghis troubled eyes and his incorrigible hair , she leaned and kissed him . I 'm all right now . I was just like a lost child for a minute . ' I hope you 're not sorry about what we have done , ' Abe said . That is the only thing . ' She kissed him again till his gloom lightened and he smiled . How could I be sorry ? ' she said . I 'm as glad as I can be . ' This tent business , it 's not good , ' Abe said . I should bring a wife home to a tent . But listen . I 'll talk to Curtin tonight , and we will have that house in the shake of a cow 's tail . ' For some reason the tears that might have come at any time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms , moving sideways so that no one from the street could look in and see , and his voice grumbled in her hair . He took the broom out of her fingers and threw it aside . Now that 's enough , ' he said softly . What is this business of crying ? You are a bride , and brides should not cry any more than they should sweep floors . ' Oh , Abe , ' she said , I do n't know why I 'm acting this way ! Why do n't you just give me a dressing down ? Really tell me off , I need it . ' Listen , ' he said . Anybody that could stand up and marry me is not anybody to be scared . What are you scared of ? There is nobody here to hurt you . When you get used to these people you will find out they are people like anybody else , and they will like you and you will like them . Did n't I tell you I like this place ? And in three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' She laughed against his shoulder . Is n't it funny ? Isn'tp97it a howl , Abe ? Here I sell wedding gowns for six years , and have my model all picked out , with buttons all the way down the back and long sleeves with buttons to the wrist  --  all white satin , you 'd have liked me in that . I could get it wholesale , too . So I get married in a gabardinesuit and take a one-day wedding trip to Crawford Notch and come home to keep house in a tent ! ' Abe did not say anything for some time . When she pulled back to look at him he drew down the corners of his mouth and said , That wedding trip , you understand about that . It is a question of a wedding trip or a house , and I thought maybe a house ... It had to be a house . ' And I 'm going to love it , ' she said . Where 's that broom ? ' In the midst of sweeping she looked across the tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really come , just to wish us well , sort of ? ' Why not ? But if you 'd rather not , I could let the flaps down . That would mean we were not at home . ' Oh , no , ' she said quickly . I think it might be nice . I do n't much care who , it would just be sort of pleasant to have somebody drop in . ' That was at two-thirty . At three-fifteen Mrs. Martin Bentham , tall and thin and with a nose that looked as if it had been sharpened in a pencil sharpener , came up the hill with two pairs of trousers to be cleaned . She was suitably surprised when Abe told her the news  --  well , not really surprised , because she had expected something of the kind . She thought it was real nice they were married , and she sat for ten or fifteen minutes . When she had gone Ruth commented that she seemed very nice and friendly . Sure , why not ? ' Abe said . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to that religious crowd , but good honest high-grade people . ' He twinkled his big eye/brows at her . But I should tell you , ' he said . They do n't usually bring their cleaning to me . Why do you suppose they should start now , eh ? ' Ten minutes after Mrs. Bentham had left , a summer camper came in for a fitting . Where 've you been ? ' he asked . I 've been around twice in the last couple of days . ' Abe cleared his throat solidly . Hah ! Where have I been ? I have been off getting married . That surprises you , eh ? Come in , come in , I want you to meet my wife ! ' He presented Ruth with a flourish , and in a few minutesthey got to be a very friendly threesome . All during the fitting the man talked over his shoulder to her , telling her jokingly that she should look out for Abe , how a few years ago he had been the biggest tom-tatter in the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his old Ford . The worst was the men 's supper over in Sudbury Common . Those men 's suppers used to be something , ' the man said , and winked at Ruth . Abe had ParleyPugh with him coming back , and just at the head of the lake they hit a mailbox and turned over in the ditch . Parley got tossed out in the long grass , and he 'd had so many at the supper he forgot all about Abe . He just took off and walked into town and went to bed . It was n't till he woke next morning that he thought about Abe at all , and then he hopped in his truck and came tearing out with a posse . When they rolled the car over , there was old Abe , madder than sin . He 'd been lying there on the ground , not hurt at all but pinned down so he could n't wiggle , all night . He was about the frozenest , maddest , hung-overest man you ever did see . ' Yes , yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood back to see how the lapels set , but had forgotten what he was looking for . His grin was wide and delighted , and with a big needle stuck in his shirtfront and a piece of marking soap in his hand he circled the summer man and laughedp99and said , Yes , yes , I admit all that , but that was a long time ago . Now I have got rid of that Ford and got a wife I am a different man . ' When he left , the city man shook hands with Ruth again and wished her happiness . She thought he was charming . He was a professor from Princeton , Abe told her . The afternoon became a levee . Abe sat at the entrance of the tent , sewing on a half-made coat , but when people came by in the road , by car or truck or bicycle or wagon , he rushed out like a highwayman and flagged them down . I want you to meet my wife , ' he would say . You did n't think I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was too old to catch a wife , or too homely in the face ? Well , there she is . I met her two weeks ago and now I am married to her , now I am stuck . ' His laughter was a contagion , his jokes outrageous , his generosity would n't let him rest ten seconds without trying to force on a visitor a drink of water , a bottle of coke , a chocolate  --  here , there are plenty !  --  a more comfortablechair . He collared a Yale dean and a professor of Greek from Pennsylvania . He ran down two little girls in playsuits and shooed them in long enough for Ruth to hug them and give them each a chocolate . He overtook old Daniel Pratt , a bent , hairy man whose thumbless right hand hung down his middle like the furry paw of an animal . He is a rich peasant , ' Abe said when the old man had gone on . I have seen plenty like him in Russia . They are rich and cautious and suspicious , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About five all three Dows came by , and for a few minutesthe tent was full of the bass voices of the men and the vivid smile of Mary Dow . Following them there was an insurance man from Wolf eboro and a French farmer who prophesied fifteen children . There was a sweet old manp100with great knobby arthritic hands , a cabinet-maker . There was the boy , Andy Mount , who lived with Mr. Richie , a grave , quiet boy with a lock of brown hair falling across his forehead and a serious , almost disturbing way of looking at people . There was Helen Barlow , who worked in the post office now but was going to teach the primary room of the consolidated school in the fall . She lived just up on top of the hill , next to the church . She and Ruth got talking books , but just when Ruth was feeling that she had found someone she would like to see a lot of , Helen had to run down to help sort the mail . She promised to stop in sometime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faintly as Abe led Ruth across the road to Harold Swett 's , and from across the fence introduced her to three highschoolboys who looked at her in quick , sidelong glances and kidded Abe and smiled out of the corners of their mouths slyly . Good Lord ! ' Ruth said , stretched out at last on the bed . She fanned herself and blew out her breath . Now I know how the President feels when they line up on the White House lawn . ' Well , ' Abe said . Is it strange any more ? Have people come in to say congratulations ? ' A lot of them came with a rope around their necks . Did you have to shanghai people ? ' I do n't understand this word shanghai , ' he said . But I guess people came around . ' He sat down and leaned over her . How about it ? Are you still scared ? ' She shook her head back and forth . Just imagine , ' she said after a silence . In New York we could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look twice , they 'd never even notice us . Everybody 's so wound up in his own business down there . ' So up here everybody is wound up in other people 's business , ' Abe said . This is better , eh ? '  |p101She  put up her arms and hugged him . This is much better . ' After supper they talked to James Curtin about buildingthe house . As they came back up the lake street toward the square several young men sitting on the steps of Bentham 's closed-up store watched them , and Ruth heard their soft laughter . The annoyance she felt was only for a moment . They were like all young men anywhere , like boys in Washington Square whistling at the girls . Following close upon her annoyance came a warm rush of acceptance . This was going to be her village . Already the little square under the hill , the angled porches of the inn and the white fronts of store and creamery and post office , were familiar and comfortable . She had seen before , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and smelled how the night-smells sharpened . Along the street there was the pulse of fireflies in the grass . They pulled chairs to the flaps and sat quietly , ' watchingthe street darken and the last child go trailing home . Lights went on in the Richie house , the Swett house , the Pratt house . The street light down by the post office spluttered on . A bat went past their faces , not so much seen as felt . Above them the gray , half-luminous canvas roof darkened slowly and disappeared . Abe 's hand holdingRuth 's was warm , but the air moving past the tent flaps and brushing their faces was cool , and smelled of grass . Ruth stirred . Maybe we ought to shut our door and light a light , like everybody else . ' What for ? All a light does is make silhouettes . ' What ? ' Sure . A tent is not like a house . You can see through it with a light on . '  | You mean you never had any lights ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not '  --  his hand went out in a flat gesture  --  now . ' Listen , ' he said , and hitched his chair closer . Maybe you will be mad about this , I do n't know . But I should tell you . Around here it is a custom when people get married that they should be given a chivaree , and when you live in a tent that chivaree might be bad . ' What is it ? What do they do ? ' Do ! ' Abe said . Do , is it ? Listen ! Out here on the swamp road is a farmer , Albert Hall . Last fall he got married . Now when he brings his wife home , and that night they go to bed , there is a big row and twenty peoplehammer on his door and yell and raise hell wanting free drinks . But Albert is a pinch-penny . He told them to quit bothering people , he would n't buy drinks for any gang of good-for-nothings . So they knock his door in and kidnap his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is running for the woods in his long underwear with ten people chasing him . ' He leaned back dramatically , and for an instant the picture of Abe loping through the square in his underwearpursued by a gang of young men was so ludicrous that a giggle burst from Ruth 's lips . Abe was relieved . Well , I 'm glad you think it is funny . ' I do n't think it 's funny one bit , ' she said . Have n't they got any respect for people 's privacy ? ' It is no good to argue with them . ' They would n't dare do anything like that to us , ' she said . Abe got up and walked through the tent . In the faint light from the street she saw him wince at some thought . They would dare anything , ' he said . This is like a lynch mob , you understand , but good-natured . There is only one way , and that is to treat them fine . After all , they arep103your friends , they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke with newlyweds . If I was a young man I 'd be out with them , probably . Once I was a young hell-raiser myself , a revolutionary running from the police and staying up all night . ' Crowding past her , he opened his wallet and peered into it , took out a bill and held it in his fingers , watching her steadily . There is another thing about this business , ' he said . In a tent anything can happen . Even if I put out ten dollars for beer there is somebody who might pull the tent down , just to make fun . I think it is smart we should go to bed in our clothes tonight . Then they ca n't take us unprepared . ' Well , I must say ! ' Ruth said , ready to laugh . Do I have to wrinkle up all my clothes just because a bunch of country jakes want to have fun ? ' ' I ' 11 press your dress again in the morning , ' Abe said humbly . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to think of you being kidnapped in your nightgown . ' She remembered the youths on Bentham 's steps in the twilight , the watchful heads and the soft laughter . All right , ' she said . You know what goes on in a place like this , I do n't . But it sure seems to me the whole town is in on this wedding . ' She was embarrassed about going to the privy , and made an excuse to stay outside a while as if enjoying the night air . She came in with her whole mind full of dull wonder that she should find herself using an outhouse like some country bumpkin . And sleeping in her clothes because the yokels might come around and raise an uproar . She almost laughed . The tent bloomed weakly with light , its end-pole and low board walls black against the lighted canvas , and she saw Abe 's shadow stoop on the slanting cloth . While she creamed her face he turned down the covers , pulled the oilcloth-covered stool close for a bed table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flashlight . Now it is a cinch , ' he said softly , as if in fear of being overheard . When they come , I will be already dressed . I get up , go to the door , make them a little speech , hand them the ten dollars and tell them to have a drink on us . Then they will probably make a little noise and go away . All they want is to raise a little hell and beat on tin pans and scare people , and then they will go and drink our health . ' What if they decide to do more than that ? ' Ruth said . She saw the cloth roof move in a draft , and the candle flickered . Anybody could push right through this tent . And she and Abe were n't really part of the village . Would that lead the crowd to be easier or harder to handle ? They wo n't do anything else , ' Abe said . Wait and see . ' Oh , I 'll be waiting ! ' she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They laughed together softly , and then Abe blew out the candle . Ruth kicked off her shoes and lay beside him in her clothes , and he pulled the auto robe up over them so its tickly fringe was against her throat . Lying there in the dark with their bribe ready on the stool , their ears pricking for foreign sounds in the village quiet , they both giggled , and they lay giggling and whispering for some time . Later Ruth realized that she had been asleep , she did n't know for how long . Abe was snoring gently . She rose on one elbow , wondering what had awakened her . She could see plainly in the tent , and realized that the moon must have risen . In the dimness she lay listening for several minutes , holding her breath , but except for the thin bark of a fox off beyond Pratt 's hayfield she heard nothing that she could identify . Finally she lay downp105again , and when she awoke the second time the sun was shining on the patched and tarred canvas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking straight upward , flexing his mouth , dry with sleep . The ten-dollar bill still lay under the flashlight on the stool . Abe left it there . It 's a country custom , ' he said , shrugging . Part of it is to catch you when you 're not ready . If they did n't come last night , they will come tonight . It is no fun unless you surprise people . ' That night they went to bed in their clothes again , and again the night passed without an alarm . In the morning Abe looked at Ruth a little furtively and spread out the bill to look at it . By golly , I never knew anybody so slow to get ten-dollars ' worth of drinks . But it is nice to get all that sleep . ' I 've got permanent marks of buttons all over me , ' Ruth said . I wish they 'd make up their minds . ' Looking at Abe , she wrinkled her brows in perplexity . Did n't he feel that this whole business was crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making love .. . If you can stand it another night , ' Abe said , as if he were reading her mind . His eyes were contrite and his voice humble . I know it is a funny way for a honeymoon . But if it should happen Albert Hall 's way , that would be worse . ' It 's all right , ' she said . It is n't your fault . ' That day Curtin 's truck unloaded three loads of lumber , shingles , nails , and building paper under the hill beside the messy woodpile . Under the hot sun the smell of new boards was an intoxication . James Curtin arrived with a cone of heavy hard string on a stick , and measured off distances and drove in stakes . I can hardly wait , ' Ruth said , hanging on Abe 's arm . Wo n't it be fun when we can walk in and see where different rooms are going to be ? ' Irp106You wo n't have to wait long , ' Abe said , and screwed up his eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those hoodlums will choose to come hell-raising . They will think they have got us fooled now . ' The bill and the flashlight were on the stool again that night as Abe blew out the candle and rolled over to kiss Ruth clumsily . She lay quietly , staring at the low roof and thinking , hardly hearing him . Well , let them come , ' he said , and relaxed back into the pillow . A man should not begrudge his friends a little fun . A man only knows two things , all his life he knows only those : how he is himself and how he fits with other people . Once you move into this village you are behind glass , everybody can see you , but that is all right . Anyway , this is how I feel about it . A man such as me , to get such a wife as you , is so lucky these hoodlums could come every night for a month and it would still be worth it , if it cost me ten dollars a night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind run . Outsidethe tent , across the road , was Pratt 's pasture , and through the pasture or up the street or down from the darkness of the hill the young men could be coming now to perform their initiation ceremony on the newly married . Behind the piles of lumber boys might be crouching , hanging onto their laughter , waiting for the signal . It was a Friday night . There was a dance at the Grange Hall , and her ears caught the occasional swift beat of country dance music . Her little illuminated clock , perched on the two-by-four ledge of the wall , told her that it was eleven . If they were coming they should be coming prettysoon , maybe at the intermission . She waited , listening to Abe 's soft snoring , thinking with an odd tenderness that it was appropriate he should snore , but snore quietly . I-ie should have the fault , but in an inoffensive form . The illuminated dial staring in the gloom said eleven-twenty.  |p107She  waited , and fell asleep , and awoke starting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street , and her heart jumped with fear , as if it were murderers she lay expectinginstead of village youths . Then the clatter ended with the grate of a key , and she knew that the noise had been Harold Swett stumbling up his porch stairs after a toot in Stafford . The moon could not yet have risen , for it was still very dark in the tent . The clock said one-fifteen . The leap of her heart at Harold Swett 's noise had awakenedher thoroughly . She lay thinking of the girls at Garbstein 's , and what they would say if they could see her now , and of her friend Lucille in the New York Public , with whom she used to go to concerts at the Lewisohn Stadium . She wondered whether or not the movers would really pack everything up carefully and not lose things , and she thought of Mrs. Bentham 's handshake and the sly mouths of the schoolboys across Harold Swett 's fence . The quiet slipped in from the pasture and the shadowed lumber piles like a threat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up now she could hear it rise . And all around her , mile after mile in every direction , were black woods , empty black fields , black farmhouses , loneliness and this deathlike quiet . It seemed to her that of all the lonely darkened places in all the miles of those quiet hills , the loneliest was this tent in the middle of the villagewhere she lay awake and listened to her husband 's gentle snoring , and only that soft loose rasp of breath kept her from screaming and burying her head in the covers . In the still dark she cried . The noise of sawing awakened her . The sun was gold on the canvas . Well , missus , ' Abe said from the front flap . Your house is getting built while you sleep . ' She looked at the stool . The ten-dollar bill was gone . Did they come ? ' she said . Did they come and I not even wake up ? '  | Abe grimaced . His eyes darted out the flap , shifted back . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want ten dollars we would use it ourselves . ' He tapped his pocket and turned away , ducking out through the triangular opening . The sawing went on steadily , and now someonebegan to drive spikes with a steady , even hammer , the sound of hammer on spike getting higher and higher in pitch until the final wet chunk as the hammer head found wood . Then a new one , starting lower and climbingto the finishing chunk . Ruth laid aside the auto robe and sat up . Her mind registered the wrinkled dress , and with a wry little face , standing up to twist the dress straight around her hips , she said to herself , Well , well ! All dressed up and no place to go ! ' With the noise of the hammers and saws building her house it had been made irrevocable.  |p109ALLAN  RICHIE 's little hayfield bordered the golf course ; and as he moved slowly along over the raked windrows driving by voice and hopping to make into a load the hay poured in on him by the loader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golf bags on their shoulders , or pushing little two-wheeled buggies full of clubs ; or standing spraddle-legged waggling a club back and forth . He had no contempt for the game , as many people in the village had . He was simply curious , unable to imagine what it would be like to walk three or four miles knocking a little ball ahead of you . He reached the end of a windrow and turned , lurching , dragging the hay-loader around into line for the backward tack . He forked the half-load even , tramped it down . Gee-up ! ' he said . The wagon rolled forward , the hay came in gobbets up the moving belt of the loader . Slowly as the horses moved , they brought up more hay than Andy could handle , and he had to stop every few rods while he dug himself out . Gee-up ! ' he said again , and as they drifted a little off line , Whoa-haw ! Whoa-haw , there , Mae ! ' A waterfall of hay smothered him , filling his mouth with dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad getting out . At the fence he drew up and smoothed out the load . He was brushing haystems from his bare shoulders preparatory to climbing down and unhitching the loader when someone across the fence said , Looks like a good lively job . ' The boy scooped his forelock out of his eyes . An elderlyman was sitting on one of the green benches while a younger companion set a ball on a little yellow peg . Beyondthem a man and a woman dragged a doormat back and forth across the black sand green . The old man 's face was pale and thin , and the hands that knocked a club up and down on the grass were ridged with cords , spotted with brown spots like big freckles . His eyes were blue and squinted . Andy knew him by sight . He was a man who had been financial advisor to a half-dozen South American governments . It is n't rightly a one-man job , ' Andy said . Can be done , though . ' Who drives the team ? ' Andy was bent under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load the hay too ? ' Drive ' em by hollering at ' em , ' Andy said . He stood up and shouted , Gee-up ! Gee-up , there ! ' The team pulled the loaded wagon free . Whoa ! ' Andy said . He climbed up over the back of the rack and waded forward . Ordinarily he would have unwound the lines and driven back to the barn that way , but with the summer man watching he leaned on his fork and shouted at the near horse . Back up , Mae . Back up , now ! Back ! ' The horse crowded her haunches into the single-tree and jockeyed backward . Haw-up ! ' Andy shouted . Haw , Mae ! Haw , Milly girl . Haw , now ! Gee-up , there ! ' Neatly , aware of his own skill , he shouted the team away from the fence and started them down the field . He did not look back to see the effect of his driving on the golfers , but he did take out of his pocket the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stooped under the hayloader . It was a golf ball , nicked on onep111side , but round and firm and heavy in his hand . HE hefted it , felt its surface dented with round craters , won  --  dered how long it had taken someone to figure out just what sort of ball was best for knocking around a lawn He had seen plenty of golf balls around the country cluk service window , but he had never before had one in hi hand . When he was halfway to the barn he looked back towardthe old man and his companion , but they had both hit their balls and were out of sight behind the knoll Andy flipped the ball into the air and caught it , then pul it back in his pocket , where it made a hard , unfamiliar lump against his thigh . By the time he had got the load mowed up it was almost time for chores . He unhitched , watered the team grained them , threw down a mangerful of sweet fresh hay . The two cows were not yet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saw them trailing single file up from the lake shore , and opened the doors for them . In the ) ) little interior pen the two Guernsey calves stuck square . browed heads over the top rail and rolled their eyes white ly and lapped their tongues out . He let one have his fin ger for a minute , and laughed when the calf nursed it pressing it hard against the corrugated roof of its mouth Boy , I bet you 'd suck an axe-helve , ' he said . From the milkroom where he washed up , Andy saw Mr Richie out in the new gravel of the drive , looking acros at Abe Kaplan 's half-painted little house against the hill He had not yet found his opportunity to bring up Mi Dow 's proposition to the old man . As a matter of fact he had been afraid to . He was afraid to now . Bu it was getting on toward the first of August . H could n't put it off forever , if he ever expected to g down this fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he were about to dive , he went out into the half court formed by house and stable with their connectingsheds . Mr. Richie was still there looking down into the square , his sharp chin thrust forward . It struck Andy that he had the kind of face that cried for a goatee , an Uncle Sam kind of face , the kind of face for a driver of hard bargains . The square , he saw , was full of people , mainly summer people waiting for the mail . Henry Ball 's car was parked among the others in front of the post office . The crowd filled the street in front of the post office and eddied clear across the street to the creamery and Bentham 's store . The old man shot him a sharp look as he came up , but his voice was mild . Mail 's late . ' E-yeah . ' Get that meadow all in ? ' All I had mowed . There 's about three loads to come in tomorrow . ' Herbert Pratt wants to rent the loader . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Wants it tomorrow morning , ' Allan said . You can pitch those last three on by hand , I guess . ' I guess , ' Andy said , and got his breath again . Mr. Richie ... ' The old man took his eyes off the crowd in the square . Eh ? ' How much wages have I got saved up ? ' Allan 's head moved slightly forward , his chin moved slightly out . Do n't know 's I 've counted ' em lately . Why ? ' I want to go to school this fall . ' Allan peered , suspicious of a joke , thrusting his narrow old white head further forward still . School ? You finishedschool . ' I finished high school . I want to go to college . '  |p113He  saw Allan 's expression change , the outthrust lip and jaw relax slightly . The blue eyes under the slash of white eyebrows twinkled . Been talkin ' to summer folks , ' Allan said . Well ... ' I 've got nothin ' against summer folks , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ em do well enough . But they 're gettin ' to stick their noses too much into how this village runs . Like that music thing . ' Now that he had made the opening move , Andy was willing to stall , though he had no intention of being sidetracked . What music thing ? ' That Sunday night music thing , over on Mrs. Weld 's dock . ' What about it ? ' The chin went forward again , and for a moment Andy almost saw the little quivering goatee . Have you heard ' em ? ' A few times . ' Like ' em ? That kind of music tickle your taste ? All that Wagner and Whatsisname ? ' All right , I guess , ' Andy said . It sounds good over the water that way . ' Not to some people , it do n't , ' Allan said . Whole village , practically . And Mrs. Weld . She ca n't get the kind of music she likes , not to save her , even if she does give the concerts off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up a committee that votes her down . Votes the whole village down too . ' They had the idea for the concerts in the first place , ' Andy said . Allan grunted . And packin ' into the Westwick Associationso they can vote down a movie picture house . Want to keep the town unspoiled . Vote down another service station . Same reason . Vote me down when I want to put up four little cottages down on my lake shore for overnightcampers . Summer people do n't want transients , outside the inn . Bring in the wrong kind of people . ' He made a disgusted sound with his mouth . Might 's well go down and get the mail , boy . ' Andy did not move . He kept his eyes steadily on Allan Richie 's sharp face . There was a trembling going on somewhere under his ribs , and he scooped the forelock out of his eyes . The whole summer-people lecture had been an attempt to smoke-screen him , but he was n't goingto be smoke-screened . I mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was confronting not the twinkling Allan Richie but the hard-bargaining Allan Richie . The old face was hard as flint . You do n't calculate that 'll leave me out anything , I suppose . ' I 've worked all the time and done the chores . And since I 've been hiring out you 've had half my wages . ' Enough to pay half your food and clothes . ' All right , ' Andy said steadily . Keep it all . ' Allan Richie turned away with a snort . Down in the square Alma Bentham came out of the post office lugging a bundle of papers , and a queue from the idling crowd followed her into the store . Allan swung around again . Damn it , boy , ' tis n't the money . But I would have expectedyou to act different . You know how I happened to take you in . You know how things was for you , and what happened to your Ma . You know about your whole family , for that matter . How much respect have folks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever since I can remember , and a new kid every year . I did n't have to take you in . I could have said you were just another noaccountmember of the Mount family . ' My mother was n't no-account ! ' Never said she was , ' Allan said . I was just talkie ' thep115way the village thinks . Folks 'd say you had a-plenty to live down , boy . ' Maybe that 's why I want to go to college . ' " Twould n't be livin ' it down to run away from it , ' Allan said . They remained eye to eye , locked in a conflict as silent and strenuous as if they had been straining every muscle wrestling . Inside the house the telephone rang three longs and a short , waited a moment , rang them again . Allan turned around and went inside . The holds had been disengaged so abruptly that Andy took a minute to get his legs under him again . It was not clear to him whether he had won or lost , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Allan finished on the telephone . For a while he stood around waiting , but when Allan did not appear he went down toward the square with the vague intention of getting the mail . Milkingcould wait . As a matter of fact , maybe it could wait indefinitely . The thought that perhaps the break had been made , that perhaps this was all there was to getting free , brought on the thought that perhaps Allan would expect him to find some other place to sleep right away . But that did not bother him long . Peter Dow might have a place , or Mr. Mills might want somebody to do his chores . It began to occur to him obliquely and tentativelythat except in experience he was a man . He was as big as a man , could do a man 's work and assume a man 's responsibilities . Until now he had thought of school and college as something he would have to do under Peter Dow 's wing . Now it was plain to him that if he had to he could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked carefully as he passed through the crowd , hoping to see Peter Dow there . There was no sign of him . Inside the narrow alley before the glass-doored post- office boxes people were packed thickly . Children ducked in and out , and a dog started in but was dissuaded by a flick of skirts . Andy squeezed in , nodded to people he knew , turned the combination on Allan 's box . As the door swung open he saw through into the inner office , saw Helen Barlow 's sunburned arms sorting letters into the pigeonholes and the stooping back of Gaylord Brown as he sacked mail for the star route to Sudbury . Helen saw him looking in , and gave him an intent , concentrated smile . Evidently she had been swimming ; her nose was as sunburned as her arms . He took out the letters that were in the box and slammed the little glass door . Behind him he heard the stamp window slide up , which meant that all the mail had been distributed . People began getting into cars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tennis rackets between their feet , sat on the edge of the sidewalk licking ice cream cones . The shadow of the creamery chimney lay almost across the square . With the mail in his hip pocket Andy went across to Bentham 's , nodding to Alma Bentham with a one-sided grin . He avoided looking at the summer girl she was talking with , and turned into the store without any real intention , unless it was that same half-wistful desire to see Peter Dow and be encouraged . Two city women in jeans were buying groceries at the south counter . In the back room Martin Bentham was cutting a piece of glass for Albert Hall , and against the soda fountain three long-legged , brown-legged , T-shirt-andshortsgirls leaned to inhale from tall soda glasses . They leaned their chests against the fountain and braced their weight on backward-extended legs . Their three symmetricalhips jutted like the hips of resting horses . Andy contemplated going out again , but he did n't like to give the impression of not knowing what he was after.  |p117Neither  did he like to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the three girls in shorts . But he was not unaware of them ; he crowded over to the end of the fountain , as far from them as he could get , and waited until Margery Young looked his way . I 'd like a tonic , ' he said . Now all three city girls were looking at him , their red mouths pursed on their straws . Andy flushed hotly , wishinghe had never come in . Tonic ' was a word that someonelike old Daniel Pratt would have used . He should have asked for a coke or a root beer . Probably the girls thought he was some kind of quaint hick . Coke , ' he said , and cleared his throat viciously . He pressed himself into the narrow space at the end of the fountain and drummed with his fingers on the marble slab and indifferently eyed the glass cupboard back of the fountain , filled with Climax and Prince Albert and Copenhagensnuff . Though he would not turn to look at the girls again , he felt that they were still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half of it at a gulp . In the reflecting glass of the tobacco case he saw the front door open and the familiar figure of his Uncle James come in . Hunching on the counter , Andy watched out of the corner of his eye . James went up to the grocery counter where Martin Bentham now was and laid a bill on the boards , keeping his fingers on it . His overalls were splattered with white paint , his hands were stained , there was paint in his hair . His toothless mouth was brown with tobacco . Looks like you 'd been paintin ' , ' Martin said . James spread his stained hands , craned to look at his overalls . His mouth opened in a wide cackle of laughter . Brought away more'n I left behind , ' he said . Gim me three-four loaves of bread and a peck of spuds . ' Workin ' steady these days ? ' Martin said.  | Steady 's I can stand , ' James said . Paint Abe Kaplan 's place all day and blow my saxophone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll be fallin ' asleep and drowndin ' in my paint bucket . ' Spotting Andy over at the fountain , he raised his hand and spread his mouth in greeting . His merry little eyes almost closed when he laughed . Hey there , Andrew , ' he said . Where 'd you find three such handsome girls ? They all yours , or could a feller borrow one ? ' Andy 's neck burned . He tried to smile at the girls , but one glance at their faces , rounding in surprise and openingtoward laughter , put him back in his coke glass . Need n't be bashful about it , ' James said . He turned to Martin and cackled . Boy stands there surrounded with ' em like a dang Turk . ' Lay off it , ' Andy muttered . He tipped his glass and got a mouthful of ice , and rather than appear to be driven away by his uncle 's kidding , he stayed leaning against the counter until James got his packages together and went out . But he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his disreputable uncle , he said to Margery , Have n't seen Mr. Dow , have you ? ' Which one ? ' Peter . ' Not today . ' Thanks . ' He crowded out between the glove counter and the jutting hips of the girls . At the door he met Mrs. Emma Budd , who sailed in the screen door he held open without giving him a sign of recognition , though she had known him all his life . Mrs. Emma had seldom greeted anyone since George Budd traded her in on a giddy hussy of thirty-five from Lancaster . The hussy had died of pneumoniathe first winter , but Mrs. Emma remained in the village , a scarred trunk in the burned-over forest of George 's matrimony . People said she stayed alive onlyp119to plague George . She had even got herself put on the same telephone line , and no one could talk on George 's line without hearing the quiet click of Emma 's interest . She was lean , sapless , sour as vinegar , bitter as alum , vindictivelypious and conscientiously unkind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter , she had everybody 's goat . She came in past Andy leaning forward from the waist , her knotted hands swinging . Directly before her were the three cocked hips , the three pairs of long smooth brown legs . One of the girls straightened up and tucked her thin sweater inside the waistband of her shorts , patting her stomach with a sigh . Andy watched her ; so did Emma Budd . The old lady started back toward the meat counter on a course that took her within a few feet of the row of bare legs . She walked mincingly , as if there were electricityin the flooring , and her brown hands twitched . Her mouth worked en a kind of gasping smile , malevolent and triumphant and full of cunning . As she passed the protruding hip of the last girl her hand darted out and one twiggy finger touched the startled bare skin . Run short of material ? ' Mrs. Budd said , and swept on to the meat counter without a backward glance . Andy 's eyes met the eyes of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth was open . Andy snorted and let the screen door slam . As he hit the steps , exploding with mirth , he heard the three girls let go in high whinnyinglaughter inside the store . He sat down on the steps , cleared of people now , and laughed to himself until he thought how he must look , and stopped . The girls came crowding out through the screen , looked quickly at him sitting there , and stormed off into the square , caving and staggering with laughter . They got on bicycles in front of the creamery and ped- aled out the Sudbury road , standing up on the pedals and pumping hard , screaming to each other . Andy watched them go , feeling a curious mixture of pleasure at the way they had been stabbed , and irritation at their hysterical self-conscious glee . He knew they would tell it a hundred times , and he knew how they would tell it . This old native ' woman , prim as a doily and with a tongue like a rat-tailed file , comes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're in shorts , all of us , and you know what she does ? This will slay you . She comes right up to me , mumbling over her false teeth , and just as she passes me she puts out her finger and touches my leg and says .. . The shrill laughter . The joy in the cottages and in the canoes and sailboats and on the porches and docks over the antics of the old native woman . The hilarity for weeks every time some fool kid reached out and pinched the bare leg of a girl and said , Run short of material , dearie ? ' Mrs. Emma came out with a package and went around the corner to her tenement above the feed store . Andy sat on , thinking that little as he liked her , he liked the summergirls less . They made so obvious that ugly sense of difference , they opened their mouths and eyes and stared when his Uncle James came in and acted silly , they stood around like tourists in darkest Africa , rubbering at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two boys came down the county road on bicycles , pedaling furiously with their noses to their turned-down handlebars and the muscles bunching in their calves . With a brief swift rattle they were through the square and gone . Mrs. Bentham , coming out on her way home , looked at Andy curiously , and he knew she wondered why he was n't at home doing the chores . The shadow of the creamery was grayp121over the whole square , and as he sat he heard the dinner bell sound up in the flame-windowed inn , and saw the figures rise from the porch chairs . He had to make up his mind . If the break had been made , then he ought to be looking for a place to stay . If it had n't , he ought to go back and resume that quiet wrestling with Mr. Richie . But he sat still with his head against the wall , watching the clouds blow over very fast , thin scuds of cloud , high up . Hunching up his feet so that he could hug his knees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pocket and got it out , remembering how the professor of finance from Harvard , the money expert who was always being called to fly to Quito or Santiago or La Paz , had watched him with respect as he hollered the team away from the fence and down the meadow . There was n't a man on the lake who could handle a team by voice , not even Peter Dow . Dozens of things he could do that a city man could n't . It would be nice to get some camper on the other end of a crosscut , or put one to honing a scythe . If you were a good hand , there were a hundred things you could take pride in . You knew animalsand tools and yourself . There might not be any money or future or fame in farming a place so stony it looked as if the devil had emptied his apron into it , but there was satisfaction . He thought of the farmers he knew , men like Donald Swain , most of them good men to work with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shinhoe , who could doctor a horse or repair a tractor or set a straight line of fence or swing an axe from milking time to milking time , and do it the year around with no vacationsand no two-month spells of rest with golf courses and sailboats . It might be a hard life , but it was a man 's life . And it might look funny to city girls , but it was not something to laugh at . Maybe his uncle was , but there were things that were not.  | He was bouncing the ball gently on the sidewalk , catchingit and bouncing it and thinking about his uncle , and about what advice his mother might have given him if she were alive , and about what Nancy would say if he went over tonight and told her what he was puzzling over , when Helen Barlow came quickly out of the store . She stopped at his sprawled feet , and he noticed that her neck was beginning to look a mite stringy . Not much  --  just enough to tell you she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' she said . Are you taking up golf now , Andrew ? ' Had n't quite made up my mind , ' Andy said . Think I should ? ' He had the peculiar feeling that she was blinded by her own smiling , and could n't see him . No reason why not , ' she said . Any reason to ? ' Exercise . ' E-yeah , ' Andy said . Since Mr. Richie got the hayloaderI do n't seem to get my muscles shaken out , somehow . ' He bounced the ball and it got away from him and rolled into the street . He did not stir after it , but halflayon the steps , thinking that Helen had gone to college , almost the only person from the village who had . She ought to be able to tell him what it was like , what it was worth . But she was still smiling that dazzled smile , a smile she hid behind . A kind of funny girl , perfectly nice but a little odd , never ran much with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father . And it was n't that she was n't pretty enough . He supposed she was as pretty a girl as there was in the village . I just found it up in the meadow , ' he said . She hesitated , as if not quite sure how to break off a conversation that had nothing in it for either of them . Have n't you got chores to do any more ? '  |p123I  was just considering them , ' Andy said . Think I should take some action ? ' Should n't be surprised . ' E-yeah , ' he said , and stood up . Maybe you 're right . ' She left behind her the impression of her bright , smiling , uncertain face . It was not a face you could see into . It was a mirror , not a window . Andy had a feeling as he watched her trim figure cross the square diagonally and go up the street toward the church that he knew exactly what was the matter with Helen Barlow . She was neither village folks nor summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own life but not into the other . He stooped and picked up the golf ball , bounced it once , compressed his lips and stared up the street . Words Allan Richie had spoken to him returned to his mind . Folks 'd say you had a-plenty to live down , boy , and you wo n't do it by runnin ' away . ' Well , how did you live things down ? How did you make up for a down-at-the . heel family and a disreputable hard-drinking old uncle like James ? What could you do in your life to atone for the bad luck and shame that had followed your mother through most of hers ? The voice of Peter Dow was a strong one , and its argumentsseductive . Given opportunities , he might be able to make something of himself , get to be a professor or a lawyer or a doctor . If you had any intelligence , you had an obligation to develop it to the limit , not let it rust like unused machinery in a leaky shed . But he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mounts getting too big for his breeches , thinkinghe can get to be a lawyer or a doctor . Village ai n't good enough for Martha Mount 's boy . Seems if something'swrong in the blood of that family . Never can settle down to anything . The golf ball bounced crooked against the steps and rolled into the street again . Andy swung his heavy shoe , intending to kick the thing clear across the square , but it dribbled weakly off the side of his foot and rolled to the corner of the building , where Norma Pratt 's cocker spaniel appeared from nowhere and pounced on it . Go ahead , ' Andy said , as the dog stood looking at him . Go ahead , you can have it . Eat the cover off the thing . ' He started walking fast up the street , straight up to Allan Richie 's barn . He heard the sound of milking from the cow stable , and came in through the milk-room door to see the lantern hanging on a peg and Allan Richie squatting at Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he entered , but the even hiss of milk streams in the froth did not stop . Andy got another pail and hooked a stool by the leg . Reckoned maybe you were n't comin ' back , ' Allan said mildly . Andy took the letters and the rolled paper out of his hip pocket and laid them on the ledge near the lantern . Went after the mail , ' he said , and put his flat hand against Sally 's hip to push her over . He reached the cloth from the rail between the stanchions and wiped off her bag and teats , and the cow turned her head as far as the stanchion would let her and watched him with wide , placid country eyes.  |p125THAT  EVENING there was a church supper at which Helen was , as usual , supposed to supervise the high-school girls who waited on tables . But when she came home from the post office and found the kitchen empty , the stove ticking away its warmth , the smell of fresh-baked blueberrypies dissipating itself through the open window , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if her muscles had forgotten how to obey her will , as if her mind were numbed and unable to function . In the dining room her father sat , as he sat every eveningof the year , looking through the Woodsville Gazette . He could have said hello when he heard the door open ; he could have called out , That you , Helen ? ' ; he could have made some gesture toward fatherliness . But he sat tucked away into his own peculiar isolation , and made no sign . How could he sit there so long  --  four years ? How could he hold everything he needed in himself , and never spill a drop or give a drop away ? How could he exist without belonging to something or someone besides himself ? She did not want to go to the church supper . The marriedwomen had their steamy , big-armed club in the kitchen ; the high-school girls had a secret society in the pantry between kitchen and dining hall . Helen Barlow fell neatly between the two . In the whole village there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who yet belonged more with the girls than with the women . Nop126one except poor Arlene Knight , with her cross eyes and her stuttering tongue . Helen Barlow and Arlene Knight . Her lips twisted in a grimace , and in the same way that one can feel with salt-mouthed certainty the coming on of nausea , she felt the beginning of a headache . It would be stupid to go over now , ten or fifteen minutes late , and stand in the dining room with a glazed smile , looking out for coffee shortages or directing the girls to bring a new platter of chicken for the corner table . No matter what her mother would think , she was n't going . Let Arlene run the waitresses . She loved to hustle people around and feel important . Helen went into the dining room . Did Ma give you your supper ? ' The bright eyes jerked up . Ai n't heard me hollerin ' for it , have you ? ' All right , ' she said . I just wondered . I 'm going up-stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he was shuffling the possible reasons why she was n't going to the supper . Then he ducked his head , and communication between them ceased . His face in profile looked like a pouty carving in weathered wood , done with such meticulousJapanese realism that even the grizzled whiskers were there , set in most cunningly and catching the light as if real . She pulled down the shades so that no one could look in upon his privacy , which was all he had , and went up the dark narrow stairs . Her room was almost dark . Its windows looked to the east and north , so that now only shadow came in past the neat tied-back curtains . The white walls were dusky , the cornerslost . She guided herself to the bed by the glint of brass and lay down on the crazy-quilt coverlet . Amongp127the multitudinous small pieces of the quilt 's pattern he fingers found a piece of satin , and she hitched her hod : until her face touched its flower-petal coolness . A mood was on her , a peculiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disemboweled . For a long time shy simply lay without thinking anything in particular , with out wanting or feeling or hating anything in particular Her mind was a patchwork as crazy as the quilt she la : on , a pastiche of Arlene 's crossed eyes , envelopes type written and envelopes in longhand , Andrew Mount 's serf ous face through the porthole of the box door , the loo of a fork in a big calloused hand , the church 's great gran iteware coffee pot with a dishtowel wrapped around thi handle , and the strain of a girl 's arm as she carried an ( poured , deep trails through the snow at sugaring time and the ache in the shoulder from the weight of the ful sap buckets , the fierce primitive light from the fire under the arch , and the weathered walls of the sugarhouse oz the old farm , years ago . On the old farm , before her father rented it and moves them into town , there had been a row of maples tha bloomed with flame in the fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see them holding her eyes closed , and see the swing she had had made of an old tire on a rope . It seemed to her that she had been very happy in that farmyard under that row o old maples , and she remembered waiting for the mail man in the mornings , when she sat barely stirring in the sagging tire and kept her toes against the ground an ( saw how the dew was on the blackberry vines by the fence , and felt the chill that would not go away until the sun climbed higher . She saw too , with precise clarity , the body of a woodchuck a fox had killed . She must hav , come down the lane almost in time to interrupt the fight for when she got to the maples the chuck lay on its bast (  | its paws held in a ridiculous hands-up gesture . Its throat was bloody , and its yellow teeth showed . Its position was so helpless , it looked so utterly overpowered , that she looked in its face for signs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found its throat . But the chuck 's face , with its rodent teeth protruding , had no expressionwhatever . It was just dead . The memory of the chuck was too near her , and too unpleasant . She concentrated on the star-shaped patches of sky through the maples when she leaned back in the swing and looked upward . Lying quietly on her back , her hands over her head like the surrendered woodchuck 's paws , she felt the words coming , and nursed them , listening to their flow . It was always the sound of a poem that came to her first . This one , she knew , wanted to be sad and gentle and nostalgic , like the sad rustling of leaves , so she let it come that way , shifting sounds around and trying them out in a whisper , until she had three lines . A fourth was necessary to complete the stanza , but nothing she tried seemed to suit . The fourth line had to say something definite , but she was n't sure what she wanted it to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first three lines almost aloud : The doves are mourning in the maples , love , The leaves are keening with a long lament , The willows weep beside the waters , love ... . The final line eluded her . She thought of getting up and getting the rhyming dictionary , but that would have meant putting on the light . She tried changing the third line , coming in by the side door : The winds are wailing in the willows , love ... . That was too violent , somehow . Her brain stuck , andp129she jerked it free again . A line occurred to her , and sh tried it : Weeping for that unkind note you sent . It did n't satisfy her . It was n't smooth enough and i forced the poem to be about a broken love affair , an she did n't want it to be about that . She tried another : Once I too grieved , but now my grief is spent . Her ear and her mind tentatively accepted it , went ove the whole stanza . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its lot , of unhappiness bearing its burdens , an it did n't bring in a troublesome lover and make the poer sticky . Her headache forgotten , she sat up with the intention of writing the stanza down . In her mind she was ahead . showing it to Flo Barnes . She was already debating be tween sending it , when it was done , to the Gazette , whit would probably print it , or to some place like the Atlantic Even as she swung her legs down from the bed she wa imagining that letter , that formal but glowing paragraph We are all greatly pleased by your poem , " Septembe Nocturne , " and wish to buy it for the Atlantic 's pages . I occurs to us that you may have other poems which yoi would be kind enough to let us see .... ' Then she noticed that the moon , almost full , was look ing straight in her east window . The little white cell wher she most intimately lived was transformed by it . The to of her desk under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the moon 's full image reflected in ii Moonlight deepened the rag rug , lit expensive gleam and glints on the walls , turned the foot of the brass bed stead into smooth gold . As if a sound would disenchant her , Helen crossed t the open window . Eastward the open , mown hilltop spread bare as a lawn to the hedge of spruce at the far edge . She returned to the north window . Down over the hill she could see the silver roofs of the Richie and Swett places , and the street came silvery out of shadow and flowed into the quiet square . The square was white and deserted , and the inn 's shadow lay half across it . Back at the east window again , she looked at her arm , reaching to hold the curtain aside , and then down at her breast . Moonlight lay on her skin and on the white cotton of her dress like fine pallid dust . She put her own stanza away and felt for the other , the remembered and romantic lines : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her silver cross soft amethyst , And on her hair a glory , like a saint . Tears came surprisingly to her eyes , and she was drawn again to the north window and the sunken , moon-drenched village . Moonlight on the transformed roofs and the enchantedsquare was too lovely and too sad . Moonlight was like poetry , like a magic that could lay glory on even Westwick Village , which she knew for a dowdy little prison colony . It could turn the front of Bentham 's store into the pediment of a temple , and it could take her from her casement on waves of soft light , out over the silver roofs and angled shadows and the white streets , carry her light as down out of the village and through the world that spread moonlight-blasted and still to every horizon . She sat there for a long time , stupefied with moonlight , riding the gable of the old house as Noah 's wife might have ridden the prow of the Ark , dreaming of the floweredslopes of Ararat . Then the sound finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was knocking on the door downstairs . Down the steep stair tunnel the dining room door wasp131half open . She heard the knocking again , and now hex father was pounding in furious answer on the broad arm of his chair . Coming ! ' she said , and hurried down . The knocking was coming from the front door , and hex father was upset , glaring around over his shoulder at the disturbance . To open that door at all , his chair would have had to be moved . Helen ran to the kitchen door and stepped out onto the porch . Who is it ? ' she said . Thai door does n't open . ' Why do n't you board it up , then ? ' Flo Barnes ' voice said , and the secretary stepped out of the porch shadow and came along the edge of moonlight . Helen 's imagination caught at the strangeness of this meeting , both of them in white dresses , drenched it moonlight , both just at this edge where the moonlit world met the shadow . The moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had jewels in her mouth She carried a book under her arm . I thought maybe I could talk you into going for walk , ' she said , and lifted a hand to sift the moonligh through her fingers . I wish I could , ' Helen said , but my mother 's over a the church supper , and I could n't leave my father alone . Could n't he stay alone for an hour ? ' Not so loud , ' Helen whispered . If I were just over a the church he 'd put up with it , but if he knew I was really going away somewhere he 'd be mad . He says what if hi had another shock ? ' Yes , ' Flo said . What if he did ? ' She seemed to 131 thinking , standing with her head dropped so that he whole face was in shadow , and the light cut obliquely across her short fair hair . The sounds of the chum supper were momentarily loud , and then a car started and drowned them out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If things were as they ought to be , if people had freedom to follow their impulses , they could seize the opportunity of a great burst of moonlight like this , and there would be no paralyzed old men , no grizzledDuties , sitting inside glaring at the unexpected knocking on the front door . I might be able to go later , ' she said timidly . Why do n't you come in and wait till Mom gets home ? ' I do n't want to come in , ' Flo said . My God , it rains enough around here so it 's a crime to waste even a minute of a night like this . ' Helen dropped her head . I 'm sorry . It 's just Pa . But it 's nice from my room , too . I was sitting there watching the moonlight when you knocked . ' You were ? Alone ? ' Of course , ' Helen said curiously . I started to write a poem , but when the moon came up I forgot all about it . ' I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're fine . ' Really ? Did you really like any of them ? If you did n't , I wish you 'd tell me , because I would n't want to go on wasting ... ' I thought they were fine , ' Flo said . Quite a lot of them were like you . ' Such a wave of delighted embarrassment went through Helen that she almost stammered and giggled . Silly and sentimental and full of romantic nonsense ? That 's what my professor at Durham used to say . ' He was crazy , ' Flo said shortly . Her shoulders moved in a vigorous , thrusting gesture , as if she were going through a door . Look , maybe I will come in , if we do n't have to sit around and make conversation with somebody else . I want to talk with just you alone . ' As they went up the steps Helen said , It 's funny , you coming to the front door . Nobody except summer people ever come to anybody 's front door around here . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a kitchen-door town . ' She seemed grumpy and abrupt , but not until she was standing at George Barlow 's chair did Helen realize the full incongruity of Flo 's presence here . Shooting a look at the secretary 's tanned face and even teeth and short mane of blonde hair , she saw her with George Barlow 's eyes as something strange and foreign and suspicious , a city importation . The old man was holding his paper down , looking fiercely over its top . Pa , ' Helen said , this is Flo Barnes , a friend of mine . She works for Mrs. Weld , down at her camp . ' How do you do ? ' Flo said . She put out her hand , and George Barlow 's crooked fingers touched it reluctantly for a moment . There was a brief , awkward tableau with Flo smiling down on Helen 's father , and her father looking pouty and disturbed , and Helen herself in the background unhappily conscious of how deep and wide was the abyss between them , how utterly incapable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resentful suspicion and how caustic her city-bred contempt . We 're going up to my room , ' she said hurriedly . You call if you want anything . ' His suspicious , intent frown followed them until the door closed . Almost breathlessly , already forgetting her discomfort at the introduction of these two , she led Flo into the moonlit room . Bringing this outsider friend into it made it seem more than ever a virginal cell , immaculate and waiting . She was jumpy for fear Flo would not notice the room , the desk , the curtains , the pure whiteness of the walls , and because she could not wait for Flo to comment , she said something herself , her voice going fluty and artificial . Well , how do you like where I live ? ' Flo was looking around with devouring intentness . She moved to the bed , touched the crazy quilt , went around the foot of the bed to the desk flanked by its two bookcases . She put her own book on the desk and leaned to look out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from below : people beginning to go home from the supper . ' It 's like you , ' Flo said , and her voice was so harsh that Helen bent sideways , trying to see her face . ' That 's what you said about the poems . ' ' That 's what I meant , ' Flo said . She swung around with her back to the window so that Helen could not see the expression of her mouth or eyes , but her voice was bitter . There 's a lot about you that 's too good for this jerk town , if you 'd ever get the sense to realize it , and quit wasting yourself on cheap people ! ' Helen put her hands behind her , holding to the cold brass foot of the bed . The attack was so sudden , the switch from friendliness to contempt so abrupt , that her heart seemed tangled in her chest , and she could force out only a whisper . ' I . . . what do you mean ? ' ' Oh , do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess I just do n't understand , ' Helen said . She felt pale and pinched-in , and in a moment she would cry . With her back hard against the footrail she watched the shadowy fury of Flo Barnes . ' I 'm for Sunday afternoons , is that it ? ' Flo said . ' Weekdaysyou can hang around with your Brooklyn Jewess and God knows who else . My God , is that the best you could do ? ' ' Ruth Kaplan ? ' Helen said stupidly . Her mind was running ahead and backward at the same time , trying to anticipate Flo 's attack and trying to remember when , how , where , she might have said or done anything to Ruth Kaplan that would warrant this . ' I 've seen her inp135the library a couple of times , and I had tea with her the other day up in her new house , but I ca n't . . . She like : books , she 's read a lot .... ' Oh , ' Flo said . She 's read a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Helen flared . Why should n't talk to her all I want to ? There are some people in this dirty place that think they 're better than she is , just be . cause she 's Jewish , but if they 'd just look they 'd find she ' : more intelligent and more cultured than anybody in till ; village , even if she does have a Brooklyn accent , and ca n't see ... ' Flo 's hand burned across Helen 's cheek , and Heler backed away , her jaw locked with a paralysis that stopper her tongue and even prevented her crying . Her eye : filled , but she could make no sound , and as she backer away Flo followed her , and when her back was against the wall Flo slapped her again twice , swift hot blows thai she could not defend herself against or understand . The secretary 's face in the bluish twilight was convulsed with such fury that Helen turned away and hid her face in he arms against the wall . There was nothing in her whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar , oddly comforting sound . Her body slipped against the smoothl wall , and she let it go , slumping to the floor with her face still buried in her arms , the blows of her friend still burn . ing in her skin . She may have lain there for five minutes or for half ar hour . When she came out of the dark place where every thing else was obscured by the reassuring sound of he own grief , she realized that Flo was lifting at her armpits She let herself be lifted and half carried to the bed , anc she felt the springs sag as the other woman sat down be side her , but she lay quietly sobbing , pretending neither to know nor care what Flo Barnes did . The secretary 's hand lay lightly on her shoulder . I patted her , then tightened convulsively , and when Flo spoke Helen realized with a mean little thrill of triumph that Flo was crying too . Her hands and her voice plucked and beat and fumbled at Helen . ' Oh , dearest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know why I did . I wanted to hurt you and make you cry , I was rotten jealous . I saw you talking with that woman and laughing with her and I could have killed you both . .. Helen , do n't cry any more . Forget everything I said and did . I 'll make it up to you . . . do n't hate me for loving you . . . for being jealous ... Her hands hauled at Helen 's limp shoulders , pulled her to a sitting position . The moon had climbed high enough so that only a half pyramid of powdery light fell at a steep angle onto the desk . The room was darker than it had been , its white walls duskily staring . Look at me ! ' Flo said . Darling , look at me ! Slap me if you want , do anything to me , I 'd love it . But do n't hate me . I could n't stand it if you turned against me . I 'd kill myself ... ' Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crazy quilt . Flo 's hands held her upper arms tightly , shaking them , and her talk babbled , intense and driven and full of queer , unwomanly endearments . Abruptly the secretary rose and went over to the desk . She came back with the book in her hand , laid it in Helen 's lap . Helen 's eyes were blurred with shadows and the long spell of crying , and she could n't see what it was . It felt heavy and cool in her hands . I got it for you in Concord last week , ' Flo whispered . I did n't mean to go crazy and lose my head . I wanted to come and see you , that was all , and I brought you a present . I wanted you to love me , to think of me as your best friend , I did n't want to drive you away . ' Helen said nothing . After a moment she rose and wentp137to the window , laid the book back on the desk . The escaping moon , like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall , looked down on the gilt lettering of the title : The Collected Poems of ElizabethBarrett Browning . Flo was behind her , leaning forward , eager , almost abject . Her hand came up to touch Helen 's hair , and Helen bent her head away . Is it something you 'll like ? ' Flo said . I do n't know anything about poetry , but the woman said ... I described you , she seemed to think this might be good . ' Still Helen said nothing . After a time Flo said , I know I 've been a fool . I have n't any right to ask anything of you . But I wish ... ' Wish what ? ' Helen said . They were the first words she had spoken since Flo slapped her . I wish you 'd let your hair down , ' Flo 's hurrying voice said . You 've got luscious hair . I 'd love to see it with the moon on it . ' Helen did not move or answer . She was looking across the meadow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn in and the light had taken on a quality almost like that of a pre-dawn twilight . It seemed as if at any moment the magic would flick off like stage floodlights , and trees and stubbly hayfields would spring back into reality again . She might have laughed at Flo 's foolish solemn request except for the ache in her chest , a core of something undissolvedby her weeping ; for a moment her skin crawled , and she felt the presence of the secretary behind her as she had sometimes felt the presence of a formless , fearful Dark when she walked home late and alone . But then the woman 's voice came again , soft and pleading , full of contrition and love . Please ? ' it said . To show you do n't hate me for what I did ? Please ? ' Helen 's hands came up and felt for the pins . The firm bound weight of her hair loosened , spread , fell softly around her shoulders , and she shook it out with a little laugh , turning in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As if he had seen her do it , her father began to shout and pound downstairs.  |p139AT  six O'CLOCK on an August morning the light is gray a pearly . The leaves along the road to the Corners ha distinct and very still . The maples and gray beeches a split-barked yellow birches are motionless in every le : and not a needle quivers on the spruce that cross ov the hill above the lake . There is no color in the sl only cool gray light ; the world is green and cool and it . If you listen you can hear the strokes of six o'clock from the old locomotive bell in the Catholic church at t Corners . At this hour smokes are going up from the farms m tered over the hills , and a white river of mist is crawling down the valley of the Ammosaukee . A few minutes aft six , the Toonerville whistles as it rounds into the big be at the Corners , and ten minutes later it whistles agai trundling on across the Ammosaukee bridge and dov the valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at eve farm , their udders shrunken and empty , touch the gra with moist muzzles and snuff softly , dropping their hea to eat with the forward swing that lets their tooth ( lower jaws cut the grass . They pay no attention to t tooting of the Toonerville 's short , comical whistle amored the hills . Even if they are grazing in meadows that lo ( down on the valley , and the mist lifts to show the lilt three-car train snorting across their vision like a cranl toy , they do not lift their heads.  | By the time the train is gone , the long , sloping back of Sunday is furry with golden light and the western slope is almost black in the shadow . Some of the clarity is gone from the air , as if a fine mist of gold has been stirred up . The leaves still hang motionless . Then a black Ford sedan climbs up out of the mist in the valley and comes fast along the county road . Cattle and deer grazing along Broken-Musket Brook lift their heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose it wears . It swoops around the bends of the smooth blacktop , climbs under the still maples and beeches and birches west of the mill , speeds past the place where the piped spring gives its constant round inch of water to the roadside , crosses the bridge between mill and millpond , and then turns sharp right into the village . This is Henry Ball , who drives the star route between the Corners and Sudbury Common . Every day , Sundays and holidays included , he comes like a messenger of morning . Until his car swings around the curve and comes up the street between the dock and the houses of John Mills and Parley Pugh , the village is barely yawning itself awake . A few smokes rising , a dog out early to course the street and inspect the inn 's garbage cans , the far putt of a fisherman 's motor on the lake , and that is all . But when Henry stops in front of the post office the village stirs . Someone is sure to appear wanting to catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Gaylord Brown , the postmaster , comes out . Down the oblique church driveway Helen Barlow conies hurrying with a sweater across her shoulders , on her way to help with the sorting . Up on the hill the church is in full sun . Now a beam slips past the shadowed barrier of the inn and touches the creamery 's white wall , and a little wind that will stir all the leaves comes up from somewhere and drifts down the awakening street.  |p141Abe  awoke when sun and breeze together touched the window curtains . For a while he lay getting his bearings , studying the raw-raftered pitch roof , the clean new wood with numbers and symbols left by the carpenters in black pencil or blue chalk . Through the cracks between the sheathing boards he saw the soft brown of shingles . He turned his head sideways ; Ruth was still sleeping . She braided her hair at night into pigtails , and somehow the frizzy pigtails had curled down under her chin like the tiestrings of a bonnet . She looked about twelve years old . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirring of the new curtains , and the desire to get up was as strong in him as hunger . On such a morning only a fool or a sick man lay in bed . Cautiously he slid his feet out , felt for his slippers , eased his weight off the bed . Ruth still slept . He felt good , like a conspirator . Carrying his clothes , he went down the half stairs through the tailor shop , which occupied the whole front half of the house , and into the dining room . It was only with an effort that he restrained himself from stumping his feet solidly into his shoes . For a moment he thought of getting breakfast , but then he reflected that with a wife he was not called upon to get breakfast , even when he got up early . Instead , he went to the front door and stood looking out . He saw the sun take the village like a sliding flood . At about the time the yellow warmth reached the square at the bottom of the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Sudbury . Raoul LaPere , the handyman at the inn , came down across the square to the creamery . The chimneys of all the white strungouthouses fumed in the still air . Abe twitched his nose . The smells of morning , smoke and coffee and the faint unnameable odors of breakfast , tantalized him . He went back inside and listened.  | There was no sign or sound from upstairs . To kill time , he turned on the goose and pressed three pairs of trousers that had been brought in the day before . The smell of steamed wool filled the room  --  a good smell , familiar , mixed with a thousand associations . In the smell of wool and steam there was Russia , Boston , his old tent , a continuitythat had lasted through twenty-five years . He was glad he had never changed jobs , and it pleased him to be curing this new house , only a week old , in the old smells , steam and scorch and beeswax and filler and cloth , good cloth . The short counter by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finger the bolts of cloth there , feeling the tight , hard , unwrinkleable virtue of good worsted , the shaggy friendliness of Shetland . He bent his head to sniff the peaty , sheepy smell of his one remaining bolt of Harristweed . So he went sniffing around his new house , familiarizing himself with it , his nose isolating paint smell and newlumbersmell and cedar-shingle smell . In the middle of the room , itself bigger than his entire working and living quarters had been in the tent , he let his satisfaction swell . In such a house as this he could work all winterwithout freezing his hands . He could sit by his fire and read without a sheepskin on . Absently , still sniffing for the present and the absent among the smells , he took the lid off his tobacco can and rolled a cigarette . Rolling his own was a concession he had made to the expensiveness of being a married man and a householder , and he was not good at it . He spilled crumbs of tobacco all over the congoleum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ended with a waddy and uneven thing that practically exploded when he lighted it . Warily he smoked the loose fuse of what was left , feeling good , feeling permanent and estab/lished . While he was smoking , Ruth 's feet hit the floor upstairs , there was a loud , unbridled yawn , and she appeared at the top of the little stair , on the bedroom shelf seven feet above his head . For heaven 's sakes , ' she said . Up and working . Have you had breakfast ? ' No , how should I have breakfast ? Am I a cook ? ' You managed all right till I came around . ' Ah , ' Abe said , but now I have a wife for those purposes . Now I am a mechanic again . My job is to make clothes . ' Ruth disappeared , talked unintelligibly all the time she was back on the sleeping shelf getting dressed , and came out still talking to slap down the stairs in her slippers . Could a man get a good morning kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway to the living room , eyeing him and fending off his hands . I wish you 'd find something to smoke besides that old shredded rope . And you ought to have better sense than to smoke before breakfast anyway . Smoking before breakfast gives you ulcers . ' If breakfast was on time I would n't have to smoke , ' he said . I could be stuffing my face . ' She escaped from him and whipped into the little kitchen . No fire ? ' she said . You yell for breakfast and you do n't even build me a fire ? ' Oh , hell ! ' Abe said , and smacked his brow . I am such a man as will stand in his doorway and look at the smoke in every chimney in town and never think that his own is not smoking . ' Ruth laughed , but Abe kept talking seriously as he broke lath-ends and shingles into the firebox and built up the fire with bigger wood . No fooling , this is something I will remember . From now on I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whose chimney is cold when everybody else 's smokes . '  | About nine o'clock every summer morning young Mrs. Herbert Pratt let her cocker out for a run , and the fat shining little dog went like an auburn caterpillar up and down the road and around the square . Not everyone in Westwick looked with favor upon the cocker . He was a city-folks kind of dog ; farmers and villagers kept beagles or hounds or farm shepherds . They watched this dog , owned by the town-bred wife of one of their own people , with some doubt and even with some asperity . At first , when Herbert had brought it home , Martin Bentham and two or three other men had open-mindedly looked it over , had checked its deep mouth and big feet and had agreed that it looked like a retriever in spite of its small size . Still , there was nothing in the way the dog acted that made anyone believe it was good for anything . It was flighty , noisy , probably neurotic . Some people it fell all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others it fled home , into the house , and under a bed , where it lay making brave defiant noises until Norma Pratt coaxed it out . Then one day at the dock , when Norma Pratt was n't around to protect her pet , Parley Pugh picked it up and threw it ten feet into the lake to see what kind of stuff it was made of . Abe and Allan Richie and two or three city men stood and watched . The cocker could swim , all right . It came up wet and plastered and set out for shore like a side-wheeler , its ears floating back like wings , its big feet chugging the water , its bulging eyes glaring at the safety of the dock . The dock was about ten inches above the water . Swimming strongly , the cocker came straight on . It made no attempt to climb or scramble up when it hit the planks . It simply hit them , nose on , at full speed . Its neck buckled , and it bounced , but its driving legs never faltered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beating like a fly againstp145a screen . If Parley had n't reached down and pulled it in by the scruff of the neck it would have stayed there slammingits nose against safety until it drowned . After that the village had no respect for the dog , and when it caterpillared furry-footed up and down the hill on its morning run , no farmer or villager whistled at it or scratched its ears . The complete and disgraceful ineptitudeof the spaniel was taken , moreover , as further evidence that city people lived in a strange and helpless world with different standards , and that even their pets , though perhaps all right in the city , were pretty comical when you brought them up country . Actually there were three people , outside of summer people and Norma Pratt , to whom the cocker could look for a kind word . One was Helen Barlow , who loved any little soft animal ; another was Ruth Kaplan , who had known a friend 's cocker in New York ; and the third was John Tait , who as the new pastor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone , even the dogs . The dog had run the length of the street through the ditch , had come bounding back up the other side with flapping ears , and had visited three telephone poles and a maple tree and the corner of Knight 's culvert . Now he came across the street again to where Abe was fixing a length of plank as a bridge across the roadside ditch in front of his house . He stopped by Abe and wagged his whole hind end , the stub of his tail imperceptible among the silky red hair . Abe said , in the best village tradition , Get along , you imitation dog , ' and the dog got . It boundedoff , and at the bottom of the church driveway it met Mr. Tait coming down . Mr. Tait put out his fingers and chirped with his lips . The dog slid to a halt and backed off . In a burst of feeblemindedexcitement it laid its chin to the ground andp146barked . Tait advanced , fingers outstretched . Finally he squatted down . The dog liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lynx , tried to crawl into his squatting lap , fell through , and reared up to paw with muddy feet at Mr. Tait 's shirt . Mr. Tait got up and walked on , brushingat his clothes , and the cocker sprang against the backs of his knees as if trying to hamstring him . By the time they got up to Abe the minister was making angry sweepingmotions with his arms , trying to shoo the spaniel away . You imitation dog ! ' Abe said . Get along , out with you ! ' He waved his shovel . Across the street and down three houses , Mrs. Pratt came to the door and called . The cocker streaked for home , leaving Abe and Mr. Tait facingeach other across the ditch . Mr. Tait was a rather big man , wide-shouldered and wide-mouthed . He looked a little like William Jennings Bryan , who during the years of Abe 's reading had slowly crystallized as the epitome of everything narrowly and pettishly denominational . Yet when the minister bent his head to see what damage the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mounded up above his collar , and his laugh was somehow a fat man 's laugh . From across the ditch Abe watched him without enthusiasm , but without malice . Mr. Tait took out a handkerchief and wet a corner with his tongue and worked on his shirt a minute . Then he laughed and came across Abe 's plank with his hand out . Abe shook it . It was a big hand , with a hard , friendly grip . You 're Kaplan , are n't you ? I 've been meaning to call , but you know how it is  --  new place , dozens of people to meet , especially when the summer folks are all here . I 'm John Tait . I 've just been called to this pastorate a few weeks ago . '  |p147Sure  , ' Abe said . I know . Pleased to meet you . ' The minister slouched , took off his hat , and ran his fingersthrough his curly hair . Well , it 's a wonderful place , ' he said . ' My wife and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a place with finer people in it . Every day we meet new ones , splendid people . ' There are some fine people here , yes , ' Abe said . Mr. Tait put his hat on the back of his head and his two hands in his hip pockets , leaving the thumbs out . He looked straight at Abe , meeting his eyes easily as he talked . You 're not native to these parts . ' You mean was I born here ? ' Yes . ' Abe laughed . How should I be born here ? No , I was born in Russia . ' The wide smile widened . Then we 're both still company , ' Mr. Tait said . I gather it takes a long time before a newcomer is accepted as part of a village like this . ' Say , ' Abe told him , that 's the truth , without kidding . Even when you are born here sometimes you 're not a native . You know that story about the man who bought a farm up by Huckleberry Pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his kids were born there . But everybodystill called them city folks . So he got mad and one day he asked a neighbor what it took to be a member of the community , like you might say . He did n't care about himself , but what was the matter with his kids ? You know what the neighbor said ? ' No . ' The minister was listening politely and intently . ' He said , " Cat kin have kittens in the oven , but that do n't make ' em biscuits . " ' Mr. Tait threw back his head and roared with laughter . Abe was tempted into a few short explosions himself by the unaffected heartiness of the preacher 's enjoyment.  | When Mr. Tait got his breath he said , You do n't consider yourself a native , then . ' Me ? I 've been here five years only . I 'm a stranger . ' You do n't mean it 's unfriendly , ' Tait said , looking at him straight . Oh , no , ' Abe said . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a summer person . City people . ' Mr. Tait was smiling , his eyes roaming around the front yard . These little New England country villages ! ' he said . No more conservative places on earth , and no better places once you are accepted . Let 's hope we can get them to let us in . ' Sure . ' Abe was wondering what the minister had come for , or if he was really making a call . Maybe he had just stopped casually , as he had appeared to . Now that you 've got your house built , ' Mr. Tait said , perhaps they 'll soften a little . When a man builds a home in a place it means that he intends to stay . ' I stayed all right when it was a tent , ' Abe said with a shrug . Winter and summer , I stayed all right . ' Ah , but now you 're really in the village , with a house . And a new wife , I hear . I do n't believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose , ' Abe said . He looked at the minister , and the minister wore an expectant air . Well , come in , ' Abe said . I 'll make you acquainted with her . She 's from New York . ' So I understood , ' said Mr. Tait , and came along behindAbe into the tailor shop . Ruth was sweeping the dining room . Ruth , ' Abe said . Come in here . This is Mr. Tait , the minister . He wants to meet somebody from New York . ' I was just telling your husband , ' Mr. Tait said , since we 're all company , we ought to stick together . ' Yes , ' Ruth said , uncomprehending . Well , how do youp149do ? It 's a pleasure to meet you . ' Her warm welcoming smile made Abe feel good just to see it . Mr. Tait just came a few weeks ago , about when you did . He 's going the rounds making calls on everybody . Is that it ? ' That 's about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know every sheep in your flock . ' Abe exploded in short laughter . Sheep ! Sheep , that 's good . ' Abe , ' Ruth said , get Mr. Tait a chair , why do n't you ? ' He jumped into the dining room and came back with two . That was one thing about having a wife , especially one from New York . She knew how things should be done , even such a thing as this call from the preacher . She knew how to make people feel comfortable , but she did n't fall all over them . She acted like somebody who knew her own value . Madame ! ' he said , and held the chair for her to sit down in . Mr. Tait sat down too then , and Abe kicked the padded stool out from his work bench and perched on it . Balancing there , he reached for the tobacco can and rolled a cigarette , scattering crumbs on the congoleum . Maybe Mr. Tait would like to roll himself one , ' Ruth said . The minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge of the paper and rolled and crushed the cigarette together . So you like this village , ' he said . Very much . Do n't you ? ' I like it , yes . But I am not in your business . ' Mr. Tait agreed . And in your business you have to deal with people I would not like to deal with . ' He lighted the cigarette , ducked from the explosive flame-up , and brought his lips back to puff cautiously at the smoldering stump.  | ' I have n't found anyone yet that I would n't be delighted to deal with , ' Mr. Tait said . ' You will meet them , ' Abe said , waving his arm . ' Beinga preacher , you can not choose your friends . ' Mr. Tait pondered this , and agreed that in a way it was true , but that being forced to work with all kinds of people made one eventually more tolerant of human frailty and more brotherly toward mankind at large . And after all , we were all God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would not want to have to do it . ' He laughed and made a strong gesture of repudiation and brushed the cigarette against his coat and knocked the stringy coal of burning tobacco off on the floor . It smolderedthere until he finally put his shoe on it . Ruth went and got broom and dustpan and swept up , rubbing with her fingers against the little brown mark on the congoleum . ' I could name you names , ' Abe said . ' I could give you chapter and verse , but you should find these things out for yourself , who is sheep and who is goats and who is a wolf in sheep 's clothing . ' Mr. Tait said with a smile that he hoped there were n't any as bad as all that , and Abe threw his hands outward , giving up the subject . He hunched on the stool and dropped one shoulder and squinted at Mr. Tait , and then pointed a finger . ' You are an intelligent man . You have had an education . I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this preaching business ? ' ' It seemed the field in which I could do most , ' Mr. Tait said . His eyebrows were up slightly , and he looked a little at bay . ' For who ? For yourself ? ' ' Abe , you 're getting excited , ' Ruth said . ' Of course not , ' said Mr. Tait . ' For others . '  |p151For  others , ' Abe said . So . Always you should think of others first and yourself last . ' That 's the best Christian tradition . Naturally humar nature is frail , and falls short . ' Abe was silent for a moment , brooding . Then he chopped out a laugh . It fails sometimes , so ? I tell you , fails all over this village . I know all these people . There are good enough people among them , but I do n't know any Christians who think of others first and themselves last . Well , one , John Mills maybe . But these others ! Who is the worst man in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he holds your mortgage ? Who will sting you in a trade and think he should be proud of himself for it ? You will see them in your congregation  --  big important people in your congregation . ' You should keep quiet while you 've still got some sense , ' Ruth said . Why should I shut up speaking the truth ? Mr. Tait here is maybe a Christian by his own definition , but exceptmaybe for John Mills there is n't such another Christianin the village . Not even the people who hire him and pay his salary are such Christians . They are the farthest away of all . ' Aber Ruth said , and stood up . But Mr. Tait held up a placating hand . No , no . Let him say it out . We 're none of us so tender we ca n't stand open discussion . This is the way to get things out in the open where we can do something . And I assure you , ' he said , smiling , I want to see them all ironed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you both members of the Christian fellowship of the village . ' Abe looked at him hard , laughed incredulously , batted at the air with one hand . Abe gets so excited , ' Ruth said . ' He does n't mean half of what he says . '  |p152What  ? ' Abe said . I beg your pardon . I mean every word I say . I say the Christianity of a lot of these people is bunkum . ' Naturally you 're more critical than I would be , ' said Mr. Tait . And yet in other ways I wonder if you are ? The spiritual state of the village is my personal charge and duty . I like to think of Christianity as simply the real true brotherhood of man , and I hope that through my efforts that brotherhood can be promoted a little bit . ' Nobody could ask anything fairer than that , ' Ruth said . Abe gets so excited  --  he loves to argue . ' I suppose , ' Mr. Tait was going on , that the Christian tradition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then with the more restricted tribal tradition of Jewishseparateness and exclusiveness . But after all , Christianbelief is rooted in a reformed Jewish faith , and there 's no real reason ... Abe bent his head to glare angrily from the stool . You speak to me as if I were a Jew ? ' Mr. Tait 's eyes , cheeks , and mouth all tightened slightly , and his neck stiffened , but he went on smiling . Well , are n't you ? You 're not a member of the only Christian church in the village . Your name is Kaplan . You do n't attend , so far as I know , the Catholic chapel in the Corners . So I assume that you 're Jewish . Why not ? I have no prejudice against Judaism . I have many Jewish friends , several rabbis , in fact . ' Listen ! ' Abe said . He was almost falling off the stool , leaning forward to point a dramatic finger at Mr. Tait 's chest . Rabbis or Christians , it is all the same to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am not talkingagainst Christianity only , that is as good a religion as any . I am talking about hypocrites . I am talking about ways of fooling yourself and putting your brains to sleep . I am talking about living one way and pretending another.  |p153The  brotherhood of man , that is fine , those are fine words , but who is a brother ? Could I get a room at that inn down on the square except by some accident the way my wife did ? You tell me . And all this nonsense of prayers and a God that watches the sparrows fall , and this notion of " I am right and you will go to hell , " that is what I am talking about . ' For a while Mr. Tait sat as if musing . Then he shook his head , and twitched the corners of his mouth as if loosening them . Ruth had taken Abe 's shoulder and rattled him into silence . The minister rose , still smiling slightly , still shaking his head . Well , ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like people to be honest , as you have been , even when they express sentiments in which I profoundly disbelieve , and by which I must say I am considerably shocked . Sometimelet 's get together again and try to get to some meetingof minds . ' Why not ? ' Abe said . I am always willing for an argument , and on this business of religion I will argue anybody . I grew up in a synagogue , I know all that stuff . My eyes are perfectly good to see this Christianity here , too . I 'll argue any time , but you will not make a believer of me . I believe in using my brains , not putting them to sleep . ' He hopped off the stool and opened the door for Mr. Tait affably , and on the steps they shook hands . As the minister went out across the plank and into the sunny street Abe was waving and shouting things . Come again any time , ' he was saying . I will have this religion businessout with anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have walked out on the grass and shouted last words and afterthoughts , if Ruth had n't pulled him inside and shut both the screen and the door.  | My Lord ! ' she said . You certainly do fine ! Why do n't you go walking up and down the street shouting " There is n't any God ! " ' You think I am scared to ? ' No . I know you 're not scared to . That 's just the trouble . We have to live in this place . ' So while we are living here we will let everybody know where we stand , ' Abe said . I am not one of these who will act worse than he talks . Maybe I will talk worse than I act , how do you know ? Did you ever know me to cheat my neighbors or tell lies ? We will let people know exactly where to find us . I do not believe in this hypocrisy business . '  |p155MRS  . SOPHUS WELD did not have her own way with many things in Westwick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the map and making it a bustling little summer colony had met the gelid smile , the polite rebuff . The university people who had been coming to Westwick for a generation or more did not want it on the map . They had something quiet , well-bred , pleasant , uncomplicatedby any intrusive spirits other than Mrs. Weld , and they were hanging onto it and fencing it in and keepingit just as long as the world would let them . Many of them were so far from wanting to be part of a bustling little summer colony that they left their names off their mail boxes , allowed weeds to grow in their roadways , and maintained think-houses ' off in the deep woods to which they could retreat at the sound of a motor . Only one suggestion of Mrs. Weld 's , her most grandiose , had ever borne fruit of any kind , and it had n't borne the kind that Mrs. Weld had expected it to . She had offered to bring up to Westwick a double quartet from the PhiladelphiaSymphony , of which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the village entirely free a music festival that would put the place on the map just as surely as Whatsitsname where the Berkshire Festival was held . But the Westwick Association did not want Mrs. Weld promoting and controlling any such cultural enterprise . It found loopholes and objections , thought that the village might get caught in obligations it could n't live up to ,  | frankly feared the distinguished people ' that Mrs. Weld prophesied would be lured in . Finally it voted a substituteproposal for lakeshore concerts from records , the record collection to be assembled by popular subscription . Mrs. Weld , all but frozen out , shouldered her way back in by suggesting that Weld Island offered the best stage from which to broadcast , and the handiest gathering-point for people from every part of the lake  --  a suggestion so obviously true that no one on the committee could gainsayit . Thereafter , every Sunday evening , Mrs. Weld was , in a way , where she wanted to be  --  at the center of the cultural life of Westwick . She was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts her old dock proved ample , but when listenersbegan to show a tendency to come ashore and listen from the land , she had her dock extended fifteen feet and built a little demountable bleacher at its landward end . As it turned out , few people chose to sit in it , because it offered no chance for a family group to feel private and secluded as it could feel in a boat or under the trees . It was almost certain , moreover , that at some time during the concert some uninitiated helper groping for the switch that controlled the record-changing light would accidentally hit the big switch and turn a halfdozenpowerful floodlights into the eyes of the bleacherites . Later Mrs. Weld set out two large floats , seventy-five feet offshore , to which anchorless boats and canoes could attach themselves during the music . Somehow few did , most of them preferring to drift around . Still later , Mrs. Weld erected a tall flagpole above her boathouse and flew the American flag all day Sunday . At sunset , at about the halfway point in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who would creak from his chair near thep157phonograph and tiptoe to the halyards and haul Old Glory down with a faint ceremonious squeak of pulleys . She felt her responsibilities , even anticipated them . To make things easier for landing parties she had in a bulldozerthat cleared fifty feet of shore and laid down a ramp for the beaching of canoes . Thereafter the infirm or aged could come ashore and listen at their ease , and at the ramp they would be met and flagged into a parking space by Mrs. Weld 's chauffeur or by one of the three or four myrmidons she hired especially for the evening . After the concert the same myrmidons would be there with flashlights , darting about and complicating traffic with contradictorysignals and making themselves very efficient and useful . Sometimes Mrs. Weld herself would come out and stand spraddle-legged baying her helpers on . She managed the concerts as if she were directing Yankee Stadium during a world series , but one thing she could n't manage . True to its original intention , the Associationnever gave her a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guile or plain stubbornness it persistentlymanaged to avoid playing the numbers that Mrs. Weld as persistently requested . Almost every Monday , before the meeting of the program committee , Mrs. Weld dictated a letter to Miss Barnes requesting specific pieces , and had her chauffeur deliver it personally . Principally what she wanted was a change in the theme song . She was sick of the Egmont Overture , and she had never liked it anyway , and besides it was n't appropriate . Her own choice was When You Come to the End of a Perfect Day , ' though she had also suggested Just a Song at Twilight ' and In the Gloaming , ' both of them just as appropriate to the time and occasion . She had also , many times , requestedthat these heavy classical numbers that all sounded like finger exercises be omitted , and some good tuneful pleasant music substituted , things like ' Humor- esque ' or MacDowell 's To a Wild Rose . ' Or why not play some lively things like the William Tell Overture ? Her letters piled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on playing Brahms and Bach and Haydn and Mozart and Beethoven and Mahler and Smetana and Stravinski and Sibelius . Having the upper hand , they left her nothing but the mechanical details , and when she had exhausted all the obvious improvements in these matters she began devising less obvious ones . About the middle of August , on a Thursday evening , she got the notion of making over a stretch of lake shore into a park where people could lounge and listen . Much better than the dock or the grandstand . She put Miss Barnes on it at once , and within an hour she came in to say that she had located four workmen who would be around in the morning . Andy Mount pulled his boat up on the ramp and came around the edge of the vegetable garden at seven o'clock . Nobody seemed to be up in the three cottages strung out under the cedars , and there was no sign of his Uncle James or of the Shurtleff boys from Sunday Mountain . He walked past the workshop and between two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trees ; the sun coming in flat under the trimmed-up branches glinted on the wet grass and on the wide patch of **25;1858;TOOLONG the main house . He went clear over to the other side of the point , north of the dock , and leaned his double-bitted axe against a tree and sat down on a stump to wait for the others . Woods and lake were utterly breathless . Not a ripple moved against the shore , not a leaf or a needle fell . Back in the island woods a white-throated sparrow was ecstaticallypouring out his one liquid song . Andy looked at his big silver Ingersoll . Five past seven . But his watch might be wrong . It seemed awfully early , somehow.  |p159Through  the fringe of boughs along the island 's edge he could look over at the unpeopled north shore . beyond Turtle Rocks . The rocks themselves were out of sight behind the jut of the point , but he could see the mill-pond water and the steep sun-slanted shore . It seemed to him too that he could hear splashing , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swimmer came in sight from around the point , as if coming from the rocks ; someone darkly tanned , who cracked the mirror-water in a swift strong crawl . Andy watched , admiring the easy power of the swimming , wondering who was man enough to get up and swim when it was as early and as cold as this . The swimmer came straight on to a point a hundred yards down the shore , the brown arms and shoulders gleaming now in the sun , now passing into the shadow . In the shallow water the swimmer staggered and lurched upright , and Andy froze where he stood when he saw that it was a woman , naked as a fish . Without hurry or appearanceof alarm , she splashed up on the bank , pulled herself in by the knee of a cedar , reached a white terryclothrobe off a limb , slid into it , kicked her feet into clogs or sandals , and started up the shore path toward the cottages . There was nowhere Andy could hide until she had gone by . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she was out of sight among the trees , and duck back to his stump , where he sat down and stared fixedly out over the lake . With all his senses focused , as it were , in the back of his neck , he felt the exact moment when she discovered him , felt the slight slurring pause in her stride , and then she went on , twenty yards behind him , to the central cottage . He bent his neck slightly , getting a sidelong look over his shoulder . The woman  --  it was Mrs. Weld 's secretary ,  | the blonde woman with the short hair  --  went up the steps , her calves walnut-brown below the white robe . She was the one to be swimming in the cold morning water . There was a story that she had bicycled clear to Mount Washington and back , more than a hundred miles , between dinner and supper . Carefully he withdrew his gaze from the empty screen door and let his neck turn almost imperceptiblytoward the front again , moving as slowly as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flower near his face . The image of the brown woman standing upright on the rooty bank with her water-dark hair swung back , her hand reaching for the robe on the limb , was tense and living in his mind . He sat still on the stump and looked out over the lake , and his blood burned with desire and his hands shook with wonder and a bright feverish excitement . He was still sitting there almost an hour later when his Uncle James and the Shurtleff boys came together between the cottages from the direction of the ramp . The older Shurtleff looked at him sharply , with a shrewd , hanging grin . His face was edged like an axe , and his hair lay every way on his head , a dull black mat , as if it had not seen a comb for so long it had become felted . His eyes pried at Andy 's face . Well , well , ' he said . She been in yet ? ' Andy went brick-red . Who ? ' Who ? ' Shurtleff said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he do n't look guilty 's a burglar . Who 'd you think you 'd see , comin ' down here early ? ' I do n't know . ' Well , who did you see ? ' Nobody , ' Andy said . I 've been waiting an hour to get to work . ' Do n't nobody start at seven on a summer-folks job , ' the younger Shurtleff said . He was gopher-toothed likep161his brother , but less in need of a shave . He looked at James Mount and squinted his eyes . What held you up , James ? Sh 'd think you 'd be down to see the sights too . ' I 'm a married man , ' James said . He winked at Andy and spat on the ground . What are you talking about , anyway ? ' the boy said . Young Shurtleff searched in his frock pockets for acigarette . Did n't see nawthin ' , all the time you was here ? ' What would I see ? ' Folks been sayin ' this secretary of Mrs. Weld 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Prouty boy was up fishin ' t' other mornin ' , said she swum clean across the channel and back , naked as you please . ' Andy opened empty hands and shrugged . He heard the elder Shurtleff say , Wo n't be a fish in this pond , she keeps that up . ' How 's that ? ' James said . Shurtleff made an obscene gesture . Stiffen up and drownd , ' he said , and cackled with sudden loud laughter . His brother was looking speculatively toward the house . ' Wonder if she 's married ? ' Why , I had n't heard so , ' James said . You gettin ' ambitionsthat way ? ' Would n't turn it down , ' Shurtleff said . She must be married , showin ' off that way . Would n't any girl be that bold . ' Well , if she 's married , that makes it easy , ' James said . She 'd never miss a slice off a cut loaf . ' Shurtleff senior smacked his seat and laughed again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet little knot on the shore , as the back door opened and the secretary , in a white shirt and gray slacks , came out and started out the path toward them . Andy moved a little behind the others , knowing that if he looked at her openly he would look at her as if she had no clothes on , and that she would recognize the look . He was hot and embarrassed , and he did not particularly like the cool , arrogant expressionlessness of the secretary . Her hair still showed the marks of the comb . Her voice was crisp , a little loud , and her eyes touched them each briefly , impersonally . Andy could make nothing of the glance she gave him . It simply recognized that he was there , as if counting him , without individualizing him in any way . She showed them what Mrs. Weld wanted done . From a point a few yards below her boathouse to the first outcurvingin the shore , perhaps two hundred feet , she wantedall weeds and bushes cut out and cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one tree every fifteen or twenty feet . Where there was grass under the trees , she wanted it scythed and then mown with a lawnmoweruntil it was as smooth as it could be made . Where there was not grass , she wanted sod laid in . They could cut the sod across in Charbon 's meadow , where there was a good deal of clover . There were tools of all kinds , includinga grass roller , in the shop . Walking them down through the cedars , stooping under low branches , talking crisply with her cool eyes touching now one , now the other , allowing them no personalitiesbut only their identity as workmen , she stopped at the bottom end of the projected park , rolling the starched cuffs of her shirt up her brown smooth arms . When you get that much done , there 's one last job , ' she said . Mrs. Weld will be particular about it . Maybe she 'll want to show you herself how she wants it done . Have any of you ever seen a formal garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' You mean cut out into shapes ? ' James asked . Yes . Would you know how to do it ? ' Reckon a man could figure it out , ' James said . What kind of shapes does Mrs. Weld want ? '  |p163The  cool blue eyes came to rest on James , and it seemed to Andy that in her eyes and in the corners of her mouth there was a faint sneer . Whether it was for his uncle , or Mrs. Weld , or this job which she was giving directions for , he could n't tell . What would you suggest ? ' she said . James screwed up his face . Cows , maybe . Sheep . Could be we could find one spread out , sort of , make a fish or sornethin ' out of it . Might get a tall one into a long-legged bird , like the kind they have cut out of a board on folks ' lawns . ' Yes , ' she said , watching him with that remote , shadowytwist of irony in her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Ray Shurtleff , silent till now , quelled by the efficiency of the secretary , uneasy under her level eyes , made one desperate attempt to distinguish himself from the other three digits who made up the work gang . Mrs. Weld 's that fond of livestock , I got eighteen head of caows she can pasture in here . Little more lifelike than cedar ones . ' The eyes barely brushed him . I expect you 'd better take that up with Mrs. Weld yourself , ' she said . With her sleeves rolled neatly to the middle of her round upper arms , she said , Mrs. Weld likes things done in a hurry . You can come in for your pay at five o'clock , and the rate will depend on how much of this is done . She pays by the day , and she pays high for good work . ' She left them , swinging with her vigorous free stride down the shore . James Mount looked after her , then looked at Ray Shurtleff . His toothless mouth opened , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again after an absolutely soundless cackle , he said , No , Ray . You ai n't man enough . Ai n't anybody I know round here that is man enough . ' All day Andy kept his mouth shut and worked , and when the Shurtleffs pointed out places where a manp164could sit completely out of sight and command the whole main cove and Turtle Rocks , he made no sign that he heard . It was perfectly clear to him , in spite of the uncheckedexcitement that still beat in him when he thought of the naked body staggering up out of the shallows , that he would not come down early the next morning and try to catch another look . He knew the Shurtleffs would n't either . There was something in the way the woman looked at you , not exactly contemptuously , but with an inhuman impersonality , that discouraged even the determinedlewdness of the Shurtleffs . It was a good hour after her departure before they recovered from the confusedstate of mind she had left them in , and got back into the swing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Andy , swinging a grub-hoe on the roots of little felled cedars , thought with wonder how desirable , how graceful and warm and living she had been at a distance , and how cold and even repellent she was when you met her face to face . He nursed the contradictory images in his mind all day , and at five o'clock when they went into the office for their pay he stayed behind his Uncle James . A half hour before , the secretary had walked unhurriedly through the cleared-out area along shore , inspecting the amount of work done . Now , as they came up the steps in a close huddle , Andy darted his eyes around the office in search of her , and was half disappointed , half positively glad to see the room empty . There was a letter in the typewriter , and the breeze from the open window behind riffled the two sheets of paper and the blue carbon between them . From outside came the low sound of women 's voices , indistinctand mumbling as the sound of flies on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the window , his grinning toothless face turning right and then left . Were you looking for me ? ' the secretary 's voice said clearly.  |p165I  understood you to say we got our pay here at five , ' James said . Just a minute , ' the voice said . Then in another tone it said , You do n't have to go in yet . Wait a minute and I 'll run you over in the motorboat . We can tow your skiff . ' Miss Barnes appeared in the doorway . She had glasses in her hand , and slipped them on as she sat down . From a metal box she took a package of bills , thumbed off four ones and four fives , snapped the box shut , and looked up at James Mount . One by one they stepped forward and took their six dollars . Andy came last . He was weak all over , and it cost him agony to lift his eyes . Even when he managed it , he looked past rather than at the secretary , and on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She lifted a nervously gay hand , and in his surprise at seeing her he forgot himself momentarily . Well , hello , Helen , ' he said . He was aware that the secretary had said something . He turned his glazed eyes on her and saw her standing with the new bills in her hand , her eyes impatient and her mouth hard . In the instant when their glances met with a little sparklike shock , he had a feeling that she dislikedhim intensely . Six dollars , ' she said . Thank you , ' Andy said . For very desperation , in his confusion and embarrassment , he craned to make a little gesture of farewell at Helen Barlow outside the window . The secretary stood with her fingers on the desk until he got his feet working and followed the others outside . That was all , but the contradictory emotions aroused by his brief contact with Flo Barnes bothered him all the way home , all through chores , all through the pork chops and boiled potatoes and rice pudding that old Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It nagged at him , sitting out on the porch after supper , until he got up and walked aimlessly through the square and out the road . No matter how his mind ducked and turned , it kept coming back , slyly , until it caught itself up in the act of gloatingover the bare brown body , the smooth perfection of every limb and every movement . He saw her image generallyat a distance , but even close-up it had power to shake him  --  the way the starched cuff of her sleeve turned up along the round arm , the strong throat within the open collar of her shirt , the walnut calves below the terry-cloth robe , mounting the steps and vanishing withinthe house with a movement of lithe ankles . He lived with the memory of her bare flesh in orgiastic intimacy , yet through every erotic vision he allowed himself to construct , her icy blue eyes looked at him as they might have looked at a signpost , and the mouth was shadowedby an unspoken but obvious contempt . When he looked up in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Mrs. Weld maintained on the mainland opposite the south channel , he swore aloud at the thing which was being done to him , and set off at a hard , conscience-smitten run up the road and away from temptation . When he came to the four corners where the lake road turned away toward Sudbury , he slowed to a winded walk , but he kept on going , headed for the lighted kitchen of Donald Swain 's place . The night was overcast , a little breathless , quite warm . From the steps where they sat they could see on the left the faint pale shape of the hydrangea bush , and on the right , lighted by the light from the window , the tall , **28;1885;TOOLONG heads of the goldenglow . At their feet the grass stretched off short-mown into the darkness . They had exhausted words , and had come to the quiet part , the kissing part . Nancy lay within his shoulder , andp167their arms were around each other 's waists . The girl ' , pale blonde hair was under his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blondie , ' he said . Just the color of a Jersey cow . I wish ' t was , ' Nancy said . That would be a lovely color of hair . ' Nicer the way ' t is , ' he said , and then added , You 're the second blonde I 've seen today . ' It came out as if it had been hiding there , waiting fog a door to open . It slid out like a cat slipping between walker 's feet , and he sat staring hotly down the vanish . ing apron of lawn . With everything lovely , Nancy sweet as sugaring time , giving him her deliberate , shut-eyeed kisses that were like fruits to be picked , one at a time , he had to say that . So far as he knew , the woman had n't been on his mind for a half hour , but out she popped , just the same . Nancy turned her face toward his , her eyes faintly shining . I bet I know who . ' Who ? ' Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What makes you think so ? ' She 's the only one around with hair as light 's mine ; and you were working there today . ' You ought to be a detective , ' he said uneasily , laughing , seeing the brown body in the shallows , the careless , back-thrown hair , the reaching arm . She 's pretty , ' Nancy said . She 's a knockout . ' Is she ? ' he said , shifting his back against the pillar . She could be in the movies , ' Nancy said . For certainkinds of parts she 'd be wonderful . ' He bent and kissed her , forcing himself to feel the tendernessof her lips , the softness of her skin . I ca n't imagineher doing that , ' he said . Movies or otherwise . ' She 's the outdoor type , ' Nancy said . She 'd do better in Westerns . She 'd look wonderful in a black sombrero with a tie-string under the chin . ' She lay comfortably against him , accepting his kisses when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The very thought of what it might be to hold a woman like Flo Barnes in his arms this way made him shake . She 's got funny eyes , ' he said . They 'd scare a man near out of his mind . ' They 're awful light , ' Nancy agreed . She must be Swedish , maybe . Lots of Swedes have those light blue eyes . ' She lay speculating , her whole mind given over to the problem of who besides Swedish girls had light-blue eyes , and he looked down at her pretty childish face , feeling years older , feeling like her father almost , feeling protective and warmly involved . She was a country girl , maybe , and she still had two years to go in high school , and she did n't know everything a woman from the city knew , and probably never would . But when he bent over her again to rub his nose softly against hers and kiss her he could see , in the dim dusky light from the window , no arrogance in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her mouth . Danger lay where his mind had been wandering ; safety lay here.  |p169IT  WAS A LITTLE like being God , distributing the mail . From outside , where people waited , the letterboxes were single , private , impregnable with glass and bronze and cunning combination locks . The majesty of the law protectedthem , as the handbills and reward notices tacked all over the walls made plain . From the viewpoint of the waiting box-renter the mailbox was a privacy as sanctified as any he could command . But from Helen Barlow 's point of view , from back of the box wall , the whole honeycomb was open and available . From where she worked it was possible to see into anyone 's affairs , read his postcards , estimate his bills . With a little malice she could have wrecked lives ; with a will to snoop she could have known secrets of everyone in the village . A little like being God . Gaylord Brown , behind her , finished sorting first-class mail into the star route sacks and handed the packet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bringing the smeared front window into her vision , and just as she turned she saw Flo Barnes cross the pane , turning her head to look in . The feeling of having impregnable barricades between herself and the village vanished between two breaths . The post office became not a fortress but a trap . She was not like God now , but something on which God looked down , knowing every thought and act , and it did no good to pretend that the letterbox was private because it was bound in metal and locked with a two-dialed lock to170 Second Growthp170which no one else had the combination . God did n't need the combination . Secrets could be kept from the front , but from the rear they were wide open . Her hands still automatically slid letters edgewise into the narrow pigeonholes , but there was a heavy thudding in her chest , and her mind fluttered like a bird caught in a room . If the whole village could walk around behind the wall and look and see it all , the way God saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bentham knew everything , and old Mrs. Budd knew , and Mr. Tait and Mrs. Tait and Mrs. Thatcher and lewd old James Mount . If Vina Mount knew , and could stand insolent and with curling lip , and talk about it with her drunken boy friends down on the river . The door of the Weld box  --  she knew it , out of all that battery of boxes  --  swung open , and Flo 's straight brows and blue eyes and the evenly-tanned upper part of her face were there . Helen flashed a tight smile and moved sideward , religiously reaching and stooping . But when she had to cross the open box again Flo 's eyes were still there . The brows frowned a peremptory summons , but Helen did not heed it . She formed a word with her lips , Later ! ' and escaped to other boxes . The thudding of her heart filled her whole head . After a moment the box door slammed . Until all the mail was sorted , Gaylord kept the stamp window down , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side door and got the sealed sack for Sudbury , came back and gathered up the star route sacks . When the door had closed behind him there was only the little job of stuffing newspapers and catalogues into the boxes . Box doors began to swing open and click shut again , feet shuffled outside as people made up their minds they had all the mail that was coming . P171Helen stayed till the last , through the little clean-up jobs , but when Gaylord looked at her and wrinkled his long lip and said , Well , reckon we can sell a few stamps , ' she smiled a sick smile and said , I 'll be running along , then , ' and slipped out the door that let her into the alley . For a second she hesitated . Someone crossed the narrowopening between the post office and the firehouse , and her heart stopped , but the walker went on . She turned and ran down the alley into the sloping backyardstrewn with rusty cans and old square blocks of cement buried in the long grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Pugh place and lost itself in woods . To her left the cross alley , unused except by children cutting through the back lots , opened onto the Corners road above the feed store . There was a chance that she might fly out the feed store alley and come around through the square and home before Flo saw her . But it was too risky . Flo had probablyalready discovered her escape from the post office . She fled down the lot , through a boggy spot into open woods , across a fence and down the steep wooded hillside until she reached the brook , which fell through a gravelly chute into the old millpond above the road . From there it went underground through a culvert into the mill . Helen stopped by the pond and got her breath , looking back up along the wooded slope in fear that Flo 's figure might appear in pursuit of her . The last of the day was stretched from the hills above Broken-Musket Brook clear across to the slopes of Sunday . The woods behind her were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the abrupt sweet tune of a peabody bird in the quiet . Not a leaf moved on the late goldenrod and joe pye weed at the roadside . The mill was deserted ; there was not a car on the road . She felt how the quiet threatened her , how lonely it was and how soon the dark would come on , and suddenly the village seemed a friendly and protecting place full of light and the sounds of life . She wanted to start straight up the road and go to her house and feel the warmth of the big range and smell the smells of supper , and see her father settling to his evening reading . But there was too much danger that Flo would be waiting for her . The only chance she had of escaping was by walking clear around the village and coming in like a sneak thief from back of the hill . As she started up the edge of Livesy 's meadow and crossed into the rough golf course she said to herself , quite simply  --  or to God , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her mind . Please , ' she said , let me keep out of her way ! Just let me get in without her seeing me . She 'll be gone in a few more days . Please let me keep out of her way till she goes and everything will be all right . ' It was at least two miles around by the elaborately safe way she had chosen to go . In the rough the stubble snagged her stockings and pricked her ankles , and in boggy spots she sank over her shoetops in squelching grassy mud . Once , at the edge of a wide sand trap , she stopped to get her breath and look back . The valley was bleak with the oncoming dark . The evening star was pale above the cemetery hill . By the time she had picked her way the length of the golf course and come over the hill to where she could see the wink of lighted windows in the village through the trees , it was almost fully dark . She had to feel with her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was filling with stars . Across the half-cleared patch that Daniel Pratt had been clearing for as long as she could remember she had to move with great care , for the caves left by uprootedP173stumps were treacherous in the dark , and there were ex posed roots and snags of old cedars to bump into . She was tired and close to tears when she made the fence parted the wires , and got through onto the county roadFor a moment she was tempted to turn straight down the road and home . That way it would be less than half a mile of easy walking . But she would have to go down almost to the square , turn up the hill with the arc light shining on her . The very thought terrified her . By now , across the arch from east to west , crossing Cassiopeia and the Dipper , a shimmering band of light began to play , delusive and fleeting , at one moment look ing like a luminous wisp of cloud , at another momen gone . The girl hugged her arms across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road . Thy wind had a bite like winter . The Northern Lights shed a vague sort of moonligh through the air , but she had to walk stooping , her hand before her to ward off branches . She knew that he mother would be worried . The mail had been a hour late to begin with . It must be eight o'clock now . I was comforting to know that in a few minutes she would slip in from the back shed , muddy-footed and breathless and with her hair snagged with twigs , but safe . She would tell her mother she had gone for a walk and for gotten to pay attention to the time . She would say she was tired and not feeling well , and go up to her room and if anyone telephoned , or knocked on the door , she could tell her mother to say she was n't well enough ti see anyone . It might even be possible  --  and she stopped in the dal . ' among the spruces , thinking of it  --  to go to bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just lie in her bed a her father sat in his chair , pull her privacy in around he like curtains around a four-poster , and be safe , and snug and by herself . . . . She would n't have to come out until Flo Barnes was gone , and the whole dreadful thing was finished and over . She could go to bed and almost dream it away , as simply as lying down to sleep . Somehow she felt that her father would approve such action . Somehow she felt that he knew her fear , and was himself terrified of Flo . She even thought of talking to him about it . The woods thinned , and off to her left she saw a farm . Channing 's . The meadow that lay between woods and house was fenced away from her by a three-wire fence , but rather than walk any longer through the woods she fought through the prickly tangle of wild-apple trees along the fence , climbed carefully over the wires , and got out into the smooth grass . In a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the fringe of woods along the east side of her father 's hayfield . Here too the tangle was thick along the old crumbling snake fence , and she snagged her hair getting through and over . But on the other side she saw , just a skip and a hop across the hilltop field , the barn roof sagging like the back of a tired old horse , the lower line of connecting sheds , the square calm yellow pane of the kitchen window . Beyond the vague cluster of buildings the slim dark spire of the church pinned the sky up and back . She kicked one foot against the other , staring out of her covert into the empty field . She was wet halfway to the knees , and chattering with cold , but the kitchen window was as invitingand heartening as the smiling face of a friend . She ran out across the lot to the back wall of the barn , and came around it to the unused milkroom door . And at the milkroom door someone stepped from the shadow of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SINGLE THING brought her to it . Abe kept saying at first that it was the newness , that she was strange yet , that it took time to get acquainted and get the feel of a new place . But she knew he was wrong , for the feeling grew worse with every day and week . And after she got sick , Abe said of course it was the illness . Coming on for some time , that had made her unhappy and spoiled things for her . As soon as she was up and around things would look different . But Abe was talking to reassure himself . Ruth knew that what ailed her was not the strangeness and not really the sickness , but the village itself , the people in it , the things they said and the way they acted . It was Mrs. Boyce , giving a fancy la-de-da luncheon in the church , imitating the ways of city women , and asking every marriedvillage woman , every mortal one , except Ruth . Abe was furious when he heard about that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course Mrs. Boyce did n't ask any city women , just village women , and maybe she still thought of Ruth as a city person , coming from New York and staying at the inn and all that . Which I 'm not , ' Ruth said , and she knows it perfectly well . ' Yes , ' Abe said . Yes . Well  --  do you care ? ' Do I care about missing her hayseed luncheon , do you mean ? ' Yes . '   No , ' Ruth said . But I care about not being asked , and so would you . ' She went upstairs to the bedroom . It was n't even not being asked that bothered her . It was the deliberateness with which she had been left out . She thought that anyone with any kindness or hospitality or simple humanity would have asked a newcomer , even if she was a dubious guest . As it turned out , she could n't have gone anyway , because the day before the luncheon was to be given she came down sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe 's , generally a summer person , would come up the ladderlike stair and sit a few minutes and talk . She always brightened at those casual unpremeditated visits , and felt better . Once Mary Dow came with some dahlias from her garden , and once old Mr. Dow left a couple of books . But apart from those , no one called . For days on end she had lain expecting Helen Barlow , who liked to talk about plays and music and books , and who worked just down in the square and had whole afternoons of free time , but not once did Helen appear , and in her illness she grew bitter , blaming even Abe , thinking that the way he acted about her sickness was enough to scare anybody away . Her ailment embarrassed and flustered and dismayed him . It was a feminine business , mysterious and alarming , and she could hear him down below , whispering loudly , whenever anyone asked about her . She 's in bed , ' he would say . She is n't feeling so well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cold ? ' or This sorethroat that 's going around ? ' he would speak in that tone that always meant he was making jerky motions with his arms . Oh , you know , ' he would say . Some of this business of the insides . I do n't understand it . ' Everything he said soundedto her straining ears like an attempt to discourage people 's solicitude . P177But after she had lain there a week , with headaches foi company and a perspective of isolated years to look into , she did not blame Abe . He was gentle and helpful and alarmed , and if he tiptoed too much he did it out of considerationfor her , and if he dropped his voice when peopleasked about her sickness , and evaded their direct questions , it was because he was self-accusing and afraid feeling that he was responsible , that it was marrying him which had got her into this . She could n't really blame Abe , but she could lie there long hot afternoons under the roof and grow bitter abou the village , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . She heard from Harold Swett , who repeated i as a good joke , that Mr. Tait had mentioned in a sermoi the unbelievers in the village and had made it pretty plain he was talking about Abe . She could lie there am sort through their faces and feel that there was n't a one not a single one , who in two months had given her an : reason for liking or affection . Most of all she could hate the Boyces , not only because of that luncheon snub bu because of the chickens . There was a good deal of weakness with her sickness so much so that sometimes she lay for an hour crying weakly , her eyes running over and wetting her pillow and sometimes her head ached so that in spite of he weakness she could not rest . Her body found every but ton in the mattress , every unbound wire in the springs and many nights she lay burning-eyed until dawn or the waiting for sleep that did not come , thinking over he life with a scrupulous attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ornate a the plots of novels , and wondering what this sicknes might mean . Who in this hick town would know who ailed her ? She doubted if the doctor Abe brought i knew enough to wash his hands ; he did n't smell asepti the way a doctor should , but reeked of pipe smoke . P178Oh Lord , she would say , and turn her pillow and ease her aching hips and listen forlornly to Abe 's light snoring beside her . He was sweet , and he tried to help , but how could he know that the thing she would have appreciated most was that he should stay sleepless with her through the long night hours ? About daylight she would find the sleep she had been hunting for , but it would be broken , haunted by strange cries that no amount of burrowing into the pillow could shut out . After a half hour of trying she would be awake again , angry and ready to cry , and would recognize the sounds which had awakened her as the crowing of roostersover in Boyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but what do you expect ? ' Abe said when she complained to him . Roosters crow , that 's all . You get used to it . I never hear them at all . ' I do , though , ' she said . There 's one that sounds exactly as if he were having his throat cut . He gives me the most horrible nightmares , hearing this gurgling and screaming and being half asleep so I do n't realize what it is . I wish you could speak to Mr. Boyce and see if he could do something . ' He stared at the floor and pulled his nose and puckered his lips . ' I do n't see what he could do . You ca n't stop a rooster from crowing . ' You can cut his head off . ' Off two hundred roosters ? He cuts the heads off five or six every day , selling them to people . But two hundred , that 's impossible . ' He could find that one that gurgles and chokes , and sell him to the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his mind , trying out explanations and soothing words as one would try them out for a petulant child , and it infuriated her . She saw his hesitation , his will to humor her , and she wouldP179not be humored and put aside . These roosters , you understand , ' he said , they are young roosters , just learning how to crow . That is what makes the gurgles . ' I do n't care what makes it ! ' she cried . You 've got a sick wife here , and if old Boyce had any consideration he 'd do something about his roosters . And if you had any consideration you 'd go and tell him so . ' He was silent for quite a long while , shrugging to himself , puckering his lips at thoughts that occurred to him . He lifted his eyes and essayed a smile , a pleading , listento-reasonlook . It does n't last , ' he said . Look at it . He starts with two hundred young roosters , he sells a half dozen a day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a month . Even if he does n't sell any on Sunday , that is maybe a hundred and fifty he has sold . There are only fifty , maybe , making this noise ... ' Only fifty , ' she said , and turned her back on him . That sure makes it a lot nicer , to know there are only fifty . And one that gargles . ' She lay with her back to him , yielding not an inch to his words or his hands or his silences , hating herself for being sick , for breaking down , for being hysterical and unreasonable ; hating the village for its barriers and its roosters . Finally Abe tiptoed out and went away . Later , when he brought up her dinner , he told her that he had been to see Boyce . There is nothing he can do , ' he said . I told him about this rooster which gargles and he looked at me as if he thought I should be put in some asylum . That will be a joke all over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her , the shrewishnessthat was unlike her , that was unworthy of her , but that she could n't help . All right , ' she said . It 's a joke . It 's a great big joke , and I should laugh like anything because I have n't had any sleep for four nights . Why ca n't he keep his roosters inside the chicken house , at least while people are sick ? If he 'd shut them indoors they could crow all they wanted and never disturb anybody . ' Well , maybe , ' he said . With a flash of his old argumentativespirit he said , Have they put rubber tires on the elevated now ? How can you sleep in New York with all that banging going past ? This is the same kind of a thing . ' No , it is n't anything of the kind , ' Ruth said . You know when the elevated comes , for one thing . And it is n't alive , for another , it 's just noise . And there 's nothing you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's something old Boyce could do about his roosters , if he wanted to . ' In the end she drove him out again , threatening to go herself , weak as she was , if he would n't . He came back muttering and exclamatory , rigid with anger . He would n't tell her what had passed between him and Mr. Boyce except that they had quarreled , and that he had threatened to shoot any rooster of Boyce 's that was loose out in the yard at dawn and jumping on fences and crowing . And now I am going down to Bentham 's and buy the gun . ' Oh , Abe , ' she said , you should n't have threatened anything like that ! ' Listen ! Do these roosters bother you or do n't they ? ' Yes , but not ... ' So if they bother you , and you are sick , not just some woman making a fuss , then Boyce should try to do something . And when I come twice to ask him , friendly as you please , if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at me as if I am crazy , then I will shoot his roosters next time they crow . ' Ruth caught his hand and pulled him down on the bed . I would n't let you do that . They 'd put you in jail . ' What had been unbearable to her before seemed bearable enough now , and she was ashamed of having been so unreasonablyirritated . She soothed Abe down , pleased thatP181he could get so angry for her sake , and they had a kind of reconciliation and a long talk , and afterward she had a nap and awoke feeling better . But even when she was well enough to walk as far as the post office or the library , she felt as if her illness marked a boundary , that since her spell in bed she could never be deceived again about her position in the village . People spoke to her , women inquired how she was feeling , old Allan Richie commented , Well , looks if you were up and about again , ' but she was not fooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boyce or his wife . Roundabout , it came back to them that some people in the village thought Mrs. Kaplan was consumptive  --  a communication that made Ruth so angry she cried , and went up to the bedroom to look at her face in the mirror , noting its thinness and the shadowed eyes . It was only the summer people who made her life bearableat all , and she was obsessed with the fear of what the village would be like after they went home . The only culturalinstitution in the village proper , the library , was made almost impossible by old Mrs. Emma Budd , sitting in the room like a skeleton on wires . Every time she went in for a book Ruth came out feeling bitter and somehow degraded , though not a word might have been said on either side . And now the summer people were already beginning to leave . Abe 's racks were less crowded , the half-completed suits no longer lay around on his bench . Within a few days it would be Labor Day , and by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these dour and unyielding villagers , the acid women and the silent men , the people with whom she had no means of communication , and could have none . And on the day before Labor Day would be the last concert of the year . After that there would be no music P182except what her little radio would bring her  --  a radio too weak to pick up anything but Montreal and St. Johnsbury , Vermont , and too likely , in the midst of any programworth listening to , to give way to uncontrollable and hysterical static . The static Ruth blamed on the Pratts , down below Harold Swett 's . There were radio sermons on at the same hour as Ruth 's favorite symphonicprogram , and Evelyn Pratt , very religious but not rigidly denominational in her tastes , dialed back and forth among three stations . Every time she turned the dial of her old superheterodyne Ruth 's loudspeaker made a noise like a falling tin roof . This place is going to be like a tomb , ' she said to Mary Dow one afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no concerts , no good conversation , no nothing . ' She turned her eyes on her visitor and unaccountablyfelt the smarting of almost-tears . When I think of how many things you can do in the winter in New York , ' she said . All for nothing , too , you do n't need any more than bus fare . All the museums , and the galleriesalong 57th Street . You can get yourself a real art education , just going to shows in those galleries . And all the free concerts , and WQXR . . . For that matter , just walking along any street in New York is as good as a show . ' She sighed , dimpling at Mary Dow and turning her nostalgiainto a laugh . But I guess I 'd give the whole businessif I could only get some good music on the radio up here . They could take away my breakfast and lunch if they 'd leave me some music . ' Mary Dow 's lively face , the eyes constantly round and the mouth ready to smile , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unexpected and happiest of surprises , and in an instant would be running wildly like a delighted child to welcome something  --  this friendly face rounded still more , and the brows frowned quickly at some thought . P183'Oh , why did n't I think of it yesterday ! ' she said . ' I won der if it 's too late now ? ' Abe wandered in from the dining room , mussed fron his afternoon nap on the couch there . What is this ? ' he said . Think of what yesterday ? ' The program committee for the music met yesterda ) to make arrangements for the storage of the machine anc records . Last winter we left them in Mrs. Weld 's cottage and the cold did something to the machine  --  it had to be fixed this spring . What we want is some place that 's warn and dry , that 's all , and where the people will be careful of the records . But they could play them , all they want . ed . Oh , why did n't I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled yet . I doubt if it is . Would you like to keep them if I can fix it ? ' Would I ? ' Ruth said . Oh , would I ! ' Say , ' Abe said , talking so fast the words tripped and tangled . Say , that would be nice if you could . You never saw  --  she likes music like nobody ever did . You never saw anybody so crazy over music . ' You wait right here , ' Mary Dow said . I 'll go see Moll ) Porter this minute . She was going to look into some other possibilities , but I 'll bet she has n't done a thing yet . ' She went out , running lightly as a child across the patch of lawn Abe had created from the former rani grass . Well , Madame , ' Abe said , and stopped . What you are crying ? ' he said softly . Oh , Abe , ' she said . All that beautiful record collec Hon ! And that machine ! Think of having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Beethoven , put it on When you want to skip and dance , out comes Mozart .

' Her eyes wandered away from his face , the tears tha had jumped in them already forgotten , and went  | latively around the walls . Where could we put it ? ' she said . It 's pretty big , and it should n't be too near the stove , because heat might blister it , or warp the records . It should n't be up against an outside wall , either , if it 's as cold up here as you say it is . Where would you think , Abe ? In here or in the dining room ? ' How about this , ' Abe said . How about moving my bench down , against the wall , like this . Then you 've got maybe five feet clear , all inside wall , eight or ten feet from the stove . Eh ? It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was pushing against the heavy bench , sliding it across the congoleum , when Ruth cried that Mrs. Dow was back .

If I 'd had the slightestbit of brains in my head I 'd have thought of you last night , and then it could have been all fixed by now . But Molly Porter 's already talked with Mrs. Tait , and I guess it 's all settled . Next year I 'll have some sense , and speak up in .. . Mrs. Tait ? ' Ruth said . Oh , Lord , she does n't even like music . She has n't gone to a concert this summer . It 'll just sit there and gather dust !

It was the one thing that might have . . I ca n't help it ! ' Abe gnawed his lip and looked at Mary Dow with sick eyes . He sighed , a windy , defeated sound . You know how it is , ' he said apologetically . She has n't been well , she does n't feel good yet . And this is a disappointment , you ca n't deny that . Yes , it is a disappointment . ' P186INDIFFERENTLY , doing a routine job for the millionth time , going about it as if sullen at the tedium of old chores , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a while the peak 's bald crown and timbered slopes were visible , but then the clouds slipped around the flanks until only the granite profile showed , and then the gray poured over , with thunder rumbling under it and lightningwhipping it along , and came over Canadian Notch in a douche of cold rain . At a little after one Baptiste Charbon , trying to get a second cutting from his lower meadow , gave up and put his team into a run for the barn with only a half-load on , and behind him the rain came , not in gusts or with any particular fury , but with a businesslike thoroughness , wettingdown the tumbles , soaking into the matted stems and stubble . Along the county road the ditches began to trickle thin streams of brown mud , and the brook that came down below the Dow place sounded louder through its culvert . Beyond the tip of Weld Island three boys in a sailboat drove for shore in a gray squall . At the town dock the waves began to dance and slap and spank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not yet seem to be any wind , the boats moored there jerked at their painters and bumped their noses softly against the dock . Rain roughed the water out in the lake , and all around the dock there were sudden little popping noises like the gasping of fish , as drops hitP181the surface . The gray planks were freckled , then streaked then dark , and the rain passed on toward the village . It put the inn guests up on the verandah and route ( three old gentlemen playing darts against a maple . Thy little after-lunch scattering of people before the store wa driven to shelter . Parley Pugh , stretched out under the creamery truck working on a loose spring shackle , poke ( his squinting greasy face out , got a drop in his eye , an ( lay for a minute with his face under the runningboard a if calculating probabilities . By the time he had his min ( made up , the square of dry ground on which he lay was outlined with drip-holes from the streaming running boards , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street and up the drive to John Mills ' shopAndy Mount , working on a batch of chairs with oh John Mills , watched through the window as the ran closed in upon the town . The shop was snug , with little fire going , for old John was eighty , and needed warmth . The air was sweet with the smell of planed pine the vinegar smell of oak , the richness of linseed oil . There was something , too , as perceptible as an odor , that em anated from the old man , a tincture , a quintessence ex pressed most by his face and his hands . He had a face a gentle as a blind child 's , and great knobby lobster-clay hands that looked as clumsy as fire-tongs and were actual ly precision instruments . Andy had been working for th ( old man only three days , but he had seen already hove men dribbled in and sat and passed the time of day , sit ting on nail kegs and talking or not talking as the ) pleased . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why they came , but it was difficult to say . All he knew was that they took something away from those visits , the ) went away as if they had refreshed themselves atspring , they were reassured . When Parley Pugh thudded in with his denim frock rain-streaked and water running on his face , Andy noddedas John Mills did , and moved down the bench to turn on the motor and begin ripping out slats for chairbacks on the bandsaw , feeding the thin boards into the saw and thinking that in a few more days now Peter Dow would be going down to Dryden , and that Andy Mount would not be going with him . He knew he had not made a decision . He had simply tightened his hands around something , and shut his mind to the lure of the other complex and dangerous possibility . In his present mood , it suited him exactly to be here in John Mills ' warm shop . As much as anyone in the village he needed reassurance , he needed to listen and watch men who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what they had made of that choosing . There was comfort in old John 's smooth-worn bench , in his reverendage , in his clumsy-looking old blotched hands , and the skill in them . To work with good , familiar tools was better for him than any amount of talk would have been . The rain was a steady gravelly patter on the steel roof , and it streamed on the windows . The woodpile outside was sooty black in the wet . Back of him in the room the easy voices came out tentatively , retired again . On the bench the stack of identical slats grew , and he pushed it away and started another . The pulsating strip of light where the saw hummed was slight , almost unnoticeable , yet it was full of purpose , even danger ; it demanded the undivided attention of its master . It was a force that did not shift or wander , but it cut clean everything held against it , an edge against which lives could be shaped as he was shaping slats . He laid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become a thin gap , the board become a shaped and meaningful thing . And he watched his own hands , round-nailed , brown , yellowin the palms with clear callous . In a certain numberP189of years  --  fifteen , twenty , thirty , fifty  --  they might look like the hands of John Mills , with thick ridged nails and thickened joints and mottled skin . The rain outside was obviously going to last . Andy gathered some scraps from the box and threw them into the ashy coals in the stove . Pugh , sitting on a keg with his gumboots muddying the floor , was making idle talk for an idle hour . Andy listened just as idly , bellying up to the bench . They can get somebody else , far as I 'm concerned , ' Parley was saying . Or just let them folks be . ' Thought you 'd got all around last week , ' John Mills said . Did . I was lucky to get off that rud alive . First door I stopped at , that was Graham . The old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a drag saw , all teeth  --  and I says , " Come to administer the freeman 's oath to your boy John . " " He ai n't aimin ' to vote , " she says , and shuts the door . Next place I stop , that 's White 's . Two kids without clothes on satin ' with their feet in the spring tub . Says I , " Where 's your big brother ? " They just giggle . Thinks I , I might 's well find out , and I paound on the door . Nobody comes , Pa , Ma , or brother . Nobody on the whole place but them two naked young ones , and neither of them fully witted . Caows still in the stanchions at nine , stable so dirty you wanted stilts to walk through it . Next place I come to , that 's Beatty , you know , that moved in here from Maine way ten-twelve years ago . Never quite right in the head , shell-shocked in the war or something . His daughter 's come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I knock ten minutes before I start anybody , and then Beatty opens the door a crack and I see he 's got it chained inside , and he 's got a shotgun . I 'm abashed , but I tell him I 'm come to administer the freeman 's oath . He ai n't interested , not a mite . When I see ' twas n't any use standin ' there havin ' a stare-fight with him , I come away . Same way clear around that rud , clean through to the highway . ' Did you see Leila Pruett ? ' Andy asked . He knew that road ; his family 's old farm had been just off it , on Pickerel Pond . Be funny if I did n't , ' Parley said . Out drivin ' a tedder in a bathing suit . See her five miles away , like a red posy . ' He felt his thigh and lifted one side of his face in a grin . Old iron seat 'd be a mite hot , I sh 'd think . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunted in the parts box for the right sandwheel . She used to scare me to death , ' he said . She 'd meet everything that came down that road , never missed . Once I was bringing down a load of potatoes . ' He stopped , looking at John Mills and then at Parley Pugh to see if he was oversteppinghimself . They were listening . You know how she sails out into the road as if she was going to send you about your business and no nonsense ? And how she talks sometimes  --  half in poetry ? She stopped me in the road and looked in at the sacks of spuds and says , " What is in the sack , a lifeless form ? You will be left all forlorn . " Then she came around to the wheel and looked me right in the eyes , just like that , a foot away . She never has to hunt around for words , you know . They just bubble out of her . " The French will show no mercy , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says , " whole hillsides polluted with innocent blood ! ' He laughed a little lamely . I got so I 'd whip up old Baldy half a mile from there and go by like a runaway . ' Parley 's lip pulled up on one side in his devilish grin . He needed a shave and his denim cap was grease-stained . She 's a queer one , ' he said , but she ai n't any queerer than the rest on that rud . Seems if everybody up that way , his brains is all toggled up with baling wire . ' P191Old John said softly , talking to the shaped chair seat in his hands , I remember when Leila was a pretty little girl . Then she went down country and worked a while in a hospital for crippled children . Seemed like seeing all those game-legged little ones set her off , somehow . Folks said she did all sorts of wild things , tried to burn the hospitaldown , and turned in one of the doctors to the police , said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was right there was n't a nicer girl than Leila . ' Andy put the sandwheel on the chuck , ashamed that he had started this and appeared to make fun of Leila Pruett 's askew mind . Who was he to gossip ? His own family had lived on that road of defeated and queer farmers , and though neither of his parents had been raddledlike Mrs. Graham or gone and strange like Leila , his mother had married Branch Willard , as worthless a goodfor-nothingas the town had produced in two generations . And they had had that fire . Some people made one sort of shift and some made another against the stony acres and the mortgage and the loneliness and the endless labor without profit . His own mother needed a good word said for her , as surely as Leila Pruett did , and he knew , gratefully , that old John would have said it . He would say the best he could of anyone . There was a stamping on the porch , and James Mount put his head in . He never did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck his head around it first , as if he expected something to be thrown at him . First the tobacco-stained toothless grin would appear , and then the whole man , walking spryly , shaking his shoulders . ' Anybody workin ' in here ? ' he said . Not enough to hurt , ' old John said mildly . Come in , James . You look a mite wet . ' Only down to the hide , ' James said . He held his hands to the fire , and his merry little eyes touched Parley and Andy , letting them in on the joke . Takes a hard rain to wet me any deeper . ' Parley grunted . Ca n't get through that layer of hard-pan . ' Oh , there 's drainage , ' James said . There 's drainage . ' He kicked a nail keg closer to the fire and sat down , and the room was as it had been before , no more changed than if one more child had entered a full classroom . James was absorbed , and his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company key . Andy lost the thread of the talk , concentrating on the mechanical routineof smoothing the slats against the sandwheel , hypnotizinghimself with the hot angry sizzzzzz and the floatingpowdery dust . John Mills was mixing up a batch of glue , and its smell went through the room like another voice . The rain beat steadily on the roof . Finally Parley said , You wo n't be startin ' school after Labor Day this year , Andrew . ' Graduated last June , ' Andy said . The question took him off guard , and he kept his head down . Be workin ' out ? ' Soon as we 're through here I told Pliny Hall I 'd do some road work . ' Parley leaned to light a long shaving in the stove , got his pipe going , and teetered his keg back . Heard some talk about you goin ' daown country . ' I thought some of it , ' Andy said . I decided not to . ' His face was hot ; he did not want to talk about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the whole thing worse . Some business about college , wa' n't it ? ' ' E-yeah . ' Ai n't but one college person in the village , as I recall , ' Parley said , tipped back comfortably . Two , ' Andy said . Helen Barlow and Alex Thompson . But , .. '  |p193Never  saw that college made Alex any better , ' Parley said . Runs that turkey farm , might 've been postmaster if he 'd been willin ' to turn Democrat . Nawthin ' he could n't have done without college . Do n't see how he 's been helped at all , except he gets to play the head Wise Man at the Christmas pageant down to the school , with his head wrapped up in a velveteen cushion cover . ' He moved his gumboots gently , spreading around the halfdriedmud and water he had left on the floor . Head always was wrapped up in somethin ' , seems like . ' Well , ' Andy said , I was n't going , so ... Or Helen Barlow . Helen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought she was too good for the village boys after she went to college . Should have been raisin ' a family for the last four years . ' Mr. Mills ' voice , gentle as his face , said , Andy 's a smart boy , Parley . ' Tis n't as if he had all the education he could hold . ' Passed the high school , ai n't he ? ' Parley said . Speakin ' of education , ' James Mount said , summer folks gettin ' scarcer . Came across the square just now and did n't stumble over one . ' Parley rose and looked out the window . Standing , he exposed the long scar that ran down the side of his face and into his neck . A falling tree had caught him years ago and he had smiled off center ever since . His lip liftedas if a string were pulling it straight up . Too early in the day , ' he said . Give you till tonight you 'll be stumblin ' fine . ' He went out . Within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , his white eyebrows movingall over his face . Andy felt his entrance like an intrusion . Even James , thriftless as he was , fitted easily into the atmosphere of John 's shop , but Allan Richie brought something sharp and foreign.  | Get that box done , John ? ' he said . Right here . ' With his lobster-claw hands old John pulled out a clean pine chest from under the bench . A fresher smell of pine came out when he opened the lid to show it . Allan looked it over , reaching under his oilskinsto bring out a snap purse ten inches long . How much ? ' The old man hesitated . Well , the lumber cost about three and a half , and there 's the hardware . I should n't think I could take less than about five dollars . ' Pay him less than ten and you 're a bandit , ' James said from his keg . Allan 's face thrust in James 's direction and his eyebrows twitched . You the new manager ? ' Just been appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wondering if he should speak up . Then without having made up his mind whether he should or not , he heard himself saying , I kept a time-card on that job , Mr. Mills . You paid three-sixty for lumber and sixty cents for hardware and you put in four hours ' time . ' The embarrassed blood pounded up into his face , and knowing himself too brash for his years , he said to Allan Richie , He does n't ever figure his time is worth anything . I think he ought to figure it at a dollar an hour . ' Oh , you do , ' Allan said . He held a five-dollar bill between his fingers , his eyes as bright as a weasel 's . Goes up pretty fast , ' he said . Jumps five to eight like scat . ' Eight-twenty , if you figure it the way I did , ' Andy said , and got redder than ever . Ten , ' said James Mount . John Mills was smiling , shaking his head . Oh , now boys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little pine box . ' For a minute Allan looked at Andy and James alter-P195nately . Then he fished deep in the purse and got out a wad of one-dollar bills , smoothed off three , and laid them with the five in John 's hand . I 'm payin ' you eight , ' he said . You can take the twenty cents out of Andrew 's wages . ' He went to the door and looked out . Get all spattered up if I took it now , ' he said . Andrew , you can bring it home when you come , if ' tai n't rainin ' . ' ' All right , ' Andy said . John Mills was still protesting , but James tipped his keg over and the protests were lost as Allan went out into the drizzle . Thunderation , ' James said . Allan got a bargain , and he knows it . I can remember a lot of other bargains , too . Remember those wagons you and Henry used to make in your old carriage works ? Remember when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand just for the right kind of lumber to put in them wagons ? I saw one yesterday that was built in 1906 , and still solid . ' He stood looking at old John with his toothless mouth half open , his eyes squinting . Remember why you and Henry quit makin ' wagons ? ' There was n't any reason to any more , ' John said . Sears Roebuck would sell a good wagon for a hundred and forty dollars . ' Not a really good wagon , ' James said . There ai n't been any since you quit makin " em . I recall you 'd put a hundred and fifty dollars ' worth of lumber and iron into a wagon , and work three weeks makin ' it , and then you 'd sell it for two hundred dollars , apologizin ' all the time . Yon remember now why you quit makin ' wagons ? ' Mills smiled . I guess so , James . ' Best wagons in the world , ' James said , and you gave ' em away . What would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think ? '   I do n't know , ' the old man said . Folks 've said we made good . wagons . I guess we did . But what I 'm doing now , it do n't amount to enough to charge folks for . I just putteraround . ' He went into the house to put his bills away , and James sat on the keg shaking his head , grinning strangelyat Andy . There was three of ' em in this village once , ' he said . Old John and his brother Henry and old Cass Casswell . Any one of ' em could make you anything , and make it better'n you 'd get it anywheres else . And not a one had a kid 's notion how to charge for his work . ' Pushingback his hat , he exposed his gray disordered hair . Lacking teeth to chew tobacco properly , he tucked a wad of snuff into the pouch of his cheek and gummed it around . When I was your age , ' he said , I used to think old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do old John now . ' It came to Andy strangely , like something out of an old book . He had heard his mother talk about James when he was young , how everyone had thought he would be somebody . He could play any kind of musical instrument , just pick it up and in a week or so he could play anything on it . Then he got married while he was still in high school , and children kept piling up on him , and he could n't hold his farm , so that he had to hire out , skiddinglogs or working on the roads , and playing for dances in the Corners or the village . Somewhere , back in those years that were so alike and so telescoped , the talent he had started with had gone little by little , as his teeth had gone , and he sat there now a toothless and disreputable and drunken man , old at fifty . Here was another outcome of the choice Andy was making , another way he could end up . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ precision of John Mills ' , but he might lose his teeth and his talent fighting a losing fight , as James had . P197His uncle 's speckled eyes were unwaveringly on his face , and his hanging grin never changed . I guess you feel that way about old John , do n't you , kid ? ' You could n't help it , ' Andy said . No , ' James said . And do n't you never forget to . But ai n't one in a million can be like John . Probably could n't anybody be like him any more . Times change , and people with ' em . ' The old man came back from the house , smiling his vague sweet smile . John , ' James Mount said , if you was advisin ' a young man with brains , what would you say ? Get out and get a good schooling so 's he could do somethin ' , or hang around this village and try to keep it from fallin ' apart ? ' I take it you mean Andrew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else around here with either the brains or the chance to do anythin ' , ' James said , and winked at his nephew . But Andy was watching old John . In the old cabinet-maker was somehow concentrated everything that was best in the village , the integrity and the honesty and the kindness , the artisan 's skills and the artisan 's bone-deep satisfaction in his work . Peter Dow had once said to him that old John was a twelfth-century guild worker lost in the twentieth century . It was true , as James said , that there were no more like him ; perhaps the world had lost the knack of producing them . He listened for what the old man would say , because what he said would matter . I 'd go , Andrew , ' John said . There is n't much else we can teach you around here . You 'd stay the same size all your life . ' Speaking out of the confusion and the doubts that had eaten at him for weeks , out of the arguments of Peter Dow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dreams of knowledge and power and triumphs in the world where the monumental granite of Dryden showed between the noble elms , out of the fears and withdrawalsand shames , his memory of his sad , weak mother , his groping for security and stability and his itch for new things , Andy said , But Mr. Mills . . . Uncle James .. . what if I did n't make it ? What if I went down there and it was too much for me ? Would n't it be better if I 'd stayed right on here ? Or what if I stick it out down there and do get to be a doctor or something , I could n't live anywhere but around here , I know I could n't . I wake up in the nights sometimes just thinking about it , so homesick I ... ' He stopped , because there was no way of telling them the deeper reasons , the obscure intangible fear he had of losing himself . He did n't want to be like Helen Barlow , lost between two worlds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tangled and contradictory vision of the world that books had brought him . Somehow , at the center of that fear , he always managed to find the image of Mrs. Weld 's secretary . The whole prospect of going down to school was like that woman , like a basiliskthat he feared and despised but could not keep himself from looking at . I 'd go , ' John Mills said again . Is n't much of anything around here for a young fellow any more . ' He turned to the bench , snapped on the saw switch , and reached over a glued but unshaped chair seat . Andy moved to clear away the slats he had left on the bench . The old man bent to shift the pine box he had made for Allan Richie . He shoved it under the bench and straightenedup . A surprised , breathless grunt came out of his half-opened mouth . His face purpled with a rush of blood , his eyes bulged , his left hand stabbed down , groping for the bench , to steady himself . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a wet sound in his throat . BracedP199on one stiff arm , he leaned on the bench , his face and neck distended with dark blood . The hand on which he leaned slid six inches , caught , slid another inch or two . Andy shouted and leaped at the same instant , just as John Mills collapsed . The boy 's driving body met the slipping weight , and his desperately grabbing hand caught the old man 's wrist . He never could sort out afterward , from the swift and violent sensations of that instant , exactly what he remembered and what he simply inferred must have happened . But he knew that there was a moment of toppling effort to keep the dead weight of the old man 's body from driving him against the bench . He remembered , or supposed , a sensation as if a stiff charge of electricity had gone up his arm ; the echo of a scream , perhaps his own ; and then he was leaning , half supporting with his right arm the fallen body of Mr. Mills . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then he found his own left hand curled against his chest , its third and fourth fingers and the corner of the palm gone as neatly as a slice is taken from a loaf of bread . The motor was still humming softly , and there was still light on the singing line of the saw . James was at his side , helping to let the body of John Mills down to the floor . Andy let go with his right arm and stood up , tightening the fingers of his right hand around his left wrist . He felt no pain , but the furious pumping of blood from his hand made him light-headed and sick . Still holding his wrist tightly , he raised his foot and kicked the switch , quieting the deadly saw . His two fingers lay on the metal plate through which the saw pierced the bench , things as natural to see there as the feet of chickens cut off by the butcher . His uncle , kneeling by old John , had his eyes on Andy . His voice came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded , and James was gone . The boy sat down on a keg , his head down . The blood fell in quick drops now , not in streams , and formed a small puddle between his feet . While he sat there , hanging to his pale consciousnessby an effort of pure will , he thought for the first time how it had happened , and looked at John Mills . The old man lay with suffused face , breathing harshly and rapidly . His white hair was in a puddle of blood and sawdust . Andy looked at the blood soiling Mr. Mills ' hair , then at his own hand clenched around the maimed thing on his knees . He could n't let go without freeing that terrible pumping jet again , but he did n't like to see the thin white hair in the bloody sawdust . He stood up and put his shoe gently against the white head and tried to shove it over , but he could n't . He was sitting with his head down , his mutilated hand between his knees and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Florence Pugh came running with a clean-laundered sheet , a pillow , and a bucket of warm water . Parley was right behind her . He knelt by Andy . James is callin ' Stafford for the doctor . I du n no as there 's anythin ' we 'd dare do about that hand till he comes . ' Take a strip of sheet and tie it around his wrist , ' his wife said . And take him where he can lay down , poor boy . ' No , ' Andy said . No , thanks . I can hold it with my hand . ' It seemed to him that he was the calmest person there , that the thing to do was to sit quietly and eventually the proper help would come and he would be taken care of . He heard Parley arguing with his wife about something , and was vaguely irritated at their excitability , but he did not listen to what they said . The puddle of blood between his feet kept slipping away , receding so that he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a lake over a cliff . In the distance there was a vague , diffused roar like blasting , and he wondered stupidly if it came from theP201quarry at the Corners . Then he was aware of people around him , Marjorie Bentham and Mrs. Tait and two or three others . The roar came again , and he realized that it came from the slamming of the door as people entered . Somebody said , Had n't we better get them both into bed ? ' and somebody else said , He wo n't go , ' and several said at once , How did it happen ? Did anybody see it ? ' He heard Florence Pugh telling someone to get a strip of sheet tied around that poor boy 's wrist and get him lying down , he 'd fall off that keg in a faint , at least get him a chair ... . Sometime later the door blasted again , and the voices , far away and jumbled , said , Here he is ! Here 's the doctor . ' Andy fought off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit up straight as the doctor stooped beside him , and he heard the stammering voice of Arlene Knight : I cleaned off the bench , I thought you mmmmmm-m-m-ightwant it for an o-o-o-operating table . But his f-f-f-ingers were there , they 're right there now , maybe you can s-s-s-s-ew them back on . ' The doctor 's voice was rough as a file . Nothing to that notion . Let 's get him up here now . How you feeling , boy ? ' All right , ' Andy said , and stood up . He got his feet under him , but consciousness went out in a shower of darkness . From a great distance he heard someone say Easy , easy ! ' , and he put out his hands to catch himself . But his hands were tied . He fell twisting , trying to light on his shoulder , but never alighted . He thought , I could n't save him after all , he fell before I got to him , ' and still falling , still with his hands tied , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his own bed in the gable , his left hand an unfamiliar bandaged lump across his chest and Norma Pratt and Mrs. Barlow sitting by his bed . Well , now , ' Mrs. Barlow said encouragingly as he opened his eyes . Well , now , that 's better ! ' P202THEY HAD EATEN late and had walked for more than an hour up above the cemetery . Already , at the brink of September , there were premonitions of winter . They passed patches of bracken withered and brown as if fire had seared them . The only flowers they saw were closed gentians and a luxuriant late crop of fireweed in the cellar of a burned house . Let 's go back , ' Ruth said abruptly , and they turned and came back down the hill to the cemetery road , past the inn and through the crowded square and home . I think I 'll lie down a while , ' she said , and went up to the bedroom . Abe sat unhappily on his front steps , looking down the street , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags and children , start out on the road toward Stafford and the down-country . A day or two , and there would be nobody left . His mind , turning delicately to Ruth upstairs , tired , maybe sick , with this blight on her and her unhappiness growing with her dislike of the village , veered away because he knew that once the street became empty of cars and summer people it would be thirty times worse for her . In summer it was possible to feel that Westwick was part of the United States , an accessible part of the continent . People came in from Boston or New Haven or New York , the store handled Pepperidge Farm bread at thirty cents a loaf , the afternoon mail brought the TimesP203and the Tribune . But at the end of summer the whole fiction was exposed . After Labor Day the Times and Tribune would disappear from Bentham 's counter . Along the lake , the cottages , showing more and more as the leaves thinned , would turn black shuttered windows on the road . As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice-shanty down onto the shore opposite the island to have it ready for February and March . Within a week now one would rarely hear the words Boston and New Haven and Providence . Once the summerintrusion was over , people 's minds would venture no farther than Lancaster or Woodsville or Laconia . In the fall it was as if a large room were suddenly emptied of people , and those who were left hitched their chairs in a closer , more intimate , more self-sufficient circle around the fire . Then there would be no one to give her what she craved , books and music and talk . There would only be Pratt with his hairy peasant hands hanging down before him , and his sheeplike face and his closed peasant mind . There would only be Sam Boyce , skinny and miserly with words . There would only be a lot of people who , seen from her eyes , looked now as lumpish and taciturn as Neanderthal villagers might have been . Down in the square , Stephen Dow 's tall figure came out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and met him at the foot of the church drive . He felt blue and depressed , knowing that Mr. Dow was making a round of farewell calls . I do n't like to see you go , ' Abe said . Somehow this year it is different , with a wife who is n't well . I hate to see people leaving here . ' Cheer up , ' Mr. Dow said . It will only be a few months until half the people in Massachusetts and Connecticut are back up here crowding you off the road . '  |p204Abe  shrugged . ' I do n't know . It 's different this year . Spring is a long way off . I do n't know . ' Is Mrs. Kaplan around ? ' Mr. Dow said . I 'd like to say good-bye to her . ' She is lying down . She does n't feel so well . Maybe it is better if you do n't . Things like that depress her . ' Give her my best then , ' Mr. Dow said . He shook Abe 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her we all hope she feels better soon . ' He put a hand on Abe 's shoulder . Good-bye , ' he said . We 'll see you in June . Take care of yourselves . ' Yes , ' Abe said . Well , good-bye . ' He stood at the foot of the drive and watched Mr. Dow climb slowly upward . At the top , where the road curved out onto the level , the old man stopped and waved once , and then he went out of sight . Abe looked at his watch. , It was almost six . Wincing a little , he went inside and climbed the stairs into the bedroom . Ruth was lying with her face to the wall . How is it ? ' he said . Are you feeling all right , eh ? ' An indistinguishable sound came from the pillow . What ? ' Abe said anxiously , and bent over her . I 'm all right ! ' she said , so sharply that he straightened up . He rubbed his neck , staring at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snack before we go to the concert . ' Ruth rolled over on her back . She did not look at Abe , but lay watching the roof . I do n't know whether I want to go or not . ' Ah , now , ' he said . You miss this Moussorgsky busi-ness ? ' It 'll be cold . ' Since when have you started caring whether it was cold or not ? It has been cold other nights . This is the last concert , you would n't want to miss it . ' P205'I could miss it easy as pie , ' Ruth said wearily . He sat down on the edge of the bed , intent on kidding her out of this , but she turned to the wall again . Say now , listen , ' he said . You are n't sick any more , you are getting well . This is the way a sick woman acts . ' It 's the way I act , ' she said . Abe sighed . For a while he sat wondering how he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transition the train of his thought turned to how long September was after the summer people went , and how October lingered and smoldered and burned away through Indian summer and into the November rains . How November was endless gray wet days whipped by the wind out of Canada , with storms that tightened abruptly into snow , and with long periods of soggy thaw . December , too , snow and white woods and blocked roads , and around Christmas always the rain again , the moist warm air of delusive thaw before the world hardened into January and winter began in earnest . Two feet , three feet , four feet of snow , until the drifts pushed back by the plows were eight-foot banks on either side of the roads . Then the cold , unrelaxing , sometimes with bitter wind and sometimes deep and still and burning in the lungs , when thermometers hit thirty and thirty-five and forty below and every chimney in town wore a straight feather of white woodsmoke . It was a long way to think ahead , clear up to those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woods , the sap began to run in the maples and the farmers waded waist-deep with their sap buckets and the fires burned all night in draughty sugarhouses . In April , finally , you could smell spring coming , in spite of the snow . You could feel it coming like a promise of wonder , until you went wild with it as dogs and children do , and once you sniffed that promise on the wet wind you could stand any delay or setback , because you knew that the season was coming on into mudtime , and that mudtime would open into summer for three brief months again . But it was a long time to wait , until April . Eight months . He sat on the bed in the house he had built against those months of winter and could think of nothing to say . Ruth said it . Abe , ' she said , rolling over to face him , why ca n't we go away for the winter ? ' When he heard it , he knew he had been expecting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and especially since the disappointment about the records , he had known it must come . It did not shock or dismay him ; it merely saddened him , because he felt that somehow he had failed . To stay through the winter , to stay all the rest of their lives in the good new house , had been such an idea once . I do n't see how , ' he said . How much money have we got ? ' Not much . Not enough to go away . ' Have n't we got enough to get us south , maybe to Florida ? You said you made your expenses the winter you went down there . ' For one person only , ' he said . And then I did n't have payments on a house . ' Well , New York then , ' she said . That would be better yet . I could get my old job back , and you could get a job too . You 're a good tailor , there 'd be dozens of jobs you could get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said after a pause . That was what sent me up here with tuberculosis . ' Ruth rolled over again , and for several minutes Abe sat looking out the window . Finally he said , You ca n't stand it here , is that it ? ' I hate it . I 'd die , Abe . I really would . ' He sighed and rose . Well , we can think about it . But I think now we should go to the concert . You think youp207do n't care , but I have seen you when music comes on . You feel better right away . ' All right , ' she said apathetically , and sat up , feeling for hairpins . I remember that first time , ' he said . You remember ? That was the Tchaikowsky thing , the Pathetique . ' Her eyes were large and dark and sober , her mouth like the mouth of a child who has been crying a long time . Lord , ' she said , that seems like ten years ago . ' Late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greenish twilight . It was a plain room , almost bare . The flowers on the bedtable next to the mounded shape of the old man under the quilt were like flowers at the head of a grave . Stephen Dow was thinking that they might as well be at the head of a grave . From where he sat , old John 's face looked gentle and peaceful , but from the other side , he knew , it was twisted in a fixed grimace , and all up and down that side , foot and leg and shoulder and gnarled skillful hand , John Mills was dead . Mr. Dow sighed . One trouble with being a historian was that you got into the habit of thinking in centuries , of leaping decades as a child would pass a summer day . And then one day your own life came and touched you on the shoulder , telling you that time was not forever . His own hair was as white as the hair of old John , and if his face was still straight and his right side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very late in the afternoon . Mr. Dow stood up and reached his hat from the dresser , noticing in the watery dusk the simple clean lines of the piece . It was one of old John 's making , and love as much as linseed oil and rubbing had given the cherry wood its finish . Good-bye , John , ' Mr. Dow said , and let himself out . P208As he passed through the kitchen Mrs. Pugh stood up . Is he all right ? ' He 's all right , ' Mr. Dow said . When he stood outside it was nearly time for Henry Ball to come through with the Sunday papers . There was an inordinate Labor Day week-end jam in the square , twenty or thirty cars and two dozen people crowding the little crossroads . It was a good deal different from the time , forty or more years ago , when he had come through in a one-horse buggy searching out places both beautiful and isolated for summer retreats . Since then Westwick had had to learn to deal with every sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people like Mrs. Sophus Weld . That was the trouble , he thought ruefully , about trying to take refuge in simplicity . The lovers of the simple were too inevitably complex . The place had changed ; something fine had gone out of it , or was going . Something that had been peculiarly and wonderfully native lay now like old John Mills with half its face pulled into a stiff grimace and one side gone dead . Looking out into the square full of the invaders and contemplatinghow the whole life of the village had altered so that now it existed mainly to supply the campers , and lived only during the summer months , Mr. Dow felt a twinge of guilt . He had been the very first , and his responsibilitywas that much greater . If he had not been able to believe that out of the confusion of two ways of life there would come not only destruction but some survival , and not only survival but perhaps eventual enrichment , he would have gone away from John Mills 's door feeling that his last visit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had other visits to make , bills to settle , books to return , before he went down for the winter . He dropped two books through the slot in the locked door of the library ,  |p209went  past the post office to mail some letters , worked his way out of the crowd and up the street , where he met Abe Kaplan and talked with him for a minute or two . Abe 's air of sad patience was like the autumnal feeling that Mr. Dow had had ever since his visit to John Mills , and he climbed the hill slowly , ruminating on decay and change . His legs were tired from the climb , and he felt the remoteness of being seventy-two as he mounted the Barlow porch . Only an impulse had turned him up the hill . He had no particular reason to call on the Barlows , except that the obscure notion of doing penance before all the village lingered in his mind . Something was passing ; he might as well say good-bye to all of it . He knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he saw Mrs. Barlow reach quickly to the sink and take her teeth out of a cup there . She came across the kitchen wiping her hands on her apron , smiling her teeth into place . She was a woman whom Mr. Dow had known for forty years , and who had never been anything very real to him . There had never been any cause to dislike her or to like her ; nothing could be said against her habits or her housekeeping , and she even maintained a kind of social superiority in the village on the strength of George Barlow 's three rented farms . Yet she seemed to him somehowlarge and doughy as a personality , as if she could assume any shape she was punched into , and would assume it without complaint other than a few yeasty sighs . Good evening , ' he said as the door opened . He stepped in and shook her moist hand . She was flustered . Oh , Mr. Dow , ' she said . Come in . My goodness , I in such a mess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful , ' Mr. Dow said . He sniffed at the rich sharp smell that cut back through decades , as much a part of New Hampshire for him as the delicate uncoiling of roadside ferns in mudtime , or the worms of sawdust that a crosscut chewed out of a maple log . He had smelled piccalilli in dozens of farm and village kitchens , and he knew the look of windowsills where green tomatoes sat at the end of summer , hopefully exposed to the daytime sun . They had always had trouble ripening tomatoes in this part of the state , and had always had to save them in relish . But they always tried to ripen them anyway , even artificially . He hung his hat on the back of a chair and went into the dining room . George Barlow shaved only once a week , and Mr. Dow was a little startled to see his face without the grizzly bristles that usually covered it . It was a sagging , secretive , petulant , pouty face , full of invalid irritabilities . The eyes reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a flashlight beam , eyes that stared glassily and yet seemed constantly to swim in every direction at once , looking for an escape . Well , George , ' Mr. Dow said , and shook Barlow 's hand . Almost ready for another winter ? ' The shaven , unfairly-exposed lips said the proper thing , but the eyes still looked furtive and trapped . ' Winter do n't make no difference to me , long as I can get somebody to put me up a woodpile , ' Barlow said , and flattened the paper in his lap . Mrs. Barlow brought a straight chair . Set down , Mr. Dow . I 'll just have to run and keep my eye on that kettle for a minute . ' I can only stay a second , ' Mr. Dow said . Just a round of good-bye calls before I go down . I 've just been down seeing John Mills . ' The furtive little eyes jumped and wavered . Tell me he 's paralyzed all daown one side . ' It 's too bad , ' Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some folks figure he 's a mite soft-headed , ' Barlow said . Would n't hurt a fly , though . ' It occurred to Stephen Dow that he did n't like dis-P211cussing old John with this invalid , and it seemed to him a kind of outrage that John should finally be brought down by the same slow sclerosis that had held Barlow in his chair for four years . Looking at Barlow 's exposed face and at his eyes that hid something , he was reminded of the daughter , Helen . There was something of the same look in her face when she talked to you , as if behind her desperately-smiling mask she was crouched down hoping no one saw her . Helen down at the post office ? ' he said . Eh ? ' The paper rattled in the invalid 's lap , and his heels shifted rapidly , in a curious tattoo , against the footstool . His attempt to hide whatever thought had frightenedhim was almost ghastly , and Mr. Dow found himself thinking , the man should grow a real beard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hide that mouth . Helen 's upstairs lying down , ' Mrs. Barlow said . She ai n't been well at all last few days . But she 'd like to say hello , I know . I 'll call her , just a minute . ' Oh , do n't bother her , ' the old man said . If she is n't well , let her rest . All I wanted was to wish her luck with the school . ' She 'd want to say good-bye to you , ' Mrs. Barlow said . With the big pewter stirring spoon in her hand she went to the stair door and called . A voice answered faintly , through a couple of doors , from up above . Mr. Dow 's down here , ' Mrs. Barlow said . Come on down and say hello , do . ' Helen 's voice said something else , but Mrs. Barlow paid no attention . She moved away from the stair and said , She 's deserved the village school a long time , but up to now she could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take any of those . George and me made sacrifices to send her to Durham . She did real well there . '   I 'm sure she did , ' Mr. Dow said . He would have liked to say his good-byes and go , but in uncertainty whether the girl was or was not coming down , he lingered . George Barlow 's hands rustled like mice in the newspaper . An uncomfortable silence fell on the three , as if there was nothing whatever to talk about . Mrs. Barlow moved to the stair door again and called . Helen , are you coming down ? Mr. Dow 'll think you do n't care whether he calls or not . ' I 'm coming , ' the light hurried voice said , and in a moment there were feet on the stairs . The girl appeared in the stairway , smiling at the room as if a light were glaring in her eyes . Mr. Dow made the note that she was really quite pretty in a frail sort of way , but that she was certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dow , ' she said . I 'm sorry I was slow getting down . ' Not at all , ' he said . ' I 'm sorry you have n't been feeling well . ' It is n't anything . I 've just been . . . sort of . . . upset . ' She gave him the strained smile again , and he found himselfwondering if she really was agitated and trying to act calmly or if she was putting on an obviously brave front about nothing . Ca n't be anything serious , ' he said playfully . You look almost as tanned and healthy as your friend from out on the island . ' The girl 's eyes were suddenly immense and startled , and every line in her face tightened . She looked as if she had been hit by a sudden pain . Possibly she had , Mr. Dow thought . One thing you learned was that reading people 's faces was an extremely dubious pastime . So often you found that the guilty look you detected in your neighbor'seye was nothing more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking . P213That 's an amazing girl . Is it true she rode a bicycle clear over to Mount Washington and back in an after-noon ? ' I . . . think so . ' And has she really swum all the way across the lake and back out beyond the island ? ' I ... guess so , ' Helen said . She 's very good at sports . ' She has n't quite got you riding a hundred miles in an afternoon , or swimming three miles , has she ? ' As if with enormous effort , the girl 's unwilling face lifted . Her head shook , the lips made the difficult smile . No , ' she said . I 've seen you with her a good deal , ' he said , but I had n't ever thought of you as the New Woman in quite that way . ' It was then that the absolute terror in the girl 's face finally made itself clear . She was not simply suffering from pain or nausea . She was frightened to death , and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmistakably into her eyes . Very carefully , cursing his own stupidity , he acknowledged the suspicion and put it aside . He did not want to pry . Well , ' he said , and smiled at her , wanting to thaw that frozen terrified look . So now it 's almost Labor Day , and there 'll be no more swimming and bicycling for a long while . We can all put the summer away in mothballs . You 're about ready for school , I imagine . ' The strained mask did not relax . I guess , ' she half whispered . Good luck with it , ' he said , still trying to reassure her , and took her hand . The village is lucky . ' Her eyes searched his face , and she smiled as if smiling were anguish . Her hand was clammy and apparently without bones . With his hat in his hand , Mr. Dow stood in the kitchenP214talking to Mrs. Barlow for a moment . When he leaned into the dining room again to say a last good-bye , Helen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting bolt upright in his chair , almost supporting himself on his hands , glaring after her , his face convulsed as if at some tremendous physical effort , and his mouth working . " Night , George , ' Mr. Dow said . The paralytic jumped and jerked around , at the same time letting himself go so that he slid down in the chair . The chairback bent his head forward , pressing his chin into his chest . Be seein ' you , Mr. Dow , ' he said , and his cheeks twitched . Stephen Dow took hold of the doorknob . On the windowsillbeside the door was a row of green tomatoes . He touched one with his fingers . It was almost rock-hard . Good night , ' he said softly , and let himself out . It was quite dark when the last amplified raspings of the turntable ground into silence . Glimmers of light shook along the water to show the abrupt side of a boat , the roundness of a canoe , and dark shapes began to move off over the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showing people clambering down from the bleachers , moving in toward the path , walking among the balloony shapes of the pruned cedars in the new lakesidepark . Ruth held the flashlight on the bow while Abe pulled on the braided clothesline anchor rope . The line swayed and stretched oblique and white in the green water , and the boat moved under them , going to meet the anchor , until the line straightened and hung heavy and the big angular rock rose out of the depths and was pulled dripping inboard . Well , ' Abe said , scrambling onto the rowing thwart . How was it ? Pretty good ? ' It was all right . It was fine . ' P215They rowed away , leaving the lighted boathouses like Venetian houses at the end of a canal , and Abe said , Try the light up ahead sometimes . There 's a big rock here that comes out at low water . ' She blinked the flash three times , letting it finger the wind-roughed surface . There it is , off to the left , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abe rowed steadily , putting muscle behind the oars , but by the time they cleared the point and felt the fresh breeze from the open lake the lighter canoes and kayaks and sailboats were all gone in the dark . There was not a star showing ; only in the west a little watery - light was left on the sky from the sunset . In the boat it was difficult to see from one thwart to the next . Do n't work so hard , Abe , ' Ruth said . What 's the hurry ? ' ' I thought maybe you are cold . ' I 'm all right . ' You want to take a row , maybe ? ' . All right. ! ' Now you are talking , ' he said . Now you are making sense . ' He swung away from the white-bouldered , darkrootedisland that Ruth was following with her flashlight , and turned out into midlake . In the dense moving darknessthe breeze freshened ; there was a chop under the bow . In the stern Ruth was silent , her flashlight dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is like that first night , eh ? That was a black one too . ' It 's windier tonight , ' she said . That night it was perfectlystill . ' Yes , ' he said . I guess it is windier . ' Some time later , drifting with trailing oars , they swung around slowly before the wind and saw down the lake the sparse lights of the village appearing and disappear-. , , Ammnmm1 ing through the wind-moved shore trees . Around the whole periphery of shore were cottage lights like low stars . The sky was lighter than the shore , but not light enough now , even in the west , to pick up a glimmer from the water or show an object in the boat more than a few feet away . I wish there was some way , Ruth , ' Abe said . He waited for an answer , but she said nothing . In the almost-absolute dark , between dark water and dark sky , between village lights and cottage lights , they swung as if suspended , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not built the house , ' he said awkwardly . ' I am the one to blame for that . I thought it would be better than a wedding trip . That was a bad mistake . ' Do n't feel bad about it , ' she said . You 're not to blame for anything . I 'm sorry I said anything . It 'll be all right . ' But you do n't feel at home , ' he said . You feel lonesomeand shut out . ' Maybe we can do something about the radio , put on an aerial or something . The Philharmonic broadcasts will be starting , and there 's the opera on Saturday . ' Say , that 's an idea , ' Abe said . I will get Anson , he is an electrical fellow . He will put us up an aerial that will shut out that Pratt sermon-static . ' Sure , ' she said , comforting him . That 's all it needs , probably . ' And there is this business of records . When we get home we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a phonograph , a little one , will cost . ' ' Surre , ' her disembodied voice said . They drifted on little rocking waves before the wind toward the distant village . The wind was fresh , with just an edge of chill in it , but it was not really cold . Over an hour later they were still drifting . Ruth hadn'tP217said anything for a long time , but Abe had a feeling that she liked this , that it would be a mistake to say anything or try to plan anything or cheer her up . Sometimes she got frightened of the quiet and the dark , but this was a good healing quiet , and there was no fear in this dark . The windows of the village were folded into the blacknessby now , and there was no sign of light or life along the impenetrable wall of black where the dock should be . Once , a few minutes back , he had thought he heard the rattle of oars , but now he heard nothing except the chuckle of water under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fitful that it might have been imaginary like the rowing noises , of wind in the shore trees . He was about to lean forward and ask Ruth for the flashlight so that he could locate the dock when the other sound came : the hard , near clatter of loose oars , the little fluty sound as if someone had sucked in his breath suddenly , and the wallowing splash . It was very near , perfectly distinct and quite loud , and it shocked Abe so that he fell on his knees in the boat , groping frantically . The light ! ' he said . Give me the flashlight ! ' The smooth barrel touched his wrist and fell . He grabbed it up , fought the switch button for a moment , snapped it on backwards so that the hot light blazed in his own eyes , reversed it and shot the beam out over the lake . In his momentary dazzlement he could see at first only the wrinkled water . Then the swinging light brought out , staring white , the shape of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rowlock by its worn leather collar . There was no one in the boat . Abe shouted . The noise left his lips and winged away like a rock thrown to arouse the village . Ruth shouted too , and he had a momentary glimpse of her scared face as he slid into the rowing thwart . While he rowed , she flashed the light on the empty boat , and they both watched for any sign of life near it . There was none . Abe shouted again , and as they swung up beside the empty boat he leaped up , rocking their own boat wildly , and let the anchor rock down . The rope hissed through his hands and then went slack with ten feet to spare . Hang onto this , tie it up ! ' he said to Ruth , and struggled out of his coat . Ruth was crying , Abe , what are you going to do ? Abe , you ca n't swim very well . Do n't jump in , Abe , please ! ' Tie up that other boat too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He crawled up in the bow and let himself over the side . The water grabbed his legs with chilling cold , stopping his breath and plastering his pants to his legs . Turn the light straight down in the water , ' he said to Ruth . Keep it there . I will be all right . I can hang onto the anchor rope if I get tired . ' He put his face in the water , took it out to take a deep breath , and dove under , kicking and swimming and pulling his way down , his eyes glaring around into the murky darkness for a sign of something , anything , and the pressure closing in around him terrifyinglyas he fought his way down . Andy was in bed when he heard the furious iron clangorof the firebell . He swung his feet out of bed and went to the window , gritting his teeth at the instant swelling pain that throbbed up from his injured hand . Holding the hand close against his chest , he stared out into the street . Down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers on over his long underwear . The lights of a car backing to swing into the street picked him out sharply and then left him . The fire truck rolled out of the firehouse , bumped into the street with DonaldP219Swain running to grab the endgate and Herbert Pratt picking it up from the other side on the run , and roared into the square . Because of the intervening houses Andy could n't see where it went , but he heard it slow as if turning , and then roar again . Norma Pratt ran down the street and grabbed the rope of the now-silent firebell and yanked at it . In the high single light at the peak of the firehouse gable Andy saw the shadowy bell swing in its iron frame , and heard the wild iron outcry begin again . Harold Swett ran down the outside stairway and disappeared down the street at a hard run . Downstairs the door slammed , and Andy knew that Mr. Richie was on his way . The lights flashed up on the inn 's porches . Clumsily , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his crippling , Andy got into pants and socks and shoes . He had never realized until the accident how many things a man did left-handed  --  like button his pants , for instance . Right-handed , the buttons were backwards , the buttonholes elusive , everything so clumsy and slow that he broke into a sweat . He hurt himself again getting a sweater over his right arm and buttoned down across his sling , and he was still fumbling awkwardly at the last sweater buttons as he went downstairs and outside . He could not run without starting the pounding pain , and so he was alone when he reached the street . From over toward the dock he heard the noise of shouting , and saw a glow on the low clouds . As he turned into the dock road he saw many headlights , and figures black against them , and the running shapes of men , women , and children . But he saw no fire . He walked along the rutted road holding himself back from running . The firebell stopped , and in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could see that the crowd was concentrated on the dock , and out on the lake were moving lights . It was no fire , then , but an accident or a drowning . Cars were backing and jockeying at the end of the dock as Donald Swain maneuvered them into a half circle so that their headlights would focus on the boats that moved like light-trapped insects a hundred and fifty yards out in the water . In the center of the semicircle of lights was the firetruck , its spotlight glaring out over the heads of the crowd . The firetruck 's motor was talking quietly to itself . Andy moved up close to where Donald straddled the hood , shouting directions . The crowd shifted and moved restlessly . There was shouting from out at the boats , and a dozen people shushed the crowd , but when the feet and voices were still the shouting had died . Donald stood on the hood holding onto the top of the cab and peering out into the web of lightbeams . On the other side Allan Richie cocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . Somebody drown ? Who ? ' Donald continued to stare out over the lake . I do n't know , Allan . ' Who started all this fire alarm ? ' I did . We were over at Martin 's , and just as we were startin ' home we heard yellin ' and screamin ' down here . Martin and John La Pere run down , and I grabbed the bell rope . ' What 're they doin ' out there ? ' I do n't know , ' Donald . said . They took grapnels . ' How do they know where to drag ? ' I do n't know . ' Seems like a funny time of night for a boatride , ' Allan said . Suppose it was some camper kids spoonin ' ? ' If I knew I could tell you , ' Donald said . There was two boats out there . ' Two ! ' Allan said . He disappeared into the jam on theP221dock again , and Donald shouted at the crowd , Keep off to the side . Stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Four boys , all summer folks , pounded up the road and onto the hollow planks . What 's happened ? ' they said . They pushed to the edge of the watching crowd , standing on tiptoe and asking questions of everybody around them . Let 's get a boat and go out there , ' one said . Eaton 's , ' said another . ' It was still out this afternoon . ' You better stay out of their road , ' Donald said . They 'll holler if they need more boats . ' The four looked blankly up for a moment . Then one broke , and in a moment they were all off up the shore . A ring of canoes and skiffs was already beginning to form around the two white rowboats and the two green ones that moved misty and light-netted just beyond clear visibility . Somebody shouted , and while the dock buzzed a rowboat came in from the outer ring and moved up close to one of the green boats . Andy looked up . Can you see what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody in the boat , ' Donaldsaid . Dang if it does n't . ' He reached down a hand , and Andy took it and climbed the fender to the hood . The ring of boats did not appear to move ; their flashlightsand lanterns were like the eyes of watching foxes . Then a boat pulled from the central cluster , fuzzy and melting in the almost-dissipated light , and the word startedaround , They 're bringin ' somebody in ! They must have got him , whoever it was . They 're comin ' in with him ! ' They 're still grappling , ' somebody else said . Look , they 're starting back and forth again . They ca n't have found anybody . ' Or else there was more than one , ' the crowd voice said . There was two boats . ' Get blankets ready ! ' some woman said . But the crowd   voice said , They 'd be dead , it 's been thirty-forty minutes since the alarm first went out . ' Well , get blankets anyway , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that boat is all huddled up ! ' As the boat came down the lightpath and individual figures could be easily picked out , Donald said , That 's Raoul La Pere rowin ' . Ca n't see who he 's got with him . ' One 's a woman , ' Andy said . He could see the light dress and the bare arms . The word went around the crowd . One 's a woman , no coat on . Must have been neckers . Can you see who ? Who 's the other one ? ' Two women came running with robes from automobiles . They stood ready at the dock as Raoul La Pere angled in . Flashlights jumped on the occupants of the boat . One was a woman , sure enough . The other was all huddled up in the stern with a coat around him , and as a more powerful spot touched his hair they could see it was tangled and wet . It 's somebody they got out , all right . He 's alive , too . Get those blankets ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Andy said to Donald , it 's the Kaplans . ' They stood up in the boat , wobbling , and a dozen hands reached down to help them onto the dock . In the shifting light of the torches Abe 's face was blue . His hair was pasted to his big domed head , and his eyes glared and his teeth chattered . Ruth clung to his arm , and the voices beat at them , What happened , Abe ? Anybody else out there ? Was it you that yelled ? What are they still doing out there ? ' The women threw blankets over Abe 's whole head and shoulders , leading him up the dock . Ruth was trying to answer questions and at the same time get Abe loose . He did n't fall in , it was somebody else . We were coming in and heard a big splash . Abe tried to rescue them , but he ca n't swim very well ... was hanging onto the anchorP223rope , we let that down right by the boat , so we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hood clinging with his good hand to the top of the cab , watching the seethe of heads and bodies below him , straining his eyes out into the diffused light-beams , Andy had a sense of unreality so strong that for a moment he was positive this whole clamor of bells and stabs of ineffective glaring light and weave of crowdfiguresand mutter of the crowd-voice was a confused dream , and the people who milled below him were the heterogeneous scourings of a consciousness unwilling to woo sleep . They stood on the dock in ignorance , asking questions of people as ignorant as themselves , and somebody was drowned but no one knew who , or even , really definitely , if . Out on the water other men dragged the lake bottom for something they were afraid to find . Someonewas dead , but who ? said the voice which spoke over and through this dream . Someone had left in the darkness and was not yet missed , but only searched for . The crowd was shifting , buzzing . The whole group moved up and down , floating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dock . Andy looked down over them and saw the blonde woman shouldering her way through the press . Her open shirt collar looked dazzlingly white between her brown throat and the blue blazer she wore . She came close to the fender , looking restlessly around . Her eyes noted Andy above her , and dismissed him . She stood on tiptoe , hunting for someone in the crowd , impatient and arrogant , a frown between her eyes . Andy watched her . The two remaining fingers of his left hand , poking through the bulky mass of bandage , were going numb in the night air , and with his eyes on Flo Barnes he massaged them back to life with his right . Then he saw Flo 's head twist around , and he realized that the talk , the hum , the scuffling , the confusion of sound and movement , had stopped . He could distinctly hear the voices of the men out in the boats . It was as quiet as if they were all grouped around Weld 's dock waiting for a concert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women were helping Abe Kaplan into a car . Everyone was looking back that way ; even the efficient figure of Florence Pugh , glorified in the past few days by more first-aid work than had been necessary in years before , stopped half-bent at the waist after closing the door on Abe , and stared incredulously at the end of the dock , where the parked cars made a semicircle of fierce footlights round a patch of trampled and almost bare ground . George Barlow , the paralytic , stood there . He held a blanket bathrobe clenched shut against his chest , and his clean-shaven face was like a dead man 's . As they watched , he took three tottering steps forward , leaning and dragging his slippered feet . Where is she ? ' he said . His voice was hoarse , hardly more than a croak . In the silence that followed his words Andy heard the wind swoop and sigh in the trees further up the shore . She 's done it ! ' the croaking voice said . I knew she 'd do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonight ! ' There was a sound like a hiccough from below . The boy looked down . Flo Barnes had one fist against her mouth . It looked as if she were biting the knuckles . In the light raveling off from the hot beam of the spot he saw the sweat come up on her forehead as if she had been spattered with water.  |p225NINE  o'clock on a September morning . The kind of day , Laura Bentham was thinking , when you never could tell what it would do . If you went out without a wrap of some kind , it would be sure to rain , and if you got all done up in a raincoat and rubbers it would blow off clear and be sunshiny as you please . She got into her raincoat in order to tempt the sun , picked up the baskets by their heavy twisted handles and leaning against the weight went down the stairs and through the back room and into the store . There was no one around except her husband , showing work gloves to Howard Pembrook . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pembrook 's shoulder . She lifted the baskets , pointing up in the direction of the church . Martin nodded , and she went out . As she stepped down from the sidewalk the sun swam out of a cloud and sent her long shadow back almost to the creamery . A tall thin woman on an errand , the shadow followed her across the square past the corner of the inn , carrying its elongatedbaskets on its arms . It went up the street with the real woman walking in its tracks . When the real woman turned up the church drive the shadow woman turned too , and together they climbed the hill and walked past manse and church . But when Mrs. Bentham started in the driveway of the Barlow place the cloud had moved across the sun again and she went the last fifty feet alone.
