Beatrice d'Este was 16 when the future Duke of Milan married her ( in 1491 ) , and probably not much older when Leonardo da Vinci painted her portrait for the Duke , his patron . Innocent , fresh and direct , the portrait was like a summing up of everything that the complex , secretive , worldly-wise Old Master himself was not . It made a highlight in the comprehensive show of Leonardo and his circle at Los Angeles County Museum last week . <P> Of the 72 paintings on exhibition , only four were attributed directly to Leonardo . The rest , wavering between chill sentimentality and brown gloom , either anticipated or copied the Master 's favorite tricks : chiaroscuro ( strong contrasts of mingled light and shadow ) , sfumato ( blurring of outlines to suggest space ) , geometrically involved compositions and ambiguous half-smiles . <P> Along with the paintings were nine examples of Leonardo 's unsurpassed draftsmanship and 66 models of his scientific inventions , ranging from ten-barreled machine guns and rocket-shaped projectiles to automatic roasting spits and a slave-powered air-conditioning unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast chiaroscuro of Leonardo 's mind , scores of the horrors and wonders of 20th Century science had hatched and died .
