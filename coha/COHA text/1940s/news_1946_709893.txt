Conciliator Explores Peace Chances By LAWRENCE RESNER Swift restocking of barren retail food shelves was promised yesterday as contract haulers for 500 stores of the Great Atlantic &; Pacific Tea Company and 125 outlets of the Gristede chain signed settlements with striking teamsters . Within a matter of hours after the settlements had been announced , trucks were rolling between the warehouses and the stores with heavy work schedules ordered to hasten the task of placing supplies back on a normal basis . William M. Byrnes , president of the eastern division of the A. &; P. , announced that all of the company 's stores in New York City , Westchester , Long Island and southern Connecticut would reopen Tuesday morning . Gristede 's stores had been open all along but had run short on many items . 31-Cent Hourly Pay Rise Officials of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters said both the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hourly wage increase , the fortyhour week , a guarantee of four hours ' work at the overtime rate to men called in on Saturday , a week 's vacation after 125 days of work and two weeks after 175 days . These conditions are identical with those granted earlier in the strike by the Bohack grocery stores establishing the pattern on which all settlements in the general trucking strike have since been made . John E. Strong , president of Local 807 , which hauls for the A. &; P. , said a meeting of the 600 A. &; P. drivers at Beethoven Hall yesterday had approved some minor modifications of the union position but not of the principal issues . He declined to specify what they were , explaining they were // " important to the drivers but not to the general public . " While the store settlements were expected to have an important bearing on the attitude of the Safeway stores , which are still closed , there was no indication last night that any further break was imminent in the ranks of the big operators who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; P .. who emp ! oy 600 members of Local 807 , were , however , said to represent the largest single group that had remained in the holdout ranks . Companies Still Resist Joseph M. Adelizzi , chairman of the employers ' - negotiating committee , emphasized the determination of the trucking companies to continue their resistance to any Bohack formula settlement , and said that regular truckers , unlike the grocery chains , could not absorb the increased costs . Exploratory conferences with both management and union representatives were carried on by Lucien F. Rye , Federal conciliator , who was assigned to the dispute Thursday . He visited both Mr. Strong and Mr. Adelizzi yesterday and scheduled a further meeting at 8 A. M. today with the union leader . The general trucking strike , which took effect officially at midnight , Aug. 31 , but because of the Labor Day holiday had no actual effect until Sept. 2 , had forced the A. &; P. stores to suspend business on Saturday , Sept. 14 . During that period the chain continued to pay its 8,000 full-time employes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the strike had cost the A. and P. $5,000,000 , of which $2,000,000 represented wages paid out . In sharp contrast to the bare shelves in the A. &; P. retail stores , three of the chain 's warehouses in the Bronx , Brooklyn and Maspeth , Queens , were reported bulging with $12,000,000 worth of supplies which will soon be placed on the retail market . No Statement by Safeway Safeway stores , one of A. &; P. 's biggest competitors , which was also forced to close , had no statement yesterday concerning the possibility of making a similar settlement . Safeway , which deals with Local 641 in Jersey City , had earlier adopted a policy of accepting whatever was the final settlement in the New York dispute . Its situation was complicated by a walkout of its , wiiehousemen , who also demanded the 31-cent hourly increase . Rejecting the suggestion that the food stores settlements would Dave an important bearing on the eneral trucking situatibn , Mr. Adelizzi declared : " The A. &; P. and Gristede are private carriers whose trucking is but incidental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not lessen the prohibitive nature of the union demands . The stake of the ' for hire ' carrier is. , far greater because his entire business is trucking and labor comprises the largest item in his operating cost . " He said the operators he represented would not go back to work until a settlement with some " economic justification ' had been offered . Harris J. Klein , attorney for 102 trucking companies , whose telegram to President Truman brought Mr. Rye here from Washington , said he wanted to correct " a false impression in the news to the effect that the Federal Government has refused to seize the industry . " He declared this remained a definite possibility and said it was conceivable that the Government would take over and pay to the union the 31-cent hourly rate which the operators themselves could not . Not in the Same Position Mr. Klein also backed up Mr. Adelizzi 's statement that the companies engaged strictly in the trucking business were not in the same position to meet the unions ' demands as the grocery stores . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parcel Service and four drivers ' unions were scheduled to meet again at 11 A. M. today . They broke up yesterday with no announcement of any progress . The drivers are demanding a scale of $60 for a forty-hour week , compared with old scales of $50.50 and $51.56 for a forty-five-hour week , but the discussions at City Hall . were reported to center primarily on twelve fringe issues asked by the union . Most of the discussion , it was said , concerned the demand of the union for a progression of rates for inside workers similar to those for outside workers . Special committees of both the management and unions were considering this issue . The Commerce and Industry Association disclosed meanwhile that 85 per cent of the companies which had participated in a survey it conducted had reported their businesses adversely affected by the trucking strike . Replies were received from 149 concerns , half of which said their businesses were curtailed from 10 to 49 per cent , while the others said 50 per cent or more . Eightyseven per cent said they were unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not deliver what they had produced .
