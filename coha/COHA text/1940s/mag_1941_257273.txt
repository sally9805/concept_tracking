Most U. S. citizens know that there are Communists in labor 's ranks , frequently in key positions . But few citizens pay much attention . Last week they had good reason to look , and look again . In New York City 3,500 busmen struck , leaving 1,300 busses stalled , inconveniencing almost a million New Yorkers . The strike was engineered by Michael J. Quill , head of the Transport Workers Union . <P> Said the Daily News : " One orthodox Red tactic is to hit at a large community 's key points - transportation , power plants , water works and the like - in the hope of paralyzing the place and creating chaos , so that a well-organized knot of Reds can then step in and take over . . . . <P> " Whether Mr. Quill has it in back of his head to give it a tryout here - whether this bus strike is a sort of rehearsal for a general bus , subway , El and taxi strike to come - we do n't know . <P> " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend of organized labor ; bona fide organized labor . <P> . . . Yet the Mayor calls this strike ' a tragic mistake ' and denounces its leaders as bullheadedly and stupidly refusing to arbitrate . " <P> Mike Quill , who carries a briar stick and limps around with a bullet in his hip , which he got in the Irish Republican Army , has been fighting since he was a Boy Scout . He started his labor career in the U. S. as moneychanger in a subway booth , got interested in union politics and helped start T. W. U. In 1937 he got a closed-shop contract for his new , pugnacious union . In 1939 , as candidate for re-election to the New York City Council , he took the Communist line , refused to go along with the American Labor Party 's denunciation of the Hitler-Stalin pact , was read out of the party , lost the election . <P> Last year he was called before the Dies Committee . Other witnesses had already pinned the Communistic label on Mike Quill and on two other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Santo . Mike blusteringly denied the charges . <P> Mike Quill 's demands included an increase in wages ( present wages for drivers are 75 an hour to start , 81 after four years ) ; a six-day week , eight-hour day ( instead of the present 54-hour week ) ; three weeks vacation with pay ; other improvements and benefits . Mike based his demands ( later reduced ) on the company 's earnings , which he claimed were plentiful . <P> Mike Quill had something else at stake . <P> When all city subway lines were put under city management last year , subway employes were taken into the Civil Service . <P> Since then many a subway worker has wondered why he needed to pay dues to a union , now that he had Civil Service protection .
