W ITH my exit permit clutched in one hand and my passport in another , I left the passport office in a daze . My ship was to sail the next day . Everything was done in forty-eight hours . " It must be destiny , " I kept telling myself . The warm autumnal sun gave London new beauty . England had never known such warmth and sunshine within living memory , as through 1940 . Out of Dartmouth Street and the passport office , I emerged into Victoria . Down Victoria I passed in the shadow of Abraham Lincoln 's statue in Parliament Square , and I thought he , too , looked sad that day as his gaze rested on Westminster Abbey . He could n't have been sadder than I. 1 had to leave London  --  the London I had grown to lore in the two years I lived there  --  and I had to leave her in her hour of tragedy .

And to cap it all , if only I had n't solemnly promised a nice Canadian officer at luncheon a few days previous to make every effort to leave England . My route to the steamship office in Trafalgar Square took me past the Foreign Office , past the Home Office , past great hoops of barbed wire , machine-gun emplacements , piled sandbags and guards along Whitehall . I passed Downing Street , more guards , more barbed wire , and good-natured bobbies decorated with tin hats instead of their famous helmets . On , on I went . Past the Horse Guards parade ground . Here the magnificent Life Guards , bereft of their horses , their scarlet tunics , their white doeskin breeches , their high , gleaming black boots , their whitebeplumed , shining silver helmets , were keeping guard . How they must hate drab khaki and mounting guard in foot . The bomb crater in Whitehall near by they ignore . Just as the guards at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destruction in the palace courtyard . Siren Song Tr1HE Cenotaph to the " Glorious Dead of .1 1914-1918 " in the center of Whitehall is flower-bedecked . A man passes . He doffs his hat and people look on the Cenotaph with a new look in their eyes . The lions at the foot of Nelson 's Column are as imperturbable as ever , and Nelson , from his grandstand view of London up top , looks even more impervious than ever . Down below is King Charles II , boarded up with sandbags and corrugated iron . His statue , one of the really fine works of art in London , is protected for posterity . The steamship offices in Trafalgar Square and along Cockspur Street are n't doing much business these days . There are some lines that are n't doing any business at all . My passage was booked by a Canadian company and they were still doing business at the old stand . Or were they ? The door was locked . I banged on the door , and an attendant emerged from the dim interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've come to pick up my ticket , " I replied . " I 'm supposed to sail tomorrow . " " Do n't you know there 's an air raid on ? " he shouted back . Sure enough , there was . Great slashes of exhaust cut the sky . With an effort , I remembered that the sirens had gone when I was in the passport office . " Better come in out of danger , miss , " said the doorman as he unlocked the dour . " Go right down into the shelter ; everyone is down there . " Everyone was there , from the president of the line to the typists and the office boy . The man who had arranged about my ticket was there too . " Everything in order ? " he called as he saw me enter the shelter . Leaving England had been no simple matter . Immediately after my promise to make inquiries about a transatlantic passage , I stopped in at the steamship office . The man behind the counter had smiled politely . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could you please ? " I began . He interrupted , " Madam , if it 's a passage you want , we have no ships available . If you care to go on a waiting list of several thousand , it 's up to you . The government has all our ships . When one is released to us , we do what we call to fil in our bookings , " he concluded . Continued on Page S9 ) That was that . I could stay in London indefinitely . " However , " he had called out as I was leaving , " I 'd advise you to tilt in this form " ? he handed me a sea-blue leaflet ? " and send it to me by post . " That was still that . I 'd fill it in , of course , but a lot of good it would do . It wanted to know who I was , why I wanted to leave England , would I go on brief notice , would I travel any class available . Faithfully I wrote out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , of course , I suddenly remembered the recent ruling that all British subjects between sixteen and sixty , both men and women , were not allowed to leave the country . The only exceptions were mothers and guardians with children who had been guaranteed homes in other parts of the world . I was a British subject between sixteen and sixty . I was no mother with small children looking for refuge for the duration . I was a Canadian , though , and 1 had n't been in England quite two years . That gave me the privilege of being repatriated . Only 1 did n't want to be repatriated . I had an American visa which one branch of my American family had arranged for me , and I wanted to go to the States . Three days went by  --  only three days  --  when a frantic call came through from the steamship-line office , asking if " Miss Helen Cumming would consider sailing on a ship due to leave in forty-eight hours . " " If you 're interested , " continued the Impersonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's done it , " I said to myself . " Ell bet the whule British navy has been put at their-disposal just when I did n't want to leave . " I went to the office immediately . " The Admiralty has released a ship , " the steamship agent told me . " It is to leave in forty-eight hours and we must have your decision now . The only reason you 're considered at all is because of your presence in London . We have no time to notify out-of-town passengers ? mails and telegraphs are hopeless . We 're not taking many children , on board , only so many in proportion to adults , and you , as a single person , are more eligible for passage . " I could n't grasp so much in so short a space of time . " Now , tell me , is your passport in order and have you an exit permit ? " What a foolish question . Of course I had no exit permit . One did n't get an exit permit until one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passage until an exit permit was issued . It was a silly vicious circle . My passport had n't run out , so I assumed it was still good . " Here , take this coupon , " he said as he handed nx , a little card which informed the passport office of available cabin space reserved for me . " Take it to the passport office and they 'll give you quick service on an exit permit . It usually takes two weeks , but with this guaranty of immediate passage your papers can be put in order in twentyfour hours . " Ali , there were ways of speeding up the civil-service departments . It came as a revelation to me . ( Continued On Page 91 ) the purpose . Half-bombed shops and boarded-up shops still proclaim , " Business as Usual . " Time was precious . My shopping finished , I took a taxi home . We dashed  --  as fast as any English taxi can dash  --  through Piccadilly , past the Ritz and Green Park  --  often wondered what happened to the sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into Park Lane . With a roar of guns that was enough to wake the dead , I was shaken out of my lethargic state to see what was going on next . London is full of surprises . The guns in Hyde Park , right across the street from Grosvenor House and the Dorchester Hotel , were hanging into the skies at a terrific rate . I looked up and , sure enough , German planes in formation were sailing over London . I kept looking up . As I watched , a big black limousine came along parallel with my taxi . The handsome man in uniform  --  it looked like a general 's uniform , with lots of red decorations to brighten up the khaki ? was peering heavenward with his head out of the window . The face looked familiar . No wonder he looked familiar . I took a second look . It was the King of England , with his Queen by his side . So the King and Queen and I drove along Park Lane together to watch the ferries fly over London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip across the ocean was the acme of everything that was wonderful . Such a trip required not weeks but months and months of planning . Everyone was told about it . A wardrobe was collected . Bon-voyage parties were part of the fun of leaving . Then , of course , there This time it was different . The only things that remained the same were the tears and farewells , and that from only the three people who knew I was leaving . No new clothes , no flowers , no letters , no nothing . There was no time to write , wire or telephone , even if it were possible . Letters take days , telegrams are only for messages of national importance , and only priority toll calls are allowed . I must leave England alone , almost unwept and totally unsung . Just to make sure that I 'd get a taxi in the early morning , I rang up a taxi rank cab stand asking to have one sent around at 7:30. - Sorry , madam . " came the reply , " but we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning ; the chances are that you 'll be able to get one easily enough . " The Wings of Death With the black-out came the sirens , and with the sirens the droning German planes , and with the planes the guns . Our guns . The night had started my last night in London ? and it was one to be remembered . I took a sleeping pill to catch up on six weeks of sleepless nights . It might have been effective if there had n't been so much noise that night . It 's all very well to take comfort in the guns , but when every gun in every square in London goes off at the same time , and when mobile guns race up and down the streets to catch the enemy , and when screaming bombs add to the cacophony of sound , it takes more than a sleeping draught to dull the senses and close the eyes . " The Western Front was never like this , " said one 1914 veteran to me . " Then we knew where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planes came from , but this in London is the very devil . " It was indeed the very devil . The tactics that last night in London were different . It was a combination of a solid wall of steel against the sky plus the stabbing of searchlights . At the crack of dawn the raiders left , and we came out of our basement shelter . Journey to Nowhere The great day had come . I called for a taxi . There was no answer . I called another rank . Still no answer . I started to call garages . The response was nil . Time was flying . There 's no such thing as a direct route to any place in London today , and I knew I must allow for diversions if I was to get to Euston at 8:20 to catch my boat train . 1 gulped the very excellent breakfast that had been prepared especially in my honor . But my mind was on taxis . We took turns going to the telephone calling garages , with no luck , and at i ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hailing a cab . We got one at eight o'clock . Three miles to go in twenty minutes , with time bombs all over the place . By this time I was numb , Any emotion I might have felt about leaving London was completely frozen within me . En route to Euston Station we were faced by diversions . Block after block was roped off . We took a circuitous route from Abbey Road in St. John 's Wood , where I had been staying , around Regent 's Park and Primrose Hill and heaven knows where else before we as much as got near the Euston Road neighborhood . I was still the unemotional Buddha , but my friends were tearing their hair . At the time I wondered why . This taxi really did travel ; we arrived at Euston Station at 8:21 exactly , I did n't even know where I was going ; all I knew was that I must catch a boat train leaving at 8:2U . My destination was a secret . I could only hope the train might be late . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform to find a lot of very bored and drab-looking people , with no train in sight . Exactly an hour later the train appeared . I embarked , but not alone . Two of my friends decided at the last minute that it would be fun to take the day trip up to an " unknown port , " so it was arranged . After an unspeakably dreary journey through the Midlands , we guessed we were going to Liverpool . We were right . Even the dining-room steward admitted it . And a trip that usually takes three and a half hours dragged itself out to an interminable six and a half . Sirens wailed as we crawled north , but nobody paid any attention . The boat train was an unusually short one , the passengers few . I wondered where everyone was . In the next carriage to me sat three little girls , all wearing red hats , and with them were a man and a woman . Just before we got into Crewe , where we had promised ourselves a drink at the station buffet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into our compartment to say hello . She was about four , and looked like a Marie Laurencin painting , with black eyes , and dark curia tumbling over her shoulders . The English children do n't usually speak first , and I was a little surprised . ( Continued on Page 94 ) ( Continued from Page 941 Straight away there was lifeboat drill . We had n't even left the Mersey River when the ship 's horn blasted six times and a siren sounded throughout the interior of the ship . " Everyone up on deck ! " called out members of the ship 's crew . How everyone jammed on the promenade deck I 'll never know . With bulky life belts tied around us , we jockeyed for space . The sailors wore flat rubber life belts that could be inflated in a hurry . So did the officers , but civilian passengers and children wore the cork kind . The purser stood up high on the rail , overlooking his passengers . " Now I want everyone to listen to me very carefully , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to the way you tie the belt on . Please tie it very , very tightly around the middle . I 'll tell you why . Very often , in a catastrophe at sea , people get unduly excited and jump off the side of the ship into the water . The impact of the water pushes the life belt up , and I have known many passengers to break their necks needlessly . Now , you do n't want to break your neck , do you ? " That was just enough for everyone . The woman next to me , with four small children  --  her sevenmonths-old baby in her arms with his little life belt tied around him  --  turned quite green . She gathered her children a little closer beside her . The purser went on : " When the emergency arises , please step up on the rail to get into the lifeboats . There 's no hurry and there 's no need for panic ? never ! " The next morning , Sunday , feeling the need of a little spiritual courage , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of a particularly doleful hymn , the ship 's horn tooted six times . The siren blew . Gosh , was this the real thing or just practice ? The two ship 's officers who were conducting the service looked at each other , but kept on singing . The passengers looked at one another a little apprehensively . No one made a move to go . Certainly I was n't going to dash out of a religious service all by myself . If the others could take it , so could I. The commotion out in the passageways and up on deck was terrific . What do we do ? I thought to myself . Die like rats , singing a hymn ? Then I thought of how the people went down on the Titanic , singing Nearer , My God , to Thee . Only this hymn we were singing was so dull . The suspense was over in a few minutes . We heard no explosion , there was no listing of the ship ; we had no reason to believe that it was anything but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why , I never knew . I could only guess that the Royal Navy knew all there was to know about ships in distress at sea , and as they constituted three quarters of the ship 's passenger list , it was a waste of time to put people through their paces every day . Besides , I was quite sure the women and children , of whom there were so few , would get the choice seats in the lifeboats anyway . We knew where the lifeboats were and we knew what to do . It was , no doubt , a wartime passage all right . The chains on the lifeboats were oiled and testedevery day . Rations and water supplies in the boats were checked . There was a time when a lifeboat was a canvas-covered ornament on a ship . Now it stood between life and death . Rafts were piled high for the sailors . Little ones , big ones . " Tell me. how do you manage on those very small rafts ? " I asked a naval rating as I examined with interest a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . It was intricately laced with rope . Naval men say " lines . " " We manage very well , thank you , " answered the sailor . " We tie ourselves on by slipping into the network of lines , and then we trust to luck . Off Narvik I floated on one of those for thirty-six hours . " " But what was it like ? How did you feel when you were picked up ? " I asked , " I 'll never know , " he replied . " I was unconscious . I had been wounded as well . " These are the boys who keep the sea lanes free . These are the boys of the Royal Navy . Dangers ? Do n't be silly . Never think of them . Just about every naval man on board had been tossed into the water at one time or another . We were all in danger off the Irish coast , and we knew it . At night we plunged forward in pitch black . No MOOD , no stars , no cigarettes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see your hand ahead of you . How the sailors managed to wash down the decks at night I 'll never know . With an " 0i , watch out ahead , " they would splash water in the abysmal blackness with their great hoses , hoping for the best . I could discern the ships in our convoy by the dull phosphorescent glow of the water breaking over the prows . We had two merchant ships a quarter of a i mile to either side of us , and they in turn were flanked by two destroyers . During the daytime , motor torpedo boats flitted around us like fleas . The destroyers winked messages to our ship continually . The first morning out there was a very special message directed at my cabin . Only I did n't know it at the time .. One of the three girls in my cabin on B deck , who found the blackened and closed porthole a bit depressing , took it upon herself to open it to let in some air . This was just at dawn . And that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . She soon found out why . I was wakened from a deep sleep by banging on the cabin door . " Who the blankety-blankety-blank ( and you know sailors ) has opened a porthole in this cabin ? " Across the room I heard a very small " I did . " " Well , " thundered the voice , " do n't you know that you 're endangering the lives of everyone on this ship ? Do n't you know that the water will pour in here if we hit a mine or get torpedoed ? Do n't you know you 're not supposed to tamper with portholes ? Ca n't you read ? " " I 'm sorry , " from under the covers . " I should jolly well think so ! These damn women ! Do n't know enough to - - And do n't you dare touch a porthole again ! " With that he went off . And the girl burst into tears . Our life belts we carried continuously . I think some nervous passengers slept in theirs . At night I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy reach and my money and passport I tucked under my pillow . I knew where essentials were . Now , if we were torpedoed  --  I did a silly thing , according to my stewardess . Because I undressed to go to sleep the first night , she scolded me . " Do n't you know of the constant dangers ? " she asked me . " Why , no one on board ship undresses to go to bed until after the first three nights at least . " Of course I did n't know that . I was tired , so very tired , after London , and I needed proper sleep . The temptation of a real bed with sheets and pillows and pillowcases was too much for me to resist . I crawled in early that first night , and the deep comfort of the bed and the rocking of the ship lulled me ( Continued on Page 98 ) ( Continued from Page 96 ) into unconsciousness , till the stewardess wakened me . I asked the naval officers what they did at night at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flannel slacks and a warm woolen pullover , " one replied . " We know how really icy the water can be , and silk pajamas are little help . " " Surely you can toss clothes on quickly , " I replied . " Not that quickly . Ever been on a ship when it 's hit ? " he asked . I had n't , but still I was n't convinced that I should n't sleep properly . never could sleep in a girdle . I preferred death in comfort . Clothes on board ship were the least of anyone 's worries . I had unpacked only one bag , and alternated between two outfits the entire crossing . Both wool , both warm . My other baggage I did n't even get out of the hold . And I did n't have it insured either . War insurance at ten per cent of the value was too high a premium , so I took a chance on my clothes and my life . There was no dancing , no music , no deck games , no sports , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossing all right . The bar observed English licensing laws-10:30 to 3:00 , and then from 5:30 to 11:00 . For those first three days we zigzagged out a course at about thirteen knots . It was slow , but we were held hack by the convoy . The convoy was small  --  why , I did n't know . One never knew anything . " keep it dark " was the ship 's slogan . The distance we traveled each day was a secret , the passenger list was a secret , the weather was a secret , our course was a secret . And one did n't ask questions . If one did , the answer was " We would n't know . " The biggest thrill of the convoy was the Royal Air Force . For three days planes on patrol duty in the North Atlantic came swooping down out of the heavens every few hours to glide along parallel with the ship , and then off again . For three days we had these boys  --  these heroes of England -- to watch over us . They would lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wave us " Cheerio , " to bid us " Bon voyage . " We could hear them . We could see them . I could even see the pink cheeks and the blue eyes of the lads . Even tough old salts had tears in their eyes as they waved back greetings  --  and I blew back kisses . " Are n't they wonderful ? " said one sailor to me . That  --  coming from the navy , the senior service in England  --  is a compliment indeed . " Indeed , are n't they wonderful ! " I echoed . Sink or Swim At the end of the three days we left the convoy behind and forged ahead alone . It was a case of sink or swim . We were a perfectly legitimate military target  --  not that that means so much to any 1 .. T-boat  --  hut now we were on our own . Mothers of small children looked at one another , a little surprised and alarmed . I think they thought we were going to he convoyed all the way across . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and one aft . I never heard them being used . People who did n't sleep so well as I told me they heard guns in the early hours of the second morning out . There was a rumor on hoard that we had sunk a submarine . We did see a whale the third day out . That was no rumor . In the eight days it took to get to an " Eastern Canadian seaport , " I not only got to know something of the Royal Navy but something of the civilian passengers as well . There was one woman on board , draped in mink , who was accompanying her two small children to Canada for the duration . Everyone on board called her the " Duchess . " I soon found out why . I was leaning over the deck one day , watching the swirl of waters , when I heard a very cultured English voice beside me saying , " Do you know Canada very well ? " I had hoped she was n't going to ask me if I knew her relatives out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English always ask if you know So-and-So , way out in British Columbia . They forget that Canada is three thousand miles across . Or they do n't know . Pilgrims ' Progress " Why , yes , I do know Canada rather well . It 's my home , " I replied . " Oh , " she said . " Do you know Princess Alice ? " she asked . No , I did n't know Princess Alice . " Do you know the Earl of Athlone ? Such a dear ! " she persisted . No , I had never had that pleasure . I 'd heard of them , of course  --  I 'd seen them in London  --  and I knew the earl had succeeded Lord Tweedsmuir as governor-general of Canada . " Oh . " " Did you have much trouble getting money out of England ? " she kept on . I had no trouble at all , because I did n't have any to take out . " Oh , dear , the Bank of England was very stuffy about me . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't let me have a penny more than ten pounds each for myself and my two sons . " I mumbled something about the law of the land . " And I left all my jewels with Cartier 's in Bond Street  --  that 's where I bought them . What did you do about jewels ? " That finished me . " I have no jewels and I have no money . I had a hard time scraping together the ten pounds I did have , to say nothing of the forty-five pounds this passage cost me . I had nothing to leave behind , " I replied . " Oh ; oh , I see , " she said . " Oh " And with that she walked away . So few . of them like that are left in London now . I took a walk around the deck after that and joined one mother who was pushing her seven-months-old baby around in his pram . Sometimes the sailors would take him for a walk when the mother was busy with her three other small children , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liability on the people she was to visit for the duration . Her husband , a major in the army , had been sent to the Near East , her house had been bombed and she was forced to seek refuge with distant relatives living in Ontario . " The children grow out of their clothes so quickly , " she told me , " that I brought bolts of woolen fabric and cotton along with me , so I could sew for them a couple of years after their present clothes wear out . I do hope the customs wo n't object . " Just before we left I had them completely fitted out with new clothes . I 'm so anxious not to become a liability on ( Continued on Page 100 ) 100 1 .

" Maybe the war wo n't last very long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two about the navy . I learned about the finer distinctions drawn between the officers of the Royal Navy , the Royal Naval Reserve , the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve and the merchant marine . Then I learned about the noncommissioned officers , the chief petty officers and the petty officers , and finally the naval ratings . They rarely call them sailors . They had to have four separate bars on the ship . The officers ca n't drink with the chief petty officers , the chief petty officers ca n't drink with the petty officers , and the petty officers ca n't drink with the ratings . Tradition and discipline are part of the explanation . One officer said to me , " How could I ask one of my men to carry out some hazardous duty one morning if I had been drinking with him the night before ? The navy is built up on discipline . If it goes , heaven help us . " Civilians could drink at any bar . They had the run of the ship . Gin at tuppence ha'penny a jigger , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twelve cents ) . That 's cheap drinking . The barroom steward explained that they were transport prices . At eleven o'clock every morning the decks were cleared of ratings . " Where do they go ? " I asked a ship 's officer . " To get their ration of rum , " he replied . The navy is still the navy . And it hated crossing the ocean with nothing to do . They told me they used to envy passengers on luxury liners , but now they felt sorry for them . Fancy crossing the ocean with nothing to do ! There was one man on board who was really taking a sea voyage because of his health . That was the last straw . Of course he explained that he had official business in Canada and the States , but he came away at this time because of his health . The tension of the journey was broken somewhat on the seventh day out . There was talk of land . There was more talk of docking the next morning . Of course , one never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The rumors were justified . We did slide into harbor at dawn the next day . Everyone was out on deck . And no wonder . Steaming in front the south were five of the famous over-age destroyers . Cheers went up  --  lusty , throaty cheers from the navy . The arrival was simultaneous . Had it been planned , I wonder ? There they were  --  the destroyers flying the Stars and Stripes . I saw tears in many eyes that morning . Tears of happiness , and the eager looks on the faces of the officers and men were a joy to see . " Jolly good show , " one boy said to me , in the English manner of understatement . " I say , I can hardly wait till we board one . Terribly curious about them , you know . " He did n't have long to wait . Before the morning was over , the destroyers were taken over . Before the day was out , they were flying the British flag , but not without a touching ceremony . On each destroyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the British stood at attention while The Star-Spangled Banner was sung , then God Save the King . A prayer followed . The momentous moment of taking over had come . The Stars and Stripes were taken down , and up went the Union Jack . There was a trial spin around the harbor . There was no time to be lost . Before the next day dawned the overage destroyers were on their way to England . I had only one wish as I saw them go . I wanted to go back with them . Canada is so big , and so safe .
