The Forgotten Village ( Kline ; Mayer-Burstyn ) is a documentary film of integrity and beauty , the story of the triumph of modern medicine over an archaic female herb doctor in the squalid village of Santiago , high in the mountains of Mexico 's centra ! plateau . Its post-production history is the triumph of reason over the paleolithic prejudice of New York State 's three-man-four-woman board of movie censors , who banned the picture because it was " indecent . . . inhuman . . . . " <P> <P> The civil-service censor board was reversed by the State Board of Regents after the film 's makers , Producer-Director Herbert Kline and Author John Steinbeck , refused to delete two protested sequences : 1 ) a woman nursing her child ; 2 ) a woman in labor . The birth is not shown merely the medieval method of assisting labor by drawing a shawl tight across the fully-clothed mother 's midriff . <P> <P> Village is a study in faces-native Mexican mountain faces : strong-nosed , squash-nosed , distrustful , lucent and , except for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natives ) are natural and astonishingly good , especially a mop-haired little boy ( Paco ) , who dies of dysentery , and his older brother ( Juan Diego ) , who makes the long hike to the city to return with the " horse-blood men " - Mexico 's rural medicos and their vaccine . <P> <P> Seldom exciting , Village has a well-sustained suspense arising from Santiago 's struggle with the epidemic . The actors do not speak : the photography ( Alexander Hackensmid ) plus Actor Burgess Meredith 's somewhat arty narration of Author <P> Steinbeck 's script tells the lonely , moving story . Although the documentary 's canvas is small , its preachment is vast . Its story in miniature is the story of the past reluctantly giving way to the future . Village succeeds in telling it with quiet dignity . <P> Only off-key note in the film is the background music . Written by left-wing Hanns Eisler , composer of the battle song Komin-tern , it is not Mexican , but an ultrasophisticated mixture of Hindemith , Schnberg and Prokofieff .

At the climax of their negotiations the hard-drinking Revueltas-to Steinbeck 's and Mexico 's dismay - died at the unripe age of 40 years . <P> <P> Sundown ( Wanger ; United Artists ) . In East Africa , sundown is the best time of the day . It is quiet then ; night is near ; and there is nothing to do . There , in a lonely desert outpost , Bruce Cabot , George Sanders , Reginald Gardiner and other British colonials thwart a Nazi scheme to arm and rouse the natives , in ten reels of old-fashioned romanticadventure melodrama . <P> <P> Through this dusty plot shuffles blue-eyed Gene Tierney , 21 , cast as a sort of desert branch manager of a Bedouin A. &; P. Co. chain . Supposedly a half-caste daughter of an Arab trader , she manages to remain as dead-pan as all good Arabs are supposed to be .
