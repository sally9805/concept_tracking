England 's modern John Bunyan is a wise , witty , sad-faced Fellow of Oxford 's Magdalen College named Clive Staples Lewis . Like the Inspired Tinker , Anglican Convert Lewis ( The Screwtape Letters , The Great Divorce ) writes of the trials and troubles of man 's soul in a sinful world ; to dramatize his theology he peoples his stories with a menagerie of sprites , devils , and fabulous monsters . Lewis ' latest : That Hideous Strength ( Macmillan , $3 ) , third volume of a trilogy* begun in 1943 . It is loaded with enough spiritual wisdom for a dozen sermons . <P> The plot revolves around an attempt by the powers of Evil to take over the earth . Evil 's chief terrestrial representatives : a brace of devils ( appropriately named John Wither and Professor Frost ) who administer the vast N.I.C.E. , an organization to handle postwar England 's technology and scientific development-ostensibly for the benefit of the common man . The champions of Good : a handful of rather painfully decent English types under the leadership and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In Lewis ' sure hands the story becomes well-written , fast-paced satirical fantasy . <P> As in many moral tales , Good is less sharply drawn than Evil ; some readers may think good Dr. Ransom 's mysterious sources of power more druidical than Christian . But for Christian Moralist Lewis , the allegory 's the thing . <P> The devil abroad in his 20th Century world is the ultra-rational scientist-technocrat , for whom man is the measure of all things ; who would storm heaven with test tubes , nuclear fission and pure reason . Of one of his satanic prototypes Lewis says : " He had passed from Hegel into Hume , thence through Pragmatism , and thence through Logical Positivism , and out at last into the complete void . " <P> For Christian readers , Lewis ' allegory adds up to an elaborate modern version of an old story which atomic man may well paste in his hat : The Tower of Babel . <P> *The other two : Out of the Silent Planet ( on Mars ) , Perelandra ( on Venus ) .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
