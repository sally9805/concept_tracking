RCA Victor last week made a low bow to a competitor whose existence it had pointedly ignored . On display for RCA distributors last week went new radio-phonograph combinations which will play not only RCA 's 45 and the standard ( 78 r.p.m. ) record , but Columbia 's 33 ? r.p.m. long-playing record as well . The phonographs will be on sale early next year . <P> Record dealers knew the reason for the switch : LP records , made not only by Columbia but by 21 other manufacturers , have been outselling RCA 's 45 , although RCA sales have been picking up since its new promotion campaign ( TIME , Sept. 5 ) . Announcement of the new machines stirred up more gossip that RCA would soon put its classical music on LP records , keep making the 45s for popular tunes only .
