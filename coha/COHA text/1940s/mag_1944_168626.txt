Across the damp , dark face of southern Russia , a vast and portentous victory took shape . At a mile an hour , the front rolled towards the Black Sea . Fifty German divisions were in retreat . Hushed , frightened Bucharest babbled of peace . <P> Along the 500-mile-long front , from the Dnieper 's mouth to the Carpathians , four Red Armies hacked their way forward . Their prime objective : the web of railroads over which the enemy could be reinforced-or retreat . This week , all but one inferior escape line into Rumania had been cut . Birds of ill omen hovered over the fringes of the German-held steppe - air transports were dropping fuel and supplies to stalled trucks and tanks . <P> Marshal Georgy Zhukov 's men battled in the streets of Tarnopol ( see map ) . This 400-year-old town is a gateway to the great fortress of Lwow ; the key to the fate of the German armies in the Ukraine . To hold it , the Germans rushed in huge reinforcements ( a Red scouting plane saw a column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dominating the town , fought for every house . <P> Marshal Ivan Konev 's men captured the Luftwaffe 's key base of Uman . The Germans were still digging trenches when the Russians struck , had no time to destroy immense supply dumps , fled half-clothed . This week Konev 's Army was pounding on the German defense wall on the Bug . <P> General Rodion Malinovsky 's Army splashed into Kherson and on toward Nikolayev after a spectacular overnight thrust . In the flooded plain , the cavalry bore the brunt of battle . Shrewdly , Malinovsky sent a myriad of raiding units-a tank or two , tommy gunners , horsemen-into the steppe to sow panic . They did their job well : Moscow said nowhere was chaos greater than in this sector . <P> This week a fourth Army-presumably General Feodor Tolbukhin's-crossed the lower Dnieper , struck beyond Kherson . Said Moscow in jubilation : the defeat was becoming a catastrophe .
