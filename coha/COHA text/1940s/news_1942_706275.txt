txt Uses Found for Old Pianos The problem of how to dispose of old pianos , thousands of which are lying unused in attics all over the country because the owner does not want to go to the trouble and expense of having them removed can surely be solved now . Pianos contain a wealth of material for salvage purposes . The average instrument has from 150 to 300 pounds of cast iron and substantial quantities of brass , rubber , steel , felt and wood . I should like to propose that all who have a piano for which they can find no further use should either turn it over to the camps for Army entertainment or , if it is beyond practical use , offer it for salvage purposes . Perhaps some civic organization will take up the task of arranging for these instruments to be picked up . WALTER GROSS . New York , March 3 , 1942.
