Factor , whose suave persuasiveness netted him $7,500,000 in a vast stock selling scheme in England , for which the British government sought for years to extradite him , and who now is under indictment in Iowa in connection with an alleged million dollar swindle involving whisky warehouses , said he does not fear for himself . However , at least six telephoned threats in the last year by anonymous callers have warned him that Touhy would get out of prison some day and punish him for the testimony which sent them to prison for terms of 99 years . Chooses to Remain Home . News of the escape @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Chicago police were informed of the prison break . For several hours after he reached home his privately listed telephone rang constantly . Friends called to reassure him and to offer a hiding place if he wanted it , but Factor chose to remain with his wife , Rella , and their son , Alvin . Happenings on the night of June 30 , 1033 , are still vividly clear to Factor . " My wife and son Jerome and a party of friends , " Factor recalled , " had gone to the Dells roadhouse it later burned down at Dempster street and Austin avenue , Morton Grove . We had been there many times before and I had gambled and lost a considerable sum of money from time to time . On the night before I had dropped $30,000 . Tells of raying Losses .

Sam Hare joined us at tile table . After dinner my wife and I went to the gambling rooms upstairs and I called for $1,000 worth of chips . " I went to tile dice game and bet $50 and won . On the next roll I made eight for a point and with $100 riding on the eight , offered to bet another $100 to $120 that I would make the point .

" My car hardly had crossed the intersection when one of the cars , which 1 was watching in the rearview mirror , came out of Austin avenue and swept around my car . " When my car was cut off and I was forced to stop I saw nothing but sawed-off shotguns and tommy guns in the hands of the men who stirrounded my car . Then I was pulled out with Al Epstein who was riding with me and my son , Jerome . Held in Glenview House . " We were forced to get into the kidnapers ' car and drivema short distance until the kidnapers learned who I was . Then Epstein was pushed out and I was taken to a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Factor recalled last night that it was Touhy Who made most of the threats against his life , during his detention , but that it was Banghart who subjected him to the greatest cruelties . " The day after the kidnaping , " said Factor , " one guard offered some ' bread to me . I was blindfolded and virtually in a state of collapse and I could not swallow . How He Was Treated . Among the indignities heaped upbn Factor during his confinement in the Glenview house , he said , were frequent beatings , kicks in his stomach , twisting of his arms and fingers , threats to cut off his ears and once to use a blow torch to burn his feet . " I thought it was all over one night , " he said . " A gang of men , it sounded like eight or 10 , came stomp , ing down the cellar stairs banging their gun butts on the treads .

" " The good guard identified at the trial as Ike Coster , a mail robber showed many times that he wanted to help me , but because he rarely thought about washing his face he never offered to wash mine , nor to remove my shoes or unfasten my collar . Once after I had been subjected to a severe beating he said he had a notion to take me back to town because they should not have beat me when I was bound and blindfolded . " Factor finally was released alter his physician , Dr. Herman M. Soloway paid $70,000 to the kidnapers .

He then received instructions to wait beside a phone booth in a loop store the next day until a call came for him . He got the phone call and instruction to take a taxicab and go to Cermak road by a circuitous route . Upon reaching Cermak road the cab traveled for 20 minutes before the kidnapers waved Dr. Soloway to a stop . He walked to their car , handed over the money and Factor was home a few hours later .

She drove a short distance east on Dempster street until she met a motorcycle policeman in the vicinity of Harms road .
