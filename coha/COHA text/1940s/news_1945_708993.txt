txt The Government moved today to nationalize the Bank of England . Under a bill introduced in the House of Commons , the nationalization will mean no financial loss to the 17,500 stockholders , for government obligations to be given in exchange for stockholders ' bank holdings will average the same gross annual return as the bank 's stock did over the past twenty years . The measure , the first of the Labor Government 's nationalization projects to reach the legislative stage , is expected to be severely criticized when it reaches ' debate on the second reading in the near future but it is expected to be carried . The more extreme elements of the Labor majority are due to attack the bill because of its " generous " treatment of stockholders . A clause tha t the opposition called " unexpected " would extend the power of the new nationalized bank to a large measure over other joint-stock banks , Conservatives said . They are reported to be sharpening arguments based on the contention that , with control of the Bank of England , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between other banks and their clients as well . The Labor party had pledged itself to the nationalization of the Bank of England , the fuel and power industries , inland transport and the iron and steel industry . Today 's bill was the first overt move by the new Government in this direction . Bonds to Replace Stock According to the measure , which was introduced by Hugh Dalton , Chancellor of the exchequer , the stock of the bank now outstanding and valued at $58,212,000 will be taken over by the Government , which will issue in exchange 3 per cent bonds to the value of $232 , - 848,000 . The Government bonds may be redeemed at par on or after April 5 , 1968 , and , subject to such redemption , will be perpetual . According to Government figures , stockholders averaged a gross return of 12 per cent on their holdings . By the issuance of 3 per cent obligations to four times the value of the stockholders ' bank holdings , the individual is assured of a return equal to what he previously enjoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expected to emphasize that the proposed treatment of these stockholders must not be taken as a precedent for other nationalization programs . Future schemes , it was explained , may apply to institutions or industries that have been run less admirably than the bank and deserve less generous treatment . The bank , it was added , is regarded as a highly efficient institution that has been prudently managed over a long period and this fact is recognized in the compensation accorded to its stockholders . Crown to Appoint Board The bill further provides that the Governor , the Deputy Governor and sixteen directors of the bank shall be appointed by the Crown . At present there are twenty-four directors , who select the Governor and his deputy . Mr. Dalton has already announced that Lord Catto , the present Governor , has consented to continue in office for the time necessary to inaugurate the new regime and he will be the first Governor to be appointed by the Crown . The whole purpose of the bill is legally to vest complete responsibility for financial policy in the Government . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board and through Clause 4 of the measure , which a4uthorizes , the Treasury to give such directions to the bank as it thinks necessary in the public interest . The ' bank has long worked intimately with the Treasury and , where differences of opinion between the two have arisen , it has usually given way to the Treasury 's view . A. further provision on which Conservative critics are expected to center their attack says that the bank may , if it thinks it necessary in the public interest , request information from and make recommendations to other banks in the nation . If authorized by the Treasury the bank may also " issue directiozs " to any banker to make certain that effect is given to any of its requests or recommendations . At Mr. Dalton 's request Lord Catto presided yesterday at a meeting of the Clearing Bankers Association , at which the terms of the new bill were considered . Later Lord Catto assured the Chancellor that he could count on the cooperation of the banking community .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
