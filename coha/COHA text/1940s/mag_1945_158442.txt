In Florence , U.S. Army officers were hard at work rebuilding a part of the Nazi-destroyed , rubble-rimmed banks of the Ponte Vecchio . Four of Florence 's famed medieval towers had been badly damaged ; three were already repaired . Fixing the wobbly fourth , 100-year-old Torre degli Amidei , was the immediate problem . <P> Rebuilding Italian towers is only a trifling part of the mammoth job now being done by 16 Allied officers ( eight Britons , eight Americans ) , whose jawbreaking official title is the Allied Sub-commission for Monuments , Fine Arts &; Archives in Italy . The title has been briefly translated by G.I.s into " Venus Fixers . " <P> It is the Venus Fixers who furnish the air force and infantry with lists of Italian art treasures which must be spared " if possible . " These non-targets are rated ac cording to age , preservation and reputation of the maker ( buildings like St. Peter 's in Rome get top billing : three stars ) . The Venus Fixers approve expenditures for rebuilding ( 20,000,000 lire in Sicily ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. Army 's Lieut . Colonel Ernest Theodore DeWald , 53 . <P> Stuff &; Things . Venus Fixer DeWald , a softspoken , pipe-smoking ex-professor of art history at Princeton , was an infantry officer in World War I. Colonel DeWald has followed on the heels of advancing Allied armies , listing damage , determining what " first aid " is needed . When he sees some of the atrocities committed on art by the retreating Nazis , he frequently has trouble with his blood pres sure . During the past year Colonel De Wald , who invariably refers to Italy 's priceless objets d'art as " stuff &; things , " could sketch , from reports of his staff , a broad outline of what has happened to liberated Italy 's historic architecture . Highlights : <P> Assisi , site of 700-year-old San Francesco , oldest Gothic church in Italy , escaped unscathed . <P> Rome ( and the Vatican ) , undamaged , except for the 1,500-year-old Early Christian Church of San Lorenzo ( three stars ) , which was hit by a bomb . <P> In Naples @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly burned , but 14th-Century frescoes were discovered when the 18th-Century decorations peeled off the walls . <P> In Benevento , the precious , 1,100-year-old Cathedral ( three stars ) was blown skyhigh , along with its famed 12th-century bronze-sculptured doors . <P> In Pisa , the famed Leaning Tower was lopsided as ever , but the medieval cloister and burial ground , Campo Santo ( one star ) , had its roof destroyed , ruining the frescoes of Benozzo Gozzoli . <P> The Venus Fixers have hardly begun . Nazi-occupied northern Italy is still ahead of them. * As for Italian paintings which have been destroyed , lost and looted , Colonel DeWald has quoted no figures ( others estimate as high as $50,000,000 worth in stolen goods alone ) . But on the theory that some of the " stuff " has been hidden by Germans or Italian Fascists , he has his Venus Fixers hunting clues . And , he thinks , a lot more will come to light when the Allies get a good look into the Hitler Museum in Linz and Art-lover Goring 's Karinhall near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported that " Italian Partisans " had blown up famed Rialto Bridge ( 1591 ) , on Venice 's Grand Canal .
