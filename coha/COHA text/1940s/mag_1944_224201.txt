Denmark 's old ( 73 ) King Christian , immured in Copenhagen by the Germans , heard that his subjects in Iceland , occupied by U.S. forces , were planning to establish an independent republic . <P> Forthwith he drafted a rebuke which made no distinction whatever between the occupying Germans and the occupying Yanks . Growled Christian : " . . . Decisions which involve cutting forever connections between Icelandic people and their King should not be realized as long as both Iceland and Denmark are occupied by foreign powers . . . . We can not acknowledge the change of constitution that the Althing Icelandic Parliament and the Icelandic Government have decided upon without negotiation with us. "
