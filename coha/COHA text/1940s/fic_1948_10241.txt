" Good , " said Colonel Ross , though he was far from thinking it was . Mrs. Pellerino , back at her desk , glanced at him , and he nodded . She touched the key on the box and said : " Colonel Ross , General . " General Beal sat at his desk . He said with composure , " Judge , I 'm going over to the Base . If you have anything , ride over with me . I 'm going flying . " " All right , " Colonel Ross said . General Beal said : " I 'm going to take a Forty-seven up . I just want to fly around awhile . I 'm not going anywhere . " With no change of tone , he said : " Your man Hicks , Hal 's man , had word Woody killed himself last night . I checked on it . It 's true . Look , I do n't think I do want you to come over with me , Judge . Anything you 've got will keep , wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " It will keep . " In this new distressof mind , the general would not want to be troubled about Benny . The unchanged tone disturbed him a little , and he said : " I 'm sorry , Bus . " " Oh , the hell ! " General Beal said . " Do n't think I think the poor bastard shot himself because I took his plane away , anything like that . I 'm not crazy . I just do n't feel like sitting here ; so I told Danny to get the Forty-seven he was working on out for me . I may see how high I can take it  --  something like that . " " That 's a good idea , " Colonel Ross said . " You could do that right over the field . Do n't fly a fighter plane cross-country without a wingman along , Bus . It may be silly ; but they were n't fooling about that . General Arnold would be very sore . " " I know , " General Beal said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Tower . There 's the car , I guess . Hold the fort , will you , Judge ? " The fort , Colonel Ross decided , could be held as well from his own office , where he had work to do ; but he did not get forward with the work . An unreasonable despondency filled him , an absurd superstitious conviction that , today , all their luck was out . Everything that could go wrong , would . He didP201not accept it ; he opposed it with a firm mind ; but not so firm that , after a half an hour , he could keep from calling Base Operations . General Beal , flying a P-47 , had taken off . Subsequently he had checked in twice , the last time about five minutes ago . He stated he was approximately over the field at thirty thousand feet , climbing . Did Colonel Ross want them to contact him ? Colonel Ross said no ; he merely wanted to hear whether he got off . Against the remonstrances of reason , there stayed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imagination which saw  --  and saw with clarity , with an alarming hint of veridical hallucination  --  Bus thundering slower and slower , driving up and up his P-47 , a plane he had flown only once or twice before . Now , he was miles high , mushing , nearly slumping , in the rare air , the world lost under him in a vaporous haze . Mask clamped on his face , mouth raw from sucking pure oxygen , eyes goggling blankly at his dials , he was remote , beyond all aid , on his own , as much alone as a man dying ; and this was not his lucky day . The Operations Officer cut in then , saying : " Colonel Ross ? Excuse me , sir . We had a message for you here from Colonel Mowbray about twenty minutes ago . I believe he thought you came over to the Base with General Beal . We were trying to find you . They said it was urgent ; will you call his office ? " The Headquarters Quadrangle buildings were air conditioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside at one o'clock , the windowless Staff Conference Room was cool enough . The surface of the long oak table , wider at one end than at the other , was flooded evenly with artificial daylight from fluorescent lamps . The walls were draped from floor to ceiling with folds of heavy red cloth drawn together to hide military situation maps and statistical tables posted with secret data . When Colonel Mowbray 's message finally reached him  |p202Colonel  Ross , who had not had lunch , sent Sergeant Brooks for a pint of milk and a couple of sandwiches which he brought into the conference room . When you breakfast at six-thirty , you get hungry by noon ; and Colonel Ross , when he got hungry , knew that he got irritable . Methodically , he lowered the level of milk in the cardboard container through two straws and ate the sandwiches , allowing Colonel Mowbray to do the talking . Colonel Mowbray was repeating himself . He wanted , he said , to get to the bottom of this . He did not like it ; he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assigned and appropriate action taken . His audience , besides Colonel Ross , included Colonel Coulthard , of Special Projects , who had a bewildered air  --  no doubt , Colonel Coulthard did n't like it and did n't understand it , either . With him was his Adjutant , Captain Solomon , who kept smiling nervously . Also with him , though farther down the table , were Major Whitney and Lieutenant Edsell , of the Reports Section . On the other side were Captain Collins , the Public Relations Officer , and his Lieutenant Phillips . Next to them were Major Sears and an MP lieutenant of his named Kashkin . Mr. Botwinick sat beside Colonel Mowbray with a stenographic notebook . Among so many other things , Mr. Botwinick was an expert stenographer . Across from Colonel Mowbray was Major Blake , Executive of the Directorate of Personnel Analysis . There were , in short , far too many people here . On one of his ill-considered impulses , Colonel Mowbray must have summoned everyone he could think of who might possibly know anything about it . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their trifles of information , learned much that it was not necessary for them to know . Colonel Mowbray , having made his general remarks twice ( or three times ; or four times ; for all Colonel Ross knew ; assuredly Colonel Mowbray had not been sitting in silence while they waited for Colonel Ross ) said : " Now , I hope it 's clear to you that this is a very unfortunate and very serious matter . I do n't know who 's to blame , yet . I want to hear everybody'sside of it . I want somebody , whoever can , to just startp203at the beginning . I want to plot out the movements of this fellow , this James man , from the time he turned up at the gate and was given an Area pass to the time he left . " Major Blake , who looked well-fed but was probably as hungryas Colonel Ross , touched the end of a mustache which while not waxed , was so neatly trimmed that it looked waxed . He said , with an air of great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pop . We know nothing about it whatsoever . Of course , Colonel Jobson mentioned the purpose of his trip to me , so I knew something was up , and I knew in general what it was . That is , I knew this nigger had turned up ; but I also knew he was n't to be cleared ; and I certainly do n't know how he got over to the Personnel Analysis Auditorium . " " Well , that 's what we 're here to find out , " Colonel Mowbraysaid . " And I think you 'd better stand by , Evan , if you will . " Captain Collins said : " I can start at what I guess is the beginning , sir . " Colonel Ross knew that Captain Collins had been sports editor for a large city newspaper , though he could not remember what city . Though he was now in his middle thirties , wearingglasses , and somewhat filled-out and softened , it was evidentstill that there had been a time when Captain Collins was an athlete himself  --  probably a football @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a business . It required , as well as more strength and speed , more brains , at least in the backfield , than were normal in the players of Eastern colleges , where football remained partly a sport . Captain Collins had a good-natured , well-featured face  --  outward evidence of a basic unexcitable assurance which often develops in a growing boy who looks able to knock down almost anyone , if he wants to . When you look that way , you do n't have to be in a hurry about taking offense ; and most other youths are in no hurry to offer it . Captain Collins said calmly and mildly : " We got this call from the gate a little after eight o'clock . Mr. James had his War Department clearances , and a letter , attention PRO , signed by the Chief , Air Forces Group , Bureau of Public Rela/tions in Washington . I told them to give him an Area pass ; and I sent Lieutenant Phillips down to get him and bring him to the office . " He closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not know Captain Collins very well , gave him in his mind a favorable mark , recognizing that astuteness , much too rare in human beings and almost unteachable , which never said unneeded words ; and having said those that were needed , simply stopped and waited with attention but not impatience , for the response . It was now up to Colonel Mowbray , who , not a very astute man , was taken aback by this competence of mind and manner , He cleared his throat in the silence . " Well , " he said , " I suppose that 's in order . Assuming , of course , his papers were genuine  --  " Major Sears said : " That 's our responsibility , of course , Colonel . They are required at the gate to satisfy themselves about the authenticity of any credentials presented before passing the bearer in . If we find out his papers were forged  --  " " That is n't in question , " Colonel Mowbray said . " Nobody says he had forged papers . I just want to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further to say , Captain ? " Captain Collins looked at the palm of his hand reflectively . " I think not , sir , " he said . " That , as far as I had anything to do with it , was how he came to be admitted , how he got his Area pass . " " Well , " said Colonel Mowbray , " did n't you call my office and request a clearance ? " " Yes , sir , " Captain Collins said . " That was after Mr. James was admitted , when he was in our office . Mr. James showed me his stuff , and explained what he had come for . We then put through to clear it with you . " " I know that . No , go on about that . " " I do n't quite understand you , Colonel . That is all I know about that . " " What did my office tell you ? " Groaning silently , Colonel Ross contained himself by taking the last of his second sandwich in a large bite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe your office , Mr. Botwinick  --  " Captainp205Collins nodded toward him  --  " told us he would call back when he had consulted you . I think he said you were in with the general . " " And did he call you back ? " " I believe that he did . " " Do n't you know , Captain ? " " Well , I was told so , sir . I did n't talk to him myself . LieutenantPhillips took the call . I was out . " " Where were you ? " Captain Collins looked at him placidly . " Well , sir , as a matter of fact , I was in the can . " Colonel Coulthard emitted a grunt of laughter ; and , thus encouraged , there were several smiles . To pay back despitefully , preferably with interest , the man who got them laughed at would be the natural next move of most people sitting in Colonel Mowbray 's autocratic and powerful position . Colonel Mowbray blinked , and displayed instead that disarming , simplemindedmagnanimity which so greatly inconvenienced Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Colonel Mowbray 's character . The laugh , though more or less on him , was his own fault . Colonel Mowbray conceded it . He said , peering almost apologetically at Captain Collins : " Well , that 's right , of course . It 's immaterial where you were . I see that . I just wanted to get everything straight . You were out of the office . Now , what was it you were told by the lieutenant about Mr. Botwinick 's message  --  " " Pop ! " Colonel Ross said . Though he admired magnanimity as much as anyone , though he even marveled at this saintlike little display of it , he never had been able to suffer a blundering examination silently . " Might n't it be simpler to ask the lieutenant ? Unless , of course , you want to ask Botty to tell us what he said . " " Yes , " Colonel Mowbray said , relieved . " I will put that question to the lieutenant , instead . Reason I ask them , Norm , is I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only ones that can tell me what they understood my orders to be , after Botty transmitted them . I want to get at the reasons for what happenednext . Can you answer , Lieutenant ? "  |p206Lieutenant  Phillips was tall , with fair , thin , wavy hair . He had the long , sloping forehead and thin , straight nose that often distinguished , in Judge Ross 's experience , a high-strung , voluble witness , quick and fearless , but speaking before he thought . Unless the Bench intervened from time to time to save his story , a hostile attorney , trained to think before he spoke , would soon make a fool of him . When Lieutenant Phillips spoke , his voice , as you would expect , was high and clear . He had the accent , supercilious-sounding to most of the country , of educated New England ; or , specifically , Colonel Ross was sure , of Harvard . Lieutenant Phillips said : " As nearly as I understood it , we were given no orders . We were simply informed that we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beal would have to approve it . As a matter of courtesy to his Directorate Chiefs , the general would not approve it until he knew that it was all right with Colonel Jobson . Colonel Jobson could n't be reached because he was out getting his flying time . " He paused and added : " That last , I gather from what the major , there , said a few minutes ago , was untrue . I gather that the colonel was warned , and then ducked out on it so the general could n't ask him  --  " Colonel Mowbray had disliked the accent at once . Given this good opening , he jumped in hard , with the grating disciplinarybark of the old Army : " I did n't ask what you gathered or did n't gather about Colonel Jobson , Lieutenant . Colonel Jobson has nothing to do with this . All I wanted was your statement of what you understood my message to mean . Do you concur in his statement , Captain ? " Adroitly grasping from the context that " concur " here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Collins nodded . Hesaid : " Yes , Colonel . I mean , I understood that that was thesubstance of what Mr. Botwinick said on the telephone . I didnot understand that we had been given any particular orders . " " Surely you understood that nothing was to be done untilGeneral Beal approved the clearance . If not that , what did youmake of the message ? What did you make of it , Lieutenant ? " Lieutenant Phillips shrugged slightly . " Little or nothing , "  |p207he  said . " Frankly , I supposed that Mr. Botwinick , for reasons of his own , was disinclined to go to any trouble . I supposed it likely that he had n't even bothered to mention the request to you . " Barking again , Colonel Mowbray said : " That is an entirely unwarranted supposition , sir ! How dare you suppose such a thing ? Go on , go on ! " Colonel Ross , his chin on his chest , his feet extended under the table , filled his pipe from a pouch . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips repeat his slight shrugging movement of the shoulders . It was plain , then , that Lieutenant Phillips had been , literally , the reverse of intimidatedby the old Army bark . That could be seen in the shrug , for it was unconscious , not a conscious shrug . The shrug , when it was conscious , was the cowed man 's furtive little insolence , the sum of his impotent , frightened resentment . Judge Ross had seen it dozens of times  --  the shrugger , sore and surly about what the judge just told him , knew that if he did n't comply , the judge had only to speak a word and he would land in jail . He hoped his insulting little gesture would be noticed ; but not noticed too much . Lieutenant Phillips 's unconscious shrug meant that his patiencewas giving out . He had tried to be civil , but enough was enough . Here , then , was a rich boy ; or , at least , what had once been a rich boy ; used to doing what he pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because those with whom he came in contact would give way , believing that if they pleased him they might get a little of his money . When he was opposed and trouble resulted , he need not worry too much ; some of the same money would pay the fines . Lieutenant Phillips said : " Yes , I 'll go on , if you want . The supposition seemed very well warranted to me . We had said that Mr. James was a Negro , down to visit a Negro project . I thought it quite possible that your office  --  and Colonel Jobson'soffice  --  " he gave Major Blake a contemptuous glance "  --  felt that it did n't really matter how they treated what the Major elegantly described as a nigger , ' or how much of a runaroundhe was given . What Mr. Botwinick said , I consideredp208mostly nonsense ; for the simple reason that I was sure there would have been no difficulty in getting a prompt clearance if Mr. James had been the writer of some nationally syndicatedcolumn , instead of a representative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence that followed , like the fact that Colonel Mowbray did not break in before Lieutenant Phillips finished , that Major Blake who had opened his mouth angrily to tell a second lieutenant where he got off , merely left it open , testified to Lieutenant Phillips 's powers of presumption . That dead silence could last only a moment , so Colonel Ross said instantly : " Are n't you making a good many gratuitous assumptions , Phillips ? Did Colonel Mowbray 's office ever , as far as you know , behave unfairly to Negroes ? Had you , at the time , personal knowledge of definite facts that made Mr. Botwinick 's statement to you nonsense ? Unless the answer to those questionsis yes , I suggest you moderate your language . " The glance Lieutenant Phillips gave him told Colonel Ross ( not to his surprise ) that he would get no thanks for his timely intervention . Lieutenant Phillips said indifferently : " Colonel Mowbray wanted to know what impression the messagemade on me . He then seemed to want to know why it made that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of my ability . " " Yes , " Colonel Mowbray said , finding his voice . " You considered the message I sent mostly nonsense . " " I do n't think Lieutenant Phillips meant quite that , Colonel . " Captain Collins spoke without haste or excitement , but firmly and loudly , taking and holding the floor . Captain Collins could see his man getting himself into a jam . Whether Captain Collinsliked or disliked Lieutenant Phillips would not matter much . The proprietary , paternal instinct of command brought him forward to fight for what the Table of Organization said was his . " He was only trying to tell you what he told me at the time . He was not sure that the message actually did come from you . Anyway , he did not understand that he was being given any order , and neither did I. His job , as he saw it , and as I see it , was to act promptly on the War Department directiveto the Commanding General , AFORAD , to clear Mr.p209James . When a directive like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the general will want to , and will , comply with it . Lieutenant Phillips was wrong in his opinion that the matter had not been mentioned to you . I do n't think he was wrong , when that was his opinion , in trying to check with you personally . That is all he did , sir . " " That was not all he did ! " Colonel Mowbray said . " His performance was extraordinary ! Instead of waiting for General Seal 's clearance , he decided to clear the man himself and send him over to the Directorate of Special Projects . Do you deny that , Lieutenant ? " Lieutenant Phillips said icicly : " Certainly I deny that I cleared him myself , or sent him anywhere . That is a **27;3318;TOOLONG , and you have no right to make it . " Adopting his booming courtroom voice , Colonel Ross said : " No one has the right to misrepresent you , Lieutenant . You , on the other hand , have no right to speak impudently to your superior officer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Colonel , I think I am responsible for what my office does . If I may , I will explain as well as I can what was done in this case . I accept all responsibility for the results . " " You do n't have to tell me that ! " Colonel Mowbray said . " Explain , by all means , if you can . Explain to me why that man , who has not been given a clearance , was permitted to leave your office and to wander around the Area unaccom-panied . " " Yes , sir , " Captain Collins said . " Mr. James did not leave our office unaccompanied . I ca n't say how he came to be wandering around later ; but I accept the full responsibility  --  " From down the table , beyond Colonel Coulthard and CaptainSolomon , Major Whitney said : " I do n't think the full responsibility is yours , Captain . Not for his being unaccompanied , or for wandering around . I think I 'll have to take that . Lieutenant Edsell brought him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss with Lieutenant Edsell , so I had the man James escorted out to Special Projects Reception and left there by himself . "  |p210Colonel  Coulthard , with the same half-jealous alacrity CaptainCollins had shown , came forward now to cover his command . He said : " Well , Bill , did you know he had n't been cleared ? Understand he had an Area Pass  --  " he looked at Captain Solomon , who said : " Yes , Colonel . He had . He showed it to me . I can swear to that  --  " Colonel Mowbray said : " A pass does not constitute a clearance . The pass was given him so he could come to the Public Relations Office . It is up to the office that gets the pass issued to comply with regulations . The regulation , and there is no excuse for anyone being ignorant of it , is that a civilian , admitted to the Area on a pass , shall be accompanied at all times by a commissioned officer . " Major Whitney said : " I guess I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was accompanied by Lieutenant Edsell until I ordered Lieutenant Edsell to do something else . I should have provided somebody to stay with him  --  " " I do n't see why you should , " Colonel Coulthard said . " My God , we 're so short-handed now we do n't know where to turn ! Why should we have to provide wet-nurses for people on projects that have nothing whatever to do with our Directorate ? What I want to know is , who assigned Bill 's officer to taking this fellow around ? Bill did n't . Now , who did ? It was Manny , here , who give the man a lift over to the PersonnelAnalysis Auditorium , Pop , if that will clear that up . No reason why Manny should n't . The fellow showed a pass and said he was trying to find Personnel Analysis . That has my approval . I 'll be responsible for that . He had n't any business with us ; so the sooner we got him out , the better . How he got to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Colonel , I gave Lieutenant Edsell permission to go to Captain Collins 's office to see this James . I did n't know he was going to bring him back with him ; but  --  " " Well , now we 're getting somewhere , " Colonel Coulthard said . " Why did you go to see him , Edsell ? What was the idea in bringing him back ? "  |p211Lieutenant  Edsell said : " I wanted to go over because I knew him , and I thought perhaps I could  --  " " Who did you know ? " " Mr. James , Colonel . " Lieutenant Edsell looked at Colonel Coulthard with a faint , elvish or perverse smile . " He 's an old friend of mine . " Colonel Coulthard looked back with the expression you might expect to see on the face of a man , asked to meet someone 's old friend , who found an ostrich nodding civilly to him , or a horse holding out his hoof . Lieutenant Edsell let his smile grow a little . " I brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to talk to him . We had a project yesterday , I was working on it with Captain Andrews , for Personnel Analysis , which I could see was related to this colored bomb project . I thought I might be able to help with the clearance . I had been talking to Colonel Jobson 's Executive about the other , our project . I thought if I told him Al James was O.K. , he might be willing to tell Colonel Mowbray that Personnel Analysis approved the clearance . I was , of course , unacquainted with Major Blake 's racial prejudice  --  " Major Blake said : " You 're unacquainted with a lot of things , Lieutenant . If you thought I 'd approve a clearance without Colonel Jobson 's knowledge , you 're even stupider than you look . Now , suppose you leave me out of this . " Lieutenant Edsell said almost gleefully : " Where I 'll leave you is just where I found you , Fatso ! In case you want to make anything out of it , take those brass leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wax your whiskers for you  --  " " Here , here , Edsell  --  " Colonel Coulthard said . Major Blake who , though fat , looked in good shape , more than a match for Edsell , pushed his chair back , getting to his feet . " Silence ! " Colonel Mowbray roared . " Both of you ! Sit down , 1'van ! Are you crazy ? As for you , Lieutenant- " Colonel Ross said : " Major , you seem to have offended these young men by calling their friend a nigger . It is an opprobrious term . Neither the War Department nor the Army Air Forces countenances its use to or about colored persons . If you mustp212use it , use it in the privacy of your office or your quarters . Lieutenant , the epithet you applied to the Major is also opprobrious . If I understood you to be challenging him to a fist fight , you are insubordinate and disorderly . You will both state in my presence that you withdraw your expressions . Lieutenant ? " Lieutenant Edsell looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I withdraw them  --  if he does . " " And do you , Major ? " " Yes , sir ; if this is an order . " " It is an order . " " In compliance with your direct order , sir , I withdraw my expression . " Lieutenant Edsell 's lips went through a sneer ; but he turned it , for present practical purposes decorously enough , Colonel Ross decided , toward the floor beside him . Colonel Ross said : " Pop , I think I 'm the only one who 's had anything to eat . How about all of you getting some lunch ? I think we now have a clear enough idea of what happened . I have an inspection at two o'clock . I 'd like a statement , for my own information , and for the record , on the final action taken about Mr. James . Who handled it ? Johnny ? And did Mr. James actually interview project personnel ? " Major Sears looked at Lieutenant Kashkin , who said : " He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how long , nor what about . My orders were to find him , lift his pass , and escort him to the gate . " He glanced at a little notebook in his hand . " I found James at one one four five hours outside the Personnel Analysis Auditorium , in conversation with project military personnel . I advised him , as I was instructed , that his presence in the Area had not been authorized , and he would have to leave . He did not make any trouble . There were some remarks made by project military personnel in the vicinity of the auditorium entrance , which I ignored . No one attempted to interfere . I entered a squad car with James and rode with him to the gate . I personally saw James off the Area . I observed that he took an Ocanara bus . " " Thank you . " Colonel Ross said . " Could we now adjourn , Pop ? "  | " Yes , " Colonel Mowbray said . " That will be all for now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to ask you . " When the others were out the door , he said , lowering his voice , anxiously inquisitive : " This business of Colonel Woodman at Sellers . He was Bus 's first squadron CO , you know . " " Yes , I know , " Colonel Ross said . " I think it hit Bus pretty hard . Do you know anything more about it ? I just heard the bare details , what Botty got from Vera . Is there anything we ought to do about it ? Anything we could do about it ? " " I 'm afraid not , " Colonel Ross said . THE CAR slowed and halted . Seeing the card with the colonel 's eagle and the words Base Administrative Inspector on the windshield , the two guards started up from the bench under a little canvas tilt and saluted . One of them ran across the road and unhooked the chain from which depended a sign : WAC AREAOFF LIMITS . When the car moved again , Colonel Ross lifted his sun helmet and fanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clip board with the check sheets , and looked at the list on top of them . " Then , the last thing , " he said . " General Beal called  --  " " Why did n't you tell me that first ? " Colonel Ross said irritably . Undisturbed , Sergeant Brooks said : " The general said it was n't important , Judge . He only wanted you to know he was back . He asked where you were going to be , and I told him he could reach you through the Staff Director 's office , here . He said not to bother you ; but when you got through , he wanted you to come around . He was going to get some lunch . That is all , sir . " Colonel Ross said , " Oh , Lord ! " They were approaching now the yellow-painted framep214building which housed the Staff Director 's Office and DetachmentAdministration . In front of it , in the stunning blaze of early afternoon , about twenty WAC officers were drawn up in a double row at attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention , stood Captain Burton , the Staff Director . " Who in God 's name told them to do that ? " Colonel Ross said . " It must be a hundred and ten in the sun , there . She must be crazy  --  " The car came to a stop . Colonel Ross got out of it heavily , and pulled himself up a little , answering the salute . He could see sweat running on the nearer faces , stiffly and ostentatiously eyes-front . " Good afternoon , Captain , " he said . " At ease , everybody ! Fall out , before you melt  --  " There was a simultaneous relaxing murmur of sighs , little groans of relief , and a few giggles . The formation broke up . Captain Burton , a large stout woman , produced a handkerchief and wiped her face , which was almost scarlet . To her officers , she said : " Company commanders in the staff room , please . Others are dismissed . " Colonel Ross said : " Captain , I think in the future @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . We could work out some kind of a schedule so that there will be a company officer at each barracks building when we reach it . I do n't think it will be necessary to assemble them first . " Captain Burton said : " I see , sir . I thought possibly you would want to inspect the company officers as a group  --  personal appearance . They understand they are to set a proper standard for the enlisted women to emulate and respect . They are a very fine body of girls , Colonel , and I think they do set a high standard . " " So do I , " Colonel Ross said . " They do you credit , Captain . Are there any general matters , before we begin ? " Captain Burton , her broad and beefy but not unhandsome face regaining some of the scarlet it had begun to lose when they got into the shadows of the hall , said : " I 'm afraid there is one matter , rather unpleasant , Colonel . That is why I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him into a long narrow room with unfinished board walls . Two big fans were stirring the warm air andp215Colonel Ross took off his helmet gratefully . " I thought we might sit here , " Captain Burton said . She drew out a chair for him at the head of the table , a gesture of deference , whether to his rank or to his gray hairs , which Colonel Ross found irritating . " Yes , close the door , " she said , " and sit down , all of you . " Sitting down herself beside Colonel Ross , she said : " This is a matter I do n't quite know what to do about , Colonel ; but I felt it should be brought to your attention . A number of women made the same complaint to their officers , and I will ask those officers , or some of them , to give you any details you may want . " She paused awkwardly . " In general , " she said , " we are not very well satisfied with the arrangements the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . It is n't convenient , having to send them all over there ; but I quite understand that until the infirmary here in the Area is finished , those are the nearest adequate facilities . Though , of course , they are n't adequate , either , Colonel . The girls reportinghave no proper place to undress . It is right next to an orderly room , or something of the sort , used by male enlisted personnel . Though I think disciplinary action was taken in one case , some of the men continue to make little holes or openings through the walls so they can see in , and the girls know that , and I think if they ca n't stop the men from doing it , then they must give them a different room . I brought the matter up with Major McCreery , but he said there was no other room , and anyway , a thorough inspection did not disclose any such holes now . There had been some , but they had been stopped up . From what I am told , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in such a way that they can be , and are , reopened whenever the girls are undressing , and then covered up , so anyone inspecting does n't find them . " " I see , " Colonel Ross said , sternly putting down the ribald , highly unsuitable impulse to laugh . " I will discuss the matter with Major McCreery . I think I can promise you that it will be corrected at once . Make a note of that , Steve . " Captain Burton cleared her throat . " That is one thing , Colonel . The other is in connection with the same thing . Therejp216have been specific complaints , quite a number of them , that the Medical Officers , or some of them , at any rate , regularly make vulgar and obscene comments to the personnel they are examining . There has been some difficulty in identifying the officers in question  --  the girls have no way of knowing their names  --  but we pretty well identified one of them as a Captain Raimondi  --  " She looked down the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you tell Colonel Ross what your girls told you ? " " Yes , ma'am . " Colonel Ross looked down the table . Lieutenant Lippa had a sober , pug-nosed little face . She arose and stood straight , showing a neat little figure . She said : " In the course of the last two weeks , sir , four enlisted women came to me separately and said they did not want to go over to the Base Hospital for PI . I thought this might be due to extreme shyness , bashfulness ; and I tried to overcome it , reassure them . I asked them what , specifically , they objected to . Thev were reluctant to say anythingspecific , at first . But I finally learned that , in addition to those peep holes in the wall , the Medical Officers , in the course of the required pelvic examination , often made coarse remarks to them and sometimes treated them with undue familiarity . " She paused , grave and alert . The little pug face , Colonel Ross observed , was one that grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sir , that none of them , none of my women , accuse any Medical Officer of attempting to assault her , anything like that . There were just these wisecracks and unnecessary liberties  --  " " It is still despicable ! " Captain Burton said . " Taking advantage of a girl that way ! I asked Lieutenant Lippa and the other officers who had the same complaint made to them , to note down the exact remarks . I have a list of them , which I can turn over to you , Colonel . Some of them are so obscene and offensivethat I hesitated to have them typed out . Furthermore there is reason to believe that those who complained were not by any means the only ones who were obliged to submit to it  --  that some Medical Officers , at least , made a regular practice of insulting all the girls they examined . Go on , Mary . " Lieutenant Lippa , her face grave and intent  --  you could see that here would be a first-rate company officer ; the small , quaint ,  |p217grave  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most troubled people as a present comfort and a reassuring promise of help  --  said : " Well , sir , after the second one had come to me , I thought I 'd better make a check . So I talked to a number of others , women I knew to be particularly truthful and intelligent , to find out whether they had any similar experience . Two or three told me they had not ; but most of them admitted that there were wisecracks , more or less regularly . One said that a Medical Officer did try to get fresh with her ; but  --  " the trace of a triumphant feminine smile appeared around Lieutenant Lippa 's mouth "  --  she managed to give him a good hard kick . So he stopped ; and she did n't have any more trouble . " Colonel Ross , wholly won over , repressed a smile of his own . He said : " Was this officer , who had to be kicked , identified ? " " Well , sir , " Lieutenant Lippa said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Captain Burton mentioned ; but she , this woman , did n't want to make a fuss . She said she guessed he was just fooling ; only she did n't feel like being fooled with ; and after she made that clear , he stopped . " Captain Burton said : " Naturally enough , none of these girls wants to be called as a witness , to have to testify , or anything . I think the Medical Officers concerned know that ; and that is why they behave that way . " " Yes , " Colonel Ross said . " We must remember it 's one of those charges that can easily be made against an innocent man ; so even when we 're sure it 's true , there would have to be very conclusive evidence . I would rather see what I can do by having a talk with the Medical Officers who make the examinations . " Captain Burton said : " I think , Colonel , Lieutenant Lippa has a suggestion to make in this connection . " She looked at Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants her best pupil to show off a little and thus do them both credit . " May she make it , sir ? " " By all means , " Colonel Ross said . " Let 's hear it , Lieutenant . " Lieutenant Lippa said : " I do n't know whether it 's practicable or not , sir ; but I wondered whether , instead of sending our women over to the Base Hospital , we could n't have them sendp220he could not tell a lie . There was the Letter Order . Colonel Mowbray had laid a tortuous train which , fired at any point , must lead to this resounding mess . By bad luck , Benny might punch the wrong person in the nose ; by bad luck , Mr. James might arrive at Ocanara on the worst possible day and get himself turned loose in the worst possible place ; by bad luck Mr. James 's telegram of protest would be carried upstairs and laid on the desk between Colonel Jobson and the Chief of Air Staff ; but if it were n't any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colonel Ross could have wished that Wilbur Wright had never taught Pop to fly . At this point , he could even wish that Wilbur Wright and bright young Lieutenant Mowbray had broken their damn necks in the historic cow pasture . He said : " So now what ? " General Beal said uneasily : " I do n't think we can do what we were planning to do , not the way you planned it . They want action taken at once . " " What action ? " " They want us to amend the Letter Order by adding two paragraphs to read roughly  --  wait ; yes , give me that , Vera . All right , Judge , I 'm reading Paragraph Four : In order to promote the close integration essential in a self-sustaining combat unit , all project personnel will use the same facilities , as assigned in Paragraph Two above . They will regard as off limits AFORAD Area facilities provided for permanent party personnel , with the exception of the Post Office , the Finance Office , the Main Post Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Directorate of Personnel Analysis Center as may from time to time be assigned for lectures or demonstrations . ' End paragraph . Paragraph Five . This order will be distributed to each officer presently assigned to Directorateof Personnel Analysis Project **35;3347;TOOLONG , and will be read by each officer and returned by him to this Headquarters when he has accomplished the first indorsement form below certifying that he has read the order and that he fully understands it . ' End paragraph . End order . " Colonel Ross said glumly , getting time to think : " In Para/graph Five , make them take out ' presently , ' Bus ; and farther down , put when he has signed ' instead of when he has accomplished . ' In Paragraph Four , add to the exceptions : dispensary , chapel . Do we want to deny them medical care and religious consolation ? Who 's going to handle this , and when ? " General Beal said : " Hear that , Vera ? Please change those things for the Judge . Well , I 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four . I ordered Personnel Analysis to assemble the men at four-thirty . Here 's how it was put to me ; I got myself into this , I would have to get myself out of it . So maybe I 'd better handle it myself , not delegate it . I would n't want Pop to do it , certainly . " " No , " said Colonel Ross . " Let 's not have him do anything more . " He did not intend the tone to be so pettish ; but it broke from his control . " Do n't take that , Vera , " he said . " And , like a good girl , get off the line . I might say something else we wo n't need a copy of . " " Me , too , " General Beal said . He laughed shortly . " You can hang up now , Vera . " Colonel Ross said : " Bus , can you tell me anything more about the attitude in Washington ? Were those paragraphs dictated to you as a suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered to ? " " Judge , can you tell one from the other , coming out of there ? It was an authorized course of action ; but the heat was right on me . I got myself into it ; I get myself out of it  --  but quick , but quiet . I have an idea there may be trouble of the same kind somewhere else . I know there has been a little trouble in the Training Command , in Texas . Club stuff . That 's what Pop was thinking of . It 's a damn hard thing , you know . You have in training , say , a big group of white bombardiers and a very small group of colored bombardiers . The Training Command , the AAF , does n't give a hoot in hell what color skin a bombardierhas , just so he 's been trained to dump it on the target  --  or , if our big friends ever want to stop kidding themselves , within a few thousand feet of the target . It 's a tough course , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CO has got to produce on the deadline . He gives with the bombardiers ; orp222else ! If the big group is going to sulk around because the little group drinks beer with them , there 's a morale problem . If one group or the other is going to be demoralized , which group would it better be ? " Colonel Ross said : " There 's no use going into that . Let 's stick to what we do now . " He looked at the blank board-wall on which was centered a poster showing three wooden crosses , one capped with a banged-up steel helmet , against a clouded sky . It said : Women ! They ca n't do any more  --  but you can ! Join the WAC now ! Colonel Ross said : " You 're holding the bag , Bus . If you follow their suggestion , and that does n't get you out of it , it 's going to develop that you should have had more judgment than to follow their suggestion . You were there ; you knew the conditions obtaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; a suggestion out of HqAAF could not be distinguished from an order for the good reason that every suggestion restated an order , detailing or delimiting it . Here , the order was : you are directed to get yourself out of this in a hurry . The suggestion defined out of this ' for you . To be considered successful or satisfactory , your escape must work all the ends implicit in the suggestion . Rightly read , read this way , Paragraph Four said : In getting out of this , you will repair injury to morale by somehow persuading project personnel that the order is acceptable to them . Paragraph Five said : In getting out of this , you will not undermine discipline by causing anyone to imagine that you gave ground under pressure , and so might do it again . Taken together , they said : In getting out of this , you will under no circumstances , by any action of yours , make such a stink that HqAAF , to the detrimentof the war effort and to its own great embarrassment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juggling a red hot poker while it squares enunciated theory with expedient practice . Not added ( but only because Major General Beal surely knew it by this time ) was : Failure to comply with these orders , for any reason at all , will constitute disobedience and insubordination ; so , watch yourself , Mac !  |p223Colonel  Ross said : " Bus ; add Paragraph Four to the order . Omit Paragraph Five . I will read the amended order to them , and then dismiss them . Nothing could possibly be gained by giving them the indorsement to sign . Nothing could possibly be gained by having you read it yourself . In the first case , somebody will , sure as fate , hold his hand up and say : I ca n't sign this . I do n't fully understand this ' ; and you might have fifty men in arrest by five o'clock . In the second case , if I read it , and somebody sounds off in the back , I do n't have to hear . You do ; you 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as they find out what they 're assembled for , as soon as they hear the order , they 'll know that we know what they were planning . They 'll have a couple of hours to decide whether to go on with it . We 'll have to handle the Club differently . Johnny can get his men there at four-thirty and keep them there . The officer who is acting Provost Marshal will have to be stationed at the door and refuse them admission , if they show up . The other was the best bet ; but after reading the order , we ca n't pretend it was just a misunderstanding on their part . " General Beal said : " Can we be sure it will work , Judge ? If I follow their suggestion exactly and do n't get out of it , that 's bad , all right . But if I do n't follow it exactly , and do n't get out of it , that 's worse . " Colonel Ross said , " You have it the wrong way . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Follow their suggestion exactly . You 'll have it . The other way you might not . " " You think we are n't just dodging the issue ? " General Beal paused . " I have word Jo-Jo Nichols will be in , six , seven o'clock . He would still have been at the Pentagon when this broke . He 's going to know about it , know what they suggested . I do n't exactly like having to tell him I did something else . " He paused again . " Jo-Jo 's a very good guy , Judge . I do n't know whether you know him or not . He would n't trot back with any stories he did n't have to tell . But I know they trust him , up there ; and he knows they trust him  --  you would n't find him not-seeing anything a Deputy Chief of Staff ought to see . I sort of wish I could get it cleaned up before he came in. "  | " There is n't any way , " Colonel Ross said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I guess so , " General Beal said . " We certainly screwed up that business with this James man . That 's why we 're up the creek , here . Without that  --  well , it 's too late now . Pop told me about your meeting . " " It was his meeting , " Colonel Ross said . " Well , I guess you 'll agree I 'd better blitz those two lieutenants . Pop thinks the Eleventh Air Force might be a good place for them . That could be arranged . They 're short on most MOS 's up there . They 'd better find out they 're in the Army . " Colonel Ross drew a breath . " For the love of God , Bus , " he exploded . " Never mind what Pop thinks ! Just think yourself ! It is alleged we are discriminating against Negroes . We put a reporter off the post . There were two men who tried to work a clearance for him . Next thing they know , they 're out on a rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard , one of them writes for magazines . " General Beal said , " O.K. , o.k . Do n't you blow your top , too , Judge ! Everybody else around here has . And come over as soon as you get clear , will you ? Pop just thought  --  " " He never did ! He never did in his life ! " Colonel Ross hung up without ceremony , somewhat shaken to hear himself pronounce so poor a jibe with so much ill-temper . Normally profane or not , for the second time today , and fervently , he said : God damn hint to hell ! He meant Pop , poor old Pop ; but the feeling was the enragedfeeling he had about Woody , poor , no doubt , if not so old Woody , whose little weaknesses ( like Pop 's , too much indulgedby those around him ) could be counted on to make mess after mess faster than anyone panting along behind could hope to clean them up . And who panted along behind ? Poor old Judge ; poor old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He got no help ; it was all up to him ; something he could take care of in his spare time . Wiping his forehead , Colonel Ross got hold of himself sternly and marched out of the room . To Captain Burton , wait/ing for him in the hall , he said : " Sorry to keep you waiting . Shall we get on with it ? " At half-past three Colonel Ross , followed by Captain Burton and Sergeant Brooks , came up the plank walk laid on the loose sand , burning in the sun , to the screened doors of the WAC Detachment Mess . He pushed the screened doors open and walked blinking into the shadows . The usual taut , agitated , female voice called out : " Attention ! " " At ease , " said Colonel Ross . He looked at the line of cooks and bakers , kitchen police and dining room orderlies ranged stiffly down the side of the room . Captain Burton said : " This is Lieutenant Miller , the Mess Officer , Colonel . And Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Yes , " said Colonel Ross . Blinking , he said to Lieutenant Turck : " How are you , young lady . Thought you worked in Files ? " Captain Burton said : " In accordance with Headquarters policy instructions , Colonel , we have arranged a schedule to ensure rotationof duty assignments of junior officers in order that they may receive experience in all detachment duties . The assignmentof Mess Officer is made in addition to other duties . " " Quite so ; quite right , " Colonel Ross said . " I would like these two officers , the Mess Sergeant , the First Cook , to go along with me . Other personnel may return to whatever they were doing , or if they were n't now on duty , they may be dis-missed . " " Yes , sir , " Lieutenant Miller said . " This is Sergeant De Luca , the Mess Sergeant , and Sergeant Loveman , First Cook . " " Come along , please . We 'll look at the kitchen . First of all ; Bulletin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Menu for the Day ; Food Handlers ' Cards  --  all these up to date , Sergeant ? " " Yes , sir . " " Names of cooks posted , yes ; name of Mess Sergeant , name of Mess Officer . All right , check off , Steve . Now , let 's see.  |p226Floor  ; scrubbed , rinsed , mopped dry ; baseboard clean , corners clean . Very good , Sergeant . Stoves . Tops clean ; open all ovens , please . O.K. Work table , O.K. ; serving counter , O.K. ; meat block  --  that has a crack , Sergeant . " " Yes , sir . We have a new one requisitioned . We ca n't seem to get it . " Lieutenant Miller said : " I believe they had to send to some Army Service Forces depot , sir . They say it has n't come . " " If they still say that Monday , you must stir them up a little , Lieutenant  --  that will be you , Lieutenant Turck . Note it inspected and condemned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " Can we use it tonight , sir ? " " Not if I am here to see it . I will not be here . Now , the ice boxes , please  --  " As NATHANIEL HICKS stepped out the door of the Directorate of Fighter Analysis Administration Building he saw Lieutenant Turck pass , striding fast and erect along the cinder walk . Though Fighter Analysis Administration was not , like the Headquarters Quadrangle , completely air-conditioned , Colonel Folsom , as a Directorate Chief , rated one portable window unit in his office . From the cool room , you walked into heat that seemed solid , dense as water . The surface of the paved road beyond the path wavered away , shakily reduplicated , trembling in a mirage which , a hundred feet off , was a foot from the ground . Up the road , the group of library buildings and the pines left standing around them trembled too . The clear sky looked pale , filmed with hot dust . Breathed , the burning air half-suffocated you . Lengthening his own stride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came beside her , turning her composed face which shone with a dew of sweat . When she saw who it was , she drew a breath . She said : " The Lybian air adust  --  do you care for Milton ? I try and try ; but , no ! I thought , Captain , you were to be off into the wild blue yonder.  |p227Did  you get to see the general ? " She held a step , fell back , and came up on his left . " Excuse me , sir , " she said . " We have just been inspected at the mess within an inch of our lives and I am now very much in accordance with regulations , rules of military courtesy , and customs of the service . " " I thought you did n't have to take over until Monday . " " I do n't , thank God . But Captain Burton thought I 'd better see what I was going to be up against . It was Colonel Ross . He is a nice old lamb ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will help you when he sees a roach in the store room , you are wrong , as our Lieutenant Miller found . There was also a little difficulty about outside purchases from the General Mess Fund . I shall have to get , and worse , read , TM ten-dash-two-oh-five ; TM ten-dash-two-fifty ; TM tendash-three-ten ; TM ten-dash-four-oh-five . Either that , or leave it all to the Mess Sergeant , which would probably be easier and better . But she is a very fat girl and her Christian or given name  --  not a nickname ; she signs the pay roll with it  --  is Billie . The combination makes me uneasy . I do not think she is firm with the little slatterns and sneak-thieves under her . What about the general ? " " It was somewhat complicated , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I was to go off right away on a grand tour of our outlying installations ; but other matters came up ; there was a certain loss of interest in me ; I could not get hold of Colonel Mowbray who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do everything I wanted . So finally I called Operations and told the general 's pilot  --  how do you like that ?  --  who was standing by with a plane , that we were not going anywhere . I do n't think it went down very well . He had been waiting some time . I expect I wo n't go until Monday . Though , of course , as soon as I dismissed my pilot , the Adjutant General'soffice called and said to pick up my paper , it was done . Just then , they brought me a TWX from Orlando saying my Captain Wiley was flying over and ought to be here by fourthirty . He was n't supposed to come today . Is all this inter-esting ? "  | " Very , " Lieutenant Turck said . " It has the bustle and stir of life . Do go on , Nat . " " Well , I have plenty more , " Nathaniel Hicks said , not unawarethat it was the first time she had called him by name . " While I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave him Lieutenant Lippa 's note , which he seemed glad to get ; but he remarked that he would probably be in the guard house over the weekend ; so then he got to telling me how he had pinned back Colonel Mowbray 's ears and terrorized several other officers of field grade in the course of a conference they had just been having on a little administrative snafu that involved us . So , when I had stood all I could , I remembered I had to see Colonel Folsom . So I went and got my letter , which proved to be a good idea . When the colonel , with whom I was not on speaking terms last week , took a look at that , our relations improved wonderfully . What I really went in for was to ask him if he would give a job to a man who asked me if I would ask him if he would . He said he 'd see ; he thought he could arrange it . Well , it looks as though , from now on , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around here . " " I will have no trouble remembering , " Lieutenant Turck said . They were in front of the library buildings . " Would it get me anywhere if I invited you to my office and fetched you a bottle of Coca-Cola ? We have a machine that really works ; so they come out cold . " " That would usually be a deal , thanks , Amanda , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " But I have to send a message to the man about Folsom ; and then , Wiley . I have to pop over  --  his phrase ; he 's an Alabama boy ; but the RAF corrupted him a little  --  to the Base ; welcome him ; get him a place to stay ; and take him to the Officers Club and give him a few slugs from that bottle with my name on it  --  you see how it is . There are so many demands on me . " " I want but little , " Lieutenant Turck said . " Just get me promoted to first lieutenant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the Area in a lovely apartment or snuggery I happen to know we can rent . You might mention those things when you talk to the general again . Be seeing you , I hope , sir . "  |p229She  pulled herself up , saluted him precisely , and went into the library entry . The plane was a beat-up P-4o with stained and flaking camouflagepaint . It came noisily around after the jeep with the sign : FOLLOW ME , and aligned itself in the row of parked planes . The engine revved up , shaking the wings until they seemed about to fall off , and , with a pop or two , fell silent . Emerging from its blur , the propeller took shape in expiring slow twirls . Captain Wiley , wearing a white coverall and a white cloth helmet whose strap was unbuttoned , erected himself in the cockpit . He lifted a hand to Nathaniel Hicks , put a long leg out on the wing , and jumped down . " How 's that ? " he said . " Jesus , I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a real old-time son of a bitch ! " He gave the shabby fuselage a punch . " First , I could n't get the landing gear up . Could n't find the damn handle . " He began to laugh . " Never checked out on the son of a bitch , " he said . " Told the Operations Officer ; sure , sure , just like the Kittyhawk . Only , never flew one of those either . Why tell him that ? Here , " he said to the ground crew corporal who had rammed the chocks under the wheels and now stood waiting , " Here 's your paper , son . Never mind anybody servicing this . God Almighty could n't service it . " He turned and began to untwist a wire which apparently was all that held the storage compartment door closed . He jerked out an old musette bag and a frayed manila envelope full of papers . He said : " Say , Nat ; I did n't know whether you expectedme today ; only , for God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer Sunday . So I got to get back tomorrow . So I figured maybe I 'd better come this afternoon . O.K. ? " " Fine , Gene , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I have a car right over there . " Captain Wiley stood about six feet four . Being unusually tall , without being unusually heavy , he looked thin , but he was very strong and solidly made . Fitting himself into the cockpit of a fighter plane took skill and ingenuity ; and Nathaniel Hicks hadp230heard , when he was in Orlando , Wiley 's Division Chief kidding him about flying a Spitfire with his legs over the sides . Captain Wiley 's face , with a big wide mouth , big strong nose , big dark eyes which he had a habit of narrowing at the corners , was remarkablefor an almost satin tone of skin , and a coloring , warm and even , that , in a woman , would certainly be considered beautiful . In his movements , Captain Wiley showed traces of the awkwardnesscommon to people who are taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not ashamed or embarrassed , and consequently belligerent , as undersized men often are ; but being oversized meant being conspicuous , even if in a manly and agreeable way ; and he felt it . So many people must have kidded him about where he put his legs in a plane , or asked him wittily whether it was cold up there , that he was ready , whenever anyone looked at him , with a mobile , goodnaturedsmile ; and , if the subject was pressed , the ejaculation of a few filthy words , genially spoken and in his mouth so worn with use that they sounded quite clean and innocuous . Captain Wiley stood on the ramp , smiling down at NathanielHicks for a moment , rocking gently from his heels to his toes . " Hell , " he said , " I better get out of this . They probablypeg you for wearing it off the line . " He began to remove his white flying clothes . On the cloth helmet Nathaniel Hicks observed a bit of tape printed in ink : P/O @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , littler , bit : F/O Dell . It occurred to Nathaniel Hicks that these articles belonged once to members of the squadron who had been killed . Their flying kits were divided , for a complexityof reasons ; beginning with the economical consideration that somebody might as well get the use of them ; but unquestionablygoing on to a casual , tough gesture in real or affected contempt of death ; and , beyond that , to obscurities of meaning where deep feeling might mix with the usual mawkishness to say : though they were dead , yet shall they live ; they were not forgotten , and they would not be unrevenged . Underneath , Captain Wiley proved to be wearing eightpoint-twopants , somewhat short for him , and a bleached chinop231shirt with the sleeves rolled up . The captain 's bars on his open collar were tarnished until they looked like gun-metal . Above his left breast pocket he had a pair of illegal miniature wings , and the diagonally blue-and-white-striped ribbon of the British Distinguished Flying Cross . Above his right breast pocket he had faded Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Taking a soiled overseas cap from his back pocket , he unfoldedit and propped it , Royal Air Force fashion , over one ear . " Wait , " he said . " I better take that damn parachute ! I do n't want that swiped . You ca n't get them like this here . This one has n't been unpacked for three years , so I know it 's all right . " When he had dragged it out of the cockpit and slung it cumbersomelyover his shoulder Nathaniel Hicks was not surprised to read on the cover : F/O Johnson . Since Flying Officer Johnsonwould not be likely to have a spare parachute in his locker or quarters , there was a good chance that this one had been recovered from the plane in which he died . Captain Wiley , seeing the car , said : " Say , this is all right ! I got to get me a car in Orlando , if I stay . It 's like here ; the School of Applied Tactics is way the hell out in the woods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you enough gas ? Another thing : it lets you take her away from it all . Fine for Operation Nooky . " Lolling in the seat , his shoulder and long bare arm half out the window , he said : " How are you coming with this Folsom jerk , that his name ? Do n't let him give you any , Nat . On Malta 's where I 'd like to see those nice types  --  three , five interceptions a day . Shakes the dust off you ! " They had reached the gate . " Patience , Bud , " Captain Wiley said to the guard . He contorted himself , got a wallet from his back pocket , and waved open an isinglass face with his folded AGO card under it . The guard said : " Excuse me , Captain . In case you 're a transient , I have to inform you you will be out of uniform anywhere in Ocanara after seventeen hundred hours without a necktie . It is now seventeen ten . " " Thanks , pal , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " From his trousers pocket he extracted a handkerchief , and , tangledwith it , a crushed and wrinkled necktie.  |p232The  guard said : " Sleeves are also required to be rolled down and buttoned , sir . " " Be right there , " Captain Wiley said . " How 's about my fly ? Closed or open after seventeen hundred ? " Under the white square of a screen on which motion pictures could be projected Colonel Ross sat waiting . Major Blake and a lieutenant from Major Blake 's office were on the raised platformwith him . The lieutenant , standing to the front with a list in his hand was engaged in calling the roll . Major Blake sat at a bare table next to Colonel Ross . He had the roster sheets spread out and was checking names as the responses came . The Personnel Analysis Auditorium , which could seat severalhundred , echoed emptily behind eighty or ninety men in the front rows . It was very warm . It seemed warmer because floodlights , hanging from the beams of a half-dozen , great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the roof , were turned on . Between the few windows , the dingy , concrete-block walls were decorated with pictorial charts , bold in line and color , having to do with AAF personnel . On one chart little blue men marched briskly into tubes displayedlike veins or arteries , the various times of entrance beingindicated by a list of months along the margin . The tubes swept down , approaching each other , joining . Toward the bottom , all merged ; and , two years after the first little blue men ( pilots ) entered , out came : ONE COMBAT GROUP . Another showed , foreshortened , the picture of a B- 17 , bombbaydoors open , bombs tumbling against a ghastly sky filled in letters of flame by the words : Bombs Away ! Below , was stated starkly : What it takes  --  . Files of rigid scarlet mannikins showed how many men it took in Air Crew , in Operations , in Maintenance , in Transportation , in Administration , in Housekeeping , for just that one bomber . Much of the wall opposite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE ARMY AIR FORCES . Square-jawed sil/houettes standing at parade rest succeeded each other . They grew from an homunculus four inches high , labeled 1938 , to a prodigy thirteen feet high , labeled 1944Colonel Ross eyed these charts , which , while not uninteresting , did not interest him at the moment . He sat motionless , his mind troubled , breathing with a sense of weariness and oppression  --  theheat of this cavernous hall ; the hard long day ; the dubious , disagreeable job . He had taken another pill before coming in . He attended the far-off ringing in his ears with glum bemusement , for no gain in cheer or assurance could be expected if he diverted thought from himself to the business on hand . He had tried that . As soon as he sat down he had begun dispassionately to look over the assembled personnel of Project **36;3384;TOOLONG , to judge their temper as a group ; and , if he could , to identify what was probably no more than the handful of hardy spirits on whom any organized action must depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that each man  --  they were boys , really  --  feeling Colonel Ross 's eyes on him , glanced aside . This was natural enough . Boys planning mischief , or knowing of mischief that was planned , acted this way whenever they found authority looking at them . It was not these boys ' fault that the movement of white eyeballs in dark faces was more noticeable than the movement of white eyeballs in white faces . It was not fair to form the conclusion that they were an unusually furtive , sullen , and shifty lot . On the other hand , it was not easy for a man , tired , irritated by difficulties not of his making , and maybe , beyond his power to resolve , to practice a full , calm fairness ; to remember that this furtiveness , sullenness , shiftiness were conclusions , reached in his own mind , existing only there  --  not qualities inherent in those he looked at . Looked at sympathetically , with friendlinessor good will , the ill-ease showed by these boys might be appealing they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing injustices of their world ; they had overcome great handicaps , with little or no assistance , in order to sit here as commissioned officers . Those who wore the wings of pilots , navigators , bombardiers could be regarded as achieving morep234than white men who wore the same wings . It had been harder for them to get the early schooling , simple as that was , which would fit them to enter the training courses . It was fair to form the conclusion that they were an unusually sensitive , intelligent , and courageous lot . That this was the right view , that reason must in justice endowthem with qualities like these , was Colonel Ross 's settled conviction . His difficulty in interrupting the vicious progression , born in resentment at the heavy burden of trouble that they put on him , and at each stage assisted by this resentment , exercisedhim . From the unfavorable judgment passed by the irritablemind on that shift of eyeballs , resentment would go on to stir a deeper antipathy . To see where you were going you did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did stop himself at the first step ; yet a reflective man must be disturbed to know that he has such stuff in him , ready to be jarred off , like a chemical or physical chain reaction . It would be almost a relief to let his brooding mind rest on himself , desponding over these slight telltale symptoms of the stroke he was going to have if he did not take care ; and the thought of death which , after that , a man ought to see as a friend , yet seldom did . This would not do , either . Granted , the miserable condition of humanity , the corrupted , unsound mind in the unsound body , both unnerved by aging . It remained necessary to make a shift at bearing yourself like a man ; not mumping , not moping . Staringat the big pictorial charts , Colonel Ross set himself to his task . In a minute or two now , it would be up to him . It was time to consider what , if anything , he wanted to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order  --  Major Blake : Major Blake 's lieutenant , for that matter  --  he must have come hoping to accomplish something else . Why , then , was he here ? What decided him to come ? There was a plain answer to that . He came because he did not think General Beal ought to be here . He was here because there was no one on the gen/eral 's staff that he would trust  --  not , trust to fix the matter up ; he was uncertain that he could fix it up himself ; but trust to avoid making the matter much worse . Mowbray ; Jobson , if he were in Ocanara ; Johnny Sears , as Provost Marshal  --  each of them , if he had n't shown often a basic lack of judgment , had sometimes shown himself liable to sudden losses of judgment . Colonel Ross did not mean to say that they were complete fools  --  not even Pop . In some ways Pop was astute . It was the habit of all of them to look straight , and not very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did those , not vaguely or stupidly , but in an experienced firm way . Then they waited until whatever was going to happen , happened . They sized this up , noted whatever new duties there were , and did those . Their position was that of a chess player who had in his head no moves beyond the one it was now his turn to make . He would be dumbfounded when , after he had made four or five such moves ( each sensible enough in itself ) sudden catastrophe , from an unexpected direction by an unexpected means , fell on him , and he was mated . Colonel Ross could not risk it . Somebodywould have to look out for Bus , and it must n't be one of those people . They would do no better than Bus himself . That he , Colonel Ross , should be ready , should even , under the weariness and oppression of the hour , be eager to save Bus from these other officers , and from Bus himself , touched his favorite speculation about motives in men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where , just as naturally , it was most obscure . What motives had he ? He weighed the general ; in this matter he found him wanting . He then dismissed the finding , usually of the first consequence , as , here , of no consequence . Clearly , he acted for cause ; and it occurred to him , though it did not soften his opinions on the subject , that in some ways , and perhaps some important ways , his relationship to the generalmight resemble the general 's relationship to Benny Carricker . General Beal might jealously brood , irrationally dote , on his honey of a flying , fighting Benny . That far-from-paragon , that difficult , erratic brat , put only one real claim on General Beal ; Benny needed somebody to look out for him ; and whop236else was there ? Who else would ? Who else could ? Benny , no doubt , did all anyone had a right to expect of him if he just allowed General Beal to serve him well . Major Blake 's lieutenant called : " Willis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer . Suddenly roused by the name , Colonel Ross turned his head and said : " Check him off . I know about him . " Somebody from the rows of seats said then : " In hospital  --  " There was a stir and a subdued murmuring noise . The lieutenant faced about and said to Major Blake : " All present or accounted for , then , sir . " Major Blake lifted himself from his chair . He touched one end of his mustache . Leaning forward , his knuckles on the table , he said in a formal , loud voice : " You men have been assembledso that Colonel Ross , the Air Inspector , representing General Beal , can read you an order amended to clarify your status as project personnel on temporary duty at AFORAD . Pay close attention . This is important . Colonel Ross . " Colonel Ross got to his feet . " First of all , " he said , " I want to speak to you about the purpose of this project , and the reason for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his gaze go slowly and carefullyover the ranks of dark faces . " You are picked men , " he said . " Each one of you was selected in preference to many othersbecause you demonstrated , in the course of your previous training , abilities and qualities of character that fit you to be leaders in a project of great importance to the Air Force , and to our country . " Colonel Ross paused again , searching the front row of faces . He saw the movement of eyes . He heard , or thought he heard , the murmur again , now hardly perceptible . He said : " The accomplishmentsof pilots of the Ninety-ninth Fighter Squadron are known , I am sure , to all of you . Their courage and skill in combat convinced the Commanding General of the Army Air Forces that , as soon as enough trained men were available , colored flyers , bombardiers , navigators , gunners , could bep237formed into an equally valuable and effective medium bombardmentgroup . That time has come . You are the men . " Whether to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get by voice and manner , engaged him over the last words ; but they were going to hear him out . Even those who might be listening rebelliously could guess that he had something on them ; and they might hope to learn how much , and what he planned to do about it . Colonel Ross said : " You know the plan . On the basis of tests and exercises here , a group organizationwill be set up . You will proceed then to the School of Applied Tactics at Orlando where courses for squadron leaders and group administrative officers will be given you . You will then form a nucleus around which a full-strength group can be assembled and trained . I believe that in the future a man who served with one of your squadrons will feel the pride that every flyer of the Ninety-ninth Fighter Squadron feels today . " Without pausing , he went on : " I will now read to you this order . It is the order you saw on your arrival , with the addition of a paragraph defining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process of function analysis and organization . We ask you to observe these restrictions conscientiously . Your efficiency as a group depends on observance of regulations , on military bearing and attitude , on prompt and cheerful obedience to orders , as much as on your proficiency as air crew members . This is the order . Headquarters of the Army Air Forces Operations and Requirements Analysis Division , Ocanara , Florida  --  ' " Colonel Ross read clearly and slowly. "  --  by command of Major General Beal , " he concluded . Looking at them over the top of the paper , he tried to take in the quality of the moment 's silence ; and he could not help being aware of sullen emanations-some points of resistance . With only a moment to make his mind up , he made it up , and said : " Any questions on this order , gentlemen ? " He could hear Major Blake 's chair move , doubtless indicatingthat Major Blake , though impotently , did not approve of offering what might be considered malcontents this fine opening . Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said then : " It says in Army Regulations , two hundred ten , ten , paragraph nineteen , about Officers Clubs ; it says they have to be open , extend the right of membership to all officers on duty at the post . " Colonel Ross could hear Major Blake 's chair move again . Colonel Ross said : " Will you stand up , please ? I ca n't see to whom I 'm talking . Thank you . Yes , that is correct . That is what the regulation on administration of posts , camps , and stationsprovides . No public building can be used for the accommodationof any self-constituted special or exclusive group . The order just read has nothing to do with that . General Beal states in the order his reason for putting AFORAD facilities , other than those named , off limits . The use of them , along with permanent party personnel having no connection with your group , would work against the development of that group spirit which it is one of the most important objects of this project to inculcate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the opposite side , another man stood up . He said : " Colonel , those Jim Crow cars they have on the railroad down here ; they inculcate group spirit , too ? " " That is something those who make the local laws will have to explain , " Colonel Ross said . " This is the Army . There are no Army Regulations that make any distinction on the basis of race , creed , or color . You know that . A soldier is a soldier ; and that 's the end of it as far as the Army is concerned . " The first man arose again . He said : " We saw them put a man off the post this morning , Colonel , for talking to some of us . I saw that . " " The man you saw put off , Lieutenant , was put off because he had failed to comply with the regulations which govern visitsof all newspaper men to this Area . He came to talk to you without waiting to get General Beal 's permission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activities and equipment , which , if they were mentioned in a newspaper , would unquestionably be picked up by enemy intelligence . No unauthorized person can be allowed to see them or know anything about them . Many lives , and even the outcome of important campaigns , may depend on the effectiveness of our security measures . I am gladp239you brought that up . There should be no misunderstanding about it . " Colonel Ross looked at his watch . He said : " I will not have time to answer any more questions now . However , you all know , I 'm sure , that as Air Inspector , that is as General Beal 's InspectorGeneral , it is my duty to investigate complaints and irregularities . Any man is free , at any hour when he is off duty , to come to my office and tell me what 's bothering him . I hope , if any of you have other questions , you will see me in my office , and we can talk them over . " Someone , not clearly , but loud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all they will do  --  " Giving it no heed , Colonel Ross said : " You may dismiss the group , Major . " He walked across the platform , went down the steps , and out by the side door . ON TOP of the high southwest corner of Hangar Number One , enclosed by a great hexagonal glass cage filled now by the afternoon sun , which was toned down , because the glass was tinted blue-green ; and which was not too warm , because the air was cooled and re-cooled by air-conditioning units , four WACs , staffing the control tower , looked out over the vast triangular intersections of the Ocanara Army Air Base 's sixthousand-footrunways . The whole face of the field , along with the hangar roofs , had originally been the subject of an elaborate experiment in camouflage meant to transform it into just a few more of the farms and orange groves surrounding Ocanara . On the roofs , and on the concrete runways , colored a neutral shade , the tree plantings were represented by painted black spots , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through them . On the ground between the runways , actual trees continued the pattern , and the painted roads became real roads passing carefully constructedroofs of houses and barns , raised a little off the ground to cast shadows . Pilots just out of training were occasionallyp240enough confused by it to have to go around again ; and perhaps , at the time the work was done , there had been psychological value in implying that this was war ; that there was danger , that the Base was alert and ready . None of it would have fooled for a minute enemy flyers properly briefed to bomb the installations . The hypotenuse of the northwest-southeast runway was juxtaposed with one of the large local ponds , called Lake Lalage , of distinctive shape and size . Unless this pond , which was very deep , fed by springs , and which measured a mile by more than half a mile , were to be drained and filled-in , or boarded over , the position of the Base was clear . This had come to be admitted , so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was faded ; the various simulated objects were sagging and falling to pieces ; and the runways were given their conventional numbers and markings indicating approximate magnetic bearings and length , for anyone who wanted to know . A similar relaxation had overtaken last year 's rigidly enforced rules for dispersal of aircraft . The grim pretense that German bombers might be here any night , entailing as it did so much inconvenience and loss of time , was at last abandoned . Now , on the big field , you could see impressive massings of planes  --  a whole squadron of underslung , whale-like B-24 's lined up wing tip to wing tip ; flights of high-finned A-2o 's painted black as night fighters ; a half-dozen beautiful , silver P-38 's ; row after row of miscellaneous types ; transports , medium bombers , training planes . From the high post of the control tower , much activity was visible . Two miles away , along the dull-blue waters of Lake Lalage , an array of earth-moving machinery  --  drag-lines , scrapers , bulldozers , steam shovels  --  was busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lines of trucks , each flying a square yellow flag , moved in and out a temporary gate in the fence at the far hem of the field . Off to the left , where earthbanks had been piled to form butts , some old P-4o 's were in the sheds to have their guns bore-sighted or aligned . Periodically , bursting puffs of dust left the surface of the banks as the guns were test/fired . Down by the highway fence , gasoline tank-trucks came and went in the underground storage area . On the big triangular wind-rose beyond the taxi way several painters worked from a wheeled stand giving the diagonal stripes a new coat of staring yellow and black . On the parking aprons , mechanics were busy with a number of planes . Here and there engines fired up , now swelling , now throttled down ; and sounds like thunder reached the control tower . Within the convex glass-walls , twangings and a variety of disembodied voices constantly filled the cooled air . Paying no attention to them , T/3 Anderson , the Chief Control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest down on the extension of the ramp between the hangar and the low , long roofs of the Operations Building . A marching column , approximately a squadron , had come through the gate from the barracks area to the field a few minutes ago . It had been disposed , not without trouble and confusion , in platoons to form three sides of an open square facing the ramp . At the right of this formation , near the palms before the Operations Building , field music from a Negro Base Services unit was drawn up . The men , decked out with white helmets and white leggings , stood in three rigid rows  --  eight trumpets ; eight fifes ; eight snare drums . In front of them a black drum major held a baton . Near the center of the open square several marks had been chalked on the concrete and a handful of officers had found the marks and were jostling around , arranging themselves in a line . T/3 Anderson , focusing a pair of field glasses , said : " I know him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " At the operators ' positions , facing the sunlit field across the cased transmitters and banks of dials and controls sat T/5 Bell and T/5 Keller . From time to time they spoke into their microphonesin answer to the medley of voices that came and went on the sounding air . T/5 Keller said : " Wind is L  --  love ; over  --  " Out of nowhere a dogged Texan drawl went on : "  --  I have on board Brigadier General J. J. Nichols , Deputy Chief Air Staff , and party . Brigadier General Oliver H. P. Baxter , Junior ;  |p242Ca|ptain  John T. Stenhouse ; First Lieutenant Maitland Darrow . This is Major Bert Rogers , pilot . Have you got that now  --  " T/5 Bell said : " Five-zero , Ocanara Tower . Roger . Operationshas your list . They are ready . You are now cleared to land . Runway one four . Notice and overshoot construction in progress . Wind is L  --  love , gentle  --  . " She said to T/3 Anderson : " They are on their base leg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into it : " On their base leg , now , sir ! " She put back the telephone . T/5 Murphy said : " Oh , that 's it ! I see it . What kind of plane is it , anyway ? " T/3 Anderson said : " C-6o , Lockheed , hon. " " Oh , my ; she knows them all  --  " The speaker on the frequency of the range station at Orlando fifty miles away said softly : "  --  cleared to Jacksonville to cruise at thousand  --  " A squawk protested : " I do n't read you . Say again  --  " " I say again . To Jacksonville ; at four thousand . Over  --  " Higher and louder , someone else said : "  --  four-five to towerfor a check line ! Go ahead  --  " "  --  when I read you , I receive your Roger-five-Sugar-five . Okey-doke  --  " T/5 Keller , staring at the sky beyond the field , said : " Botheration ! There 's that one again , west  --  " She brought up her microphone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is Ocanara Tower . Do you hear me ? Rock your wings , please . Over  --  " Someone said promptly : " And if you hear me , toots , rock your tower . I am four-five miles northwest . C-47 , not 78 . You catch ? Army nine-nine-three . I want to come in . " T/5 Bell said to her microphone : " Army nine-nine-three , Ocanara Tower . I have advised you field is closed for a period of approximately three zero minutes . Hold and circle left . Watch traffic . You will be number two to land when we advise you field is open . " T/5 Keller said to T/3 Anderson : " He just does n't receive ; or he just does n't listen ! I do n't know what he 's trying to do .. We better gun him , had n't we  --  "  | " Yes , " said T/3 Anderson . " Gun him , Murphy ! See ? Right over there  --  " T/5 Murphy raised and tilted the bulky lightguntube . " Now , aim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see it if it 's slanted off , any . Give him red steady and watch his ailerons and rudder . He 's supposed to acknowledge that way  --  " "  --  Ocanara Tower , this is Navy Able-one-three  --  " T/5 Bell said , " Oh , that fellow ! He 's one of those flying boats from Sanford or somewhere . He might be lost ; but I think he 's kidding . He wants to know where he is  --  " "  --  there ! He did kick his rudder . " " All right , he 'll go around . Now , hon , watch the C-6o . They 're down , see ? They 'll turn in a minute to taxi . Give him a green light  --  short flashes  --  that 's right ! " T/3 Murphy raised her field glasses , following the C-6o up along the hangars . " Oh , I want to see this , " T/5 Bell said . " Can I see them get out ? " " All right . And you can , too , Keller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So if anyone calls  --  " Shoulder to shoulder they pressed against the convex glass panel . Under them , the C-6o wheeled and swung broadside . There was a pause while the engines were run up . Then the cabin door opened . A faint harsh voice arose , bawling : " Present  --  arms ! " The big black drum major let his lifted baton fall ; the eight snare drums , beaten , jumped to a fine muted racket of ruffles ; the eight lifted trumpets blew out a high blaring flourish . " My , he 's cute ! " said T/3 Anderson . " General Nichols ! Unless this is the other one . He looks like , you know in the movies , that tall , quiet man  --  " T/5 Murphy said , clasping her hands , " Oh , let me see , Mona ! Just for a minute  --  " T/3 Anderson handed the glasses over . " That other one , I do n't think he 's so hot ! General Baxter ! Who is he , anyway ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , can I see now ! Please , Rose  --  " " Oh , I guess they 're going to inspect the guard  --  " The two generals , who had been shaking hands with the shortp244row of officers in the center , moved across the pavement to the head of the platoon line on the right . The drum major lifted his baton , and the fifes came up as one fife . He dropped it ; and they broke , piercing , into a sweet , shrill whistle , high and jaunty against the drums . At the bar 's end , the bugles came up , too ; and threw in their emphatic three notes ' worth  --  a musically hot arrangement , almost an orchestra effect , of which the drum major was reasonably proud . With jubilation , T/5 Bell began to sing : " . . . flying high , into the sun . . . " From the void , a voice of reproach said : " Ocanara Tower ! Nine-nine-three , for God 's sake ! When do we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll live in fame , or go down in  --  " T/5 Keller lifted her microphone and said : " Army ninenine-three ! This is Ocanara Tower . A plane with high officers on board is being received on the ramp , and the field is closed until the ceremony is over . I will advise you . " The voice , sepulchral , said : " Nuts to them , sister . Do n't they know there 's a war on ? " T/5 Keller said : " Army nine-nine-three ! We are required to report superfluous transmissions , or abusive and profane languagereceived . Acknowledge ! " " Wilco , lamb pie . You doing anything tonight ? " T/5 Keller suppressed a giggle , but she said curtly : " Army nine-nine-three ! Kindly vacate this channel , or I will be obligedto report you . Out ! " +Preceded by an MP jeep , and followed by two more staff cars , they passed the gates of the Ocanara Army Air Base and headed down the highway toward the AFORAD Area . The jeep , opening its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along half a mile ahead , summoned them with stentorian wails to move over . In the back seat General Nichols sat on the right , with General Baxter in the middle , and Colonel Mowbray on the other side.  |p245General  Nichols 's face was nearly triangular . He had a wide forehead with harmonizing height , and well-marked thin eyebrowsabove clear , dark-brown eyes tilting slightly down at the outside corners . A narrow but strong chin supported a straight , ample mouth with lips firmly delineated , almost chiseled . As though to emphasize this feature , which gave his whole face distinction , and at the same time , force , General Nichols wore above it a dark mustache clipped thin and flat . His face , turned to Colonel Mowbray , had a mournful , vacant expression . The distinguished , even beautiful , lips parted . He said slowly : " Only one thing I 'm a little sore about , Pop . " To facilitate conversation across him , General Baxter tilted up his smooth chin , pulling his head back and blinking benevolentlythrough his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally recognized the sober-sided start of one of those deadpansallies for which Jo-Jo Nichols was widely remembered and appreciated . " Personally , " General Nichols said , " I 'm a simple soldier . I wish I could get away from all this fuss and falderal ! Of course , I realize that when I stand in the place of the Chief of Air Staff , I 'm not free to consult my personal likes and dislikes . I have to accept honors appropriate to my station . Formal reception by officer of suitable rank ; O.K. ! Field music , ruffles and flourishes ; O.K. ! Escort of Honor ; O.K. ! But let me ask you one question . " He bent forward and barked suddenly : " What happened to those fifteen guns I consider the representative of the Chief of Air Staff entitled to ? I did n't hear them ! " He reached across and slapped Colonel Mowbray 's knee . " Pop , you old so-and-so , " he said . " How are you , anyway ? How 's Bus ? " Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Bus ? Bus is just fine , Jo-Jo . He would have come over , only we never expected you as early as this . He was still tied up . You certainly got here ! " General Nichols said : " We had a tail wind the whole way down . From Charleston to Savannah we worked it out on the computer we were making about two hundred and seventy ; and I do n't think it could have been much less the rest of thep246time . We never left Bolling until two o'clock . I had to wait for 011ie . " " Well , why did you do that ? " Colonel Mowbray said , peeringat General Baxter . " We never knew 011ie was coming . We never invited him . There is n't any place to put him up . He 's going to have to sleep on a bench in Sunshine Park . What did he come for anyway ? " Though Colonel Mowbray spoke so playfully , the sharp inquisitive note in the last question was strong enough to make General Baxter laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I came mostly for the ride . " He continued to laugh . " Why ? " he said . " Are n't you glad to see me ? A few little things you do n't want the Air Inspector 's office to know about ? Well , I may find time to look into them . " " You can look all you like , " Colonel Mowbray said . " We 're always ready for inspection . Bus is doing a wonderful job here , I can tell you . " He leaned forward . " Had I better butter him up some , Jo-Jo ? Congratulate him on those stars ? How did he get those anyway ? Buy them at the PX ? " " Why , no , " said General Nichols . " Did n't you hear about that ? It was something I was able to do for him . You see , this list , promotions the Old Man wanted , went over to the Hill ; and of course 011ie was n't on that . But when the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been added . You know  --  colonels who 'd been pulling strings and pestering their home-state politicians to get made . Naturally , 011ie was there . Now , one morning this returned list had just been sent in to the Old Man when I found I was out of cigars , so I dropped around to get a couple from the box on the Old Man 's desk . Fortunate thing for 011ie ! " " Was n't it , though ? " General Baxter said blandly . " Yes . That very minute the Old Man , reading the list , had reached Baxter . He gave a kind of disgusted grunt  --  you know the way he does  --  and grabbed a pencil to strike it out . I was bending over the desk , filling my pocket with cigars , when I saw what he was going to do . I yelled : Good God ! What 's that behind you ? ' He drops the pencil and looks around . Why , nothing ! ' he says . Check ! ' I said . Just thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the time he picked up the pencil whichp247had fallen on the rug , and was ready to read again , he 'd lost his place in the list and went on from farther down . So that 's how 011ie got to be a BG . " Colonel Mowbray laughed until the tears came into his eyes . " Tell Bus , " he said . " Tell Bus that one ! " He got his breath and wiped his eyes . He said , suddenly serious : " Bus is a little bit upset , Jo-Jo  --  oh , one thing I did want to speak about before we get there . I suppose you heard , before you left , about this little difficulty this morning , that Negro newspaper fellow raising the fuss . Now , that man was entirely in the wrong ; and I was surprised to hear any attention was paid his telegram . As Graham Jobson must have told you , he should never have been sent here . Those public relations people seem to be so busy sucking up to the newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much harm it does . " General Baxter said : " That is n't quite the way the newspapers see it , Pop . They yell bloody murder . They tell you WDBPR is a special agency to see that no reference , direct or indirect , to the Army or the war appears in print . " " And that might be a good thing ! What they did here , without consulting us , sending a man down to write up a project that did n't even start until this morning , and might not work out  --  somebody is nuts ! Now , I admit our people , one of our Public Relations officers , and another , pulled some bad boners ; and we 'll have to take disciplinary action there . But the point is , Washington had no business to say he could come down ; and he had no business to sneak off by himself , when he knew he was n't cleared , and start trying to get a story . He ought to be struck off the accredited list for that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! That 's what I think , 011ie . " Colonel Mowbray did not wait for General Baxter 's agreement , since he did not expect to get it , and he probably felt he had not too much time for what he wanted to say before they reached AFORAD Headquarters , none to waste in hearing a defense of the War Department Bureau of Public Relations , or its Air Forces Group . Public Relations in the peacetime Army , the old Army , were usually handled by those officers whose poor or mediocre per/formance of other duties made them the easiest to spare . In this new , wartime Army , Public Relations , at least at the higher level , was of course in the hands of commissioned civilians  --  publicists , advertising men , newspaper editors . While able enough in those fields , and never wrong about what the papers and magazines wanted , the smarter ones might practice a kind of collusion . They now had the power to accommodate those who would have the power later , when the soldier-suits were taken off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not trust them . He did not even trust General Baxter on this point . Not all general officers were insensible to the advantages of a press friendly to them personally . Bending forward to engage General Nichols , Colonel Mowbray said : " What I wanted to tell you , Jo-Jo , before you see Bus , was that I think Bus very rightly feels that Washingtondid n't back him up . He sent Graham Jobson to explain the situation , why James ought not to be cleared . There really could n't be any argument about that . Bus was right . But what do they do ? They take this entirely false and misleading telegram that James sends the Air Forces Group and take action on that . They use that as a basis to intervene in a purely local thing , a little personnel difficulty which we were already acting on and had under control . Bus did n't say this , you understand ; but I 'm saying it because I 'm pretty sure I know how Bus felt , how he naturally would feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have Washington stand behind him . That 's what I think , Jo-Jo . " While he listened , General Nichols 's face relaxed from the blank , mournful expression fixed on it when he told his story about General Baxter 's promotion . He smiled lightly but firmly . His eyes grew intent . Like a man who has enjoyed a short rest , but who sees now that his time is up , General Nichols , with an almost visible gathering of muscles , arose and shouldered his load  --  heavy , but not too heavy for him , because he was strong and he was used to it . He said : " Pop ; two points about that . One : your purely local thing is n't purely local . For some time now the Secretary of War has been doing everything possible to make the Negro press change its tone and attitude.  |p249The  Administration is disturbed by the incessant attacks on Army policy , very often was n't there when they talked to Bus ; but I heard the transcript of the conversation . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to repeat his order and to make it stick . We suggested a way to handle it . In view of the other point , we did n't like the order because it left us open to the charge the James man , in fact , made ; that segregation , on the basis of color , was being practiced . We asked Bus to state that this was not the case . He was n't directed to revoke the order . Now , what more could he ask ? " Colonel Mowbray said : " Jo-Jo , I want you to know , because I do n't think Bus would tell you , that Bus never saw that order until after it was published . There was some slip-up in distributionin Headquarters . I wrote it . I put in what you did n't like  --  the separate Officers Club . Bus had nothing to do with it . In my judgment , it was absolutely necessary . If Bus is in trouble about that , I want you to be able to tell them how it happened  --  whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to take the formal responsibility ; but I think the Air Staff , the Old Man , should be told it was n't Bus 's idea . Bus would not have approved that order . " General Nichols , still smiling patiently , said : " Did you know Bus would n't approve it when you wrote it ? Come on , Pop ! " " I did n't say that , " Colonel Mowbray answered stubbornly , his face somber . " When I wrote it , I did think Bus would approve it . Now , I do n't think he would have . If there had n't been that hitch in distribution , Norm Ross would have got a copy before it was published , instead of after . He would certainly have talked it over with Bus . I know Norm did n't approve of it . He said so right away ; before we heard anything from Washington . " " Ross is your Air Inspector , is n't he ? " General Baxter said . " I think I knew him when he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes ; he 's an awful good man , " Colonel Mowbray said . " I do n't know what we 'd do here without him . Bus depends onp250him a great deal . We all do . " He looked moodily out the car window . They had turned east off the highway and were running , the car 's shadow stretched far ahead of them , through the pine woods . On the right , those miles of steel mesh fence , topped with barbed wire , which enclosed the Area , had begun . Colonel Mowbray said : " Mind you , Jo-Jo ; about this policy business . I do n't agree with Norm . He thinks your policy is right . It is n't . It 's wrong . It 's bound to make trouble . It 's bound to lead to the very thing you 're trying to avoid . A colored boy may have the same legal rights as anyone else , and we can see nobody takes those away from him ; at least , where we have control . We ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for instance . In Ocanara , there is n't a hotel used by white people which would dream of letting a Negro register ; there is n't a restaurant used by white people that would serve him a meal . I do n't think you 'd suggest we try to change that . In short , you know better than to insist that the municipality of Ocanara stop segregating Negroes socially . Your theory says they ought to ; but before you start a fight about that you better finish the fight you have in Europe and the Pacific . " He wagged his head knowledgeably . " That 's your real policy , off the post ; and it 's right . First things first ! On the post , your policy should be the same and for the same reason . The Negroes are n't the only ones who have rights . If the Southern boys do n't want to spend an evening socially with Negroes they have a right not to . " General Baxter , benevolent , beaming through his glasses , said : " Pop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " " Do n't give me that , 011ie ! " Colonel Mowbray said , bristling . The air filled suddenly with a faint but sickening stench . To the right could be seen the neat concrete vats , thickly creamed and mantled under the sprays revolving , of the Area sewage disposalplant . " That 's what that smells like ! " Colonel Mowbray said indignantly . " All right . So there 's no regulation that says every man will report to the Club every night and have one or more beers standing next to a Negro . If they do n't like it at the Club , they do n't have to go to the Club . Sure ! Sure ! " Colonel Mowbray squirmed in his corner ; but he had the air of hopping up and down ; of being ready to fly , fearless andp251furious , like a bantam or a terrier , at the monstrous nonsense confronting him . This was engaging , and General Baxter , with a grin , said provokingly : " Sure ! Glad you admit it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ club , established for the pleasure and convenience of its members , should offer a lot of boys from say , Georgia , nothing but a chance to pay their dues and then take a free choice between not liking it , or not going to it ! I tell you , they wo n't stand that ! " " Too bad ! " General Baxter said cheerfully . " Just what will they do ? " " They 'll make trouble , and it will be too bad ! You 're deliberatelytaking a social matter , a matter that a great many of the best men we have feel deeply and strongly about , and making it an issue of discipline . They wo n't submit ; and you know in advance that they wo n't . Go on ! Do your damnedest ! You can arrest them ; you can court-martial them ; you can dishonorably discharge them . In short , if you 're that much of a fool , you can arrange to get rid of a lot of your first team and see how you make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face had turned scarlet . The consternationthat his idea caused him brought him close to stuttering . He said furiously : " Someone 's crazy  --  stark , raving mad ! This bomb group , here  --  if and when activated ! Does anyone in his right senses think it will stack up with a good white mediumbombgroup ? I do n't say they wo n't try . But can they ? Jesus God ; by and large , man by man , they just have n't got it ! The Bible says hewers of wood and drawers of water , and that was no fooling ! Look around you , use your eyes , ask anyone ! Talk to Colonel Mandible , commands the Engineer Corps troops here . He was telling me last week . What those jigaboos can do to machinery and equipment would break your heart ! Give them a new truck , and in a week it 's ruined . Give them a machine gun and in ten minutes it wo n't fire . Take away the white officers , and by night your squadron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out ; your barracks will be a pigsty ; your mess will be serving cold burnt beans three times a day and piling two weeks garbage on the back porch . Jesus God , I 'm glad you can laugh ! I feel more likep252crying ! " Indeed , a suggestion of angry tears appeared glisteningin Colonel Mowbray 's eyes . He tightened his lips and clamped his jaws together . " Now , Pop ! " General Baxter said . " Nobody 's going to swipe your air force . " On General Nichols 's face the firm quiet smile remained unchanged . His expression was both abstracted and attentive . He did not waste his mind 's time on trifles like this poorly conducted and futile debate ; but he did not overlook or miss trifles either . General Nichols said lightly : " We 're going to have to use them , Pop ; and I do n't think they 're all as bad as that . I think , given a chance , a lot of them will do all right . We have some reasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel bad about this , but I brought down with me a Distinguished Flying Cross for one of your bomb group project boys . A Lieutenant Stanley Willis , I think the name is . I have the citation in my brief case . I 'll have to ask you to have him looked up for me . " " Willis ? " Colonel Mowbray said . " Willis ? " " I 'll give you the full name and serial number . He 's one of the pilots . They put in for an Air Medal for him from his last station . Awards and Decorations had it pending , we happened to discover , and the Old Man himself changed it to the DFC . Willis was in a B-26 , flying with three other B-26 's out of Del Rio on a cross-country exercise and they hit weather . By the time they worked through , they did n't have gas to get home . They were talking back and forth between the planes and the other pilots , who , incidentally , were white , thought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the colored pilot had noticed a little field  --  the sort of place they fly Cubs off Sunday afternoons . He took a turn over it and decided he could put down . He had a co-pilot and a navigator along  --  both white  --  and they were willing to try it with him . He 'd go first , and if he cracked up , the other planes could bail out . So he did . He ran off the strip , or what passed for that , of course ; but he 'd lost enough speed to use his brakes by then and he managed to swerve it a little and keep on hard , fairly level , ground until he stopped . So he pulled off to the side , and the other threep253came down , while he talked them in , telling them where to touch and when to go , and they all landed O.K. , too . I do n't think you could call that second string flying , Pop . Those B-26 's are n't for children . The Old Man figured half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dollars ' worth of medal , all right ; and under the circumstances , awarding it here and now might be useful . " " Sure , sure , " Colonel Mowbray said . He swallowed . " You have me all wrong , Jo-Jo . I do n't hold a thing against a Negro because he 's a Negro . I 'll give him every bit of credit he can earn every time he earns it , and maybe a little extra  --  A for effort . But one swallow does n't make a summer . " He moistened his lips . " Well , I got off the point , I admit it . You 're the policy people . We have to do what you say . And you know Bus . If he 's overruled , he does n't sit sulking about it . Just , as I say , he had troubles enough today , enough on his mind . I guess you know about Colonel Woodman at Sellers Field . " " Yes , " General Nichols said . He looked at General Baxter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . It was decided for various reasons that we 'd take the matter over from the TrainingCommand . The fact is , Pc'p , I 'm the Investigating Officer . Since Jo-Jo was flying here today , they thought I 'd better come down with him , get a statement from Bus , and go on to Sellers tomorrow . " Colonel Mowbray said : " Then you did know Bus went up there yesterday ? I was going to tell you . That 's a mighty upsetting thing to have happen , you know . Of course , he was Bus 's first squadron CO , too . You knew that ? I never knew Woodman , myself ; but he had a lot of hard luck . He did n't get the breaks at all . Norm Ross told me that Woodman had this idea that somebody higher up was out to get him . " He shook his head sadly . General Baxter said : " The presumption of AR **28;3422;TOOLONG always that a sane person does n't commit suicide . We would n't mind finding he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Some people went up with Bus , did n't they ? " " Norm Ross and Benny Carricker. "  | " Of course , I know Woodman was hitting the bottle , and that does n't help . If I have to find he was drunk at the time , and I guess at Sellers I will find that , it could be mental unsoundnessdue to his own misconduct , so his death becomes due to misconduct and is not in the line of duty . If Bus and his people can say he was acting queer when they saw him , it would be a help . " General Nichols said , almost derisively : " Do n't get in a sweat , 011ie . You 'll have plenty of help . " He looked steadily at Colonel Mowbray , no doubt considering his own findings on Colonel Woodman . They were clearly at variance with the findingsGeneral Baxter hoped for , the findings General Baxter had probably been told to bring back . Smiling , General Nichols said : " It is n't much of a secret that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were lookingover the axes at Fort Worth . It 's tough to have a lot of hard luck ; it 's tough not to get the breaks at all ; but these are tough times , Pop . We have a job ; and a man who 's given part of it to do has to do it right  --  or else ! " He spoke quietly and carefully , without special emphasis , as though spelling-out principles about which General Baxter , and perhaps still higher authority , were showing themselves a little remiss . General Nichols gently dissociated himself from GeneralBaxter 's mission . Smiling still , he seemed intent on stating the simple , irrecusable considerations , before which every other purpose , hope , or wish ought to give way  --  even including , it seemed , that piteous or compassionate wish to say , or at least to report officially , no evil of the dead . It was plain that General Nichols could continue to look at the facts of ruin and failure long after other men , though reputedly tough and hard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also were mortal , wanted to cover them over . He said : " A man like Colonel Woodman , who has been regularlyfalling down on his job , and knows he has , could do a lot worse than shoot himself  --  I think . What else is there for him to do ? We are n't taking any excuses . Not even in cases where something can be said on both sides . I know of several cases like that . The Old Man would have given almost anything to bep255able to let it ride , to save somebody 's feelings , to excuse some -- body who perhaps did a great deal for the Air Corps in the old days . He could n't . He had to act . There is too much at stake . " General Nichols 's serious smile deepened . He said : " An idea seems to be around in some quarters that we 're pretty near out of the woods , that winning the war is just a matter of time , now . " He shook his head . " We do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change tomorrow ; and not for the better . We need n't take our hair down about it ; but in this thing too many good men have died , and too many good men are going to die . " He paused . " I do n't mean I think you do n't know that , Pop ; or that you 'd want it any other way . But remember , they are just as serious as hell up there . " Colonel Mowbray said : " Down here you wo n't find anyone who is n't just as serious as hell , too . " " Let me tell you something , which you will treat as top secret , " General Nichols said , still smiling . " I was at the conferenceat Quebec last month . A &rtain; intelligence service , which seems to be smarter than ours , laid before the meeting some information of great interest . It was a minute of the specificterms on which one of our important allies offered to join the Axis in 1940 ; and on which they offered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were turned down both times because the Germans thought the terms too high  --  " They were at the gates of the Area . All other traffic had been halted and moved over to the side . The guard was drawn up at attention by the gate house . General Nichols absently touched his cap , and they went through the arch . He said : " We do n't know whether the offer , or a modification of it , still stands ; but it is obvious that we would be unwise to trust these friends or count on them very far . If the Germans changed their minds , we might have to throw away our operational planning for next year . " He laughed quietly . " Yes , " Colonel Mowbray said . He sat a moment , his mouth open in brooding surmise . " Yes , I see that could be pretty bad , " he said . General Nichols said gravely , " It reminds me in some ways of a situation that developed at Keesler Field a few weeks agop256when I was down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of small islands , a few miles out in the gulf . One of them is uninhabited , and it had been used for some time as a gunnery range for fighter planes . The other island belongs to an old woman , somewhat eccentric , who lives there alone ; has a vegetable garden , some chickens , a cow . There is a house on it , and a barn ; but they do n't amount to much . " General Nichols cleared his throat . " Well , it happens that , from the air , it looks a good deal like the other island , about the same size and shape ; and they 're right there together . As I say , the house and barn do n't amount to much , and the other island had a couple of sheds on it , which I think fishermen used for something sometime . The planes would fire at these old sheds . I suppose it was remarkable that it had n't happened before ; but at any rate , one evening a pilot who was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try a newly installed cannon . He made a run on the island , put his sights on this shed , and opened up . It happened to be the wrong island , and the shed was the barn , and the old woman was in the barn , milking the cow . " General Nichols shook his head . " It was good shooting . The pilot lobbed in four or five 37-mm shells , broke the roof all to bits , scored two direct hits on the cow , which just disintegrated . My , it was a mess ! " Colonel Mowbray said : " What happened to the old woman ? " Mournfully , General Nichols said : " Pop , she was left holding the bag . " AT QUARTER to six Nathaniel Hicks drove Captain Wiley into the parking space beyond the low white masses of the Officers Club . They had been by Visiting Officers Quarters to get CaptainWiley a room and to leave Captain Wiley 's stuff . Then they went over to the Special Projects Building to catch Major Beaudry , of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he could arrange to have a draughtsman in the morning to lay out the formation diagrams.  |p257Evidently  reflecting on these glimpses of the AFORAD Area , Captain Wiley , as he got out of the car , said : " Say , you got quite a thing here , Nat ; quite a thing ! " Going along with the fighting man 's usual view , Nathaniel Hicks said apologetically : " It 's mostly a lot of crap . " " Sure it is , " Captain Wiley said . " But I love to see a lot of anything . Here 's all this ; here 's all that . You been around the Training Command much ? Why , they have more damn fields , more damn planes , more damn men ! It makes you think , Nat ! " He narrowed his eyes pensively as though to undertake this exercise . " In England , in ' 41 , when they had us really on the hooks ; in Malta , when I was there , I 've gone up to intercept with only part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make one pass and you were through ; andrif they did n't hurry up , you could n't even make that . You 'd have to get down and drag your plane in a hole in the cliff and watch the bastards bomb . " With a negligent imitation of a British voice he said : " Dashed enervating . Bloody awful . " They were walking around to the Club door and he added : " Say , is the place pinched ? " In the drive curving up to the front entrance stood two jeeps full of military police . In the arch of the doorway a stocky redfacedlieutenant with a gun strapped around his waist and an MP brassard on his arm came to attention and saluted them . " I do n't know , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I saw at Operations when I was waiting for you that they had some brass coming in . Maybe it 's an escort . I hope General Beal is n't here . He thinks I 'm off on a job for him . " " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is he a good Joe ? " Not sure about his competence to decide this point , Nathaniel Hicks said : " They seem to like him . " Captain Wiley said : " I heard he was a fugitive from Bataan ; but , hell , you can hear anything you want . A fellow who knew him in the Middle East said he was a nice type with an aircraft , only he flew his groups awful hard . When he finished with them , they 'd had it ! I heard he ordered them to hit Crete one day , along with some mediums , though he knew , like everyone else , they could n't make it out and back . So , at least ap258squadron came down in the water . No lack of moral fiber tol-erated . " From Captain Wiley 's tone it was difficult to tell whether he regarded this as reprehensible callousness on the general 's part , or as a good practical joke , humorous because it was so outrageous , on the squadron concerned . Nathaniel Hicks said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly somewhere you ca n't get back from ? " " Me ? " said Captain Wiley . " I would n't know . I 'm here . They never sent me anywhere I could n't get back from . Why , Nat , it is n't a good idea . There might be only one chance in a hundred , but if the CO is smart , he 'll make sure you have that one chance . If you have n't any chance , he should n't send you . I 'd have to know more about that Crete story . Maybe never happened , anyway . But I 'll bet if it did , there were these winds aloft or something they figured might just let them do it . This death or glory stuff is all bushwah , except with nuts ; and those , you do n't want . An outfit of smart guys , always trying to figure the opposition before the opposition figures them ; they can take , any time , any day , an outfit of nuts wound up to crash their planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smart guy wins . " He smiled serenely , not pressing the implication that he must be smart himself since he had done a good deal of winning , but assured in it , and standing on his judgment of himself with no embarrassment . The steps and arch of the entrance to the Officers Club led directly into a wide vaulted passage which ran the width of the building . It was open at the end , looking over a stone balustradeto Lake Titania . The right side was open too , facing the coconut palms and shrub-plantings of the patio . On the left side were doorways with ornamental signs above them to the lounge , the bar , and , at the end , to the dining room . Part of this wide tiled passage was furnished with little metal tables and wicker chairs . These were for the convenience of members who might want to offer female guests a drink . No women were allowed in the bar room . It was pleasant here on a warm evening , for a breeze off the lake was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Inside , it gets awful hot . "  | " Swell , swell , " Captain Wiley said . He let himself down in one of the wicker chairs , heaved his long limbs around until he found a comfortable slouching position . He tossed his overseascap on the table , and gazed with pleased attention at the only other table that was occupied . Two Engineer Corps lieutenantssat there drinking rum and Coca-Cola with three notbad-lookinggirls , two dark , the third blonde . Nathaniel Hicks went into the bar room . He came out with a colored boy in a white coat carrying glasses , ice , bottles of charged water , and a full bottle of Scotch on which was pasted a strip of paper printed in pencil : Capt . N. Hicks 0-907360 . " Swell , swell , " Captain Wiley said . " Scotch , huh ? I got so I liked that stuff . " He dropped into his heroicomical British voice . " A bit all right , this ! " To the colored boy he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , you know . " He began to laugh . He poured himself a moderate amount of Scotch , filled the glass with water and inched himself lower in the chair . Enfolding the glass in his big , long-fingered hand , Captain Wiley said : " Cheers , chaps ! " He tilted it up and swallowed half of it . He brought his hand down and , still holding the glass in his lap , said : " You say the general 's got the thing now , Nat ? Is that good ? " " I 'm not sure , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " But the general has actually flown in combat ; plenty of times , I guess . I do know that . I figure he 'll see your dope is right , and that might take care of Colonel Folsom , which would be good . I saw Folsom this afternoon on something else , and he was quite pleasant . I was up at Sellers Field yesterday talking to an AVG man . I have some notes he gave me I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said enviously , " There 's a piece of cake ! I would n't have minded being out there , then . Cash money for every plane you got ! Then you take it , and do a little trading with the Chinks , and pretty soon you have a packet . That part is still going , a fellow at Orlando , just back , told me . I 'd like some of that ; and I would n't mind seeing what those yellowbelliesfly like . " He looked pensively at his glass . " Only , not till they give you something besides P-4o 's . Once you fly ap260Spit you do n't want any of those . " He laughed . " What I liked was a Spit-nine on a Wop Macchi two-hundred , or two-oh-two . Definitely a swindle ; but fun for all . They used to come over Malta with the bombers sometimes , doing a lot of phoney acrobatics . We generally got a pretty good alert , so you could be up , supposing you were n't grounded for parts or out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there waiting , and you see pretty soon a few V 's of bombers lumbering along , and the Wop fighters doing barrel rolls and all the silly stuff around them . Screw radio silence ! You 'd hear the FL 's suddenly yipping : Red Leader to you chaps ; White Leader to you chaps ; R for ravioli , R for ravioli  --  ' One day , " he said , laughing and slapping his knee , " I got to admit we had it back . A few Hermannsin one-nineties came over , way the hell up , at the same time . We never saw them . I was just bouncing a Wop , and I heard this goddamn firing in the air . When you hear firing in the air , it 's only one place ; right back of you . Goddamn bullets going through my wing ! I leaned on it and went ass-over-teakettle . I swear , his prop nicked a piece out of my rudder . I figuredafterward Hermann outsmarted himself . He did n't open early because he was trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correct his aim . He came over me , bat out of hell , probablyso mad at missing , when he practically had me stenciled on his fuselage , that he stopped thinking . So he started to pull up . He never should have done that , naturally . You overshoot somebody , and you 've put him on your tail ; so you better begin evading quick . " Captain Wiley set his glass on the table to free his hands . He poised one above the other . " So me , I let it spin about one and a half , pulled out hard coming up , and caught him smack in the ring , almost stopped , trying to climb  --  " He tilted his left hand and shot his right hand toward it . " So , I socked him the business in a good long squirt ; and he began to burn ; and alles kaput Hermann ! " He took back his glass . " That 's something we want to keep saying in the manual , Nat . You look behind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break I got twice . They shot down two of our people on that same bounce  --  one of my best friends ; fellow named Johnson . Drilled him throughp261the back of the head and he never pulled out of the dive he was making on this Wop  --  zingo ! Right straight into the field . " Nathaniel Hicks said : " Is n't that his parachute you have ? " " Yeah , that 's right , " Captain Wiley said . " That was a funny thing . The way he flew into the ground , you would n't have expected to even find pieces ; and they were spread around , all right . Somehow , you 'd never figure out how , the parachute ripped off him , and there it was , a hundred feet away , good as new . Goddamn , I was sorry to see him killed ! He was one of the best flyers ever lived  --  only , he forgot to look behind him once . " Captain Wiley emptied his glass and put it on the table . Nathaniel Hicks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I might have another short one , thanks . " He poured a little more in the glass . " I 'm supposed to have ulcers . We all had something from the food they gave you . Johnson used to get as sick as a dog every morning . Well , he 's cured now ! " Ut enfolded the glass in his long fingers again and tossed most of the contents into his mouth . He wiped his lips on the back of his hand and said : " Gashed with honorablescars , low in glory 's lap they lie . Though they fell , they fell like stars , streaming splendor down the sky ! ' " Astounded , Nathaniel Hicks said : " What 's that , Gene ? Bush-wah ? " " It 's a poem , " Captain Wiley said , grinning . " Sure , it 's bushwah . Here 's some more I read . " He frowned attentively . " Their shoulders held the sky suspended ; they stood and earth 's foundations stay ; what God abandoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . ' " He smiled with pleasure . " Makes you think , Nat ! " he said . It did , indeed ; Nathaniel Hicks reflected . It was wise to bear in mind that the man who declaimed against bushwah usually concealed somewhere in him the ordinary deep human love of it . " Do you like poetry ? " he said . " I do n't know , " Captain Wiley said . " Those are just some things I read . " He poured charged water into his glass , sloshed it around , and drank a little . " I used to read things now and then . Lot of the Britishers had a few books with them . " He rested at great ease , contentedly turning his gaze on thep262blonde girl , who seemed to be a third or extra one at the other table . Nathaniel Hicks saw that she was fully conscious of the gaze . While Captain Wiley told about his close shave that day over Malta and illustrated with " hand flying " the FW 190 's unwise maneuver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . She observed , and might naturally like , the negligentdisposal of the rangy muscular body in the wicker chair , the bold and open masculine face with the enchanting warm complexion , the inviting cast of the narrowed , roving eyes . She no doubt evaluated the wings on his shirt ; and perhaps even the ribbon of the British , or Honest-to-God Distinguished FlyingCross . Sidelong , through her lashes , she now saw that she had his attention . She began at once to address herself to her companions , male and female , with animation , cocking her head , tossing her hair , moving her arms and hands with lively grace , while she displayed her teeth in frequent soft peals of laughter . In a low , pleased , pensive tone , Captain Wiley said : " The time and place being given , to organize that would be possible . Nice little dish of a bitch , too . Wonder who she is ? " " I could n't tell you , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I got to get me back tomorrow , or I might be trying to promote it , and my Orlando schedule is tough enough . Funny thing about the wars , that way . Types of chicks strictly no-no-no in peacetimejust ca n't wait to lay it on the line . I guess I 'm really a son ! You 'd think , when you have a good chick crazy about you , it ought to hold you ; but every time I see a good new one , damn if I do n't start wondering how that would be . Of course , it does n't matter so much now ; but if I got married . You 're married , are n't you , Nat ? What 's your wife do if she thinks you 're knocking a little off , every now and then ? " Though he was embarrassed Nathaniel Hicks could not very well take offense from the innocent , direct inquisitiveness of this , if not child , grown-young-man , of nature . " I do n't know , " he said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What I mean ! " Captain Wiley said , smiling . " Of course , you do n't have to tell them , I suppose . But they get suspiciousp263as hell . Even if you 're only going with them , pretty soon they start asking questions . You take off for a couple of days , so they know you are n't getting it from them , right away they wonder who you are getting it from . Could be correct , too . What 's your wife think you do ? " Nathaniel Hicks said self-consciously , since in Captain Wiley 's eyes it surely reflected on his virility : " I do n't know , Gene . Perhapsshe does wonder if I 'm shacked up with somebody . If she does , she need n't . I 'm not . I have n't found it necessary , if you want the fact . " " Still , would n't it be smarter of her to come down and keep an eye on you ? " Captain Wiley considered the question perplexedly . " I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I miss her , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Then , how about her ? Does she miss you ? What does she do to pass the time ? That 's something I 'll bet I 'd wonder about . " Nathaniel Hicks said : " I think there are quite a number of women in the world who do n't give the ice man a lay every morning as soon as their husbands go to the office . " " I suppose not , " Captain Wiley said . " I guess I just better not get married yet . I 'd kind of like to . I 'd like to have some kids . How many kids you got ? " " Two , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Yeah , I 'd like that . But I guess I 'd better not . Not while they have so many of those around . " He flicked an eye at the blonde girl . Adopting his British voice , he said : " That 's but good . And there 's jam on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hicks took a look at the blonde girl on what might be called his own account ; yet where Captain Wiley saw such a temptingly available delicacy , all Nathaniel Hicks saw was a lot of trouble . Reason , indeed , overcomes the passions ! If , by lifting his finger now , he could enjoy her , would he lift it ? He would not ! He would go furtherthan that . If  --  an improbable hypothesis , since he was not exactly Captain Wiley  --  the propositioning was hers ; if she pro/vided , with no work of finger-lifting , the necessary time and place to " organize " her ; if she then and there offered herself to him , free of bother and uncertainty of going after her , would he accept ? He felt safe in saying he would , instead , get the hell out the shortest way . Part of this chaste reluctance might come from what Captain Wiley had half in mind ; a magic  --  indeed , Captain Wiley could not help feeling , incredible  --  purification by marriage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or at least , the definite wish to be , faithful to his wife , whom he loved , and , in addition , really liked at least as well as , and usually much more than , other females who from time to time might catch the male eye . Yet this intention , or this wish , this love and liking , perhaps served , in the concourse of factors that operated together against the loose proposals of instinct , as no more than secondary , hardly needed reinforcementsto a central disinclination sprung from lower considerations . A man like Captain Duchemin ( though so many years past Captain Wiley 's flaming youth ) sought with relish unimpaired and readily found the adventurous quest and the fun of the chase ; the glee of capture and the titillations of variety . They all struck Nathaniel Hicks as highly undesirable ; if not always in themselves , always in what experience knew they brought about . Though ' t was an angel , ' t was a she ! Let irregularlyinto your life  --  oh , my God , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarrelings and repinings , with which she would quite justifiably plague you when , having enough , you thought of withdrawing ! A short course in the dear school kept for fools would learn you that Peace , 0 Virtue , Peace is all thine own ! Captain Wiley had been waiting , apparently in the hope that Nathaniel Hicks would say more , give him some useful or interestingtip . Getting none , he looked away at last . Nathaniel Hicks , relieved , looked away , too , his eyes moving down the wide shadowed passage to the bright late sun beyond the archp265of the entrance door . He saw several figures on the steps outside . Nathaniel Hicks opened his mouth idly , about to say Pope 's line aloud  --  if Captain Wiley was made to think by poetry , that might stay him ! An oddness in the gesture or movement of the figures beyond the door then brought his eye back to them . He studied them with perplexity . There were a number of them . Because of the screen doors and the blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though their silhouettes were sharp . The short , erect one , which Nathaniel Hicks recognized as that of the MP lieutenant , had moved from his post at the side of the arch . Being on the top step , inside , his head came higher than the others . They , standing together on lower steps might have gathered to listen to orders or instructions ; but certainly they were not the MP 's from the jeeps in the drive . The MP 's all wore helmets . A confused stirring , a movement of heads and shifting of shoulders took place in the listening group . The MP lieutenant , rigid , seemed to be looking them over , turning his face from those at the left to those at the right . Then he moved , too , making a smart stride to the rear , which brought his back against the wide screens of the big double door . With a motion inexplicablylike that of a man preparing to conduct setting-up exercisesor taking a formal stance before doing a fancy dive from a springboard , he lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , straight and level . His audience seemed disconcerted . They remained immobile a moment . Then one figure mounted a step , and another mounted two steps . The first figure joined him . The rest then moved , closing up , jostling each other . There was an indistinct murmur . The MP lieutenant , his arms still straight out against the door , did not budge . The two foremost figures , coming in under the arch , were now on the MP lieutenant 's level , and they were taller than he was . Nathaniel Hicks followed this amazing dumbshow with his lips parted . Captain Wiley said : " Say , what gives , Nat ? " He pulled himself around and looked over his shoulder . At the door , the silhouettes beyond the screen seemed frozen  |p266again  in their new positions . Then everything moved again , jerking forward . The larger of the two figures immediately facingthe MP lieutenant lifted his hands and seemed to lean slightly . His arms spread in a slow sweep and came around the lieutenant . They drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dance . Now the arch was filled by a general disorderly surge . The high screen doors trembled ; they parted at the center , swingingin , admitting the whole group in a straining huddled mass that pushed before it the MP lieutenant , off his feet , clasped and carried in the big figure 's arms . The others deployed past this embraced couple , their heads turning as though in search or inquiry . Their moving black faces shone ; and Nathaniel Hicks saw that they were Negro officers . The irruption , bringing all the actors from perplexing silhouettesto solid , three-dimensional people , ended , perhaps becauseof altered acoustics in the vaults of the passage , the dumbshowwith its uncertain murmurs . What was plainly the MP lieutenant 's voice , high and angered , yet not uncontrolled , said : "  --  your hands off that ! You see my brassard ! You are not allowed  --  " In answer , a deeper , African voice , speaking gruntingly , with labor , said : " I do n't want to hurt you , lieutenant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Another voice , urgent and excited , said authoritatively : " Set him down , I say . Set him down , now  --  " " He want to arrest us , I guess  --  " " That 's all right , now . Carter 's got his gun . Let him go ahead . Let him do that . " The MP lieutenant , released so suddenly that he staggered , said , breathless : " I order you to return my side arm ! I order you to leave this building immediately  --  " " Do n't go , anybody ! " " No , do n't go  --  " Behind Nathaniel Hicks , at the other table , one of the women said : " Oh ! "  --  a faint little scream . The abrupt scrape of chairs would be the Engineer officers getting up . Captain Wiley , with extraordinary quickness , already had his feet under him whilehis chair fell over on its side . His tall form straightened with formidable alacrity ; he wheeled easily , perhaps by an illusion of late @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the group . " Give that here , boy ! " Captain Wiley said . His long arm went out and snatched the MP 's holstered automatic and the dangling belt from the man who held them . In a tone full of danger , his soft strong voice broadening in an Alabama accent which usually appeared as no more than a trace of drawl , CaptainWiley said : " Get ! All you ! " He swung the belt and holster lightly , advancing with so much purpose that there was a general stunned recoil . " Now , you heard the lieutenant , " he said , earnest and even . " Now , you get ! Right quick ! You , too , there ! Stay out of here  --  " The MP lieutenant , disheveled , his cap gone , but dauntlessly stiff and erect , made a motion which proved to be that of bringing a whistle to his lips . The blast shrilled along the passage vaults . Nathaniel Hicks , still gaping , realized that this explainedit  --  his men must have had orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming , all right . Their metal heels stamped at the double up the steps outside . The round shapes of their bobbing steel helmets rose against the bright arch of the doorway . The screens swung in . A female voice behind Nathaniel Hicks said : " Oh , my good-ness  --  " Nathaniel Hicks saw a stout sergeant , the rim of his helmet shadowing his eyes , a submachine gun laid over his arm , come through the doors . More helmets , more MP brassards crowded closely after him . Out the entrance to the lounge walked a thin , graying major . The major said to Captain Wiley : " All right , please . I 'll just handle this  --  " Captain Wiley , a little higher-colored , his eyes narrower and brighter , turned calmly and looked down at the major . He then looked at the helmeted sergeant with the submachine gun , and the crowd of MP 's . He looked back at the major and laughed . " You want to handle this , too ? " he said . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said : " I 'll take that , sir . " The major said : " I am the Club Officer , Captain . I have specialinstructions for dealing with this matter . Kindly return to your seat . I must ask all witnesses to remain . " He faced the colored officers . " Now , you men , you will step outside , please . I 'll want to see your AGO cards . You are in arrest , all of you . " THE NIGHT was heavy and hot . Beyond the summits of the cork trees and the live oaks the sky , by some trick of refraction in the tropic air , or for some other reason unknown to Colonel Ross , was packed to bursting with stars  --  large ones like brilliantluminous blobs ; small ones unnumbered in drafts of incandescentdust . They gave so much light that , except where the tree shadows held it , the darkness was no more than a deep dusk . From the bungalow verandah the spreading waters of Lake Armstrong could be clearly seen , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile away . Across the hollow in which the swimming pool and the tennis courts lay , the Oleander Towers Hotel bulked up in a long mound on which was imposed the pattern of a hundred lighted windows . All the windows were open on the breathless night . From them came out a medley of distant sounds ; laughter , the humstrum of radio music , radio voices . Loudest of all , now rising , now falling , an unskilled male chorus raucously chanted : " I 've got sixpence . " The singing had persisted to the point where the unflagging singers had only twopence , jolly , jolly twopence ; a point people completely sober would be unlikely to reach , and Colonel Ross listened with disapproval . He did not think that this sound of revelry , particularly on Friday , not Saturday , night , would do anyone any good if it came to be noticed in General Beal 's bungalowa hundred yards away . It would carry there to General Nichols and General Baxter , having a talk with General Beal in the dining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Ross knew where Bus and his visitors were . Half anp269hour ago Mrs. Beal , in an elaborate white dinner dress , had come disconsolately across the lawn . Pouting , she said they had thrown her out as soon as dinner was finished , and she was sick of sitting by herself . She settled in the hammock , tangling her voluminous skirt around her thin legs , carelessly crossed . With one of her infantile gestures , she thrust her right hand into Mrs. Ross 's to be held . With her left hand she covered a little angry yawn . " What goes on around here , anyway ? " she said . " Is there some trouble out at the Area ? " " Why ? " Colonel Ross said . " What makes you think that ? Is that what they 're talking about ? " " I do n't know what they 're talking about , " Mrs. Beal said . " But I 'll bet you do , Norm ! All right , see if I care ! I know something happened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were feeling pretty good  --  been having a few quick ones out at the office , I guess . Then that Mr. Bullen came with his photographer  --  " she giggled . " He called up and asked if he could , and I said , sure . Bus said all right , because you said he was to suck up to Mr. Bullen . " She giggled again . " He said I was n't to say that ; it was unrefined . That 's why I 'm dressed up like Mrs. Astor 's horse . Cora , there 's something cockeyed with this dress . Will you look at it before I go ? It needs something done to it . Well , anyway , they took a lot of pictures of Bus and me sitting on the couch ; and Junior , who acted like hell . They 'll be in the paper tomorrow , Mr. Bullen said . Then they called Bus to the telephone . That was you , Norm . I know it . I could see right away that something bad had happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Benny ? " " No , " Colonel Ross said , " there was no crash , and it was not that Benny . It was merely a little disciplinary difficulty I wanted to report . And that 's all I 'm going to tell you . " At this point Colonel Coulthard , who had been to General Beal 's bungalow and found the general engaged , came across the lawn and tapped on the screen door to ask if he could sit with them . At Mrs. Ross 's suggestion , Colonel Coulthard soon went out to the kitchen and made a pitcher of rum swizzle , a beverage he was supposed to be skillful at concocting . Colonel Ross , very tired , could have done without these visi/tors ; but , since they were putting up General Baxter in their spare room , and since Mr. Botwinick and Major Tietam , the Judge Advocate , were coming down with charges and specificationson the colored officers arrested at the Club , he could not have gone to bed anyway . Besides , it would be too hot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colonel Coulthard , probably tired , too , seemed content enough to sit silently sippinghis drink and smoking his cigar . Mrs. Beal had subsided into a long murmuring conversation with Mrs. Ross at the other end of the verandah . The far-off singers now had no-pence , jolly , jolly no-pence ; and Colonel Ross arose wearily . He went into the bungalow . At the end of the hall a light burned by the telephone . He dialed the hotel and said to the switchboard : " This is Colonel Ross . Find out where that racket is coming from and give them a ring . " He heard the ring almost at once , showing that the party had made itself widely felt . Answering , a facetious voice snapped : " General Beal , here ! " " Colonel Ross , the Air Inspector , here ! " He said as grimly as he could . " Break that up ! If there 's any more singing , I 'll have to have your names and serial numbers , and you can all reply by indorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Yes , sir . " Colonel Ross set down the telephone and made his way out to the verandah again . Colonel Coulthard , who had guessed his errand , said , " We 've got a lot of people around here who think this war is a picnic  --  chance to raise some hell . " " Well , " said Colonel Ross lugubriously , " so it is , so it is . They are n't far wrong there . That 's what makes war so popular with people . " " This one is n't popular with me , " Colonel Coulthard said . He shook his handsome white head . " Not the way I fight it . If I could get out to a combat air force  --  " " Oh , go on , Hal ! " Mrs. Beal called across the verandah . Her waspish tone seemed to say that she too was discontented with this war as it affected her , and with much better reason . She saidp271brutally : " You 're too old and fat . You 're too lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and still you 're kicking ! Ira 's changing your efficiency rating to poor , ' you know . You 'll never get anywhere . " " How 'd you like to have a kid sister like that ? " Colonel Coulthard placidly asked Colonel Ross . " Fresh brat , is n't she ? " " Oh , you ! " Mrs. Beal said . " Why do n't you ever do anything , Hal ? Why do n't you shake the lead out of your pants ? " Dimly in the darkness , her white face , chin belligerently lifted , and her white dress , tensely stretched forward , could be made out . Her voice , throwing the fast jeering questions , trembled with impatience . Colonel Ross supposed that this tone had a long history . It might fetch back to days when she was indeed his " kid sister " ; and Hal , complacent and handsome , from her standpoint failed her in some childish crisis , and so acquainted her for the first time with the more ungrateful truths of life  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gold ! Her attachmentto him was henceforth tinged with exasperation . She said goadingly : " What did you do about that stuff you were saying the other night , that wonderful officer of yours who was going to put everything in a magazine ? Nothing , I bet ! " " That 's where you 're wrong , " Colonel Coulthard said . " I did just what I said I 'd do . I took Captain Hicks over to Bus this morning , and we planned it all out . He 's starting on the project now . So , pipe down ! " " Oh , I 'll bet you 'll make a mess of it ! " Mrs. Beal said . She drew a quivering breath . She said to Mrs. Ross : " I 'm going to bed . I 'm dead . There 's no sense waiting up for those lugs over there . Bus and Jo-Jo will beat their gums for hours . I know them ! By now , they 're reminding each other of all the people they can think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; because of something he did at the Academy , or Kelly , or somewhere . Cora , would you please look at my dress before I go ? " Left alone with Colonel Ross , Colonel Coulthard said almostdefensively : " Sal 's bark is a lot worse than her bite . " He took a swallow from his glass and drew brightly on his cigar . Colonel Ross could see that this was very likely the case . Colonel Coulthard defended , not himself , but his sister against Colonelp272Ross 's possible misunderstanding . Colonel Coulthard knew that no one could seriously consider him lazy . He worked loyally , long and hard , at a job that was not easy for him ; and his Directoratehad an impressive list of projects completed . Neither was he fat , by any means ! From being obliged to sit at a desk so much , he was a little plumper in the face and fuller in the body than he used to be . Neither was he , as a field officer , old . He had his fine white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only forty-five now . Therefore , Sal , in her familiar fiery way , was joking . The point about the efficiency rating was of course an outrageous lie , a joke . Colonel Ross , who knew everyone'sefficiency rating , because General Beal asked his advice in assigning them , knew naturally that Colonel Coulthard 's was consistently superior . When you understood Sal , you knew she was just being funny . Colonel Ross received and accepted this complicated message conveyed by the defensive remark , and by the kindly serious full face , a yard away in the dark . The actual consideration in Colonel Ross 's mind was the laboriousone of whether it would have been wiser to have those men brought to him tonight ; or whether he was right the first time in deciding that it would be good for them to wonder until tomorrow what they were in for . It would probably be necessary to court-martial the Flight Officer , whose name seemed to be Amos NMI Grandgent  --  the one who laid hands on a Deputy Provost Marshal in the person of Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who , it was alleged , while F/O Grandgent held Lieutenant Day , wrongfully possessed himself of Lieutenant Day 's side arm . The question , not quite settled in his own mind , was what exact effect might be expected if the other four were , or were not , charged , too ? The ordinary presumption in law that the others , assisting by their presence , were equally guilty , was probably not here justified in fact  --  or at least might not be justified in fact . It did not follow that any two of the others would have assaulted the Provost Marshal if Grandgent and Carter had n't made itp273unnecessary for them to assault him . Colonel Ross doubted that all six were equally resolute or firmly united in a business they could all be sure must have alarming consequences . It might be better to narrow it down  --  actual manhandling of a provost marshal in the performance of his duties made a military offense so flagrant that it ought to be possible , as it would certainly be very desirable , to appoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court . This , of course , was taking a bright view . There was the possibility , in the dim view , that Bus would have what was substantiallya mutiny to deal with . Mr. Botwinick 's spies reported that , in one of the latrines , had been written by several hands : This is Mr. Charlie 's War ; and Japs fight for Afro-Americans ' Freedom ; there was also a sketch , showing a grave , with For Whites Only printed on the cross at its head . **25;3452;TOOLONG now have a spasm . Luke Howden would want to get to the bottom of this subversive plot before breakfast tomorrow . Without meaning to , Colonel Ross sighed aloud . Colonel Coulthard , whose presence he had actually forgotten while his mind worked with weariness to bring order into this lumber of facts , conjectures , alternate possibilities , inconclusive conclusions , said : " It 's a hard life , Norm . Too damn many things  --  you do all you can ; and then somebody crosses it up . I hear Washington was onto that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not when I was there , " Colonel Ross said . " Pop brought him and Baxter over . We had a social gathering . Bus gave them a drink and they talked about the flight down . Everybody seemed cheerful . " " Jo-Jo gives me the creeps , sometimes , " Colonel Coulthard said moodily . " You do n't know him very well , do you ? " " I never met him before . He seems to be something of a comedian . " " Funny kind of comedy , you 'll find ; if you see much of him . Before you finish laughing , if he decided that was the best thing , you might hear him say : Take that man out and shoot him . ' He 'd mean you . I knew him at Selfridge a good many years ago . He was Adjutant . He really ran the place . He runsp274every place he is . You know ; other people are horsing around , interested in different things ; they get tired , they get sick of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He just drives right on . And , Norm , he is n't here for fun ; do n't think he is . " People in a service as close and clannish as the old Air Corps had a tendency to entertain extravagant ideas , whether hostile , or admiring , or , significantly , both , about each other . By and large , the airmen of the Army between the wars were a highstrunglot . Colonel Ross could see that it was natural , inevitable . They needed special psychological equipment  --  what amounted to a split in personality . To face the endless risks of aerial flight a man must have a sanguine , happy-go-lucky habit of thought ; but replaceable instantly , at need or at will , by its very antithesis  --  afreezing into precision as the controls were taken . This was the condition of survival ; the only way to put off sudden realization of all those risks in sudden death . Colonel Ross did not doubt that Nichols , like the rest of them who were still alive , would occasionally strike his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come down because of the trouble this morning . It was all arranged several days ago . He was coming down for the party tomorrow . " " He must have had some other reason , " Colonel Coulthard said . " And I do n't believe 011ie Baxter 's hopping the plane was any accident . Jingle Willie must have been told to send someonefrom his office , too . Well , we 'll find out , I guess . By the way , what did you make of my man Hicks , Norm ? I meant to ask you . " Colonel Ross contemplated the subject of Captain Hicks without any eagerness . Though he had supported and advanced the scheme  --  indeed , largely arranged it  --  he realized that it was an incidental project , a possible opportunity to embellish or add a little something to his grand project , which he so clearly recognized when he sat moping in the Personnel Analysis Auditorium  --  GeneralBeal . His judgment would not agree that it was a necessary job ; and his experience assured him it was a useless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sorts for claiming their techniques were effective or even irresistible.  |p275That  they could mold opinion was proved by the way they had molded the Army 's opinion , made almost everyone on the top level repeat meekly after them that public relations and its work of propaganda or , if you wished , " indoctrination , " was of the most vital importance . Colonel Ross doubted if anything done since , and as a result of , this triumph at the top had producedadvantageous changes in the public attitude ; or that the war , due to these efforts , was in any way more popular  --  more vigorously pressed , more fully supported . Though they might like some of its effects , the people did not like war and nobody could make them like it . The effects they liked ; high wages ; the chance it gave a good many people to push in the name of the emergency other people around , needed like good wine no bush . Men did not have to be artfully persuaded to like what they liked . Where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like , it was as always a complete and ludicrous failure . The measure of this failure was clearest where its success was supposed to be most important . You had simply to contrast the time and effort put into " indoctrinating " the military rank and file , instructing the individual fighting man in " war aims , " with the results as they appeared in his ordinarythought and real attitude . The average man already had firmly in mind the one war aim that carried or ever could carry any weight with him . His war aim was to get out as soon as possible and go home . This did n't mean that he would n't fight  --  on the contrary . Brought within fighting distanceof the enemy , he saw well enough that until those people over there were all killed or frightened into quitting , he would never get home . He did not need to know about their bad acts and wicked principles . Compared to the offense they now committedby being here , and by shooting at him and so keeping him here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their commanders , were trifles . Though the level of intelligence in the average man might be justly considered low , in very few of them would it be so low that they accepted notions that they fought , an embattled band of brothers , for noble " principles . " They would howl at the idea ; just as , in general , theyp276despised and detested all their officers ; hated the rules and regulations and disobeyed as many as they could ; and from morning to night never stopped cursing the Army , scheming to get out of it , and hotly bitching about the slightest inconvenience , let alone hardship . On the face of it , Colonel Ross must admit , it would be hopeless to embark such an Army on a serious military campaign . Such men certainly did seem to need " indoctrination " the worst way  --  that is , if you knew nothing about the history of American arms . Colonel Ross could remember from his youthfulenlisted days the attitude of the heroes of that war , the disgruntledvolunteers . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too  --  had drifted down to them from the Civil War . The song 's enjoyable concluding couplet went : " We 'll hoist Old Glory to the top of the pole ; And we 'll all re-enlist  --  in a pig 's asshole ! " This irritable , almost infuriated scorn ; this coupling of images , with the wish to outrage fancy sentiments entertained ( they suspected ) at home , summed up the American attitude . Colonel Ross , and anyone who used his eyes and ears , could see it had not changed . Colonel Ross doubted if it could be changed ; and , as a matter of fact , whether from any practical military standpointit needed to be changed . When the fighting began the bitchers would fight all right . Indeed , the event , the battle , proved that  --  still bitching , only more so ; despising their officersstill more ; hating the Army still more , and regarding ordersstill less  --  they would usually fight to somewhat better purpose , man for man , than whoever was opposite them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Colonel Ross roused himself to an effort , not very successful , to recall the talk yesterday . He said : " I got the impression that Hicks could do it , if it can be done . If that 's what you mean . I imagine he has contacts he can use if he wants to . I do n't think he was too enthusiastic about the idea , as an idea . "  | " Why not ? " Colonel Coulthard said . " I thought he was , this morning . " " I could be wrong , " Colonel Ross said . " Only , I do n't think I am . I think Hicks knows his field very well . I guess he was fairly important . He probably had a good deal of authority ; I mean , he did n't have to ask anyone what he 'd better think . Did he tell you he thought it was a good idea ? " " Not in so many words , " Colonel Coulthard said . " I did n't ask him . He seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get the impression that he was doing something he did n't want to . Is that what you think ? " " Did you get any impression about what he thinks of you ? " " I do n't know , " Colonel Coulthard said , surprised . " I really have n't seen a great deal of him . He 's polite and pleasant . He does n't seem to mind taking orders , even if he was some kind of big shot  --  " Colonel Ross said : " You generally get to be some kind of big shot by using your head , one way or another . In the Army , you use your head by saying : yes , sir . " " I see what you mean , " Colonel Coulthard said . The meaningapparently troubled him . He gave a short laugh . " Maybe Hicks thinks I 'm just dumb . He could , all right . I would n't blame him . I guess he knows a lot of things I do n't . There are some damn able men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , I do n't mind admitting I 'd be a lot smarter than I am . At least five , I think six , are right there in Who 's Who in America , so that shows you . Still , I do n't think they dislike me  --  " Colonel Ross said : " All I said was that if the project was left to him , Hicks might not , in his editorial capacity , be interested in the idea . That 's all right . It need n't be left to him in his editorial capacity . " Colonel Coulthard said , uneasily , " I see that , Norm . Maybe I did give him a direct order to do it , and he said : yes , sir . But I definitely thought he was willing  --  " " I think you thought right , " Colonel Ross said . " I could see yesterday that he would n't mind the idea of doing a special job for the general . This morning , when he thought it over , he prob/ably still liked it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to show him , he 'll go back to his editorial capacity and decide there is n't anything he wants to do . We can help him with that . Maybe he 'd better go to New York for a few weeks temporary duty to talk over the stuff with different magazines or people , see what he can arrange . I know his wife and family are up there somewhere . " " Sure , " Colonel Coulthard said . " I suppose he ought to get something for it . I never know quite how to handle some of these  --  " On the screen door at the end of the porch an apologetic tap sounded . Looking over his shoulder , Colonel Ross said , " Come in , come in ! " Though he had not heard any car , he assumed , able to see the figure beyond the screen , that it was Mr. Botwinick . He saw now that it was General Baxter . Getting to his feet , he said , " Come in , General ! Your things were sent up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pitcher there , if he has n't drunk it all . " " Thanks very much , Colonel , " General Baxter said . " I do n't think I will . Hello , Hal . Colonel , Bus asked me to tell you he telephoned the Judge Advocate and had him hold those papers . He thought it would save time if the three of you considered them together in the morning . I will sit down a minute , if I may . " General Baxter groped for , and found , the couch . He let himself down on it heavily . " Not tonight , " he said , " but sometime tomorrow morning , if you can , I wish you 'd write or dictate a short statement for me on Colonel Woodman . I 'm flying up there at noon for the investigation . " Colonel Coulthard said : " That was a damn awkward thing , was n't it ? You know who Bus first heard it from ? My man , Hicks ! I was there . That was damn awkward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . Hicks knew , because he had a call from a fellow up there about a job he was doing . He thought he 'd better tell Bus . Bus got white as a sheet . I think he really cared a good deal for Woody . " General Baxter said solemnly : " I 'm sure everyone who knew him was shocked . That 's why it was decided to appoint an In/vestigating Officer from HqAAF . The Old Man wanted to get to the bottom of it . " " What I hear , " Colonel Coulthard said , " he might better not get there . " General Baxter frowned ; but he said smoothly enough : " We 'll find what we find . Since you saw him yesterday , Colonel , it would be a great help if you 'd set down anything you observedabout Colonel Woodman 's state of mind . Bus said you had quite a long talk with him alone . I daresay you formed an opinion about the rationality of some of the ideas he ex-pressed . " " I see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement ready before you leave . " " Bus said , among other things , that he thought Woody 's behavior when he came down to meet you on the ramp was quite clearly distraught . " " That 's true , " Colonel Ross said . " I had forgotten that . " " I think we may find , " General Baxter said , " that Colonel Woodman has n't been right in the head . Not for some time . There were some very strange unauthorized communications from him to Headquarters . Well , I must n't keep you up to talk about it now . I hope I have n't kept you up . It 's very kind of you and Mrs. Ross to be willing to take me in , Colonel . " " I 'll show you your room , General . We 're very glad to have you . " +Lying on his back , frowning at the ceiling in an effort to keep awake , Colonel Ross said : " You know Captain Hicks . He was the one who took us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was down visiting him . " Mrs. Ross , who was at the dressing table methodically administering to her hair the hundred brush strokes it got every night before she retired , said : " Oh , that one ! Yes ; she was quite a nice little thing ; but not very sensible . I never knew what he did before he was in the Army . She told me she was n't able to come down to stay because they had children in school up North . She thought it would be bad for them to be draggedp280around the country . I could have told her she was much mistaken . Disturbing their routine would do them more good than harm . A child will take almost anything for granted , if you let him . He 's not nearly as sensitive as you are ; and he adapts himself very easily . They seemed to have plenty of money ; so there was no real reason why she could n't come , if she wanted to . " Colonel Ross said : " I think , in many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family down here . Where is he going to put them ? It is n't entirely a matter of money . I 've heard you find fault from time to time with what we have ; but this is the very best there is ; and the only reason you have it is that you happen to be married to a chicken colonel . " Mrs. Ross said : " That 's a man 's argument , Norman . Any woman knows perfectly well that she is either married , and so lives with her husband ; or she is n't married at all . It may be very uncomfortable , and very inconvenient ; but she ought to be with him , if it is in any way possible . Unless he has been sent overseas , she can always make it possible . She has no right to let him live alone . It is n't good for him ; and what is n't good for him will not , in the end , be good for her . " Colonel Ross smiled drowsily . He said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the opportunity to misbehave himself . A good many undoubtedly do ; but I think Hicks is quite a steady , sober fellow . " " That was n't my whole meaning , " Mrs. Ross said . Laying down the hair brush , she began to braid her hair . " But , yes . Certainly . I know about men . There 's not one of them , get him away from his wife and family , who does n't begin to kick up his heels and look around for chances to show what a gay dog he is . I daresay the chances available often do n't quite suit him  --  they look risky ; or they cost too much . Though , of course , he would n't pinch pennies the way he would at home . Or the girl sees right away that he 's a married man on the loose , and that does n't happen to be what she wants . So , if he does behave himself , you can be sure it is for one of those reasons ; and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . " Which reason do you think was mine ,  |p281when  I spent those months in Washington last year ? I can assure you that I never misbehaved . " " You would assure me that , even if you had , Norman . I admit it would be the least you could do . It 's not an assurance any sensible woman wastes breath asking a man for . I meant risky ' as covering quite a wide range , not just whether his wife would catch him . An older man may feel , and how rightly , that he 'll look ridiculous tagging after some little creature half his age . He might not be able to face what other people would think of him . If he knows he 's not as young as he was , he may be afraid of things the little creature herself might have occasion to think . Those are risks to his dignity . " " I admit I am not as young as I was , " Colonel Ross said ; " but for my age , I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about that , Norman ; though I do n't know whether I could speak for little creatures half your age , if you were ever silly enough to take up with some . I 'm simply saying that any intelligent woman knows you ca n't be married on a part-time , or spare-time , basis . Men have no sense about themselves , left to themselves . Unless a woman wants him to get into all kinds of trouble , she has no business to leave him for months and months . I did n't leave you for months and months , you may remember . And it was not convenienttraveling on those trains , or comfortable living in that hotel weekends ; and I had a hundred things to do at home , closing up , and so on . " " Why , my dear , " Colonel Ross said , " I imagined that it was pure affection that prompted your visits . " " So it was ! Do you think any woman who was n't devoted to you would take all that trouble to see how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your laundry was being done  --  and , of course , yes , to see that you did n't , like a certain number of men your age , and you know some of them , developnotions . Every cocktail lounge in Washington was full of them , picking up girls and drinking , if not actually too much , more than they were used to . If you remember what they looked like , you 'll agree that no woman who was really fond of a man could let him make such a spectacle of himself.  |p282And  it would be a case of her letting him . He 'd never be doing it , if he was n't left at loose ends , with no one to look after him . " " He certainly would n't be doing it if he had no opportunity to do it . I see that , " Colonel Ross said . " I am very glad indeed to have you looking after me ; so you will not mistake me if I say that I think it quite possible that a fellow like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a home and children , might refrain for months and months from doing anything that would hurt his wife for no better reason than that he was fond of her . " " The weak point there , Norman , if by any chance you are n't perfectly aware of it , is the definition of anything that would hurt his wife . ' He 'll always end by deciding it is n't a matter of what he does , it 's a matter of what she knows . He is wrong , of course . Either you see why , or you do n't . It is a matter of falsifying a relationship , which has to be a kind of common trust , between two people . If he is , in the very exact phrase , untrue , and she does n't know it , he may think he 's getting away with something . He is n't . He has made it no longer a common trust . He 's made an unstable arrangement of ignorance on one side and deceit on the other . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about . Sal is very unhappy about Bus . " " Why ? " Colonel Ross said . Mrs. Ross had taken an orange stick , twisted a little cotton around the end with neat firm movements and applied vaseline to the bases of her nails . " She finally told me what I think is the principal thing . He does n't sleep with her , Norman . He has n't for over two weeks . She is very much upset . She was crying about it . " " The confidences of women seem to me extraordinary , " Colonel Ross said . " What did you say ? " " I told her I thought it showed nothing but that he was very tired . I told her she should insist on his taking a week 's leave at once and going away somewhere . He could surely do that . Could n't you talk to this Nichols man , get him to tell them , when he gets back to Washington , to order Bus to take a week 's leave ? I told her I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I can , " Colonel Ross said . " I never met  |p283General  Nichols before , if I could be said to have met him now . I shook hands with him in Bus 's office . With somebody I knew well , I might do it . I 'd know how to put it to him . Incidentally , Baxter is here on his way to investigate the business at Sellers Field . I think he intends to find that Colonel Woodman was overwrought . I would not want it to get back to Washington right now that General Beal 's staff was worried about him . " Mrs. Ross faced around . " I think you have something on your mind , too , Norman . Sal says she knows that Colonel Carricker is in some sort of trouble , and that 's part of what worries Bus . Is that what worries you , too ? " " There 's nothing much to that , " Colonel Ross said . " Benny is impetuous in his habits . He lost his temper and punched another officer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Bus did n't want to . We had a long talk . Bus is very strong for Benny . " " Yes , I know that . Sal is quite savage about Benny . I do n't like Carricker at all . I do n't see how anyone could . " " That 's because you are looking for the wrong things , " Colonel Ross said . " Benny represents something to Bus . It is n't entirely unreasonable . I do n't suppose one man in a thousand has what Benny has when , as Bus would say , the chips are down . I can see it . I suppose you never have to wonder if you 're covered , where your wingman is , if Benny is your wingman . I suppose Benny can just naturally outfly and outshoot anything that comes up against him ; a beautiful sight . I suppose , when there 's one second to do it , and you must be right or you 'll be dead , Benny sees it and does it before he or anyone else has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that last . I have seen Benny pull out a plane that , I expect , anyone else would have crashed ; and I was on it . " Mrs. Ross said : " You never told me that . Yes . You 're quite right . Never tell me . I do n't want to know . I wish you would n't go flying all the time . I know it 's useless to say that . I do n't understand what you mean by saying Benny represents something to Bus . " " Maybe I do n't understand myself , " Colonel Ross said , " but something occurred to me this afternoon . I am not sure Bus  |p284understands  it . He may ; in an intuitive way . I think Benny is what Bus wishes he were ; what Bus thinks he might have been , if they 'd only had the war fifteen years ago , not now when he 's forty and too old . Though I am sure Bus does n't know this , I am also sure that nothing flatters him so much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him , disobey him sometimes . That way , he knows Benny respects him . I think Benny does , too . I think Bus is one of the very few people Benny has any use for . They make sense to each other . " " I think it is dreadful ! " Mrs. Ross said . She spoke with such unexpected intensity , and so vehemently that Colonel Ross opened his closed eyes . She had arisen from the dressing table and put out a hand that shook a little to snap off the light there . She said : " I think it 's dreadful that they make sense to each other . They really make no sense at all ! That 's what is wrong with all this . That revolting young thug is supposed to make sense ! If he does , then certainly nothing else does . Have you heard anything about Jimmy that you have n't told me ? " " Why , no , my dear , " Colonel Ross said , " I am not sure I see the connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Ross said . She came over to the bed and sat on the edge . She bent and removed her slippers . " Believe me , there is . " She snapped off the light on the bedside table and tensely lay down in the dark beside him . " You must not worry , " Colonel Ross said . " He will be all right . " " No , " she said , " he wo n't be all right . He is never coming back . He is going to be killed . " Colonel Ross drew a deep breath . " That is absurd , Cora , " he said . " I can tell you that our overall bomber losses are proving light . Only a fraction of what we anticipated , what we were prepared for . His chances are excellent . They will soon be even better , because we will be in a position to rotate the crews , bring home those who have flown a certain number of missions . Those are military secrets , of course . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You read what he wrote himself . He  --  " " I suppose they see to what he writes . I suppose he tries top285write what he thinks I want to read . Even so , I know he was afraid when he wrote that letter , that last one . " Since that letter had been dated 18 August , Colonel Ross thought this likely . Every bomber base in England must have known by then what happened on the seventeenth . They must have known , too , that this was n't the last , this was the first , massive strike at the German fighter-plane production complexes . That day , there was probably no member of any bomber crew at any base who was not afraid when he thought about it . Of course , most of the time , he did n't think about it . Colonel Ross said : " I suppose you have me to blame , my dear . But I did not see what else I could do . And I do n't see now . " " No ; it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I tried so hard  --  then something comes along , I do n't know what , and just knocks everything over . What is the use of it ? " Colonel Ross said : " Do n't press me on that point . I will not conceal it from you . I often wonder . I was wondering this afternoon . I am an old man ; and the longer I live , the less I know , and the worse I do ; and what , indeed , is the use of it ? You ca n't do anything with people ; I have been trying all day . I think Colonel Mowbray is a good man , and he is the biggest fool I know . We are having a little trouble with some Negro officers . They feel they are unjustly treated . I think in many ways they are ; but there are insurmountable difficulties in doing them justice . The only people who stood up for them were two offensive young fellows , I think principally interested in showing off , in making themselves felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one way or another odious . I speak with confidence ; for the certain number who looked all right , looked that way , I understand by now , only because I really knew nothing about them . And , of course , in every situation , I was odious , too . " " I know , " Mrs. Ross said . She moved until her head rested against his shoulder . " Let 's not go on about it . "  | T HE COLORED boy thrust his head out the elevator door , looking up and down the corridor . " Hold it ! " Nathaniel Hicks said . He broke into a trot while he fumbled with the strap of his wrist watch which he had been putting on . It was five minutes of seven in the morning . The waiting elevator contained a . ald and solemn lieutenant colonel with Chemical Warfare insignia , probably a visitor down on temporary duty ; and Major Beaudry , of Special Projects ' Charts and Plans Section . Major Beaudry , a diffidentlookinglittle blond man with glasses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a plaintive volubility well-known to Nathaniel Hicks , he continuedat once : " Look ; what time do you think you and your friend will be around about those diagrams ? The Photographic Section put in for a rush job on some lettering . It would n't take very long , and if you were n't ready until nine o'clock or so , say , I 'd let McCabe do that first . I tell you , I 'm going crazy ! Everyone thinks we can do everything on one minute 's notice ! I did n't mean you . You told me about this job a week ago . I had n't forgotten it . Then , coming around yesterday , you give me a chance to see how much there is , and to keep McCabe clear for it today . If you have to start early , if your man has to get back to Orlando , or something ; why , the hell with Photographic ! They 'll just have to wait . I told you you could have McCabe , and you can . " Nathaniel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead . I 'll find out as soon as I can , and call you . I do n't know what 's going to go on this morning . After we talked to you , I took Wiley out to the Club ; and there was a fuss there , and some people got arrested . The Club Officer took our names as witnesses , and said we 'd probably be required to attend some hearing or whatever they have this morning . I do n't know when or where . Are you going out now ? "  | " Well , that 's all right , Nat . If you 're delayed , McCabe can do the other . But just let me hear if you ca n't get over at all , will you ? Yes ; I thought I 'd go right out . If I 'm not in an hour before anyone else , we never get going . Could n't give you a lift , could I ? " " Will you ? " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Don Andrews has my car . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an Eastern Airlines plane , due at two or three . And there was n't any way she could get over . " Major Beaudry said : " I wish I could get my wife down . My , I 'm sick of living in a hotel . But , honestly ! You ever try looking for a place to live around here ? I swear to you , I was offered a two-room shanty with a pump and an outhouse at a special rate , because they were patriotic and I was in the Army , of one hundred dollars a month ! If I did n't want it , there were plenty of people who did . " " I know , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I suppose you 're in the same fix , " Major Beaudry said . " You do n't want to ask your wife to come and live in a pigsty , or one room in a hotel . Then , when you have kids , they 're probably in school ; and then you probably have a place somewhere ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you could rent it , and maybe you could n't , what with people not being able to get gas , or even maybe fuel oil to heat it . Oh , I tell you , it 's a mess ! " The elevator doors opened on the lobby . Major Beaudry and Nathaniel Hicks drew back to allow the Chemical Warfare lieutenant colonel to precede them . He nodded in solemn acknowledgment . Major Beaudry said : " Say , is n't that Andrews ? " Looking , Nathaniel Hicks said : " Yes ; and that 's his wife , all right . You know , that 's typical of Don ! He probably got in here around five o'clock . He 's going to put her up in his room in our apartment ; but he did n't want to disturb us , I suppose . So they just sit down here and wait until we show . " " He 's an awful nice fellow , I think , " Major Beaudry said . " I hear he 's a mathematical genius . Somebody told me he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not quite , " Nathaniel Hicks said , amused by this finep291example of the relationship borne by what you " hear " to what is actually the case . " What he did was break the Navy code , to pass an idle hour ; and I suppose they had to overhaul the whole thing . It was at Gravelly . I was there when he did it . Well , I wo n't need the lift , thanks , Claude . " " But you 'll let me know as soon as you can about whether you need McCabe , wo n't you ? " Captain Andrews had now seen Nathaniel Hicks . He arose from the couch and came rapidly to meet him . " Thanks a million , Nat , " he said . " Here 's your key . We used about eight gallons of your gas , I figured . I 'm sorry about those coupons . I just hope you are n't going to need them . But here 's the cash for the gas , anyway . You got time to come and meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Look , you dope ! She must be dead . Why did n't you bring her up when you came in and let her go to bed ? " " Oh , we thought we 'd wake you if we came banging in there . She slept some in the car . We stopped and got some breakfast at a road stand , so we were n't here until quite a bit after five . " " Well , Clarence ought to be down in a minute . I ordered him to give the place a good scrubbing before he left . " Though a photograph of Captain Andrews 's wife stood on his bureau ( along with a photograph of his mother ; and of a sister of his ) , Nathaniel Hicks was not sure that he would have recognized her . The photograph must have been taken a numberof years ago , and he got from it the casual impression that Mrs. Andrews was a plumpish , probably short and heavy girl . She was , instead , he saw , thin and tall with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curves of the photograph ( probably a bad one ) with a wan , not-young look  --  Nathaniel Hicks guessed she was in her early thirties . She had narrow graceful eyebrows of a light reddish brown , and matchinghair  --  rather thin and brittle-looking ; no vigor of red in the tone . Her eyes were a pale blue with , as she turned them , a tinge of green . Her thin body was sunk in lines of exhaustion against the faded cretonne cushions of the lobby couch . From the way she drew in her breath and moistened her lips beforep292smiling at him , Nathaniel Hicks concluded that she did not feel very well . She offered him a thin narrow hand that proved to be cool , even cold . Her clothes were simple and unnoticeable and had not cost much . The shoes of some reptile skin on her slender feet were scuffed . Nathaniel Hicks found himself touched in a mixed way  --  by the inexpensive , no , cheap , yet not tasteless frock , the old shoes ; by the thin face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed her eyes over Captain Andrews ; by the staunch effort of will which enabled her to smile . " It was so nice of you to lend Don your car , Captain Hicks , " she said . " I do n't believe I ever would have managed to get here by myself . Oh , it was so wonderful when I saw him in front of the airport waiting at the fence there ! It was all I could do to keep from bursting into tears . " " Well , we 're very glad you 're here , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Don 's been fretting so , and fussing around , and biting his nails , that if it had been any longer we 'd have had to shoot him , I guess . " She lifted her eyes and looked at Captain Andrews wordlessly . Captain Andrews said : " That 's a fact ! I never thought of it , but I guess I drove them all crazy . You just could n't get any space anywhere . As I told you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could bring you in here . " She managed to get her eyes away from Captain Andrews and said to Nathaniel Hicks : " I do think it 's awfully hard on you , Captain Hicks . And on Captain Duchemin . " " You 're quite wrong , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " We had to straighten the place up for the first time , though I doubt if you see where we did it . Under various things , Clarence found forty-one cents in cash ; and I found a Club coupon book of mine with a dollar-ten in coupons in it . So , you see  --  there 's Clarence now . It 's all clear ; and all yours . " Captain Duchemin , his big body rolling limberly from foot to foot , came across the old marble slabs . " Katherine , " Captain Andrews said . " This is our other victim  --  " His eyes bright and smiling , his wide , placid face grave , Captain Duchemin inclined his big cropped head , and when he saw she was holding her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathaniel Hicks had observed before that Clarencewas not easy with women on whom he could not very well be forming any design . He said , gravely : " How do you do ? I 'm Captain Hick 's orderly , ma'am . I have to report to the captain : mission accomplished . Kitchen scrubbed ; bathroom scrubbed ; wet towels taken out of corners ; old shirt removed from light fixture ; empty bottles pushed under sofa ; dirt swept under rug  --  it 's in apple-pie order . " " I think it 's so kind of both of you , " Mrs. Andrews said . She got to her feet , and put a hand as though steadying herself , on her husband 's arm . " Not at all , ma'am , " Captain Duchemin said , " I speak for Captain Hicks , too . Because he 's my senior in grade , he makes me do most of his speaking for him , while he lolls around all day  --  " " Nat , " Captain Andrews said , " I 'll be out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Woolsey , in case he tries to call my Section for anything ? " With Captain Duchemin , Nathaniel Hicks moved into the stream crossing the lobby to the front doors . Captain Duchemin said : " I think I 'll be bivouacking in the field tonight , Captain . My young pigeoneer seems to have recovered from his indispositionof yesterday and we 're concerting a joint operation on the unfinished business out there . " " All right , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " A serious understatement ! " Captain Duchemin said . " I suppose it 's the best you can do . " They crossed the high verandah and went down the steps into the already-hot sunlight . Blinking in the bright glare , Captain Duchemin cut a mock caper . Ebullient , light-hearted , he began to hum . Then , pitching his lowered voice to a reedy feminine falsetto , he began happily to sing . " Oh , please do to me , " he sang , " what you did to Marie  --  " he rolled his eyes up . " Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall , cool , empty , and shadowed , of that wing of Headquarters Quadrangle which contained General Beal'sp294office Mr. Botwinick walked rapidly . Electric light fell out the door of the Message Center and the drumming click of the battery of teletype machines came with it . There was no other sound and no one in sight . Above the long range of closed doors , neat gold-lettered signs hung on metal brackets : Assistant Adjutant ; Adjutant General ; Cryptographic Security Office ; Judge Advocate General Section ; A-z , A-2 , A-3i A-4 ; ExecutiveOfficer ; and at the end : Office of the Commanding General . Enter through zozA . Mr. Botwinick opened an unmarked door between A-4 and Executive Officer and entered briskly . " Oops ! " he said at once . " I beg your pardon , Colonel ! I did n't know anyone was in yet . " The room held several desks , some pushed together toward the corner , some at a careless angle , which gave them an unused or little-used look . At one of them , with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comic section in his lap , sat Lieutenant Colonel Carricker . He said , " Hello , Botty . " Mr. Botwinick gave him an attentive , furtive look . LieutenantColonel Carricker raised a cigarette burning between his fingers and took a puff . His hand was not steady . He spit a fragment of tobacco from his lip and ground the cigarette end out on the surface of the desk . His face looked damp , pale under the tan , and slightly tumid . His eyes were markedly bloodshot . " I just wanted to get some forms from the filing case there , sir , " Mr. Botwinick said . He went briskly over and pulled a drawer out . Lieutenant Colonel Carricker said : " What 's the pitch , Botty ? " Mr. Botwinick said : " Today , I really do n't know , sir . We were trying to get you yesterday . I believed the general wanted you for something . " " What did he want me for ? " " I was n't told , sir . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is he sore ? " " Well , Colonel , we telephoned your quarters several times . Colonel Mowbray said finally not to call any more . I suppose the general knows . " " What 's he doing this morning ? " " Why , I think the general is pretty well tied up , Colonel . P295General Nichols , Deputy Chief of Air Staff , and General Baxter of the Air Inspector 's Office , flew in late yesterday afternoon and I imagine he will be tied up with them , though I understand General Baxter is leaving at noon . " " What 'd I better do ? " Mr. Botwinick , who had possessed himself of a handful of printed forms from the file drawer , shut the drawer carefully . His sharp eyes brightened . He pursed his lips thoughtfully . " Suppose I inform Colonel Mowbray , as soon as he comes in ; that you are here , Colonel ? It might be a good idea to have a talk with him . Though I do n't know definitely , I think there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officer with whom the  --  er  --  incident took place Thursday night . He was seriously injured . " " Where is he ? " " At the Base Hospital , I believe , sir . " " Do any good if I went over there now ? " " I would n't do that , sir , until I talked to Colonel Mowbray . " " I 'm in a jam , huh ? " " I 'm afraid so , Colonel . I happened to know that the general directed that papers be drawn , charges and specifications . " " I know that , too . " Lieutenant Colonel Carricker lit another cigarette shakily and threw the match on the floor . " What happened to them ? " " They were held , " Mr. Botwinick said . " I got the impression that Colonel Ross was opposed . " " Colonel Ross ? " Lieutenant Colonel Carricker pondered a moment . " I do n't believe that , " he said . " He 'd sure as hell slap it on me if he could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happening ? " " Quite a good deal has been happening . " Mr. Botwinick looked out the window into the quadrangle . " Some friends of the officer you struck , sir , were incensed , or pretended to be . A group of them attempted to force their way into the Area Officers Club , which is off limits for them , late yesterday after-. noon . They overpowered the Provost Marshal 's officer and six of them are in arrest . I understand that the general has been in communication with Washington . " He paused . " I will tell you P296in confidence , Colonel , that there is a TWX in this morning which the general has not yet seen , though he will see it within the next half hour . I delivered it with the other messages to Colonel Howden , who went down a few minutes ago . One of the press services picked up a dispatch with an Ocanara date line about a colored officer being assaulted by white officers and hospitalized . It seemed to be a garbled version of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What do you think that means ? " " It could mean trouble , sir . I believe Washington took a strong line on the desirability of avoiding disturbance and publicityover the difficulty with the colored personnel . I suggest you talk to Colonel Mowbray , sir . I was just going to get myself some coffee , Colonel . Could I bring you some ? " " Yeah , will you ? " Lieutenant Colonel Carricker said . Area Officers Mess Number Two was a long , low , yellowframebuilding , with a kitchen wing built at right angles to it , between the row of BOQ 's along Lake Oberon and the most easterly of the Directorate centers  --  Bombardment Analysis . At quarter past seven the line always began at the door , or even on the steps outside , and extended the length of the room . It then doubled back along the cafeteria counter . The ranges of bare board tables , each seating twelve , were , in spite of the crowd , half empty ; for most people ate in haste and the stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving counter the mess orderlies were really sweating . The in-and-out doors to the kitchen wing swung constantly . Stacks of metal trays came banging to replace the piles at the head of the counter , diminishing as the line moved . Plates with slices of three kinds of melon were hastily dealt out onto the beds of crushed ice . The dozens and dozens of glasses of fruit juice embedded in the ice bed were renewed as fast as they were taken . Wheeled conveyors came from the kitchens to the steam tables with full pans of scrambled and fried eggs , of bacon and sausage and ham . Another was droppedP297in place over the hot water as soon as the servers , filling and passing out the plates , emptied one . Metal baskets of rolls and muffins and biscuits were pulled from the warming cabinets and dumped into the open compartments in the counter . One man did nothing but lay out on wide trays inch-square butter pats which came from molds that impressed on them : Buy More Bonds ; Remember Pearl Harbor ; Keep ' Em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottles of milk in a trough of ice . Two others filled coffee cups from the big urns and handed them forward . At the end , a checker , a WAC corporal , surveyed the approachingtrays , punched her machine and dropped checks on them . The cashier , a civilian woman , took the checks and money and feverishly made change . Carrying their trays , the breakfastersdistributed themselves , glancing around at the tables which a half dozen men kept clearing of used dishes and wiping with damp cloths . Big fans in the corners of the room had already been turned on . Over the tables and the line and the counters arose a steady din of talk , the scuff of moving feet , the bang and clatter of trays and dishes . The warm , damp air smelt of bacon and coffee and tobacco smoke . Down near the door , at a table for the moment otherwise unoccupied , Captain Burton , the WAC Staff Director , sat eating a good breakfast with Lieutenant Lippa and Lieutenant Turck . Since it was more convenient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Turck  --  on one side ; and one  --  Lieutenant Lippa  --  on the other . Lieutenant Turck , whose breakfast was a glass of fruit juice , a cup of coffee , and a roll , was already through . Having carefullywiped the edge of the table with a paper napkin she put her elbows on it and lit a cigarette . Lieutenant Lippa , who had a half a melon and a bowl of corn flakes , was not so far along . Captain Burton , who had melon , and oatmeal , and ham and eggs , and two muffins , was a good deal slower . Although she ate steadily and with appetite , Captain Burton 's full , sunreddened , well-scrubbed face was troubled . She said , " As of P298One September , it was still the same . It was in the HeadquartersNews Letter . Regardless of assignment , no branch insignia other than Pallas Athenae may be worn by WACs . I think they are going to change that ; but they have not changed it yet . If Colonel Folsom told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wear Air Force insignia , even if she is assigned to Fighter Analysis . She must take it off at once . I will , of course , order her to , if it comes to that ; but I would rather one of you told her in a friendly , informal way . " Lieutenant Lippa said , " Colonel Folsom gave her the insigniahimself and told her to put it on . He said it was authorizedby Air Force Headquarters . I expect she thought she had to . There 's been some hand trouble with Folsom . Somebody told her the best cure was to get three walnuts , you know those big round nuts , and put them under the edge of her stocking top . " She chuckled . " It gives them pause , it seems . " Lieutenant Turck pulled down the corners of her mouth , directing at Lieutenant Lippa , with a shake of the head , a meaningful , warning look . Captain Burton grew redder . She flicked a muffin crumb off the full-busted front of her immaculatekhaki shirt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men , given any opportunity at all , behave like beasts . When a girl knows that , I think she has a special obligation not to offer them , by her attitude or by any act that might be misinterpreted , any opportunity , any incentive . I do n't think she does right to treat the matter lightly or jokingly . She has , as well as her own reputation , the reputation of the whole Corps to consider . A girl who is an officer has an added responsibility to set a tone or standard which the enrolled  --  the enlisted women can respect . I do n't mean that I think Lieutenant Wister is to blame in this case . But I think she can , if she wants to , make it abundantly clear to Colonel  --  to any man , that familiarities would not be welcome . " Captain Burton 's distress was visibly increasing . " It 's just not laying yourself open to misinterpretation . " She came to a painful pause . She took her knife and fork and began to cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Turck transferred the cigarette from her right hand to her left , lifted her right hand and , frowning P299ferociously at Lieutenant Lippa , tapped a finger across her lips . Without looking up , intent on cutting her ham , Captain Burton said : " I know neither of you will misunderstand me if I say I hope you 'll both be particularly careful about that  --  possible misinterpretation . You 're in town , down at the Oleander Towers , most weekends . It 's quite natural for you to entertain male friends , offer them a drink , when you have a sitting room you can invite them up to . Nobody but a very narrow-minded kill-joy could see any harm in it . I certainly do n't . But I do hope you 'll be careful  --  I mean about having them up there too late ; or letting them drink too much  --  you know ; a party that attracts attention , that people hear down the hall . " Lieutenant Lippa said to Lieutenant Turck , " Do they hear us down the hall ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The time that Britisher , the Squadron Leader , was doing the singing . We never asked him up . I do n't know where he came from . He was wandering around , and the door was open , so he came in . " " Well , I do hope you 'll be careful  --  " Firmly interrupting her , Lieutenant Turck said : " Captain Burton , this is Lieutenant Edsell , of Special Projects . " He had walked up , balancing his tray , and stood with a confident familiarity that Lieutenant Turck did not much like behind the chair next to Lieutenant Lippa . " Greetings , " he said . He acknowledged his introduction to Captain Burton by bowing negligently . " Good morning , ma'am . Mind if I sit down ? " Captain Burton said in confusion : " No . Not at all  --  " From the confusion it was clear to Lieutenant Turck that Captain Burton had been hearing the rumors . In one connection or another , little tattletales , often well-meaning , would have apprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of a certain officer . Since Mary was not any too discreet about it , they might feel they had good grounds to hint further that Mary 's virtue had been surrendered to him . Captain Burton , trying for weeks not to understand hints , determined never to believe any such thing about the girl well known to be her favorite subordinate and freely admitted P300to be , her best company officer , now showed distress . Her flabbergasted look at Lieutenant Edsell proved that her real meaning a moment ago was just what Lieutenant Turck thought it might be . The hope reiterated was her fervent pathetic plea to Mary to make it not true . Lieutenant Lippa , casually pushing out the chair for him , said : " Hello , Jim . " That was all Mary had to do . She made the non-committal words into a dead giveaway . Her clear-eyed , pleasant , pugnosedlittle face suffused suddenly and strongly with an eloquent , distinctive shyness , delicate and high-strung . She was transfigured . Any woman , even Burton intent on blinding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light tremble of the heart , the low quiver of the womb were too intelligible . It would be hard to misunderstand the lover 's query that now posed her , and by its desperate importance , now reduced and humbled her . Afraid to allow herself to look directly , she waited with averted eyes , stretching her nerves to feel the answer in the ringing air . Since this trembling and quivering , this supine reduction , very well illustrated an indignity that life tried to put on all women , Lieutenant Turck felt , besides concern about what Captain Burton might be seeing , indignation on her own part . She said in a consciously crisp voice : " I thought you were to be in the guard house today , Lieutenant . " She gazed at his face , of which the features were not bad ; but she could count on its habitual expression to irritate her and fill her with distaste . There was a rude , overweening gleam of the eyes , and a cocky , loutish outthrust of the jaw that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had just scored off someone and was now pushing exultantly for a chance to do it again . " Huh ! " Lieutenant Edsell said . He stared at her cordially , for any remark that could be considered hostile , critical , or sarcastic , he probably took as a favor to him . The rough and tumble could begin without delay . He could run atilt immediately and start exchanging hits . " Where did you hear that ? " he asked brusquely . " Nat Hicks ? "   This hit was a good one ; and it would be too much to hope that it was just lucky , that he did n't know it was good , or had n't planned it that way . Practice in giving and taking injuries and insults had plainly taught Lieutenant Edsell to study anyone with whom he found himself often in altercation ; and the insighthe then demonstrated was disconcerting . He knew where to aim ; and the same practice taught him the rapid expert jab that pinked you right there through any offered opening . His hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be very malevolent about it , savored your reaction . Whether you howled , or whether you ludicrously pretended that he never touched you , it was all one to him  --  equally satisfactory . Lieutenant Turck , with her own imprudence to thank where else would she have heard it ?  --  supported as well as she could the uncomfortable notion that rumor now had her " seeing a lot " of Captain Hicks ; and that everyone in Special Projects leered and coupled their names . She said coolly : " Oh , word gets around . " Lieutenant Edsell said : " Does n't it , though ! Well , do n't give up hope . I may land there , yet . The day is young and the trouble is plenty . The Brass bit a lot of it off yesterday , and I want to see them chew it . " " Oh , dear , " Lieutenant Lippa said . " What have you been doing now ? " Lieutenant Turck could have slapped Mary gladly for the tender assentative tone and the silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , so she said only : " He has been making trouble for poor old Colonel Mowbray ; and now Colonel Mowbray wants to make trouble for him ; but that would n't be fair , would it ? " Lieutenant Edsell said : " That old dodo ! I hope to see him try ! Not that I think he means much harm . He 's just so goddamnstupid . " Lieutenant Turck could observe that Captain Burton , distress piling on distress , liked neither the profanity nor the contemptuousreference to a full colonel , General Beal 's Executive Officer . Heedless , Lieutenant Edsell said bluffly : " I do n't know how much you know about what happened yesterday ; but I think we P302have them on the run . You may have heard that a special group of colored officers was brought in this week on a new project . The unreconstructed Confederates and other poor white trash , some of it from West Point , got all hot and bothered . Next thing , people might start treating a Negro like a human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of them decided to strike a blow for White Supremacy . I suppose they got liquored up , they usually do . The night before last , they gathered in suitable force  --  about twenty or thirty to one makes them feel fairly safe ; and when a colored medium bomber crew came in and landed , they jumped them , over by Base Operations . It got hushed up , of course ; but I guess the Confederates had n't had such fun since they nailed the cat to the kitchen floor . I happen to know that at least one of the Negroes is still in the Base Hospital . That was the beginning of the trouble . " " I do n't believe that ever happened , " Lieutenant Turck said flatly . " I  --  " " No , you do n't . That 's right , " Lieutenant Edsell said . " That 's the reason a lot of sadistic sub-morons down in dear old Dixie can do whatever they want to any Negro , any time . When you 're told about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ romantic Southern boys could n't be that unkind , could they , sugar ? Well , just take my word for this . It did happen . A lot of things you do n't know about happen every day in the South . And a lot of things you do n't know about happen every day in the Army . But never worry your pretty heads ! Just keep not-knowing about them , and you 'll be fine . Now , I 'll tell you what happenedyesterday , which , of course , you want to be careful not to believe . " Lieutenant Edsell had forgotten his breakfast after he had taken it off the tray and arranged it in front of him . Leaning across it , he said : " What really started the trouble yesterday was that Prescott Phillips , one of the Assistant PRO 's , had the guts to try and get a square deal for a colored newspaper man ; to get him the treatment any white newspaper man would damn well get . This man was accredited in Washington and sent all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bomb group project . Understand that . There was no question about his P303right to do the story . General Beal had orders to let him do it . Furthermore , I happen to be able to say that the man sent was topnotch . Of course , because he has a black skin , the reactionarypress , the big papers , ca n't employ him , wo n't give him space ; but he has about three times the intelligence and ability of the average nationally syndicated lug . I 'm not guessing about this . I know him personally . I was at college with him . He worked his way through waiting on tables ; and that 's what I did , too , if you want to know . " He looked past Lieutenant Turck and gave Captain Burton a hard , disdainful smile . Lieutenant Turck could see Lieutenant Lippa listening with a doting absorption that must be second only to Desdemona 's while hearing Othello tell what a remarkable man he was . Lieutenant Lippa goggled , finding all this passing strange , wondrous pitiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air a short cut with the edge of his hand , " our local authorites took it on them to decide he could n't do what Washington said he could do . They certainly did n't want that . Not after what they let happenthe night before . And considering the fact that they secretlyset up a lot of Jim Crow regulations to segregate the project personnel and were trying to keep it quiet . Of course , we did n't , then , know their reasons for being in such a panic . I saw right away that something smelled ; but I did n't know what . Pres is a little naive , in some ways . One thing : he 's always had a lot of money . His old man is richer than hell  --  you know : Phillips . Though he 's certainly been in the Army long enough to understand that when you see somebody getting a raw deal , you look the other way , but quick , the poor damn fool thought that if he brought it to Mowbray , Mowbray would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , for these special reasons , scared to death , that was a laugh ! Pres seriously thought a man , an old Trade School man from way back , who 'd spent his whole life in the Army  --  I guess he would have starved to death anywhere else  --  gave a hoot about justice , for God 's sake ! What is that ? " Lieutenant Edsell noticed his coffee and took a gulp of it . Captain Burton arose . Her face was set and red . She said : " I 've  |p304got  to get over to the office . " Her lips trembled ; but she either could think of no more to say , or could not trust herself to say it . Bumping a chair indignantly , she marched to the center aisle and down toward the door . " She get her ear burned ? " Lieutenant Edsell said . " She wo n't beat on you , will she ? " With a hoyden air disagreeable to Lieutenant Turck , LieutenantLippa said : " The heck with her . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's a type I 'm really awfully fond of . " " Rest easy ! " Lieutenant Turck said . " You 're a type she does n't like at all . I have an office of my own I 've got to go to , but I do n't want to miss any of this . Could you hurry it up some ? " " Yes , I could , sourpuss , " Lieutenant Edsell said . " But why should I ? I 'm really talking to Mary . You just happen to be here . " " I know all that , " Lieutenant Turck said . " I 'm only waiting for how you told Colonel Mowbray , the old Trade School man , where to get off . Does it come soon ? " " It comes this morning , maybe , " Lieutenant Edsell said . " If he wants to go on with the party , that is . He may get a little surprise before noon : and I think he may be a good way up the creek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to arrest quite a number of colored officers last night . They were all told that the Officers Club here was for whites only  --  part of this secret segregation scheme . And I 'm very glad to say that some of them decided not to take it lying down and went there anyway . So , of course , they had to rush in the MP 's . " " Tell me , " said Lieutenant Turck , " just why are you very glad to say that ? I can see you are ; but tell me what there is about it to make you feel good . " " I do n't like to see people walked on , " Lieutenant Edsell said . " Four freedoms , you know . What we 're fighting for . " " What who 's what ? " Lieutenant Turck said . " Ah ! " Lieutenant Edsell said , laughing delightedly . " Do n't go losing your temper , Amanda . What did you really mean by that crack ? That I just talk , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am . I would n't like getting killed any better than the people getting killed every day like it ; but I do n't think I 'd run away . I ca n't help it if they put me here instead of there . " He looked at her admiringly . " You know , something might be made out of you . You have a nasty disposition , which is the first thing you need if you 're going to stand up to these sons of bitches . Now , I do n't think you 'd get so sore at what I say if you did n't pretty well know at heart that that 's what they are , and that you ought to be doing something about it . You should have seen that roomful of smug bastards yesterday ! They nearly died when Pres Phillips told them straight out what they were trying to do  --  old Mowbray chattering like a monkey ; old Ross , the General 's Air Inspector , pretending he was the impartial judge , boom , boom ! A foul little squirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it made what happened to a nigger . ' Our dimwit of a Colonel Coulthard hanging his big mouth open  --  ah ! Do n't tell me you like swallowing their crap ! I do n't think you want to see people walked on , either ! " " Oh , no ! " Lieutenant Turck said . " No , you do n't ! I do n't have to join up with you  --  or else ! This is a free country , my fine big-hearted liberal friend ! " GENTLY PUSHED , the door of the Public Relations Office swung wide open . Miss Crittenden , a thin , dark-haired girl in a bright red dress , nipped the tip of her tongue intently between her teeth and advanced with a cardboard box cover which served her for a tray . On the tray were several paper cups of steamingcoffee and several sanitary glassine envelopes containing doughnuts . She made her gingerly way through the outer office , which was deserted , and into the small room behind where Captain Collins had his desk . On the desk Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far back as his chair would go . This put his wellfeatured , somewhat full face almost on a level with his feet . P306Above his face , where he could stare disgustedly up at it through his heavy-rimmed glasses , he held a mimeographed releaseof several pages . He was reading rapidly , raising his other hand as he finished a page to throw it over . " Them Pentagon jerks ! " he suddenly said . He fired the sheets at the tray marked File on his desk , missing it . Then he took his feet down and said : " Thanks , Caroline . " He removed his glasses . Lifting a finger , he poised it . When she had set down the coffee and a doughnut , he shot the finger suddenly toward the chair by the window . " Leave those other coffees lay , honey child , " he said . " Sit yourself down a minute , first closing the door about two thirds or three quarters , but not so much you ca n't see if anyone comes in out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You want me to get my book , Captain Collins ? " " I do not ! I just want your counsel and advice while 1 belly-up to this here piping hot Java . " He pried the cardboard lid off the container , opened the doughnut package , bit a doughnut in half , and dipped it in the coffee . " You , too , " he said . " You ca n't counsel on an empty stomach , can you ? Now , here 's the business . " He stopped and chewed the moistened doughnut thoughtfully . When his mouth was empty , he said : " Mr. Bullen , our pal Al , rings up here at eight o'clock sharp . He is not home in bed . He is down at the gate . He craves in . He has to see me right away . Why eight o'clock ? Why me ? Very unexpected and delicate subject . To wit : uh , now , racial relationships . Say no more on telephone . " Captain Collins drank some coffee . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little on his blotter . " Watch it ! Well , no more on telephone ' is plenty for us **27;3479;TOOLONG . I sent Pres Phillips , who for some reason was here on time , down to the gate right away . I had to . I was advised to stick to the phone , in case Colonel Mowbray felt ants in his pants early . So , now where are we ? What is your impression of the character and temperament of Mr. A. Bullen , Ocanara Morning Sun , under stress ? Will he , on sight , drag out his shooting iron and blow down Lieutenant Phillips , after what he wrote yesterday about what he thought of Lieutenant Phillips ? Would 1 haveP307been wise to give Mr. B. a different escort from there to here ? " Miss Crittenden looked at him with perplexity . She said : " Oh , I ca n't tell when you 're kidding , Captain Collins ! Why , Mr. Bullen would never do any such thing ! He 's the gentlest , kindest man . Why , I used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back before the war . I do n't know what Lieutenant Phillips could have done to make Mr. Bullen take offense that way . It must have been just a misunderstanding , is all . " " Good ! " Captain Collins said . " I thought you 'd know . Now , honey child , rack your brains . Any time yesterday , did you say anything to anyone outside this office touching on uh , now , racial relationships ? You know ; about our little unpleasantnessyesterday ? Honor bright , Caroline . " " Why , Captain Collins ! " she said . She set the paper coffee cup agitatedly on the window sill . She turned almost as scarlet as her dress . " I 'm sure I do n't know  --  why , I would n't breathe anything that violates security ! I declare ; I do n't know just what to say  --  " " Well , if you can , please do think of something , honey child . You did maybe mention it ? " The color began to leave Miss Crittenden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rouge applied all over her cheeks in Southern small-town style . She said : " Captain Collins , I never , never breathed one word that violates any security . I never , never ! Sometimes I might tell Daddy at supper little things that might have happened , that did n't have anything to do with classified material , anything like that . I might have just said we had some trouble about this colored man . I never thought that could matter  --  " " What does Daddy do for Mr. Bullen ? Something , does n't he ? " " Why , he 's chief press man on the paper , " she said faintly . " Oh , Captain Collins , that 's downright absurd ! Why , he would n't think of telling silly little things  --  " " Caroline ; you ever mention to him this birthday shindig for the general ? Back a few days ? " " I do n't know , Captain Collins . I just do n't know . I guess I could have , maybe  --  "   " Caroline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces of poop , for reasons unknown , were stamped real pretty , top and bottom : Confidential . As a result , one Lieutenant Colonel Luke Howden , Counter-Intelligence , is steamed up over who poured the whisky in the well . We could be in a jam , you and me . " Miss Crittenden began to whimper . " Oh , Captain Collins ! I never , never  --  " Captain Collins looked at her compassionately . He drew a breath and let it hiss out between his teeth . " I do n't think you did , either , " he said . " Lordy , Lordy ! Quick , " he said . " Out of here , and go wash your face ! They 'll be along in a minute . I 'll have to see what I can do . I 'll see if I can fix it . Do n't say anything to anyone . " " Captain Collins , I 'd just lie down and die if  --  " Arising , he went and took her arm , drew her to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Beat it to the ladies ' room , " he said . " Leave it to me . " He closed the door after her and took the telephone from his desk . The answering voice said : " Air Inspector 's Office . Sergeant Brooks . " " Captain Collins , PRO . Colonel Ross there ? " " No , sir . " " Do me a great favor . When he shows , ask him if he will see me for five minutes . I have some important information bearing on an investigation I believe he ordered . I will have to give it to him verbally , and in his office . See if you can get me in before he leaves or somebody ties him up , will you ? " " I will tell him , Captain . " Captain Collins put the telephone down . As he expected , a knock came almost at once on the door to the hall . He opened it and confronted Lieutenant Phillips and Mr. Bullen . " Very kind of you to come out , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Would you care for some coffee ? That was brought about five minutes ago . I think it 's still hot . " Mr. Bullen inclined his head courteously . " No , thank you , " he said . " I had myself some breakfast . " He half turned and took hold of Lieutenant Phillips 's arm . He said gravely : " That little misunderstanding between the lieutenant and me , I 'm P309glad to say we got A eared up . Hasty words on both sides ; and more of them on mine than his , I must admit . I think he knows I understand he was doing his duty ; and he tells me he believes I had n't any intention of disseminating anything that could hurt or embarrass in any way the war effort . Thank you very much for your trouble in fetching me here , Lieutenant . " Captain Collins said : " Well , Mr. Bullen , they make us lay down some laws , sometimes , that , personally , I do n't think are necessary , at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy . We 'll surely do our best to go along with you , just as far as they 'll let us . Have a chair , sir . Pres , stick around out there , will you ? We may have something . Bob Breck is n't in yet ; but when he comes , tell him to stick around , too . " He closed the hall door . He said to Mr. Bullen , who stood politely near the chair by the window until Captain Collins had reached his own chair behind tfie desk , " The War DepartmentBureau of Public Relations is improving its policy line , Mr. Bullen . They do things better than when I first came in . I do n't have to tell you I 'm no soldier . I was in the ROTC at college , a good many years ago ; and so I was suddenly jerked off the City Desk and put in khaki pants and told to buy myself an Officer 's Guide . Here I am . " Mr. Bullen said : " I was well aware that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really why I thought I 'd take the liberty of coming out here this morning . I say that , because you might be surprised some at my coming to you about this matter . " He lifted his spare , dry , tanned face and gazed earnestly at Captain Collins . " I have a number of reasons for it . I do n't care to approach the Executive Officer , Colonel Mowbray , for any cause whatsoever . Though I had the pleasure of seeing General Beal personally yesterday evening , Mrs. Beal was present , and the general had guests , and asking him for a few minutes private conversation would not have been opportune . I thought of you , because I knew you were a newspaper man . I hoped I could talk frankly to you . I presumed it would be part of your duties to advise the general on any matters pertaining to public relations . " " That 's what 's in the book , Mr. Buller , " Captain Collins  | said . " But I ought to tell you that the general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to , first . He never has asked me yet . " " Yes , " Mr. Bullen said . " I quite understand that . My thought , Captain Collins , was that I would give you , if I may , certain information that has come into my hands , so that someoneon the general 's staff here would know about it . Now , in one sense , this matter , at the present stage , is none of my business , none at all  --  a category of things I do n't greatly enjoy mixing into . But it could get to be everyone 's business in Ocanara . First of all , Captain , information has come to me about some quite serious trouble involving relations between blacks and whites out here . Would you feel able to tell me whether that is the case ? " " Not unless it 's off the record , " Captain Collins said . " You have my word of honor , Captain Collins , that I will make no use whatsoever of your answer , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , or at any future time . I ask only for my own information , and I feel I can say my motives in so asking are not idle and impertinent ones . " " I 'm sure of that , " Captain Collins said . " I will tell you , then ; yes . There has been trouble . I think quite serious ' is an exaggeration ; but I 'm not free to tell you what happened . I completely accept your assurance that what I say will go no further than you ; but , Mr. Bullen , that would n't change the fact that they told me what little I know with the tacit understanding that it would go no further than me . " " Of course ! " Mr. Bullen said . " I ask nothing more . I asked what I did ask only because the information I have might be meaningless , a waste of your time , if there was , in fact , no trouble at all . You will understand , Captain , that any disturbanceof relationships between whites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the gravest concern . I feel that concern deeply ; and I am sure everyone in Ocanara , black and white , feels it . " Captain Collins said : " Well , Mr. Bullen , I think we all understand that . There just does n't seem to be any final answer . It 's certainly a tough problem . " P311Mr . Bullen said quietly : " Like you , Captain , I came from the North . 1 was not born here ; but I have lived here the best part of twenty-five years . 1 have formed certain conclusions in that time ; but I wo n't trouble you with my conclusions . If there are differences of opinion , I think most of them are differences that always arise between those who have to deal with facts , and those who are free to deal with theories . In that encounter there is a good deal of heat and never very much light ; but I believe reasonable men , whatever their opinion , can meet on one point . Violence and disturbance will not help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbance are certainly not the interests of those , black or white , who must live together , and who want to live together amicably . " He put his hand inside the breast of his loose coat of faded wash material and brought out several folded papers . " What I have here , " he said , " are copies of some telegrams dispatched from Ocanara yesterday . The first , you will see , is to the War Department , signed James . ' One of the others is to a wellknownNegro organization . Also signed James . ' The third of this group is to an individual in Washington , from James , too . To this same individual , there is a telegraphed money order , the record of which shows that it was paid for by a Lieutenant J. A. Edsell , though the accompanying telegram is , again , signed James , ' I assume this lieutenant sent it , because his name is noted as a return address on the original . Put together , I think we get this . In connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two , somebody named Stanley was injured and put in the hospital . This Willis , in Washington , to whom the third telegram went , is ostensibly a relative of Stanley 's . He is urged to come at once . We have n't got his answer ; but probably he did n't have the money . The money was then sent him by this officer , Edsell . In view of the sending times , Willis could be on the train due here at ten o'clock . " Captain Collins took the papers and spread them out on his desk . He put his glasses on . After a moment , he said : " I see . This telegram to the War Department , I think Headquarters here knows about . As far as I know , this Stanley , whoever he   is , is not connected with the other . Nobody was injured then . I know that . " He paused and looked at Mr. Bullen . " I must ask you a question , if I may , Mr. Bullen . To use this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to you . " Mr. Bullen said thoughtfully , " Yes . I think you are right to want to know that ; but if it means that you would be obliged to make a statement about it , I do n't want to tell you . Let me make myself clear . I have no objection to your saying that I showed you the copies . In fact , I will leave them here with you ; and if an inquiry is made , it can be referred to me . " " That is satisfactory , " Captain Collins said . " I wo n't ask you , then . " " I would prefer to tell you , for your own information . I think you have a right to know , " Mr. Bullen said mildly . " Police Chief Lovewell , in an official capacity , asked to inspect the files . He thought it proper to do this on information which reached him through an ordinary police channel on the contents of telegrams one and two . " " I see , " Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You say you think Willis may be here on the ten o'clock train . Is the Chief of Police interested in that ? " " He will be at the station himself . Mr. Lovewell would want to know who meets Willis , and where he goes . If Willis is really down here to see a relative , who is in the hospital at the Base , that 's all there is to that . I suppose the military authorities will decide whether he can see him or not . You tell me you do n't know of anyone 's being injured ; so that may increase a possibility , that Mr. Lovewell would n't overlook , that it is a blind . This man Willis might represent the Negro organization to which the second telegram went . Or some other . If he is in Ocanara with the idea of arousing any kind of disturbance , Mr. Lovewell would not want to be taken by surprise. 1 thought it possible that someone out here might want to check on the man in the hospital and look up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a colored officer . Well , Captain , I thank you very much for your time and patience . That 's the sum of the thing . " Mr. Bullen arose and took his hat .   " Thank you very much , Mr. Bullen , " Captain Collins said . " I 'll make some inquiries . In fact , I can call right now and find out if there is anyone named Stanley at the Base Hospital , if you like . " " I would be very glad to give Mr. Lovewell that information , " Mr. Bullen said . Captain Collins took up the telephone . "  --  yes , Stanley , " he said . " No , I do n't know his first name , or his rank . He may be an officer , he may be an enlisted man , he could be a civilian . You have n't ? O.K. , thanks . " He looked at Mr. Bullen . " Could he be in a hospital downtown ? No  --  it says Base Hospital . That 's that , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night , I suppose . Maybe I 'd better check that . " Mr. Bullen said , " I 'm afraid , Captain , you 'll find Mr. Lovewell'sidea was right . It fits together . Thank you again for your trouble . " " I 'll make some inquiries , " Captain Collins repeated . " I do n't quite know  --  well , we 'll see . Just a moment , sir , and I 'll have Lieutenant Breck go with you . " He opened the door to the outer office and said : " Bob , will you take the car and drive Mr. Bullen downtown ? " When they were gone , Captain Collins called out : " Pres , can you come here ? " With Lieutenant Phillips in the office and the door closed , he said : " Hear anything from Mowbray 's office ? " Lieutenant Phillips shrugged . " Not yet , " he said . " Well , we 'll keep our fingers crossed . I 've got to see ColonelRoss , if I can , about something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's cooking . " Lieutenant Phillips picked up the metal model of a P-47 which Captain Collins used for a paper weight and looked at it . " Frankly , Dick , " he said , " I do n't give a damn . Though I 'm sorry you got dragged into it . " " I 'm sorry , too , " Captain Collins said . " And I am in it ; so will you not give your damn in as inconspicuous a way as possible ? I do n't blame you , Pres ; but for God 's sake try not P314to stir it up . Incidentally , have you any idea what your friend Edsell is doing , or thinks he 's doing ? " " Yes , I know . But I do n't think I 'll tell you . It would n't do any good . It might just involve you some more . " " Even so , " Captain Collins said . " If you know , would you just as soon tell me who in hell this man in Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I might as well tell you the Ocanara police think he 's some kind of professional agitator . Now , what is Edsell ; nuts ? " Lieutenant Phillips laughed . " That 's a good one , " he said . " These bastards certainly shake in their big shoes ! I guess the wicked are still fleeing when no man pursueth . The man Edsell sent the money to , and if you want to know , I put up half of it , is a waiter in a Washington restaurant . His son was one of the colored officers sent in on this project . The other night I understand he tried to use the can in the Operations building  --  he 'd just flown in  --  and some white officers took him out and beat him up so badly they had to take him to the Base Hospital . I suppose Mowbray wanted to hush it up , and they were hushing it up . James heard about it from some of the project personnel yesterday morning before they ran him off . He told Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father down here , even if he was just a colored waiter , Mowbray would have to let him see his son , and would have to explain what happened , and take some action against the people that beat him up . I go right along with that , Dick . " He put down the P-47 model . Captain Collins said , " If that 's true , I go along with it , too . I 'd better call the general 's office  --  no , wait ; first  --  the boy who was hurt was named Willis too , then ?  --  " He rocked back with the telephone . " Outside , " he said . " I want the Ocanara Morning Sun , Mr. Bullen 's office  --  yes . Captain Collins , Area Public Relations Office . Will you see Mr. Bullen hears , as soon as he comes in , that a  --  please write it down  --  Stanley Willis was injured , was sent to the Base Hospital . This bears out certain messages he knows about . This is Captain Collins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to check it . " He put the telephone back .   " Going to call the general ? " Lieutenant Phillips said . " Well , hold on , " Captain Collins said . " First I 'd better get my facts straight . And I think I 'd better check with ColonelRoss . He must know something about it . I 'll try him again . " " You wo n't get anywhere that way , " Lieutenant Phillips said . " He is n't going to buck the system . What 's in it for him ? " Profoundly disturbed , Colonel Ross could see  --  or , better , feel ; for there was nothing arresting or notable to see  --  that some grave change had taken place in General Beal . Something had gone out of him ; some distinguishing inner mettle , a sustained tension of nerves , a spirit wound up to act ; something so much a part of Bus that it was hardly noticeable , taken for granted . Its characteristic look was always on Bus 's face , immediatelybeneath surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anger . Its characteristic sound was in his voice , whatever his mood of the moment , whatever he was saying . A series of random pictures passed in Colonel Ross 's mind : Bus turning his tense face sharply , the assured snap of the brown eyes , the lips parting with decision . Casual fragments of speech , firm through all the various tones of the occasion , came to him : "  --  I do n't like rubbing it into Woody , throwing my weight around with him  --  hell ! You hungry ?  --  " "  --  Oh , Judge , that boy 's a honey ! You can believe  --  " "  --  I just do n't feel like sitting here ; so I told Danny  --  " "  - -  do n't you blow your top , too , Judge . Everybody else  --  " Colonel Ross did not know if others at the breakfast table saw it ; but he saw it . In the morning shadows Bus was calm to the point of indifference . At the head of the table , his back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriate enough expression of mute reserve , but also with small signs of a profounddetachment , to Lieutenant Colonel Howden 's not too well organized remarks on the importance , when a first sign of disaffection appeared , of getting to the bottom of it , nipping it in the bud . P316Colonel Ross now thought it significant that Howden , like Major Tietam , the Judge Advocate , had been asked to come into the dining room and bring his business . What they said would necessarily be heard , too , by General Nichols and GeneralBaxter . Bus might feel that Nichols and Baxter knew plenty anyway ; they might as well hear more . That was reasonable ; but it became easy , once his apprehension about Bus had formed , for Colonel Ross to read into it a sullen passivity . Bus resigned here and now his right and his responsibility ( nothing could separate them ) to handle this himself ; make his decisions ; give his orders  --  in short , run the show , command the situation . Colonel Ross asked himself whether General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . General Nichols 's face was composed , serious but easy , and nothing could be learned from it . General Nichols was beautifully shaved and beautifully dressed  --  no doubt , because he had official parts to play today as the Chief of Air Staff 's proxy . He wore a so-called battlejacket , the first that Colonel Ross had ever seen made of light material , a fine thin tan gabardine . Under the Command Pilot 's wings , General Nichols had four rows of ribbons . Colonel Ross observed that the collection was unusual . It included none of the combat theater throwaways of this war  --  the Silver Star , the Distinguished Flying Cross , the Air- Medal . Since he could hardly have come back without them , this would indicate that no combat command had yet been given General Nichols . The ribbons he did have  --  the Distinguished Service Cross , the DistinguishedService Medal , the Legion of Merit  --  might explain that . The first two probably dated from before the war , when medals were hard to come by . The Legion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they would show that he failed to get a combat command not because somebody thought he did n't rate it , but because somebody could n't do without him yet at Headquarters . General Nichols was a bombardment man , Colonel Ross knew . It was safe to bet that there would be something good for him when the apocalypse of the Twenty-nines was opened to Japan . Except for the theater ribbons , showing that General Nichols P317had been allowed least to visit overseas , Colonel Ross could identify none of the others he wore . Then they must be foreign ; and that , too , was significant . They were probably picked up in the course of service as an Air Attache at several capitals between the wars . Since governments to which he was accreditedgave him medals , he pleased them . Since he could not have so many unless the War Department found him useful , his work had pleased all his superiors . It took a man of parts to play at once the charming guest and the industrious spy . Lieutenant Colonel Howden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name . Howden said : " I ca n't quite go along with Judge Ross 's opinion , sir  --  " he looked apologeticallyat Colonel Ross and then back to the general . " I feel it does point definitely to disaffected individuals . The nature of the thing  --  being the Japanese propaganda line  --  makes it grave . In my opinion . I do n't mean I think there 's any actual plot  --  yet . Writing things up on the walls that way is a kind of sounding-out  --  to get to know who else feels the same . You have to watch it . You may remember all that OHIO ' stuff back in ' 4z . " Colonel Ross stirred and said : " How many of them did go over the hill in October ? " " Not too many , " Lieutenant Colonel Howden said . " Becausewe paid attention . We were ready to act . I was at Chanute then , and I know what the problem was , judge . " " The judge could be right , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to let off steam . If somebody is going to duck out , or do something treasonable , does he go advertisingit ? I do n't know ; but I do n't think they write it up in latrines . " General Nichols said gravely : " The last thing I saw written up in a latrine was : Kindly do not throw cigarettes in the urinals as they are hard to smoke when wet . ' What do you suppose that meant ? " General Baxter laughed ; and so , as though against his will , did General Beal . Colonel Ross , involuntarily , taken by surprise , joined them ; but not against his will ; for this coarse conceit unreasonably relieved him , restored the practical sense P318of proportion which he had been losing in his alarm about Bus and Bus 's state of mind . Lieutenant Colonel Howden smiled in a worried acquiescent way , not willing to give up his point , but not insensible to the privilege of being in attendance while generals familiarly joked . Major Tietam 's round , solemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smirk . And another thing , Colonel Ross thought , anxious to hold his recovered balance : it ought not to be forgotten , while they beat their brains over this teapot tempest in a Zone of Interior installation , while the Charge Sheets that Major Tietam had passed to him  --  incidentally , why , when it was sure they would have to be handled a lot , did they print WDAGO Form No. 115 on such poor paper ?  --  lay there specifying under Article of War Sixty-four the offense of six men in their willful disobedienceof the Assistant Provost Marshal 's order not to enter the Area Officers Club ; now , at this very moment , if the weather had been at all possible , Eighth Air Force bombers were turning , a certain number of them damaged with engines out and dead and wounded on board , to try to make their English bases . Perhaps also at this very moment ( though for them it was still yesterday ) Fifth Air Force fighters were dropping belly tanks as the Zeros came climbing at them over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What about it , Judge ? " General Nichols looked at him , too. , General Nichols 's civil interest probably included a wish to satisfy himself about this elderly colonel 's ( no Military Academy ring ; no wings ; he would have noticed ) part in the administration of the Operations and Requirements Analysis Division . Colonel Ross said : " I think you sized it up , General . I think Luke put Counter-Intelligence 's angle on it very well . I think he could keep his eye on that . But in this particular case I would certainly go along with you in feeling we do n't have to act on it now . It 's relevant . It might come to be important ; but for the present it tells us only what we know alreadyP319some of the project personnel are in a resentful mood . Let 's deal with that first . " General Baxter said : " Bus , if I could put in my two cents ' worth , I 'd say that was just exactly right . The feeling in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop facts in doubt or dispute . If that is n't necessary , the investigation is n't necessary . If it is n't necessary , it is undesirable ; and I do n't mean just because it makes work for our Special Investigations Division ! It wastes everyone 's time , and often it aggravates the trouble . In this case , if these colored boys have got it into their heads that they 're being persecuted and badly used  --  " " Is that what they say ? " General Beal took up the sheaf of TWX messages next to his empty coffee cup . Leafing them over , he pulled one out and extended it to General Nichols . " Read that , " he said . " Now , who gave that out ? It 's not true . There was no riot here . Why does a press association pick up a thing like that without bothering to find out whether it 's true or not ? Why do the Air Forces Group people in Public Relations fire that upstairs when they do n't know whether it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed disturbance , the general spoke withoutanger or even emphasis , as though the question were real , not rhetorical ; and the answer must be something beyond him , something he would n't even try to figure out . General Nichols gave the lines of typed tape a comprehensive glance . " Well , " he said , " they were probably told to send up anything their Press Section found that mentioned Ocanara . About the newspapers ; that 's always interested me . Most of the things you read in a newspaper you naturally do n't know anything about , except what they tell you . Did you ever happen to read a newspaper account of something you did know something about ? It 's always more or less wrong , usually more . I 'm told it 's because most stories are rewritten when they get to the office by somebody else , not the man who covered the story . They have to make them fit between the advertising . I do n't think it 's done on purpose . I do n't think they 'd mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do about it . " " I 'm not going to try to do anything about it , " General Beal said . " All I say is , if it happened , I do n't know about it . P320So I ca n't give them any report on it . I suppose I 'd better tell them the business last night before the newspapers do . 1 do n't know what they want . I do n't even know whether they think I have some plan to persecute Negroes , or whatever 011ie said . Is it all right for me to court-martial these people ? Did they tell you ? " General Nichols said : " As far as I understood the telephone conversation , they told you , Bus . I certainly did n't hear anything to make me think they were n't leaving you free to do whatever you needed to do to maintain discipline . " General Beal said : " Even if I get in the papers ? We have a leak here to the papers . The Judge can tell you about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not going to act in this without an Air Staff directive . Can you give me one ? " General Nichols shook his head . " Not me , " he said . " I do n't have any with me . I do n't think you need a further directive , Bus . Some men willfully disobeyed an order and aggravated it by assaulting a provost marshal . What 's the normal procedure ? Is it to ask Washington for a directive ? " General Beal said : " Damned if I know , nowadays . This is their party , not mine . I 've thought about it ; and there are things they ca n't do to me , Jo-Jo . They ca n't give me the responsibility and keep the authority ; and if I have to turn my suit in and join the Marines , I 'll do that . I hear it 's good . I hear they gave anyone with a military pilot rating a second lieutenant 's commission right away . " Colonel Ross said : " Before you do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more chance . Why do n't we work out a course of action right now . Call Washington then , if you like , and tell them what it is , and if they do n't like it , why they can suggest something else . " He glanced at General Nichols who was lighting a cigarette . " Why let them suppose we have n't any plan ? " " Well , have we ? " said General Beal . " Have you ? " " I think we can offer some suggestions , " Colonel Ross said . " You have three members of your staff here , and this is a matter that comes more or less in their fields . If they ca n't offer you practicable suggestions , you 'd better get a new staff . " He tookP321up the Charge Sheets . " We have six of these , " he said , " all the men involved . I 'd like to suggest , if court martial is indicated , that we narrow it to the two who assaulted the provost marshal , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at Major Tietam who said , " I quite agree , Colonel . This was simply tentative  --  in case , for some reason of policy I might not know about , the general might desire to prefer the charges separately and hold separate trials  --  there are different specifications , you see . " Colonel Ross turned the sheets over . " Yes , " he said . He turned them back to look at the witnesses . " Who is this Captain Eugene P. Wiley , AFSAT , Orlando ? How does he happen to be here ? " " I do n't know , Colonel . I believe he was in the Club as the guest of the Captain Hicks , there . I do n't know who Hicks is , either . " " I do , " Colonel Ross said . " Hicks ? " General Beal said . " That Hal 's fellow , yesterday ? I thought I sent him to Boca Negra . Well , anyway , that 's one project we 'd better stop . I guess we 're getting all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " There was no investigating officer appointed , sir , " Major Tietam said . " I based my summary on what Lieutenant Day , the Provost Marshal 's officer , said . " " We 'd better appoint one , " Colonel Ross said . " All right , " General Beal said . He yawned . " You 're it , Judge . Now , do what you want . " " What I want is a telephone , " Colonel Ross said . " I can start my people rounding up the witnesses . I think we could have a hearing by ten . Let me do that now . " " Do whatever you like , " General Beal said . " One thing ; I think we 'll cancel this show this afternoon . Jo-Jo 's seen a parade . He does n't need to see another . Have someone telephonePop and tell him it 's off . " " I do n't think you can do that , General , " Colonel Ross said . " It 's in the paper this morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at other installations , have been made . " P322General Nichols said mildly , " I like parades . When I fly all the way to Florida to see one , I want to see it . " " If you like them , you can have them , " General Beal said . Colonel Ross had started toward the door ; and , though he hesitated , he saw that he might as well go on . He went on quietly , opened the door ; and stepping through , bumped fairly into Mrs. Beal . Sal 's right hand was raised , the wrist pressed against her mouth . In her left hand , hanging at her side , she clenched absently , probably unaware of it , a folded newspaper , twisted and bent in her tight fingers . She dropped the wrist from her mouth , showing her lips puckered , as though in pain . For the dumbfounding instant , Colonel Ross wondered if , bumping into her , he had hurt her . Then , quickly , he drew the door closed behind him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What is it ? I want to know , Norm ! I have to know  --  " " Why , yes , " Colonel Ross said . The need to know must be an insupportable need , if it brought her to come close to the door , perhaps made her put her ear to it . He said , " Come along down here . I have to telephone . Let me telephone , Sal . I have to get word to my office about some things Bus wants done . You 'll let me do that , wo n't you ? " She said : " You wo n't tell me . " " I will tell you , " Colonel Ross said . He put out an arm and pressed it against her , making her move . " But you 'll let me telephone first , wo n't you ? " " No , " she said . " What are they doing to Bus ? You tell me now ! You know . You have to tell me . " She got her breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right in there . " Colonel Ross said : " What will they think if you do that , Sal ? What will Bus think ? I 'll tell you all there is . Bus has to decide what to do with some people who disobeyed orders . That 's all we were talking about . I am trying to help him get the matter cleared up . That 's why I came out to telephone . " " No , " she said . " That is n't all . I heard more than that . P313You 're not telling me . I told you you would n't ! " She stepped unsteadily sideways , as though to get by him ; and Colonel Ross moved heavily , blocking her . Blocked , she let the folded newspaper fall to the floor . She doubled both hands into fists , and , frenziedly , her face contorted in the shadows , she began to beat the fists against his big chest . Appalled , he said : " Sal , Sal ! " He managed clumsily to catch her thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this ! " he said . " You 've got to help Bus . You ca n't act this way  --  " The wrists relaxed in his hands and he let them go . The disheveled blonde hair was half over her face . It swung back listlessly as she turned away . She put a hand on the stair rail , and held it . Still holding it , sliding her palm along it , she began to climb . Without turning her head , she said woefully : " Go on and telephone , Norm . I 'm going upstairs . " Colonel Ross , still unnerved , noticed the newspaper on the floor where she had dropped it . The air of disorder it gave the hall troubled him . He went back , stooped , and picked it up . It was this morning 's Ocanara Sun , and on the rumpled front page was a large photograph showing General Beal sitting on the living room sofa , his expression stern but boyish . Mrs. Beal , in the elaborate white dress , sat beside him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who leaned with a petulantstare against her knee . Mrs. Beal was grinning engagingly at the camera . The caption said : Happy Birthday to You ! FROM BASE GATE NUMBER THREE , First Sergeant Charles Augustus Lindbergh Rogers was marching the three platoons of a Negro Engineer Corps company in column of fours across the level coarse grass and less-firm stretches of bare sandy soil of the air field toward the construction work on the extension of the long runway by Lake Lalage . Though the company had the informal bedraggled appearancethat went with field hats and herringbone twill work uniforms , the marching was good , the pace steady , the lines and P324files commendably true in spite of the often changing characterof the ground . Off to the column 's right , Sergeant Rogers , imposing in carriage and stature , his gleaming black face cocked up , boomed resonantly : " Hut  --  two  --  three  --  four ! Hut  --  twothree  --  four ! " He turned in his stride , prancing backward with a shortened step , so the first platoon passed him , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye , came abreast . " Count cadence three times ! " he sang out suddenly . " And make me hear you ! " " Count cadence three times , " chorused the Platoon Sergeants . " Now , count ! " An exuberant hundredfold bellow broke from the column , shaking the bright morning air , certainly audible a mile away : " Hut  --  two  --  three  --  " Spinning on his heel , Sergeant Rogers faced front again , surveying the runway ahead , now near at hand . " Column half right , " he shouted , " march ! " He watched them vigilantly as they came up to the turningpoint and bent past him , moving parallel to the runway pavement . When they were all by , he called : " Company , halt ! One : two ! " He stalked up to the Second Platoon . " You , there ! " he said . " And you ! What did you push him for ? Fall out , both you ! " He stood brooding over them while he looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Not the first , the far one . At the double , up there and back ! And go on doing it until I tell you . Start running and keep running ! " He saw them off , watching them a minute . " And do n't run funny ! " he roared . " ' Less you want to run all day ! Hold yourself up ! Do n't run like a monkey , run like a man ! " He faced the waiting platoons . " Company , at ease ! " he said . " I said : at ease , ' not at rest ' ! " Leisurely and severely , he passed his eye over the platoons . " At rest ! " he said . " Nobodyget out of ranks . Nobody start hollering or yelling , or you 'll be at attention . Sergeant White , you take over . I got to find Lieutenant Anderson . "   " He right there , Sarge . " " He coming now , Lindy . " " Who asked you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The company commander , First Lieutenant Anderson , was approaching with an Air Force captain . Lieutenant Anderson , his shirt collar open , his sleeves rolled up , was deeply sunburned . He shot an anxious look at the company , and returned Sergeant Rogers 's magnificent salute . " Fall out , everybody , " he said , " and get around here . You can all sit down . I want to explain this to you . Hurry up ; get settled , please . " With the company sitting and squatting in a big semicircle before him , Lieutenant Anderson consulted a paper . He said : " This afternoon an exercise in the defense of an airdrome will be performed . There will be a simulated attack by a force of paratroopers . That is , paratroopers are going to be dropped in strength on the field here with full equipment and they will endeavor to seize this area . For purposes of the exercise , it will be assumed that the runway under construction is an advanced landing strip that the enemy is trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Engineers working on it are to beat off the attack and hold the runway . What we 're going to do this morning is lay out proper defense positions , fox holes , automatic weapons ' emplacements , obstacles , and so on , according to plans which I have here . We wo n't have time to complete all of them ; some of them will just have to be simulated ; but I want to complete some of them so they would really be defensible . Regular camouflage procedurewill be followed , and Captain Dobie , here , of the Post Engineers office , will show us where to find camouflage material , and any other necessary material . Is that clear ? Any questions ? " Among the seated crowd there was an inquiring turn of heads , some quiet pushing , some nodding , grinning , and muffledlaughter . " None of that ! " Sergeant Rogers said . " Anyone got a question ? Do n't keep the lieutenant waiting ! " Someone said : " He want to ask : planes really coming ? They really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out : " You asking that , not me ! "  |p326Someone  else said : " Who they ? They not Germans ? " Derisive snorts of laughter arose around the questioner . " All right , " Lieutenant Anderson said , laughing too . " Now , everybody , get this straight . The planes are really coming . They are our planes , AFORAD planes from Tangerine City . They are really going to drop paratroopers and equipment . They are our paratroopers , the units stationed at Tangerine City . They are doing it as a tactical exercise , for practice and training ; just as we 're going to prepare real defenses for practice and training . It is being carried out in connection with the special parade and retreat ceremonies this afternoon . GeneralBeal himself , and 1 understand also some other generals from Washington , will be present . They might come over and inspect what we 've done ; and , anyway , Colonel Mandible or Major McIlmoyle will be around to inspect the work shortly before the drop is scheduled . You will then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simulated defense . Everybody un-derstand ? " There was a general murmur and nodding of heads . " Now , one thing we want to remember . Those paratroopers think they 're pretty good , and we want to show them that we 're good , too . That the Aviation Engineers are just as smart and tough as they are . We want to show them that , if it was a real attack , not just a pretended one , if they were really the enemy , why , we made such good defenses that they 'd all be killed before they took this landing strip away from us . Any more questions ? " Sergeant Rogers said : " And the lieutenant do n't mean any more fool questions You got any good questions , ask them quick , so we get them over and get working . " He surveyed the circle an instant . " There are no more questions , sir , " he said . " O.K. , " Lieutenant Anderson said . " Here is a list of the works assigned us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of men to be detailed for each job . When you see how it 's going , use your own judgment about increasingor decreasing the details . I want to be sure at least one job of each type is really finished , camouflaged , and so on . CaptainP327Dobie is going to let us have some automatic weapons to mount in the emplacements . He 'll send for them as soon as we 're ready to set them up . " " Yes , sir , " Sergeant Rogers said . He wheeled around imperiously . " Fall in , all you ! Over there ! I want to count you off , first . Then we 'll get the tools from the tool wagons . " He moved away . Captain Dobie said , " I 'll be back pretty soon and give you a hand with staking out the rest of the positions . I guess we have enough marked to hold them for now . " He stood looking a moment at the men milling around to form platoon lines while Sergeant Rogers belabored them with short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like it with them ? Lot of headaches , I guess . " " I guess you get those anywhere , " Lieutenant Anderson said , somewhat coldly . " This is a good company . Rogers , there , is good . He can get anything out of them , more than you 'd get out of most white companies . Some of them are pretty ignorant , of course  --  just barely read and write  --  " " You 're telling me ! " Captain Dobie said . " Let me tell you what some of them from one of the companies helping on the runway did yesterday ! We have a twenty-seven-foot sea sled we keep over by the little pier with the shed for a rescue boat . Some machinery was being shifted and somebody decided the boat was in the way , so he told some of these jigaboos to move it  --  he meant work it along , push it or pole it , a hundred feet or so . The boat was out of the shed , up against the bank and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drained all the oil out . Half the spark plugs were out , too  --  I mean anyone could see it was being worked on . The men were n't there  --  the truck had come around and taken them over to eat . " Captain Dobie gave his head a disgusted shake . " Well , one of these jigaboos figured it would be easier if they made it move itself . He was a truck driver , or something ; so he knew all . about it . He put the plugs back and fired up . They have quite a power plant in those boats  --  do pretty near fifty miles an hour . So this lame-brain opens it good and wide without a drop P328of oil in it and freezes both engines solid . So this morning Colonel Uline is busy trying to requisition two new engines . You can have them , brother , you can have them ! Be over in the shed there if you want anything . " Lieutenant Anderson , alone , stood watching while the platoons broke up in groups and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They have their tools in a minute , sir . I see those stakes . Any special place to start first ? " " No , " Lieutenant Anderson said . " They 're numbered ; and here are the drawings . They 're numbered , too . What about chow ? " " Corporal McIntyre 's got some men , sir . I left them at the mess over in the Area . They 're making sandwiches , and some milk cans of lemonade . Come noon , these 'll be too hot to want to eat a whole lot . When they get done fixing the stuff , CorporalMcIntyre is to bring it in a truck . The truck is there . " " Good , " Lieutenant Anderson said . " What do those two think they 're doing ? " Sergeant Rogers turned around . " Oh , " he said . " Why , they 're doing a little doubling , sir . They 're disorderly in ranks . " " Well , stop them , now , " Lieutenant Anderson said , frowning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Get over there with your platoon ! " Lieutenant Anderson looked around . No one was within earshot , so he said : " You have to quit doing that , Sergeant . I spoke to you about it before . If one of them squawks to the Air Inspector  --  " Sergeant Rogers said : " Sir , some of them do n't know much , but every one of them would know better than going squawking behind my back . I would n't do it , I could help it . Some few , they get too big for their pants . " Miss Candee , frowning at one of the many corrections in the text , sucked coffee slowly across the rim of the cardboard cup . Leaving a smear of lipstick on it , she put the cup down P329then , nodding suddenly . Her hands fell to the typewriter keys ; her fingers , as though of their own motion , danced over them . " Oh , the things Lieutenant Edsell writes ! " she said with pleasure . She slipped out the typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carbon copies and rolled it into the machine . Captain Duchemin , hunched over a typewriter of his own on a table beside his desk , puffing intermittently at his pipe , muttered : " Oh , the things the anonymous author of Technical Manual eleven-dash-four-ten writes ! " A copy of the manual was flattened out on the desk next to him . " He says the sex of pigeons is difficult to determine without experience , and it is often necessary to observe their actions when together . A coarie idea , is n't it ? Hm ! Some common distinctive actions of the cock are  --  hm ! Pecking the head of the hen when she shows no desire to mate . Hm ! Wonder if that works ? Palm , would you desire to mate if he kept pecking your head ? " " Oh , Captain Duchemin ! " " Say , am I crazy ? " Captain Duchemin sat up . " Why should I be copying stuff ? Where are your scissors , Nat ? I 'm going to cut out the paragraphs I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was looking at the Ocanara Morning Sun , said absently : " My scissors are in your drawer there , where you put them the last time you swiped them . " " Captain Hicks ! " He glanced from the paper to Miss Candee . " Yes , yes , yes , " he said . " Captain Hicks , listen to what Lieutenant Edsell says in this story . " " I will not . And furthermore , it is now after eight o'clock . To the abstraction or misapplication of the Army 's typewriter paper , carbon paper , typewriter ribbon , and typewriter you are adding a defalcation of man- or at least woman-hours belonging to and paid for by the Army . " " Oh , I only have one more page ! You have n't anything for me to do yet . Neither has Captain Duchemin . What does defalcation mean ? Unless it 's something awful . " " It means embezzlement of what is held in trust . "   " Well , I 'm certainly not doing that . Am I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duchemin said . " Polysyllabic humor ! Ye Editor is quipping . Quip no more , Editor . Be quiet , everybody . How am I going to finish this first section before I fly away ? Did I tell you what happened yesterday ? Due to the navigational errors of Lieutenant Eusner , whom Manny gave us for a pilot , we dropped our collapsible , cylindertype , four-bird container square in a pond , and so they all drowned . You 'd think we were made of pigeons . " Miss Candee said : " He says about this man : Circumspective meanness of spirit , the unswerving allegiance to stupidity taught by thirty Regular Army years had perfectly qualified him to become a general officer . " ' She giggled . " How does he know General Beal or somebody wo n't see that ? What 's circumspective ' mean ? " " It means cautious , being careful , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Looking all around before you do it . " " Oh . Well , this is a very good story , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's about this boy at Officer Candidate School who went crazy . Oh , it 's awful ! Some of the things he says they made them do ! Did they really ? " " You ca n't tell by us , " Captain Duchemin said . " Captain Hicks and I went to the Gentlemen 's School . Captain Hicks never had to do anything but try and keep awake through the interesting talks on company administration and sex hygieneuntil it was time to don his whites and go boozing in the downstairs bar at the Cromwell , a luxury hotel . What they did to those hotels ! That was awful . It gave me an acute anguish in the business instinct . Now , you know as much as I do . What is the name you do n't get of this story which the lieutenant is so economically having typed for him by the AAF ? " Miss Candee turned over the pile of pages . " ' We Go Rolling , Rolling Home . ' I do n't get it . " " You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beaming , he chanted : " ' Happy is the day , when the airman gets his pay  --  ' Ah , now , can we help you , Sergeant ? "  | " I 'm looking for Captain Hicks , sir  --  " " Hello , Milt , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Come on in . Say , you did n't have to bother to come over here . I told Beaudry we 'd come there . Wiley ought to be along in a minute . I went around to his VOQ earlier , but he was out getting breakfast . Milton McCabe , Clarence Duchemin . " " And that beautiful girl in the corner is Miss Candee ; but must n't handle , " Captain Duchemin said . " And that lug right behind you is Lieutenant Edsell , who now gets gigged , as I believe they said at OCS , for being eleven minutes late . Mister , may I touch you ? " Lieutenant Edsell said : " Nuts to you , Captain . Hello , Milt . What have you got there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light drawing board with a folding support which could be adjusted to hold it on a table at any desired angle . He set the drawing board against the front of Nathaniel Hicks 's desk and laid down a pencil case . His narrow dark face showed a patient smile . " I thought I 'd see if we could do it here , " he said . " Our place is full of carpenters and builders . Nobody knows why . They seem to be constructing a course for obstacle races . I can rough your stuff out on this , and take it back and finish it when they get the step ladders out of my corner . " " What are you doing ? " Lieutenant Edsell said . " What is it , Nat ? Plane formation diagrams ? " " For God 's sake ! " Lieutenant Edsell said . He looked sympatheticallyat Sergeant McCabe . " They take one of the best artists in the United States and put him to drawing diagrams ! That 's typical of the Army mind ! " Sergeant McCabe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categorical statement of it . He said : " Thanks for the kind words , Jim ; but  --  " " No , no , " Captain Duchemin said . " Do n't thank the loot ! You 'll spoil everything ! If you 'll just grasp the offered opportunity to realize that the typical Army mind is also taking one of the best writers in the United States and putting him to doing Special Projects reports , he will gladly call it square . Wo n't you , Loot ? " P332Sergeant McCabe , more embarrassed , said : " I 'm not kicking . I have a pretty easy time . Major Beaudry 's been very decent to me . He fixed it so I could get out of barracks and live off the Area , so I have a place now where I can work evenings . " " That 's dandy , is n't it ? " Lieutenant Edsell said . He walked around behind his desk and sat down . " How do you like having a former **41;3508;TOOLONG from a second-rate advertising agency deciding what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a hell of a note . He lets you live off the Area ! That 's mighty white of him . " " Well , he did n't have to , " Sergeant McCabe said . " I 'm not kicking . When you 're drafted , you 're drafted ; and you could land in a lot worse places than this  --  " Captain Duchemin said : " Listen , boss ; some of my best friends are advertising agency vice presidents . Ca n't you see how your contemptuous reference must wound me ? And anyway , how do you think we crass business men would like being pushed around by some typical esthetes of finer clay ? Comes the revolution ! " " Huh ! " Lieutenant Edsell said . " Go carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet ! " He took his telephone and said : " Outside . Look , I have n't a book . Get me the railroad station , will you ? " " Not leaving us , I hope ? " Captain Duchemin said . " Not going away for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I want to find out how late the morning train is . I have to meet it , if you do n't mind . " " I do n't mind . The Chief of Section , W. W. Whitney , your Commanding Officer ; how does he feel ? Does he mind ? " " He is n't going to know about it . You 'll be covering for me . " " Wrong , " Captain Duchemin said . " Any minute now I becomeairborne . Just as soon as Lieutenant Pettie catches a new case full of pigeons . And I wo n't be back until it 's time for me to review the parade this afternoon . " Miss Candee said : " Lieutenant Edsell ! Both Major Whitney and Capt  --  Major Pound are at a conference Colonel Coulthard called . So I guess Captain Hicks is in charge . "   " Oh , no , he 's not , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Captain Hicks is not mixing up in this at all . " " Major Whitney said you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d#d n't see him . Listen , Milt ; I just thought of something . Would you be interested in getting on TD for a couple of weeks and being sent around the AFORAD installationsto do sketches , water colors , anything you like , that they could use to illustrate some magazine articles ? You would n't get paid for them  --  I mean , anything paid would have to go to the Aid Society , probably . But if you 'd like to do it , I think I might be able to get you assigned . " " Absolutely ! " Sergeant McCabe said . " Any time ! " He laughed . " I get a little tired doing lettering , " he said . " I never did have much practice at it , and it 's a job . Could you really work it ? " " I think there 's a good chance . They 're trying to get some stuff about AFORAD into the magazines . They ca n't do it with a hand-out ; they know that . I 'm trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody the idea of sending a good man down . 1 think if I could tell the general it would help sell the articles to be able to promise them illustrations by you , he 'd go along . That would be true , too . I 'm fairly sure we 'd have to have a very good writer , and very good pictures to interest anybody worth interesting . " Lieutenant Edsell said : " On time ? Thanks . " He pat back the telephone , and said to Nathaniel Hicks : " Who 's going to write these articles ? " " Why ? " said Nathaniel Hicks . " You would n't want to do them . I was just telling Milt . No money . " " Though good , money is not everything , " Lieutenant Edsell said , thoughtfully picking his nose . " Where 's the money in writing an evaluation report on Thirteenth Air Force findings on the use of synthetic-rubber radio-range towers for underwaterinstallations of the Army Airways Communication System ? I would do quite a little to get W.W.W. off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who 's going to write them ? " " I 'm supposed to find the material , and then I 'm supposed to find somebody to work it up . But  --  "  | " You 've found him , " Lieutenant Edsell said . " I 'll do it . " Nettled by this peremptory settlement of the question , NathanielHicks said : " Have you ever done any article stuff ? If you have , I never heard of it , and I know pretty well everyone in the business . If you have n't , you just think you could . One of you prose artists can screw up a simple , factual story until hell wo n't have it . You never know anything about organization of the material , and most of you wo n't learn ; you think you know it all . " Captain Duchemin said : " Bravo , butch ! " " Five gets you ten , " Lieutenant Edsell said coldly , " that I can , right this minute , turn out a better article on any subject you care to name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O.K. , you have n't heard of my doing it ; and I 'll tell you why . Under ordinary circumstances , I would n't be seen dead in your big-circulation magazines . For reasons of my own , at the moment I 'm willing to help you out . Now , another five will get you ten more that the magazine that sees the articles will write me direct to find out if I 'm interested in doing other things for them  --  which I wo n't be . These , I am willing to do , and you 'd better take me up . " Lieutenant Edsell smiled calmly at Nathaniel Hicks . To his added irritation , Nathaniel Hicks found himself , against his will , impressed a little by this colossal conceit . " Yes ; think it over , " Lieutenant Edsell said disinterestedly . " Why , damn it all  --  " Nathaniel Hicks began ; but the telephonehad rung , and Miss Candee , taking it on her extension , lifted her head and called : " Captain Hicks ! " The voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir ; Office of the Air Inspector . Colonel Ross directs me to notify you that there will be a hearing on an occurrence yesterday . The Charge Sheet lists you as a witness . You will please report at ten o'clock to the Staff Conference Room , Directorateof Personnel Analysis Center . One more thing , sir . Could you help us locate Captain Eugene P. Wiley ? We understand that he was with you  --  " " Yes , " Nathaniel Hicks said , " I can . I am expecting him  |p335here  any minute  --  in fact , I see him now . He 's coming in . I 'll tell him . " Moving with his distinctive , long-limbed swing , a casual , easy swagger , Captain Wiley came smiling down the office . He said : " Say , I 'm a little late , Nat ! I was getting coffee in the PX when I saw this RAF chap , he 's a Liaison Officer here , or something , I used to know in England . So we had to see what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . Jesus , I was surprised to see him ! " He caught sight of Miss Candee , viewing him with the mute , fascinated expression to which he must have been well accustomed . He acknowledged the tribute with his genial , ladykilling , frank smile and said : " Excuse the language , ma'am . " " That is Miss Candee , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " And Captain Duchemin . You know Sergeant McCabe . Lieutenant Edsell . Gene , that call I just had was about the hearing this morning . They want us at ten . It 's a hell of a nuisance ; but maybe we can give Milt enough of the stuff first to hold him while we 're over there . " " Sure , " Captain Wiley said . He dug into his breast pocket and produced a folded wad of paper . " I took that list of diagramswe worked out in Orlando and made some drawings I thought I might as well bring over . They 're not so hot , but they might help . Suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Might save him a lot of time . I do n't know what order they 're in . " He flattened out the penciled sheets on the corner of the desk . " Well , here 's a beam-rear attack on a bomber , for instance . See ; element leader and his wingman , overhauling , here . See ; fire opened here in two or three second bursts , at not more than two hundred fifty yards . Then , there ; the breakaway , sharp down ; and then out , with plenty rudder . " " Yes , " said Sergeant McCabe , " that 's perfectly clear . If they 're all like that , I could work from them . I think what I 'd better do is rough this one out now , so you can see whether I have the right idea about how they ought to look finished . You want these real planes , or just symbols ? I 'll do symbols flow , because I might not be able to do particular types fromp336memory ; but we have all the models @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have them . " Captain Wiley said , " How about it , Nat ? Real planes would be pretty good , I think . Kind of make them more interesting . If it is n't too much trouble . " " It 's not , " Sergeant McCabe said . " I 'm getting pretty good at sketching planes . " He had set his drawing board up on the table by the windowsand began swiftly to block off his sheet . Captain Wiley watched him with interest for a moment . " By God , " he said admiringly , " I like seeing a man who knows what he 's doing ! Look at that , Nat ! Always wished I could draw ! It looks so easy till you try it . " He let himself down in the chair by Nathaniel Hicks 's desk , clasped his hands behind his head , and tilted until he balanced himself and the chair delicately on two legs . " About this thing , this hearing , Nat . Do you know if they 're going to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to get out of it , give them an affidavit or something . They usually take that . I have this schedule of lectures and crap they make me give at Orlando . Having to come back here a lot of times would n't go down so well . It was all I could do to make them let me come now . " Nathaniel Hicks said : " I do n't believe they 'll want anythingfrom us except a statement that we saw them pushing the Provost Marshal around , and maybe an identification  --  though the truth is , I doubt if I could identify the one who held him , or the one who had his gun . " " I 'd know that boy , all right , " Captain Wiley said . " He 's a type you got to watch . Lot of white blood in him . " " What is this ? " Lieutenant Edsell said . He had been looking at the manuscript Miss Candee had typed for him ; but now he put it aside . " Is this what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " It seems we were , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " How did you hear about it ? " " It 's all over the place , " Lieutenant Edsell said . " Do n't worry , there wo n't be any court martial . They would n't want to give the arrested officers a chance to get on the record inp337their own defense . They 'll try to hush it up . The colored officers should n't let them . Every night a new bunch ought to go over to the Club and get arrested . The trouble is , they may not see the chance they have . " Captain Wiley , balanced on his chair , looked over at him . " I do n't believe I get you , Lieutenant , " he said . " What chance have they ? " " They have a chance to force the issue , and maybe end this whole segregation business , once and for all . The Army ca n't afford to practice segregation , if it 's known they do . They 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and once that was established , I do n't think the rights could later be taken away , even in the South  --  " " They do n't rate the same rights as white men , " Captain Wiley said gently . " That 's why the same rights are n't and ca n't be allowed them . The worst thing that could happen to them would be to end segregation . That would mean that a white man in the South would have to act every day as an individual to protect himself . That would be very bad for the Negroes . With segregation , now , both parties know where they stand , so there 's almost no friction , see ? Except when somebody from outside comes in and stirs it up . Your idea is mighty dangerous , Lieutenant . " Nathaniel Hicks said to Lieutenant Edsell : " For God 's sake , Jim , do you have to argue all the time ? Ca n't you just think what you think , keep still , and let us work ? " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to argue ! I can see the captain is from the South ; so I 'll only point out to him that , like too many Southerners , he is under a grave misapprehension . The dangerous idea is his . It is very dangerous to deny people their rights . It means that , in the long run , you drive them to take their rights by force . Is that what the captain wants ? " Captain Wiley shook his head . " That , friend , they never will do , because they ca n't , " he said . " What you 're trying to say is that a Negro is equal to a white man . Do n't you see that if he was equal , you would n't have to be demanding rights ' for him ? Like you say , he 'd have them by force , if no otherp338way . He has n't got them , though they gave them to him , and more , after the War Between the States . But he could n't keep them ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North was wrong then , and that 's where you 're wrong now . The two races just are n't equal . Anyone who says they are , either does n't have good sense , or does n't know Negroes . " Captain Duchemin said : " Please , gentlemen , please ! The captain has mentioned the War Between the States . In that dire conflict , sir , my dear old great grandpappy , a distinguished bounty jumper from Ohio , ran like hell from many a bloody field just to settle the momentous question for his posterity . Must we go through it all again ? " Captain Wiley smiled . " Our friend , here , " he said , " seems to think so . I do n't . The matter is good and settled . It 's been proved , plenty times . They do n't make the grade . " " For God 's sake ! " Lieutenant Edsell said . " I suppose you 're talking about the AGCT tests ! Granted , one Negro in twenty comes in Grades One and Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll find eight white men . What do you learn from that ? You learn what we all know . In education , as in everything else , the Negro is systematically done out of a fair chance . You 've just been explaining that , Captain . You do n't want them to have a chance . " Captain Wiley said : " No , I 'm afraid I do n't know about these tests , whatever they are , you mention , Lieutenant . I do n't believe you really have to give a lot of tests or anything . And it is n't a question of what you call a fair chance , or what I want them , or do n't want them , to have . No amount of chances , and nothing I could do , would change the fact that a Negro happens to be a member of a relatively inferior race ; physically , mentally , every way . It may be too bad , from his standpoint , and yours ; but it 's true . " " Very far from being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply an absurd lie . There is no scientific basis for it whatsoever . Outside some of Hitler 's phoneys , you could n't find an anthropologist who would accept such a statement about the Negro race . If you do n't even know that , there 's no sense discussing it . "  |p339Ca|ptain  Wiley said : " Please do n't call me a liar , Lieutenant . Not here . Not now . " " Who called you a liar ? " Lieutenant Edsell said . " A liar is a person who says what he knows is n't true . What you say is n't true ; but it never occurred to me that you would know it was n't true and still be saying it . That leaves you out , as far as I 'm concerned . However , if you mean I 'm not free to say that a statement which I know to be untrue is a lie , get rid of the notion , Captain . I believe you ca n't help your prejudices . I think , if you could , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wish I could help you straighten out your thinking ; but it does n't look as if I could , and I 've got to get downtown ; so we may as well drop it . " " I believe that would be a right smart thing for us to do , " Captain Wiley said . " I appreciate your wanting to help me , Lieutenant ; and I am glad that you did not call me a liar . " The telephone rang . Miss Candee , rousing herself from the absorption with which she had closely if silently followed the debate , took it . She said in a hushed voice : " Reports Section ; Miss Candee . " She listened a. moment and nodded at Nathaniel Hicks . " Captain Hicks . " " Captain , this is Sergeant Brooks again . The hearing at ten o'clock has been postponed . We will notify you when it is scheduled , sir . " Nathaniel Hicks said , " You wo n't have it this morning ? Well , now , Captain Wiley has to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on temporary duty . If Colonel Ross , or whoeverwill be conducting the hearing , could take an affidavit from him , and excuse him , it would be a great help . Can you find out if that would be possible and  --  " The other telephone rang . Miss Candee pressed the switch on her desk and took up the receiver . She looked at Nathaniel Hicks and nodded again . " O.K. , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " All right , Sergeant ; if you will . " " You see ? " Lieutenant Edsell said . He picked up his overseascap and paused in the door . " No hearing , no court martial . I just hope they do n't get away with it  --  "  |p340Nathaniel  Hicks waved an impatient hand at him and turned the button on the base of the telephone to pick up the other line . " Captain Hicks , " he said . Lieutenant Edsell said : " Well , make up your mind about those articles . I 'll have to tell Pound or Whitney if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hicks 's ear was indistinct and Nathaniel Hicks waved his hand again . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " I ca n't hear you . Will you speak louder ? And will you shut up , Jim ? " " Is this Captain Hicks ? " " Yes , it is ! I still ca n't hear you very well . Who is calling ? " " Captain Hicks , this is Katherine Andrews  --  Don Andrews 's wife  --  " " Oh , Yes , Mrs. Andrews , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I 'm sorry . We must have a terrible connection . " " Do you know where I could reach Don ? He left about an hour ago ; but he is n't at his office . The number he gave me does n't answer . " There was a long pause and she said , " So I asked information for your number . I hope you do n't mind . I  --  " " Of course not ! " Nathaniel Hicks said . " I 'll see if I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something in the uncertain quality of her voice made him add quickly : " Or is there anything I could do ? Is everything all right ? " " I do n't know , " she said . " I do n't know . I  --  Captain Hicks , it 's  --  I 'm horribly ill . I ca n't seem to  --  look , I am afraid I am going to faint . I will have to hang up . Could you  --  " The connection broke . " My God ! " Nathaniel Hicks said . " That 's Don 's wife . There 's something wrong with her . I think she just fainted . They ca n't reach Don  --  " Captain Duchemin said , taking the phone on his desk , " Bettercall the Base Hospital . They can send someone down . " He bent his head toward Miss Candee . " Whip along to Stat Control , Honey , and see who knows where Captain Andrews is. "  |p341SERGEANT  BROOKS put down his cigar and got to his feet . " Judge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people and they 'll be there . However , there 's one little technical difficulty I had with Personnel Analysis . The arrested officers do n't really belong to any organization yet . You see , there was a tentative group organization set up , but only on paper . Group and squadron officers had n't been formally designated , and as it happens , I do n't know that it makes any difference , the man who was going to be temporary group commander is this LieutenantWillis , who is in the Hospital . 1 have some more informationabout him , incidentally , sir . " He looked at a pad on his desk . " Well , at any rate , the thing at Personnel Analysis was who would order these officers in arrest in quarters to report for the hearing . Major Blake said  --  " " He says too much , " Colonel Ross said . " That 's an absurd quibble . Their present duty status makes General Beal their commanding officer . Tell them I order them to report by command of General Beal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Jobson made a night flight down from Washington and had just got there , and 1 think he was trying to stick his oar in . I took the liberty of calling Major Sears and asked him to send someone around to tell the officers to report . So 1 presume he did . " " Good , good . What 's this information about this Willis ? " Sergeant Brooks looked at his pad . " Well , first , " he said , " Colonel Mowbray called . He thinks it 's very important for him to see you for a few minutes right away . He said to tell you that Colonel Carricker was in his office . I thought you should know that before you saw this officer outside . It 's CaptainCollins , Public Relations . He seems to have a lot eating him . About an hour ago he called up and said he had something to communicate to you verbally about an investigation he understood you ordered . I think it must have been Colonel Howden 's thing  --  civilian personnel check in connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again  --  Captain Collins  --  andsaid he 'd had something else that might be evenp342hotter . I told him he 'd better come over , so he did . 1 asked him if he could give me an idea of what it was . He said he had information from Mr. Bullen that this man Willis 's father was coming in this morning to see him  --  Willis , and that the Ocanara police were interested in it and in view of the story he had heard about how Willis came to be injured , he thought you should know . " " Well , I 'd better see him , " Colonel Ross said . " Well , now , also waiting outside , sir , is Major McCreery . " " What 's he going to do ? Squawk about assigning a medical officer for the WAC business ? If he is , you 'll have to get rid of him . I have n't time to see him this morning . " " I thought of that , sir . This is entirely different , and he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he indicate its nature to me and so on and so on ; so he said he had word from the Air Surgeon in Washington about a discharge racket operating through the AAF hospitals -- or one ; at Mitchel Field , I think it was ; and all Post Surgeons are to check ; and he thinks you ought to help him . At Mitchel , they thought Medical AdministrativeCorps officers were taking bribes . A lot of people had been assigned to the section of the Base Unit running the motor pool . All men discharged from the Hospital ; and one or two of them were shooting their faces off  --  saying they came from hot outfits that had overseas orders . It was supposed to cost about five hundred dollars . For two thousand dollars , you could get yourself a CDD and go home . " Colonel Ross sat down at his desk . " I do n't see how it could be done , " he said . " I can see one way , Judge , " Sergeant Brooks said . " Any military personnel can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fellow got a furlough from a hot outfit , to let him go home a few days before he was sent overseas , he could report in sick at any hospital . If he was admitted as a patient , they would TWX for his papers . Once the papers were sent , his former outfit would n't have any more record of him ; he would n't belong to it any more . When he was discharged , they could cut orders for him to be assigned anywhere  --  a Base Unit here , for instance . The thing would be getting entered as a patient.  |p343I  suppose there 's some officer who has charge of that , an Executive Officer or something , maybe . If he could happen to be amenable to five hundred dollars . Well ! What do you think of that , judge ? " Colonel Ross said : " I think you 're going to be a very successfullawyer , Steve . I regret that military service is interrupting your career . I can only hope you are smarter than any of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reason to think it was going on here ? " " No , sir . He was just jumping up and down . " " Well , that does no harm . " Colonel Ross put out his hand , flipped the key marked Executive Officer on the box , and depressed the buzzer switch . Through a light crackling sound , Colonel Mowbray 's voice broke out in the room : " Oh , Norm ! Good ! You could n't come over here a minute , could you ? " " I 'm pretty well tied up , Pop . I just left the general ; and I 've got people here . " " There in the room ? " " No , they 're outside . " " I did n't want this to be heard , is all , Norm . Look , Benny came in to see me . I have n't told Bus yet . I wanted to know what about that suggestion you made yesterday . There 's one other factor , Norm . Jo-Jo , General Nichols , was directed to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cross  --  something he did when he was in transition training or somewhere . Do you know whether Bus said anything to him about Willis being in the Hospital , the circumstancesand so on ? " " I do n't think so , " Colonel Ross said . " Well , you see what I mean ? He 's going to have to give him the medal , I guess . I contacted the Hospital and they said Willis was perfectly all right  --  that is , he could leave there . I told them not to discharge him until they heard from me . Now , I thought of this . If you and Bus still want Benny to apologize to him  --  why , Benny will . He 's a pretty downhearted young man this morning . I could have him here and Benny could apologize ; but then there 's Jo-Jo and the award . Norm , it just looks pretty thick to me . Do you see what I mean ? As ifP344we were trying to hush him up , sort of bribe him . Somebody 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see why Bus might not have  --  he might want to keep Benny out of it , not let Jo-Jo get the idea it all happened because of what Benny did . I mean , the other part , the Officers Club thing . What is happening about that , by the way ? " " We were going to have a hearing at ten o'clock , " Colonel Ross said . " I have just canceled it . " He looked at Sergeant Brooks and pointed at the telephone . " Now , Pop , I have information , which I have n't checked yet , that the father of Lieutenant Willis was told the boy was hurt and is arriving here this morning to see him . He 's coming from Washington , and so he 'll be on the morning train , presumably . Will you have a staff car down at the station , with an officer , make it a captain , to meet this man and bring him out to the Base Hospital ? " There was a pause and Colonel Mowbray said : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colored man , is n't it ? " " That would seem very likely , " Colonel Ross said . " Is n't that  --  well , overdoing it again a little , Norm ? He wo n't expect anything like that . " Colonel Ross said : " Pop , are we sorry this happened , or are n't we ? " The box carried the mechanically stepped-up sound of Colonel Mowbray clearing his throat . Colonel Ross said carefully : " Bus is not going to do anything about this , you know . We 're going to have to do it for him . You understand that ? The shortest way out is the best way . " Colonel Mowbray said : " Norm , Benny should n't have hit Willis . We are sorry about that ; and so is Benny . But how about Willis , now ? He never should have brought that plane in without being sure he was clear to land . I know his radio was out ; and probably when he saw the runway lights come on , he figured that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were for him . But it was still his responsibility to make sure about other traffic before he put down . He should have gone around again . It was n't his fault , no thanks to him , he did n't kill Bus and you and all the rest of them . That 's what made Benny sore , and you know as well as I do , that that 's why P345Benny hit him . Everybody seems to be going at this as though Willis was just an innocent bystander and Benny went over and broke his nose because he was a colored boy , and for no other reason . Now , if we were being really just and impartial about this thing , it seems to me along with Jo-Jo 's medal and an apology and sending cars for his father , Willis ought to get a reprimand , be grounded for a while , and docked some pay for reckless flying . I 'm not suggesting that ; I 'm just saying it . You 're a judge , Norm . You ought to see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " but I am not being a judge this morning . I think I have other responsibilities here and now . " He looked at Sergeant Brooks who was quietly busy at the telephone at his desk in the corner , with a surprising , unmoved patience calling all the people he had called before to cancel the hearing . Colonel Ross supposed that this manner of Sergeant Brooks showed more than anything else that though Sergeant Brooks might well regard him as a trying old man , he had come , over the months , to respect the old man 's judgment . Colonel Ross said , " We have to get Bus out of this . He can not or will not get himself out . We will have to disregard everything else . " Talking to the box with his hands lying on the blotter of the desk in front of him was much like talking to himself , Colonel Ross felt , much more like it than speaking on the telephone , which was like speaking into a tube that clearly must lead somewhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relay Colonel Mowbray 's astonishment or sharp surmise . Colonel Mowbray must be well aware that the general often took action that Colonel Ross suggested  --  really , told him to take  --  but the perfunctory form was still important ; you tacked on a le-roi-1e-vent , which cleared you to act ; you got your authority by a formal avowal that you , personally , had none . The silence meant of course that Colonel Mowbray was jibbing . Colonel Mowbray said then in a dazed , but definitely reprovingtone : " That 's going pretty far , Norm . " The plain implicationwas that Colonel Ross did n't know what he was saying  --  how could he ? Fair-minded , simple-minded , Colonel Mowbray at once excused and criticized him . He was not Regular Army , P346he was not an Academy man . In a crisis , these defects in him , these things he was not , would come out  --  in the same sense that Colonel Mowbray made it felt , though he had carefully not said it , that Lieutenant Willis , when he landed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be evidencing his defect  --  Negro blood  --  in what was ostensibly a rated pilot . Colonel Mowbray said : " I think we 'd better take this up directly with Bus , Norm . I do n't think we ought to act for him , beyond a certain point , without informing him fully . For all I know , he may not want this man 's father out at the Hospital . I would n't feel justified in sending a car  --  having him escorted there , unless Bus knew  --  " " See if you can get in to talk to him now , " Colonel Ross said . " I would like you to do this , if you will . Ask him if he means to be present at Retreat this afternoon before you ask him anything else . " " Why  --  " Colonel Mowbray paused , plainly dumbfounded . " Why of course he 's going to be  --  he has to be . I do n't think I understood what you said , Norm . " " That 's what I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , will you ? " He flipped up the box key and pressed a button under the edge of his desk . Mrs. Eliot appeared in the door behind and he took two handwritten pages from the corner of his desk and said : " Would you knock this out , please . It 's a statement for General Baxter and will need a witness to my signature . Or , better , give it to Miss Miller . I may want to have something taken down in a minute . Steve , was Captain Collins there before Major McCreery ? " " Yes , he was , judge . " " Have him in . And when he is in , tell Major McCreery that I will be going over to the Base Hospital shortly and will s oe him there ; that I am sorry to have held him up ; but there is a matter which must be finished for the general . Tell him I 'll be very glad to help him in any investigation he thinks necessary . In short , fix it " To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk in an open white jacket , slowly swinging a stethoscope , P347Lieutenant Werthauer said : " Do n't ask me . I have n't had time to look at the Night Reports yet  --  Prissy has them . I 'd just come on , when there was this call to the Oleander Towers . Clark was Duty Officer last night , and he was supposed to stay ; but Prissy told me the major was in early , and then went rushing over to the Area in some kind of a tizzy ; so Clark , the bastard , must have thought with McCreery out of the way nobody would know if he left and went to bed , so he did . So I had to ride the ambulance . " He took a pen and on the upper corner of the Admission Form lying in front of him wrote : Andrews , Katherine L. ( Mrs. )  --  Capt . Donald B. Andrews , AC ; Special Projects , AFORAD . " It was this woman , " he said . He looked at the laboratory slip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hyperglycemia , " he said . " Blood sugar about two fifty . You could smell the acetone across the room . I did n't have a damn thing in my bag , so we wrapped her up and got her out here  --  that corporal , I think his name is Buck , or Bucks , they have driving , is going to kill somebody sometime , and I thought it was going to be me . I 'll report him to Captain Vaughan . He should n't be allowed to drive a car . Anyway , we got her out and shot her up , and she 'll do , I think . I do n't know what the history is . You could n't get any from her , of course . She was out like a light , lying there on the floor . I could see she 'd been vomiting in the bathroom . Her husband turned up with another officer just as we were putting her in the ambulance ; but I did n't have time to get much out of him , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's about thirty-four  --  very thin ; but I do n't think it 's a pathological emaciation . She would have been bound to have symptoms  --  polydipsia , polyurea , and so on , enough to make her see a doctor . I think it 's a new case . She 'd just come down to see her husband , and I think it just hit her . You know  --  prolonged strain , anxiety , there 's a war on ; all that . I 'll have a talk with her husband . He 's waiting around outside somewhere . He was in a state , poor guy . Of course , he did n't know what was wrong with her ; but he 'd developed himself an idea . " Lieutenant Werthauer threw the admission form into theP348file basket . " He said she was all right when he left . But I could see something was bothering him . So then it came out . He got me off a little way , and said maybe he ought to tell me  --  erthoughshe 'd had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , driving over here , and maybe  --  er  --  he ought n't to have ; why , she  --  er  --  wanted to ; so he  --  er  --  had  --  er  --  connection with her as soon as they got upstairs , about an hour be-fore  --  " Captain Raimondi broke into a cordial guffaw . " Let this be to you a warning , " he said . " Never do it in the morning ! " " Yeah ; I told him I did n't think it had any special significance . She ought to be all right  --  a good insulin customer the rest of her life . The shots were starting to pull her out when I left . She 's over in the Women 's Ward  --  Wing E. Give her a look when you go by , will you ? " Captain Andrews said : " I wish somebody would come out . Do you think we have the right place ? " Nathaniel Hicks , who could not help agreeing in his own mind that the long delay must be a bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sole of his shoe the cigarette he had been smoking . Testing the flattened end between his thumb and forefinger to make sure that it was really out , he arose and crossed to the other corner of the narrow hall and dropped it in a metal rubbish container . " I 'm sure this is it , " he said . He nodded at the sign by the door off the small office opposite . It said : Women 's Ward I. Under that were the words : On Duty ; and under that , a narrow slot into which a removable card could be pushed . The card said : Lt. Isabella Shakespeare , ANC . Nathaniel Hicks considered this improbable name again . It was , he supposed , a rough anglicizing of some Slavic name . He said : " I suppose she 's out having a quick cup of coffee at the Mermaid Tavern . There 's a telephone in there . In about a minute , I 'm going to see what it connects with . " He came back to the small folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .  |p349Ca|ptain  Andrews acknowledged the poor pleasantry about the Mermaid Tavern with a feeble smile . " Look , Nat , " he said . " There 's no reason why you should be wasting your whole morning this way . I certainly appreciate all the trouble you 've taken ; but I do n't think there 's anything more anyone can do . You must have been right in the middle of something with your Captain Wiley  --  " Nathaniel Hicks said firmly : " He 's all right . Beaudry sent McCabe over and Wiley 's working on some diagrams with him . They do n't need me . I 'd rather wait until the doctor says it 's all right , and then 1 can give you a lift back to the Area . " He hoped that the insinuated idea of everything bound to come out right would be of service to Captain Andrews in his pitiable state ; but Captain Andrews , speaking distractedly , in a low voice , said : " You ca n't tell about these doctors . I do n't know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this LieutenantWerthauer  --  it 's silly ; but when I see he 's a lot younger than I am , I just wonder how much a kid like that can know . " " He looked competent to me , " Nathaniel Hicks said , not sure that this was the case . " He certainly seemed to be on the job  --  I mean , he acted as if he knew what he was doing  --  you know ; quick about it ; and , well , absorbed in his job . I think I 'd be willing to trust him . " Captain Andrews sat silent a moment , distrait , perhaps passing in his mind the natural , unreasonable retort : yes , but what 's it to you ? You do n't need to trust him ! He moistened his lips and said instead : " I do n't know whether I really understood him . He said it was a coma ; which 1 could see was n't good . I do n't think they use that word unless it 's pretty serious . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know anything about it ; but I guess I always thought diabetes was a chronic disease , not something that could just suddenly happen to you . I could see she was awfully tired when we went upstairs , but I do n't believe she could have been feeling really sick . Of course , you ca n't tell ; she might not have wanted to worry me . She 'd taken her things o$  --  when I left she was going to try to get some sleep . I do n't think I ever should have let her come down , especially when it was still so hot . I think the trip P350exhausted her more than she knew . I suppose I should have asked her not to come . But I mean , Katherine 's always been perfectly well . Except , about six years ago , we lost a baby  --  " Captain Andrews broke off . He gave Nathaniel Hicks a sidelong , bewildered look , as though he could not imagine how he had come to proffer this intimate and purely personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's tough . " Since now it was too late to recall the statement , Captain Andrews must have decided that if he went on it would be less awkward for Nathaniel Hicks than if he stopped dead or shied away . He said : " Yes , it was . You see , we 'd been married a number of years , and we had n't had any children ; really , because a doctor thought she ought not to . I guess I was thinking of that  --  I mean how you ca n't tell about doctors . Then Katherine went to another doctor some friend of hers knew ; and he told her there was no reason why she should n't . " Captain Andrews once more paused painfully , perhaps consideringwhether he could leave it there . He then said : " So I suppose we believed him ; or Katherine did , because she wanted to very much . I guess I believed him , too ; though I was a little nervous about it . But if I had n't believed it , I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , at any rate , it was n't true that there was no reason why she should n't . The first doctor was right about that . And it was n't that the other doctor , the doctor who told her to go ahead , was ignorant or anything . But he was a Catholic , I found out afterwards . I should have found that out first , of course . It just never occurred to me that any doctor would tell a person it was all right to do something , when he knew all the time it had a good chance of killing her . " He looked worriedly away from Nathaniel Hicks . " I ought to say he took wonderful care of her , and got her over it very quickly , without any permanent bad effects . I do n't want to be unfair to him ; and I see that , believing what he believed , he had to tell her to go ahead . They feel they have to leave it up to God , or something ; that it was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't have a child , because you were only guessing until you actually tried . I do n't know ; but I know she P351meant much more to me than any child ever could ; and when I was the one who did n't want to run any risk , I was to blame for not finding out that he said what he said because he believed special things , things I did n't believe . I do n't blame him ; I blame me . Well , I did n't mean to bore you with all that  --  it was just that that was really the only time she 'd ever been sick . I can see that was my fault ; and this is , too  --  " " That 's absurd , Don , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " If I understand what the doctor told you , she must have been going to have an attack anyway  --  " Captain Andrews shook his head stubbornly . " I think she had it because she was so worn out . I do n't mean only this trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Living the way she has to . She has a job . She had it before we were married and she did n't have any trouble getting it again when I went into the Army . You see , I was n't making enough money as a first lieutenant . I do n't mean I ever made what you might think was much ; but we could get by . You see , she has a brother who suddenly went blind when he was about fifteen and when her father died she had to pay his expenses . So because I went in the Army , she had to get her job back . So she has to live up there while I 'm down here , and work too hard  --  it was n't right . " He pulled up , brought his hands together and interlaced them tightly in his lap . " I should n't have done it , " he said . " I 'm not doing anything that 's any use . I would have been more use with the company . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now they have more of them , and I know they do n't have anybody who has as much experience in some special lines as I have . I did n't see things very clearly . I mean ; I did see a lot of men no older than I was , with kids and everything , going or having to go , and it made me kind of uncomfortable . And I knew the company was trying to get me classified indispensable . I know I sounded a minute ago as though I thought I was ; but I was n't , I was just convenient . I was pretty sure they 'd manage to get me deferred on that ground , and I thought I could n't do that . When it was n't true , with everybody else having to go . I P352could n't see that all I was after was to get a uniform to make me feel more comfortable  --  " " Hell , Don , " Nathaniel Hicks said . " Why do you think I 'm here ? It 's only natural . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had any choice at all , what would be easiest for him . I do n't suppose there 's a man in Ocanara , unless he was Regular Army , who ever considered , five years ago , anything so crazy as being an Army officer . I think what you did , and the way you felt , was to your credit . Much more so than what I felt . I  --  " Captain Andrews interrupted him . The interesting feelings experienced by Nathaniel Hicks during the first months of 1942 , which Captain Andrews had been about to hear , Captain Andrews had no time to hear . They were trivial compared to what was in his own mind . He had come to the limit of his limitless consideration for others ; he could be pushed past it . Nathaniel Hicks found himself shaken ; guessing how intolerablemust be the distress that pushed him . Captain Andrews said : " It was just the last straw , the trip down here . I see now that when I got her upstairs I should have called a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to see her that I never noticed , when she got off the plane , when I was driving her over , the shape she was in . She could hardly take her things off . She was n't strong enough to take her girdle off . I had to do it for her  --  " He paused , moistening his lips , looking at Nathaniel Hicks with an expression of anguished inquiry , of a man listening desperately to hear something which was not being said . Nathaniel Hicks was unable to say anything . Captain Raimondi looked at his watch . He had still a few minutes before he began his rounds and he lit a cigarette . He said : " You know what I got this morning , Doctor ? Orders to Randolph Field all signed and sealed . Aviation Medical Examiners ' course starting fifteen September . " " You must be nuts ! " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " Far from it ! " Captain Raimondi said happily . " I gave it P353careful thought and listened to sound advice . What do I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chiropractors or whatever they have down there , and the world is mine . This war could last another five or six years . You might as well go along with it . I have my certificate from them , and a year from now , with fifty hours flying time , I 'm a goddamn flight surgeon , with beautiful gold wings . A bit of wangling , so I get my time every month  --  you only have to be a passenger  --  and I also draw flying pay , beautiful flying pay . Now , why do n't you get some of that ? " " To hell with them , " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " At Carlisle they gave me all the Army crap I can take . I came in to practice medicine , not do monkey drill , and have a lot of little twirps instruct me in my military duties . You make Flight Surgeon , and you really are up Mike 's ! That 's what you 'll be doing  --  giving physicals to flying personnel all day , every day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you get through ! " " What do I do here ? " Captain Raimondi said , yawning . " I pulled two appendixes in the last three months . Rest of the time , I 'm studying the back ends of little tarts from the WAC ; standing out on a small-arms range waiting for them to shoot each other ; and walking the wards to see that you and Clark and Hinault , and especially Yensen , are n't killing more than your quota . I do n't have a thing to lose . What have you got ? " " I 'm not going to stay here , " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " They 'll start rotating combat crews pretty soon ; and whether they realize it or not , there 's going to be plenty of psychoneurosiscoming into the general hospitals . That 's for me ! I just keep my three-one-three-zero MOS shined up , and I 'll be out of this hole six months before you finish collecting your phoney wings . " " That may be for you , " Captain Raimondi said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a supplemental staff for  --  ah , now  --  anxiety reaction cases , you know who 'll get to go ? Every **32;3551;TOOLONG they can screen out , and maybe an occasional orthopedic surgeon . Listen to me , and buck for your examiner 's certificate . "   " You do n't have to tell me what those dim-wits do , " LieutenantWerthauer said gloomily . " But at least I have a chance . At least I wo n't get packed off to be Squadron Flight Surgeon and officer in charge of requisitioning the booze at Little Nooky , Hants , Eng . " " None so blind , " said Captain Raimondi , " as those who will not see ! Where is Prissy and those reports ? Sometimes I think we could do with a new Nurse , Administrative , around here . Speaking of administration , know what that tizzy of McCreery 's you so well observed was based on ? Prissy told me  --  that 's one thing she 's good for . He got word about a station where an administrative officer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coaching them in what to put on for the Board to get a discharge . He wondered about us . " " I could have told you weeks ago , " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " Any fool could see it . A lot of Section Eight stuff going through . There was no more wrong with most of them than there was with me  --  less , in fact ; they had n't been here nine months . I reported the first few I saw to McCreery . He told me I was mistaken . O.K. To hell with them . I 'm mistaken . If McCreery has n't sense enough to see when a man 's faking , and the Board has n't , what 's it to me ? Only , I did n't know he was getting paid for it . " " Well , he was n't . Maybe that 's what burns him up . Somewherethey were , though . And there 's always your friend Captain Vaughan . Maybe he handles the Section Eight stuff . " " That 's no friend of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " Captain Raimondi stood up abruptly and stepped to the window looking out on the poor strip of sand and sparse grass , across which a plank path led from the Base street , bare and hot in the sun , to the Hospital doors . " I thought so ! " he said . " We 've got visitors . That 's the general 's car . And there 's the general ! You do n't suppose they 're pulling a surprise inspection , or something ? McCreery is n't with him . I think he 's alone . My God , do you think I 'd better get out there ? " " No , " said Lieutenant Werthauer . " If he wants anything , let him come and ask . Do n't start a lot of military crap here . P355It 's the only place you ever get away from it . You know what happened to me yesterday ? I was downtown , and walking along Sunshine Avenue , I met a goddamn chaplain , a captain . I do n't know where he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round . Well , as I say , 1 did my saluting for the whole war at Carlisle ; so I favored him with a blank look . I do n't know whether his holiness thought he was turning the other cheek , or whether he was reproving me for unsoldierly conduct . Anyway , he looked right back , hauled off , and saluted me . I thought : Oh , no , you do n't , Bud ! ' and kept looking through him . I had n't gone a yard , when two MP 's step out from the arcade of the Scheherazade Hotel , throw me a ball , too ; and one of them pulls a notebook , and says : May I have your name and serial number , Lieutenant ? ' Well  --  " Captain Raimondi was listening inattentively . He said : " Yeah ; but I think I better  --  " The door opened and General Beal walked in . Lieutenant Werthauer instantly put a hand out and took back the admission form from the file basket . Frowning , he studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pencil . He wrote on a scratch pad : Andrews , Katherine L. ( Mrs. ) . He compared the note with the name on the form , tore the sheet from the pad , and crumpled it up , throwing it in the wastepaper basket . Captain Raimondi dropped his cigarette in an ash tray and jerked himself to a sort of attention . General Beal said : " Oh ! I thought Major McCreery might be in here . " Captain Raimondi said : " Why , no , General . I do n't think he 's in the Hospital at the moment . I 'm Captain Raimondi , sir . Is there anything I can do ? " General Beal looked away from him toward the window . " No , I guess not , " he said . " I wanted to see McCreery  --  " Taking advantage of the general 's looking-away , Captain Raimondi made a hasty surreptitious movement with the hand at his side , jerking the thumb to indicate to Lieutenant Werthauerthat he should stand up . General Beal was not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , no ! " he said impatiently . " I 'm just trying to think ! Do n't bother the lieutenant ! P356He 's busy . I do n't want to upset things . I just came over to see the Post Surgeon  --  " Since the general 's eye nonetheless now rested on him , LieutenantWerthauer arose rebelliously , with a direct stare and stood behind his desk . A surge of sound , for the last moment or two sweeping nearer across the Base , was suddenly on them , a stunning hammer of engines from a big plane taking off . The whole room seemed to shake . You could feel the vibrations in the floor . General Beal made an involuntary wincing grimace , bit his lip . " Hell of a noise ! " he said through the retreating racket . Lieutenant Werthauer 's direct attentive gaze had not left him , and General Beal hesitated . His mouth moved a little , twisting out a smile . He said in a voice of formal , cordial inquiry : " What is your name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Werthauer , sir . I 'm a neuropsychiatrist and internist . " " Oh , " said General Beal . " Yes , yes . That 's good . I 've meant to get over here and meet the Medical Staff . I get good reports of your work . Sit down , sit down . Do n't let me interrupt  --  " His eyes went away from Lieutenant Werthauer 's and back to CaptainRaimondi . " Would anyone know where Major McCreery went ? " Captain Raimondi said : " Sir , I think his secretary might know . I 'll find out right away  --  " he went with alacrity . General Beal said : " Sit down , Lieutenant . I do n't know that I have any special need to see Major McCreery this morning . You 're a doctor , are n't you ? " Sitting down , but looking at General Beal with still closer attention , Lieutenant Werthauer said : " That 's right . " " Well , give me a slip for some of that sodium amytal stuff . I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said : " No . I could n't do that . " " Why not ? " said General Beal , astonished . With a faint , remote smile , Lieutenant Werthauer said : " BecauseI do n't prescribe anything for anyone until I 'm satisfied that I know what I 'm prescribing for . I can see that you are in a somewhat nervous state ; but I would have to know much P357more than that . If you want me to treat you , I 'll give you an appointment for a thorough examination . Until I 've done that , I ca n't do anything for you . Have you been taking sodium amytal ? Did a physician prescribe it ? " General Beal said : " A flight surgeon in Australia gave me some , when I got out of the Philippines  --  " " What was it ? " Lieutenant Werthauer said , frowning quickly . " This so-called narcosis therapy ? Was it enough to knock you out for twenty-four hours or so ? " " They were little green pills , " General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they did n't knock me out . I 've taken them now and then . He said they were perfectly harm-less . " " That 's one opinion , " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " Been taking it ever since ? " " I told you I 'd taken some now and then . " General Beal looked at him with growing amazement . " What do you mean I do , take drugs ? What  --  " " How do I know ? " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " If it is n't something you 've been taking , what makes you think you want it now ? " " Just a minute ! " General Beal said . " I do n't get this , Lieutenant . I did n't ask you to ask me questions . Stand up ! " Lieutenant Werthauer got without haste to his feet . He fixed his stubborn and baleful eye on the general . " Put down that pen , " General Beal said . " Now , just let me see you come to attention . " " All right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's no good shouting at me , General . I 'm a physician ; and I told you that , until I know what I 'm prescribing for , I do n't write prescriptions . So , if you think you 're now goingto order me to write one  --  " General Beal said : " That will do , Lieutenant . Get out of here ! Go to your quarters and stay there until you hear from me . " Lieutenant Werthauer said : " I 'm on duty this morning . You want nobody to be here ? " " You 'll have to find someone to relieve you , " General Beal P358said . " Get after it ! And if there 's any argument , or any more delay in obeying me , you 'll find yourself in a very serious situation . " He turned and walked out of the room . Lieutenant Werthauer put his papers away and took his cap from the table . At the door , he met Captain Raimondi , who said : " Where are you going ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask , Doctor . I 've just been ordered to my quarters . " " Are you kidding ? " Captain Raimondi said . " Look , I 've got to start my rounds . You ca n't leave  --  " " You 'll have to find somebody else , " Lieutenant Werthauer said . " Mr. Iron Pants does n't like the way I wear my hair . " Looking in vain at the screen before the ward door , Captain Andrews rubbed his finger along his lips and said : " I ought not to be here . It is all crazy . I do n't mean for me , any more than for you . You ought not to be here . It 's different for some people  --  like Clarence . It 's fine for him ; it 's right for him . What has he got to lose ? He gets everything he wants . It all suits him  --  " probably aware that he was becoming incoherent , Captain Andrewsstopped . Nathaniel Hicks remembered unexpectedly Captain Andrews 's expressed convictions , yesterday morning , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ events to happen as they do ; and their exchange , then far from urgent , while they walked across the parking lot behind the Special Projects Building : You can be sure of getting pretty much what you work for . Since when ? Since always . Had Captain Duchemin , then , worked for this state that so well suited him ? Was Captain Andrews getting what he worked for ? Were there , perhaps , temporary wartime restrictions on getting what you worked for ? No . Not if you could face the too-little-faced fact that war really brought you nothing that peace , mere living , could n't eventually bring . The large-scale operation was what impressed you  --  some millions of men receivingat the same time through the same historical events  |p359their  varying allotments of discomfort and disappointment and discouragement ; some hundreds of thousands met occasions to dissolve in unthinkable fear or scream in unthinkable pain ; some tens of thousands got an early death ; but from which of these would a just and lasting peace secure you ? Disappointment ? Fear ? Pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs he has to do suit him . All this about pigeons ! He likes it . He has fun all day long . Of course , you can see that 's what he had all day long in his work , whatever it was , representing those hotels . So , it 's the same to him . Nothing makes any more sense than anything else . Take all those women he has . What does he get from them ? " Most people , when they put a question like that , put it puritanicallyand righteously , with the real idea of directing attention to their own virtuous behavior  --  which , unless it got attention , seemingly did not compensate them for all they feared they were missing . Their offensive low motive asked for an offensivelow reply , an obvious one . Captain Andrews had no such idea . The question indicated only , though it indicated accurately , the nature of his dismay at his own life and times , as today developed them . The pandemonium of these days , the wreckage of sense and order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was nearly death to Katherine . It could not be right . Captain Andrews did not think life ought to be like this ; and Nathaniel Hicks must agree . Though previously persuadedthat so life was , and as a result not now surprised or shocked , Nathaniel Hicks , too , could never think that so it should be . The times , with their premium on Clarence 's fun all day long , were wrong . By " wrong , " Captain Andrews did not mean " wicked " or " sinful " ; he meant ill-advised , ill-considered . What Clarence got , what his lovely little Emerald , what all the others to him just as lovely , sometimes sooner , nearly always later , gave him in long , nuzzling clinches , in an abandonment of rucked-up skirts , in a convulsive fold with lips glued on lips , was not to Captain Andrews 's mind bad or disgusting . How could it be ? How did it really differ from what he got , what Katherine gave him ? But to get it like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any hammock on any porch , on any sofa in any parlor , on any bed in any hotel room , had to mean that that was all you ever got . Such fun all night , like fun all day , precluded the use of reason . You were , to be sure , free of reason'sbonds and responsibilities and obligations . Once free of those , whether you wished to be or not , you were free also of affection and understanding , of trust and devotion . At least , Captain Andrews must see it that way ; and NathanielHicks would again have to agree with him . Presumably , men being men , he must sometimes have thought of being unfaithful to his Katherine ; but Nathaniel Hicks doubted if he ever had been . And for better reasons , surely , than those NathanielHicks thought of when he was talking to Captain Wiley at the Club . Captain Andrews would probably see it as unfaithfulnessnot merely to a person , but to the basic human relation , the vital understanding between human beings . This went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two peopletogether , a solidarity of common interest and common effort  --  thevaluable part of any human relation , the thing that makes it agreeable and good , must be the mutual act of faith and trust : your friend does not hurt or humiliate you . It occurredto Nathaniel Hicks that the fact of physical " unfaithfulness " would never be the thing of moment to the average woman  --  sexual fastidiousness was probably a male concept . It would be , not the fact , but the thought of it , with its implicationsof people knowing , and always somebody must know , if only the man himself and the other woman . That was enough . He had joined with someone else to make a fool of her . And she was right , surely ; and that was no trifle , unless all trust was also a trifle , without security , without confidence , without comfort . Nathaniel Hicks found himself immediately thinking of his own wife , and even pluming himself a little on a continence that , after all , did not come very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Don and Katherine  --  worth in the long run so much . That touching relationship affected him , as he thought of Emily , with a sensation that he did not for a moment recognize . Astounded , he recognized it then as an approach to tears .   " For God 's sake ! " he said to himself . " Buck up ! " He turned his head , his involuntarily reddening face , sharp away , and saw a nurse come out , moving aside and then replacing , the screen across the door of the ward . At Nathaniel Hicks 's first thought , his heart failed him . It would be impossible to support that . If it were that , though he could not go , how could he stay to hear ? He saw then that the nurse had not come to report anything . Her surprised stare made it clear that she did not know anyone was here . She stared , frowning , for a moment ; and then she came right over to them . " It 's against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said briskly . " This is a women 's ward , you know . I think you must have come to the wrong place . Were you looking for someone ? " Captain Andrews got up in a diffident distressed obedience . Nathaniel Hicks got up too , but belligerently . With Captain Andrews too far sunk to fend for himself , Nathaniel Hicks was ready to fend for him . He felt the rise of ire , vigorous and free because it was patently disinterested . To be obdurate , and even to be obstreperous about it , was easier on someone else 's behalf than on one 's own . He said just as briskly : " Are you Lieutenant Shakespeare ? " " Yes , I am , Captain . And you ca n't  --  " Measuring her , Nathaniel Hicks said menacingly : " Do n't you think , Lieutenant , that when you 're on duty it would be a good idea to stick around ? You have n't been near your desk for over half an hour . " The success of this maneuver , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harassed expression , made Nathaniel Hicks ashamed of himself . She said : " I am the only one on duty this morning , sir . I have patients to take care of . Lieutenant Roche is sick this morning . That 's why there 's no one out here . I 'm sorry if you had to wait  --  " Nathaniel Hicks , absorbed in mounting his little counterattack , had observed hardly more than a short figure in a white uniform with a second lieutenant 's bar on the collar . Now heP362observed that Lieutenant Isabella Shakespeare would certainly be called by Captain Wiley a dish of a bitch . Under the cap , her dark thick hair was a mass of curls , the work of nature , not any machine . Her small face , with its brooding , pouting expression had a natural rich color , not from any compact . Though her hands were short and chubby , her figure was very good . She must have heard soulful whistles in her time ; and her body 's air of blood-warm bloom , of endocrine well-being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nathaniel Hicks that Captain Duchemin would be a good man for her to know . He said , still confidently , though he suspected he would now throw away his advantage : " We 're waiting to hear about a patient , the captain 's wife , Mrs. Andrews . The doctor told him to wait . He 's in there with her now . " " Oh , " Lieutenant Shakespeare said ; and Nathaniel Hicks could see he was right , she was much relieved to learn that he was n't someone in authority checking on her . Doubtless she had been in disciplinary trouble before  --  late into Nurses ' Quarters , and so on . The average Chief Nurse would not miss opportunitiesto make her pay for looking like that . She said : " What doctor ? You mean Doctor Werthauer 's case ? Doctor Werthauer left long ago . He would n't have told you to wait here . You must have misunderstood him . " Nathaniel Hicks said : " Doctor Werthauer said to wait ; and he told us where this ward was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you call him and ask him ? Captain Andrews does n't want to go until he hears Mrs. Andrews is all right . " Lieutenant Shakespeare looked at Captain Andrews and maybe the sight touched her . She said : " I 'm not supposed to ; but I can tell you the patient is all right , now . That 's why I was n't able to get out before . Doctor Werthauer wanted her pulse and respiration watched until she became conscious . She 's conscious now ; but of course she must n't be disturbed . It might set her back very badly . She 's in no danger . " Though she said this to Captain Andrews , she must have realized that Nathaniel Hicks was the one who might be in- P363tractable . She took a step close to him and turning from Captain Andrews put , to Nathaniel Hicks 's surprise , her chubby hand pleadingly on his arm . " Now , wo n't you please go ? " she said to him . " There 's a place you can wait over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doctor Werthaueris looking for you there . Doctor Raimondi will be makinghis rounds in a minute , and if he finds you here , Captain , I 'll get into trouble . You do n't want me to get into trouble , do you ? " The gesture could be taken to indicate that Lieutenant Shakespearefound all men alike and knew the way to handle them . Nathaniel Hicks would like to have laughed  --  those wide , meltingeyes ; those parted , and at such close range , moist-looking , lips ; that wealth of curls from which arose a not-unpleasant odor , mixed with traces of perfume and the also not-unpleasant muskiness of her slightly sweating body ! There was something so absurd in the all-out appeal to his senses  --  was he now supposed to stammer , intoxicated : " How 's about a little kiss ? " ; or " Doing anything tonight ? " In this amusement Nathaniel Hicks recovered at once from the disconcerting sensation that had , in fact , passed through him when the hand touched his arm , the damp lips tilted up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not a sensation sorting too well with those chaste reflections of a few minutes back . It might even suggest that there was a basic , objectionabletruth in Lieutenant Shakespeare 's experienced idea of all men , and of their usable , pandemic impulses . CAPTAIN COLLINS 'S mariner and person , which impressed ColonelRoss favorably at Pop 's " conference " yesterday , were the same today . While Colonel Ross listened , he looked at Captain Collins 's amiable , intent face . He liked the intelligent brown eyes gazing , mild and direct , through the horn-rimmed glasses ; the strong frame of the slightly fattened former athlete in un-P364strained repose . Economical , well-ordered , and earnest , Captain Collins 's speech recommended him as much as ever . Colonel Ross thought again : Very good man ; he would get results anywhereyou wanted to use him ; is he wasted as PRO here ? He overstated it a little , emphasizing the favorable estimate to counteract that unreasonable , almost uncontrollable , impatiencehe felt . There was on him the load of Bus 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was somehow to get General Beal through the day with no co-operation from Bus ; nor even , perhaps , from Pop . Pop , if he wanted to , could help little ; but Pop , if he demurred and scrupled , could hinder plenty . Most of what was done might have to be done in front of General Nichols . Colonel Ross did not really know General Nichols . At what point would Bus 's old pal , Jo-Jo , decide that this went too far , and silently transform himself into the eyes and ears of the Chief of Air Staff , of the CG/AAF ? General Nichols would not do it hastily or out of hand  --  that was plain at breakfast . Bus could behave badly , childishly  --  he was n't going to do anything about anything ; no , he would n't go to the parade ; to hell with them all ; to hell with the Army ; he would join the Marines ; and General Nichols listened unmoved . In Bus 's high position , a man had a right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , or even do , foolish , violent , and perhaps shameful things , as long as he did them in a certain way and in the right place ( meaning , in a place where his loyal staff surrounded him so he would not be seen ) . General Nichols , the Chief of Air Staff 's deputy , the eyes and ears of the Commanding General , would see nothing and hear nothing . General Nichols would not have his job if he could not distinguish what signified from what did not signify . Yet , Bus must stop somewhere ; and who but Colonel Ross must decidewhere and , probably , find the means to stop him ? Certainly not Captain Collins . Captain Collins would n't have to do that ; and so Captain Collins , in his earnest concise way , naturally thought that the day 's important business was this of his . Even about that , Captain Collins did not know the half of  |p365it  ; and much of what he did know was wrong . To assist him in self-control , Colonel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wrote : Mr. Willis , and he reflected with irritabilitythat Pop would probably think " Mr. " was going pretty far . This was a colored man . He wrote : lives in Washington : and then , waiter in restaurant . He wrote : Edsell , Special Projects , believed sent money ; and then : story from Lt. Phillips . He could not understand why Pop was so long in calling back  --  God alone knew what the old fool was up to ! He said , more coldly than he intended : " Yes . Well , Captain , you 're mistaken in thinking General Beal does n't know the circumstances of the incident at the Air Base the other night . Your Phillips has it all wrong . The only thing even partly right is that Lieutenant Willis , a colored pilot , was punched in the nose by a white officer . General Beal himself happened to witness it , as I did . It will be taken care of . Racial friction was not involved in any way . Though I think the incident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday . In any event , there would be nothing General Beal could do . I do n't know quite what you thought he could do . You might tell Lieutenant Phillips , who struck me yesterday as a young man who talks too much , to stop spreading that story around . He has invited disciplinary action already ; and I think he would be well advised to watch himself . " Captain Collins colored a little . He said politely , unruffled : " I hope I have n't butted into something that is none of my business , Colonel . I thought you ought to know what Mr. Bullen told me . Lieutenant Phillips 's story , is , at least , the story that seems to be going around ; and , if you saw that Press Associationdispatch this morning , not merely around the Area , here . I thought there was , or might be , a Public Relations angle . I think there still is . Since it did n't happen , the general may want to consider whether it should be denied . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told about it , I thought , again from the Public Relations angle , we ought to give prompt publicity to any action taken against white officers who beat up a colored officer . The general would surely want to use his authority to P366show he and the Army Air Forces do n't countenance things like that . " Perhaps , Colonel Ross thought , he 'd better buzz Pop and find out what Pop was doing . It was almost certain to be foolishand harmful , if it went beyond calling the general . Calling the general could n't have taken all this time  --  he would give Pop three more minutes . He said : " We are a little upset this morning , Captain . Your information is valuable . You did right in bringing it to me at once . About Lieutenant Willis 's father  --  I may want you to help with that , if you will . I am waiting for a call from Colonel Mowbray . Will you wait , too , please ? " " Yes , sir . Colonel , about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel Ross said , frowning . Captain Collins said , " About that investigation you orderedon a possible leak in Headquarters to Mr. Bullen 's paper  --  " " Oh ; yes , yes . Steve said you knew something about it . I'msorry . I forgot . Have you anything definite ? " " I 'm afraid I have , " Captain Collins said . " I 'm afraid I know all about it . It 's from my office . I had a hunch when Mr. Bullen called me this morning . So I investigated at once  --  " Colonel Ross drew two savage lines across the memo sheet . Getting hold of himself , he wrote carefully the name : Caroline Crittenden and then underlined it . He looked at Captain Collins . He supposed his look must have been ominous , for CaptainCollins stumbled over a word . " Go on , go on , " Colonel Ross said . " I do n't quite know what you mean by more or less of an accident . " ' Soon he looked at the clock , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said : " Yes . I see . " The comment might sound weak and indecisive to Captain Collins , a token of uncertain authority and a slow , troublous old mind  --  like Pop 's . Exasperated at the notion of Captain Collins remarking the loosened grip , the poverty of command , P367he said sharply , as if with superior acumen : " You seem greatly disturbed about this , Captain . " " I am , sir , " Captain Collins said . " Just so ! " The swelling irritability filled Colonel Ross 's chest and even his throat , where it duly produced that spiteful bark by which authority , making someone jump , confirms itself . Colonel Ross heard the sound with disrelish ; but he felt the relief it gave , too . " Answer me one question , Captain . This young woman . You do n't happen to be shacking-up with her , or anything , do you ? " He had nonplused Captain Collins , all right . He had that satisfaction , for what it was worth ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like what it cost . He succeeded in blanking Captain Collins by obliging Captain Collins to trade whatever estimate of Colonel Ross he had been forming for a lower one . Captain Collins 's lips parted ; then , quietly , he brought them together and held them closed a moment . He opened them again and said : " No , sir . I do n't happen to be . " Then he said , " I do n't know much about Miss Crittenden 's private life , Colonel ; but I would bet a good deal that she does n't hell around . I do n't think you 'll find anything like that . " " I have no intention of looking , " Colonel Ross said bitterly . An old man 's cruelest loss of face had now to be acknowledgedand the knowledge swallowed . He must  --  what was the phrase ?  --  digest his spleen ! Perhaps to some benefit ; a late lesson ! Captain Collins , half his age , passed him in deportment , in judgment , in show of true experience . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigate her private or love life , if any . It occurred to me that you might have some special reason for going to bat for her . If so , I wanted to know it . That was all . Your private life is your own , too , Captain . " Captain Collins , who must have seen his advantage , made no attempt to use it . He said : " Well , sir , I know what you mean . It could happen , according to all I hear . And I guess you 're right ; I have a special reason , though not quite that special . " Ile smiled pleasantly . " I felt sorry for Caroline , for one thing . It gave her a bad scare , and it seemed to me she had n't meant any harm . She is n't too bright ; but she 's a good girl . And Ip368do n't want to lose her , if I can help it . I 'm the only other person in my office who can type worth a damn ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see myself doing all our typing , in addition to my other duties . " " That is an admissible motive , " Colonel Ross said , the smart in his mind easing . " However , Colonel Howden is conducting this investigation , you know . What do you want me to do ? " Captain Collins said , " It is kind of you to put it that way , Colonel . I want you to let her off , if you will . Though I know it is Counter-Intelligence 's investigation , I understood that you ordered it ; and I hoped if I could get to you before Colonel Howden got to her , and could explain the case satisfactorily , that you 'd give her a break . Colonel Howden , the little I 've seen of him , does n't look too fond of giving people breaks . And anyway , if he wanted to , could he ? I thought you could , sir , if you wanted to  --  I mean , of course , if you felt that you conscientiouslycould , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Colonel Ross . He had been regarding himself this morning as half-helpless , overcharged , with few means given him ; but that view depended on where you sat . Looking from below , Captain Collinssaw him in his kingly state , caparisoned to act for General Beal ; all the paraphernalia of authority at hand . Badly scared , not-too-bright , yet a good girl , Miss Crittenden , with hundreds of other people , waited for his word . At a word from him , Miss Crittenden would weep no more , she could go free and clear . At a different word , if he chose to say it , Miss Crittenden 's case proceeded to the War Department , and from there to the Department of Justice ; and the Federal district attorney was advised to move to indict her . A Federal grand jury , importantly reflecting on catastrophes that resulted ( a million posters told them ) from even a little loose talk , could hardly argue about finding a true bill . Miss Crittendenwould stand her trial . What the trial jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crittenden . Though she had n't ought to have told , still she only told her Daddy . Mr. Bullen and his political friends would have retained the right lawyer , someoneP369to show a Florida jury that the real issue was whether or not they wanted a new carpetbagging era . Was the Yankee government to have their help in hounding a pure young Southern girl to ruin and disgrace ? After many months of cruel anxiety and humiliating public exposure , Miss Crittenden might hope to be declared not guilty . Colonel Ross tore the sheet with Miss Crittenden 's name on it from the memo pad . He said to Captain Collins , " Of course , this must stop . If it does n't  --  " " Yes , sir . If it does n't , I will gladly take the rap . " " You can do that , " Colonel Ross said , " but unfortunately , not until I have taken it first . Bear that in mind . I wo n't take it gladly , either . " He tossed the crumpled sheet into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I very much appreciate your kindness  --  " Colonel Ross said : " Collins , that is a highly improper remark . Withdraw it . The matter is in my discretion and for reasonsI find good and sufficient , I have disposed of it . Unless you think you have influenced me improperly , by fear or favor , what are you thanking me for ? " " I was thanking you for letting me present my version of it , sir . " Colonel Ross said , laughing , " Do you like your job , Collins ? " Captain Collins hesitated . " I do n't suppose anyone likes beinga flexible gunner , either . Us ; you fight it , as they say , and we 'll write it ! There is n't much to do , really . I have two assistants , and any one of us could handle it . You pass things out pursuant to the latest poop from Washington ; and maybe arrange a tour of the installations for the Combined Committee on Something or Other . I do n't really mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with it ; but when you 've done it you have n't done anything . But I would be a liar if 1 said I wished I were out being shot at somewhere ; and maybe I never had it so good . " Colonel Ross said : " This office is getting a new table of organization . I have Major Hill  --  he 's at Boca Negra this week  --  on technical inspection ; and he needs an assistant . I take careP370of administrative with Sergeant Brooks . We just barely manage that : and we really do n't manage all the other things . I 'm arrangingto have an executive officer . He would n't have to do anything about the inspection end of it ; but people come fin  --  like you , for instance . I need somebody here ; so if the general has me over at his office , or I 'm out on inspections , everything does n't stop . " Captain Collins looked at him alertly . " The T/O would call for a lieutenant colonel ; but we could get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it interest you , Captain. ? " " Yes , " Captain Collins said . " I 'm sorry I 'm not a major , sir . " " It is a matter of judgment , " Colonel Ross said . " If somebodycame in and told you the story about the colored officer , or about your girl , you 'd have to decide what to say to him , and what to tell me . There would be things you could handle yourself , and things that you would have to clear with me . Would you like to try ? " " Very much , sir . However , I do n't know about the rank , sir . I have only been in grade six months . If I have to be a major  --  " " Yes , you 'd better be a major , " Colonel Ross said . " You need the rank to do the job . It wo n't be necessary for you to have your time in grade . We 'll take care of that right away . " He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his desk . SergeantBrooks opened the door and looked in . " Steve , " he said , " call Colonel Ehret 's office and ask them to add to the next Special Orders : Captain Collins , Public Relations , relieved from assignment and duty effective Monday , and assigned to us . " " Yes , sir . " " There you are , Collins , " Colonel Ross said . " I think we can get your promotion next week . " The warm feeling which came from power to arrange so quickly a considerable favor for somebody else , which was also reasonably sure to be a good stroke of business for himself , lasted him , Colonel Ross supposed , half a minute . In this life , you succeeded when you were young because you never risked letting anyone do anything for you ; and when you were old P371you succeeded , if you did , because you never risked doing yourself what you could pick someone to do for you . Captain Collins showed signs that his equanimity was shaken , though not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuttereda little . " That was quick , sir ! " he said , and laughed . " Well , I will certainly try to  --  I hope I can  --  " Interrupting him , Colonel Ross said : " Unless , of course , an ax drops on us suddenly  --  " The telephone rang . On the line , Mrs. Eliot 's voice said : " Colonel Mowbray callingyou , judge . " Colonel Ross was conscious of a sinking sensation . He said : " Where is he calling from , do you know ? " " His office , I think , sir . His girl is on the line . " " Well , what 's wrong with the box ? " Colonel Ross said . " All right ; let 's have it " He could hear Mrs. Eliot saying : " I have Colonel Ross  --  " There was a pause and Pop 's voice said cautiously : " That you , Norm ? That you ? " " Yes , it is . " " Look , I did n't call before because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my office . I 'm using Botty 's phone , see ? I did n't know they were coming . They went out to the Base to see that P-47 with the you-know  --  " " Yes , I know , " Colonel Ross said . The you-know was a specialsmall radar unit installed in the plane 's tail which beamed its impulses through the whole rear quadrant . If anything approachedwithin three hundred yards of the plane a warning signal lit up on the instrument panel , or at least it did sometimes . General Nichols tactfully expressed a wish to see it , so that Bus would be free to go to his office and get on with his work this morning . " I know , I know , " he repeated . " Well , look , Norm . Nobody knows where he is . " " Where who is ? " Colonel Ross said automatically ; but he knew who , before he finished saying it . " Bus , " whispered Colonel Mowbray . " He told Vera he was going over to the Base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Day for Major McCreery . He did n't stay there . Nobody knows where he went then . " " Did you call his car ? " " Yes . Picked it up on the way back here . The driver said the general had told him not to wait . " " Did you check at Operations ? " " No . " " Well , better do it . He may have gone flying . See where that AT-7 and Sergeant Pellerino are . " " But he could n't do that , Norm ! He has Jo-Jo here ; and  --  " " I do n't know who could stop him . " " Well , what are we going to do ? Jo-Jo 'll know there 's something wrong in a minute . Look at the mess here ! Bus ca n't walk out on that . " Colonel Ross said stoically , " I told you before . We will just have to go ahead as if he were here . Did you send that car ? " " Car ? Car ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better come over . " " Yes . Look , Norm . 1 had to tell Jo-Jo about Benny 's trouble . He came in wanting to find that Negro . You know , about the medal . I could n't stall him off ; I had to say where the man was . I do n't know whether Bus wanted it that way , or not . But what else could I do ? " " Nothing else . Bus will have to want it the way we do it . Did you tell General Nichols that you did n't know where Bus was ? " " Of course not ! That 's what I do n't want him to know . We have to find Bus . We have to get him back here . We have to do something . " " Let 's begin by keeping our shirts on , Pop , " Colonel Ross said heavily . " You better get back to Nichols and Baxter . I will see what I can find out from Operations ; and we can try to reach the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . It will take some time . " He hung up and said to Captain Collins : " Are you free for the next half hour or so ? " " Yes , sir . " " My car , and the driver , are by the side door . Take it . Go P373down to the railroad station and meet Lieutenant Willis 's father .. Bring him to the Hospital , and wait with him until I get over . If there is any question at any point , you are acting on GeneralBeal 's orders . You can tell Mr. Willis that his son is all right . 1 know they were preparing to discharge him from the Hospital this morning , so he must be , more or less . It is being arranged for them to see each other . That is all the information you have . Can you handle that ? " " Yes , sir . " Colonel Ross felt a faint disgusted pity for those two upset old men  --  himself , and Pop . Though Colonel Ross had a pooropinion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything or nothing could throw Pop into a spasm of agitation , the pathetic pitch of this spasm might actually have areasonable and adequate basis . Pop bhad the advantage of himhere in information and experience . Colonel Ross , in many senses an old Army man himself , was nevertheless once and for all excluded from the inner circle and its sacred and unfailing bond . That mystic order , the West Point Benevolent and Protective Association , included Pop . Pop was a proficient in its neverwrittenconstitution and by-laws , in its precedents and procedures . Colonel Ross could only guess , from an outsider 's incompleteview of some of the Association 's past workings , at the admissible latitudes , and at the fixed limits  --  how far and in what directions its compassionate indulgence and long-sufferinglove would reach ; how shortly and how arbitrarily both could end . Pop exactly apprehended both . He would not be confused by the occasional apparent paradoxes and inequitabilities . The principles were imbued in his mind . fColonel Ross was sure these principles were few and simple . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things if you just do n't say anything about them ; you can say certain things if you just do n't do anything about them . Thus , Nichols and Baxter , Association members in good standing , thought nothing of Bus 's outbreak at the breakfast table about turning in his P374suit  --  this language of sports or the locker-room was significant . It declared a whole ethos or set of attitudes . On , brave old Army team ! Could a member of that team ever , by his own disgruntled choice , make the slightest actual move to leave the field and go to the showers ? Obviously , no ! That was unthinkable . That was not the good old Army way at all . That , or anything remotely like that , seen or even suspected , was beyondcompassion and would not be suffered long . Colonel Ross was ready to believe that Pop , the old fool , in this one matter , acute and right , knew that Bus was near the invisible edge , that the unthinkable opened only a step away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not care where he was going . Pop would know too what it meant , in terms of the whole long life , the whole career , the years of care and denial and disciplined patience at last rewarded , and all , in a moment , thrown away  --  why did n't you do it twenty years ago if you had to , when it would hardly matter to Pop or to you ? Colonel Mowbray said : " Now , I do n't want you to think we were holding out on you , Jo-Jo . It was n't that at all . This young man here "  --  he shot a look at Benny  --  " lost his temper . He admits it . He 's sorry . He 's ready to go right now and apologize to Lieutenant Willis . We feel , and he feels , that he may deserve some other punishment , too . Company punishment , I mean . Now , Bus did talk about court martial  --  " Colonel Mowbray got up and began to ramble around the room at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all the tip-off General Nichols could possibly need . " But I know why he did that , " Colonel Mowbray said . " He wanted Benny , here , to realize fully the seriousness of what his temper had made him do . That 's why Bus had charges drawn , ready to be preferred . But I do n't think he ever meant to preferthem . I do n't know whether you know Colonel Carricker 's record . I do n't think there 's a fighter pilot in the service with a better one . In my opinion , a man who has been cited twice for the Distinguished Service Cross ought n't to be court-martialed P375which , if they convicted him , would just about have to mean dismissal from the service . Not unless he was known to be guilty of some serious dereliction of duty , some disgraceful criminal offense . I know that 's what Bus feels . You feel that too , do n't you , Norm ? " Colonel Ross 's first impulse had been to interrupt Pop , cut off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to say . However , he did not think Pop would be physicallyor mentally able to keep still ; and it might be better to let him talk himself out on Benny . Colonel Ross simply nodded in answer . He looked at Benny . Benny sat red-faced and stolid , gazing straight in front of him at a large aerial photograph of Maxwell Field framed on the far wall . He showed no reaction either to Pop 's declaration of how bad he had been , or of how good he was . It occurred to Colonel Ross that Benny was not listening , not hearing any of this . This was more of the crap he had to go through ; so he shut his mind and waited for it to be over . General Baxter showed embarrassment  --  this was none of his business , really . He had time to put in before he flew to Sellers Field , so he tagged along with General Nichols , who also had time to put in while Bus was busy with his regular duties . Baxterdid not like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sort of court of appeal to hear what was strictly Bus 's affair  --  disciplinary action involving a member of Bus 's command . GeneralBaxter cleared his throat . With the plain idea of keeping things on the basis of a discussion of theory , not of actual cases , not of this case of Bus 's , he said unctuously : " I believe you 're quite right there , Pop . Unless a commissioned officer 's conduct should warrant or require dismissal from the service , he ought not to be court-martialed . That 's our line . Of course , the Manual for Courts Martial defines offenses that require court martial . If I recall , assault not with a dangerous weapon is n't included in the mandatory paragraph . " He turned courteously to Colonel Ross . " Would that be your recollection , Colonel ? " Colonel Ross said : " That is right , General . " " Yes , " said General Nichols , who must have decided , not to Colonel Ross 's surprise , that the real point ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
