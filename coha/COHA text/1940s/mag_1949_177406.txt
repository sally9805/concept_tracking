In Boston 's Hotel Statler this week , newsmen watched swarthy Inventor August S. Torres , 45 , dump a sack of green coffee beans into a machine which looked something like a soft-drink dispenser . Torres pushed a button , and one minute later the machine poured out a pound of fresh-roasted coffee , ready for grinding . <P> Torres , who grew up on a coffee plantation in his native Colombia , knew that fresh-roasted coffee was far superior to any other . After twelve years ' work , he found a way to roast it quickly by infrared rays . He got Boston 's New Enterprises , Inc. ( a venture capital group which finances new inventions ) , to back him in manufacturing his machine . This week his Infra Roast , Inc. was planning to open a chain of shops where infra-roasted coffee will be sold by the cup and by the bag .
