txt American trade unionists are about to find out whether they won or lost the November presidential election . The House of Repr6sentatives , with a Democratic majority , takes up this week the explosive bill to weal the Taft-Hartley Labor Act . Like a Christmas present that has not been unwrapped for five months , organized labor is waiting to see whether the " gift " now to be disclosed is to its liking or should be thrown out with loathing . The battle now opening brings President Truman to the heart of his real legislative program . Those coming up now are ones on which he campaigned and won election . The House already has passed every major appropriation bill in unprecedented time and with this routine business out of the way from now on the big . controversial social , labor , and foreign aid bills will come up , one after another , till recess . Senate Behind The talk-bound Senate is way behind schedule , but will also take up an important adthinistration bill this week , one giving $300 , - 000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It passed the Senate last year , 58 to 22 , but like so much similar administration legislation in the 80th Congress was smothered in House committee . After a 10-day Easter vacation , in which trade unions have done their utmost in home constituencies ? to impress congressmen , the House comes back to Washington to ? decide on the merits of two rival labor bills . Ostensibly they both repeal the Taft-Hartley Act . Actually the administration measure , introduced by Representative John Lesinski ( D ) of , Michigan . Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee , returns the nation to the old Wagner Act . Curious Conditions As against this , the bill offered by Representative John S. Wood ( D ) of Georgia , is the rallying ground for Republicans and conservative southern Democrats . On paper it would repeal the Taft-Hartley AO , but it would retain many of its provisions and trade-union leaders call it as bad or worse than the original . The fight is between these two bills . The battle is fought under curious circumstances . A majority of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of last June 20 . In a summernight radio appeal , Mr. Truman called the measure " a shocking piece of legislation " which was ? " bad for labor , bad for management and bad for the country . " Thereupon the GOP house over ; ruled him , 331 to 83 ; . the Senate 68 to 25 . Mr. Truman then went out and won a surprise election victory in which trade unionists played the most active role in history . They probably were decisive in defeating Senator Joseph H. Ball ( R ) of Minnesota , the lieutenant of senator Robert A. Taft ( R ) of Ohio in writing the Taft-Hartley Act . For the future , incidentally , unions ' guns are turned against Senator Taft himself in his Ohio election campaign next year , which promises to be the big battle of 1950 . Vital Issue The test over the labor act involves the issue of whether Mr Truman 's nominal Democratic majority in the Senate and House is real in the sense of enabling him to deliver his campaign promises or symbolic because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under an " open rule , " with no limit to the number of amendment ? that may be offered . Any member may speak on any amendment five minutes , and oratory of a passionate order is expected . House action should be concluded this week . The Senate , under its unlimited debate , perhaps will reach it by mid-May . It is impossible to forecast the outcome now , but these points are indicated : the administration will have an easier time in the House , where all members went through the election wringer last November , than in the Senate . Both sides already have made concessions to win the nip-andtuck House battle , with the Wood forces yielding to increase votes , the Lesinski group now tending to follow the same course . It is probable the Senate version will differ markedly from the House version , with stiffer provisions against trade unionists . Thus it seems likely that the real and final measure will be written in conferences between House and Senate when the time comes to reconcile differences . Outcome in Doubt It may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say with accuracy who won , for the compromise will be the highest common denominator that can squeeze through all of the violent factions now exerting pressure .
