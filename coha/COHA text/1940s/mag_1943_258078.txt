Whatever Franklin Roosevelt or Winston Churchill said-or did not say-the real story of their meeting in Quebec 's Citadel would be acted out step by step , in the answers by action to these questions : <P> &gt;How soon will the " second front , " infection center of ill-will between the English-speaking Allies and Russia ( see p 23 ) , be established in Western Europe ? <P> &gt;How soon will the Allies get decisive help to China for the war against Japan ? <P> &gt;Will the U.S. , Britain , China and Russia learn to live together as great powers must-now and after World War II ends ? <P> If Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill found the right answers , Quebec 's Citadel , where the end of New France was once written by the great Wolfe , may again become a landmark of history . If they did not , their conference may some day be known as the most tragic failure of World War II . <P> Pressure of Victories . Roosevelt and Churchill worked under great pressure . The rapid pace of military @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Germans backed up toward Italy 's Po River , bombers continued their spectacular successes in softening up - Western Europe , the Russians recaptured Kharkov , U.S. air power forced the last Japanese out of the Aleutians . Victory was now certain-and , in Europe , perhaps near . The political pressure was equally tense . The worries of Europe 's little people , now that victory could be foreseen , demanded a firm policy toward the postwar government of Germany , Italy , Poland , the other occupied nations . And over the conference hung the huge , dark shadow of a distrustful Russia . <P> At week 's end , timed like an explosion , came a Moscow announcement that Maxim Litvinoff , great &; good friend of collaboration , had been removed as Russian Ambassador to the U.S. and an unknown diplomat , Charge d'Affaires Andrei A. Gromyko , given his place . There was other strong evidence that Russia was retreating-or bluffing a retreat-into nationalistic lone-wolfing , perhaps even a separate peace . <P> Pressure of Possibilities . The time called for long-range policy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Their previous meetings have followed the pattern set in their first war council in the North Atlantic , when the U.S. was not yet in the war , Britain had yet to win her first victory and the atmosphere was as heavy with ifs and buts as the Atlantic fog that surrounded them . <P> Did Quebec change the pattern ? There were a few hopeful signs , mostly on the military side . Great strategic decisions were obviously made . The baronial , turreted pile of the Chateau Frontenac , famed old Quebec hotel where conference advisers lived , was so full of gold braid that the eyes of bellhops and chambermaids were dazzled . Rumor said that colonels were sleeping two to a room . <P> To the Citadel itself , the grim grey fortress where Roosevelt and Churchill lived and worked on the Plains of Abraham 300 ft. above the broad St. Lawrence River , went China 's earnest Foreign Affairs Minister T. V. Soong-a hint that real action might be on its way in the Far East .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
