Boeuf a la tartare is what fancy restaurants call raw hamburger . Some people like it that way . Some people distrust all this " processing " of news described above . They want their facts raw . <P> A student asked the late great **25;10969;TOOLONG Alfred North Whitehead : " What 's more important , ideas or things ' ? " Said Whitehead : " Why , I should imagine ideas about things . " Deeply imbedded in U.S. education is a contrary attitude : ideas are not trustworthy ; facts , especially " all the facts , " are . Have the hairy-chested factual gourmands who think they want all the facts ever faced a real plateful of them ? <P> " All the facts " about the simplest news event-say , an automobile accident-would ( if anybody were fool enough to collect them ) fill a library : the metallurgical engineer 's report , the traffic expert 's report , the highway engineer 's report , the psychiatrist 's report , the oculist 's report , etc. - and they would contradict each other . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the devaluation of the franc , are infinite ; they ca n't be assembled and could not be understood if they were . The shortest or the longest news story is the result of selection . The selection is not , and can not be , " scientific " or " objective . " It is made by human beings who bring to the job their own personal experience and education , their own values . They make statements about facts . Those statements , invariably , involve ideas . <P> All journalists ( even the women at the well ) select facts . The myth , or fad , of " objectivity " tends to conceal the selection , to kid the reader into a belief that he is being informed by an agency above human frailty or human interest . <P> The myth of " objective journalism " reached its height about 1938-39 , before the Hitler-Stalin pact , before the sharp cleavage of war reminded the Western world that the famed " two sides of a question " are not always , or even often , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , TIME departed from the principle of its prospectus , and announced that it was practicing " objective " and " scientific " journalism . It was n't . It never will . Nor will anybody else . <P> TIME in the 19303 was reporting the facts about Germany , for example , in a way that clearly showed TIME 'S working hypothesis : that the Nazi Party was very bad medicine . It reports the Communist Party today against the background of a similar hypothesis . The five or six editors and correspondents most directly concerned with Britain approach that subject with very different emotional attitudes ; they meet at present on the following working hypothesis : Britain is in a bad way , and may well be in a worse one a year hence ; but all we know about that country leads us to believe that it will somehow come through . <P> TIME 'S prospectus promised that " no article would be written to prove any special case . " It tries hard to keep that promise , while standing on another statement in the prospectus : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions and important news is probably as undesirable as it is impossible , and are therefore ready to acknowledge certain prejudices which may in varying measure predetermine their opinions on the news . " <P> Among the prejudices acknowledged were :
