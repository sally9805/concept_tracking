txt For ninety minutes this morning Adolf Hitler addressed workers of Germany gathered before radios at their places of work throughout the Reich . And when he had concluded his remarks the inescapable conclusion was that , in the opinion of the supreme leader of the German Reich , the only possible end to the present conflict between democratic capitalism and totalitarian " socialism " by the very nature of the struggle would have to be found in the vanquishment of one of the contending systems . Herr Hitler spoke over a national hook-up from the assembly hall of the Rheinmeta/1 Brosig munitions plant in a northern suburb of Berlin . He was surrounded by cannon in various stages of completion , and he faced that factory 's 12,000 armament workers . He spoke in moderate tones and avoided any reference to whatever political or military plans his government might have in preparation . Viewed in their entirety , Herr Hitler 's noonday remarks to his followers seem to have been designed chiefly for home consumption . For he placed the greatest emphasis upon benefits that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which he is the champion . At the same time he delivered a frontal attack on the faults that , he asserted , were inherent in the system represented and practiced by the Western democracies . As outlined by Herr Hitler today , democracy is synonymous with // HITLER CHALLENGES WORLD DEMOCRACY // oligarchy . Of Britain and America , he declared : " The people are not the focal point of consideration . Of decisive importance is the existence of a few hundred gigantic capitalists who are in possession of their factories and their stocks and wii-o in the final analysis thus steer the people . The broad masses do not interest them in the least or , at most , only in times of election . Otherwise , the life of the broad masses is a matter of complete indifference to them . " On the other hand , Herr Hitler asserted the National Socialist State labored for the best interest of all classes and that birth was no longer of any importance in ascending the highest positions in the Reich hierarchy . Using himself as example he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am not even a lawyer , yet I am nevertheless your Fuehrer . " The highest places in the government , he added , are occupied by men who once were workers , and he said that in the army there were now thousands of officers who had risen from the ranks . " We know exactly , " Herr Hitler declared , " that if we are defeated in this battle it is the end . Not just of our socialistic work of construction , but the end of the German people . " At the same time the Reichsfuehrer said he well understood that the leaders of the democratic capitalistic system foresaw the end of their system should the idea that inspired the Third Reich prove victorious in the war now being waged . " We find ourselves in the midst of a conflict in which more is at stake than the victory of one or another land , " he declared . " It is truly a battle of two worlds against each other . " " Stand Against the World " " In this struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the representative of the have-nots . I have never recognized the legal claims of others to that which they stole by force . In no case can I allow the justification of those legal claims for what has been taken from us " " There are two worlds that stand opposed to each other , " Herr Hitler stated at another point . " Others are correct when they say : With this world we can not ever reconcile ourselves . " They fight for the preservation of the gold standard , for example , he added , continuing : " I understand that , for they have the gold . Our gold was plundered and extorted from us . " German productive power is our gold , our capital , and with this gold I can beat any other power in the world . " A , translation of Herr Hitler 's speech transmitted from Berlin by The Associated Press gave this passage in the following language : " Our capacity for work is our gold , our capital , and with it we will defeat the entire world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the United Press , gave the passage as it appears in THE NEW YORK TIMES dispatch . In opposition to " our social system . where every position will be filled by the most competent son , " Herr Hitler asserted , " stands another structure , another world , where the last ideal is always to battle for wealth and for capital , a battle for the egoism of the inditvidual . " Furthermore , Hitler said : " The other world says : " If we lose , our capitalistic world building breaks down . Then we have bought gold without purpose . Our entire claim to world domination can not be maintained if these peoples do away with the money dynasties . They will then come with social demands . A collapse will follow . " And I understand , therefore , when they say : ' We want to prevent that under all circumstances . ' " Those are two worlds . I believe that one of the two worlds must break in pieces . If we collapse the German people will also collapse . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world will only then be free . " Did n't Want to Arm , He Says Germany did not want to rearm , Herr Hitler told his nationwide audience , because " that devours so much productive power . " " I wanted to employ German productive power for other plans , " he said . " I have the ambition to make the German people rich and Germany beautiful . I want the living standard of the individual to be raised . I want us to have the most beautiful and the best culture . I want the theatre and German culture to be for the benefit cf the entire people and not only the upper 10,000 , as in England . " Those are the stupendous plans for which I needed productive power . Armament only took workers away from me . " Therefore , Herr Hitler declared , he made a proposal that certain armaments be curtailed , that airplanes be removed from war and that bombs be curtailed , out all these proposals , he said , had successively been declined by the other side . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the task of rearming with " fanaticism . " The result , he added , was that Germany now had so much ammunition that " as the battle came to an end we had employed in all fields hardly a month 's ration of our production . " " Today , " he went on , " we are armed for every eventuality . England can do what she will . Every week she will receive heavier blows , and if she should set foot anywhere on the continent again then we will introduce ourselves . " There is no power in the world , the Reichsfuehrer asserted , that will be able " against our will " to remove Germans from the territory they now occupy in the West . As regards aerial warfare Herr Hitler asserted that he had waited three months after the conclusion of the campaign against the French for the British to desist from their " unrestricted air war at night " against the Reich . Not a single armament plant has been forced to shut down as a result of British raids , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So , Herr con-tinued : " I could no longer be responsible before the German people for letting my own national comrades die while sparing strangers . This war has also to be waged , and it is now being waged . It will be waged with determination with the material , with the means and the bravery that are at our disposal . " Germany will determine the hour of decision , Herr Hitler asserted . In such matters , however , he added , he was careful : " We are so , as a matter of course , convinced of the success of our weapons , " the Reichsfuehrer declared , " that we can allow ourselves that . The German people will be able to wait . I believe the German people will be thankful to me when I preferably and frequently wait a bit , with time therewith to spare many sacrifices . " The Reich does not want any " prestige successes , " he declared , but allows itself to be led only by military considerations . " What must happen must happen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to prevent . In addition , we all have the hope that the hour will one day come in which reason again will be victorious and peace will come . " Throughout his speech Herr Hitler emphasized the conviction that Germany would be victorious . But vic
