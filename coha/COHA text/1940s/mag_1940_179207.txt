Every year more artists go to U. S. colleges , hired sometimes as teachers , sometimes just to paint while students watch . This fall sees a new crop of artists going to college . Some universities , like Iowa with Grant Wood . Wisconsin with John Steuart Curry , have put their painters on the payroll . Others beg for them , as they might beg for cinema projectors or laboratory equipment , from Carnegie Foundation . Since 1938 this organization has supplied a dozen artists in residence , with an average $1,500 for their keep , to colleges which it prefers to be smallish , inland . The lot which Carnegie doled out this year includes : one slightly shopworn illustrator , John Held Jr. , to the University of Georgia ; one up- &-coming; muralist , Philip Evergood , to Kalamazoo College . A crack portraitist , Robert Philipp , goes to the University of Illinois on a $4,000 Rotating Professorship succeeding Dale Nichols ( TIME , Sept. 18 , 1939 ) . The Foundation turned down Pennsylvania State College when they asked for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished a mural commissioned by the college ( TIME , June 3 ) . <P> To the University of Kansas City goes Spaniard Luis Quintanilla , able draughtsman and muralist , to start the first university school of fresco painting in the U. S. Artist Quintanilla will have 40 to 50 pupils , who will help him paint , on wet plaster in the Liberal Arts Building Auditorium , a real fresco , possibly of Don Quixote in a modern setting . <P> Most important change in artists is at the University of Iowa , where Grant Wood has long carried a heavy teaching schedule , and loved it . But for an artist who can command $10,000 a canvas ( price of Parson Weems ' Fable and Sentimental Ballad ) , teaching at $4,000 a year is a definite sacrifice . Moreover Artist Wood paints slowly , fussing , niggling , spreading glaze after glaze to achieve the hard candylike effect that is his specialty . After a period of financial and marital difficulties ( he has been divorced ) , Grant Wood resolved to take a year off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was producing once more , had enjoyed doing a portrait of his old Iowa friend , Henry Wallace , for TIME ( see cover ) . His first one-man show in six years is scheduled for next March . <P> Grant Wood 's successor as mentor to young lowans is a youngish ( 36 ) , tough-looking , tough-talking , tough-painting , handle-bar-mustached artist , Fletcher Martin . A husky onetime sailor and boxer , Martin is largely self-taught . His first oils and water colors , shown in San Diego in 1934 , were done in his spare time as a printing pressman . The gobs and prize fighters Fletcher Martin used to sketch still flex their heavy muscles in his canvases ; his Trouble in Frisco-sailors slugging , seen through a porthole-is owned by Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art .
