Peewee Maloney is a little trick with a turned-up nose , brown hair and wide smile - neat and cute as a .22 bullet . Back home in Rochester , N.Y. , she had been cashier in a cafeteria , until she persuaded the Army to make an exception to its 5-ft. rule and let her in the WAC , all 4 ft. 11 in. of her . As Private Margaret H. Maloney she was soon stationed in North Africa . <P> One morning Peewee was acting as supply sergeant for her company when Private Kenny Jacobs came into the WAC 's kitchen . Helpfully he poured some gasoline into the stove to prime it , splashed some on his clothes , set himself afire and collapsed in a mass of flames . Peewee threw herself on him , smothered the fire with her body , beat it out with her bare hands . Private Jacobs was carried off to the hospital , lucky to be alive ; Peewee was carried off with him , for treatment of burns on her face and legs . <P> Last week while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platoons of WACs marched and wheeled and stood at at tention , a trembling Peewee did a front and center , stood alone . The adjutant read a citation : " For outstanding heroism and self-sacrifice , " from General Dwight Eisenhower . On her O.D. blouse Major General E.S . Hughes pinned the first Soldier 's medal awarded a WAC . Then , though the regulations do not prescribe it , towering General Hughes unbent in the middle , leaned down and planted a kiss on the glowing cheek of Private Maloney.
