The voice was like a voice of doom . It was the voice of Dr. Hubertus Johannes van Mook , Lieutenant Governor General of The Netherlands East Indies : <P> It is not that dozens of battleships , scores of cruisers and thousands of planes are needed . . . . It is only a question of hundreds more of planes and a few tens of thousands of men . . . . The reinforcements need not be tremendous , but must come continuously and there must be an end of wavering uncertainty which wastes time and weakens morale . <P> When Dr. van Mook spoke last week in Batavia , it was late in the game for Java , the Indies and the Far Pacific . It was terribly late for the Indies ' " Strong Man " to have to speak of wavering uncertainty among his allies . Within a week the Japanese broke through Java 's naval line ( see p. 18 ) and set their scores of thousands of invaders upon Java 's shores before the few hundred planes , the needed thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to Java , and it would be won or lost with what Java had in the air and on the ground when Hubertus van Mook cried to Washington . <P> The Prong . The Japanese chose their first landings well ( see map ) : near Serang in the west , a hop &; skip across the Sunda Strait from invaded Sumatra ; on the broad , open coasts of Indramayu Bay , 160 miles eastward from Serang ; at Rembang , another 225 miles to the east . Thus the Jap with three strokes sliced up the northern Javanese coast , flanked the capital of Batavia , the Army 's mountain fortress at Bandung and Java 's chief naval base at Surabaya . <P> That was the Japanese plan . Its execution would not be so simple . The Dutch had a mobile Army of perhaps 50,000 well-armed white and brown troops , 50 , - ooo not so well armed . " Some thousands " of Australian , British and U.S. soldiers were on the island , and probably were held for last-ditch shock attack . Short of artillery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch , U.S. , British , Swedish , German and Italian rifles , pistols and machine guns , the Dutch ordnance men had made much out of little . They juggled rifle parts to fit their ammunition supply . For armored cars , they walled trucks with double sheets of boiler plate . The first layer took the zing out of armor-piercing bullets , the second stopped them . The improvised cars with their mounted machine guns roared over the narrow , metalized Java highways , barking at advance parties of Jap bicyclists and rushing defenders to threatened points . <P> In the mountainous interior , the Dutch had planted explosives in the sides of every pass , every cut through which key highways and railways threaded . Successively , as the invader advanced , Java 's arteries could thus be blocked to anything on wheels . Mined passes commanded every approach to the Bandung fortress , and at the worst Java 's Army was prepared to withstand a siege there comparable to Douglas MacArthur 's on Bataan. - Dutch , British and U.S. aircraft rose incessantly from interior airdromes , met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , returned , reloaded and refueled , took off again . Pilots who had planes shot from under them parachuted down . Then they chafed and groaned because there were no more planes for them to take up .
