txt WASHINGTON , Aug. 26 ? Photostatic copies of two letters said by Soviet Russia to have been written by Mrs , Oksana Stepanovna Kasenkina will be transmitted by the State Department to the New York police so that the refugee school teacher may have a chance to pass on their authenticity . This was announced today by Michael J. , special assistant in charge of press relations for the State Department .

Further , he said , the State Department had for some time tentatively considered shutting the United States consulate at Vladivostok . The Kasenkina letters were handed to the State Department Tuesday night , with the note in which the U.S.S.R. rejected this country 's statements regarding the // school teachers , Mrs. Kasenkina and Mikhail Samarin , and announced it would close its consulates in New York and San Francisco .

Officials at the department did not undertake to direct the New York police to give Mrs. Kasenkina an opportunity for acknowledge ' or repudiation of the letters .
