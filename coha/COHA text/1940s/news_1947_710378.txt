txt Discrimination Against Foreigners SHANKAR LAL SEN. pg . 24 Letters to The Times - - Discrimination Against Foreigners To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I am a student from India studying at Columbia University for the past two years . During that time I have had occasion to meet Americans of various states , races and creeds . Recent news about India in American newspapers has given publicity to the famous , or should I say " infamous , " caste system prevalent there . But I was not expecting to come into contact with the sane pernicious system in this great " arsenal of democracy . " For the past month I have been trying to find an apartment for my mother and sister , who have just arrived from India . Although amiliar with the sentiments prevailing among a majority err Americans toward their fellow-Americans of different pigmentations aria religious affiliations , I was totally unprepared to be told by various apartment house superintendents , " We do not rent our apartments to foreigners , and particularly to colored foreigners . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is an illusion on my part , but the illusion was painfully realistic to me . I am sure that this illusion , held by many persons like my self , can be dispelled in some measure by giving this letter publicity on your editorial page so that discerning Arrierjeans may realiza the truth and really build good-will instead of talking about it . SHANKAR LAL SEN . New York , May 5 , 1947.
