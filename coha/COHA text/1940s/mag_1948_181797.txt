During the war , 36 conscientious objectors volunteered as guinea pigs for experiments in human starvation . In the current Journal of Clinical Psychology , the results are reported by the researchers ( Drs . Joseph C. Franklin , Burtrum C. Schiele , Josef Brozek , Ancel Keys ) who conducted the experiments at the University of Minnesota 's laboratory of physiological hygiene . <P> The volunteers were prepared for semi-starvation by three months ' good eating with a daily average of 3,492*calories . Then for six months they were fed two carefully rationed meals a day totaling 1,570 calories . Sample meals : pancakes , syrup , applesauce , cornbread and jam in the morning ; potato soup , stew and potatoes in the evening . <P> Although they knew that nobody would try to shove them aside , the hungry men began taking great care to guard their places in the chow line .

During the first three months of rehabilitation their bad table manners and bad study habits showed little improvement ; some men actually became more depressed and irritable than during semi-starvation . As the effects of starvation wore off , each man lost his sense of close identity with his group and began worrying about his own personal plans for a normal future . <P> <P> *Present daily average in Britain , 2,700 calories ; in Germany , around 1,550 calories .
