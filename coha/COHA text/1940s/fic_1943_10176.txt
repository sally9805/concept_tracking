CAME HOME AND HE AND FRANCIE WERE SENTout for the week-end meat . This was an important ritual and called for detailed instructions by mama . " Get a five-cent soup bone off of Hassler 's . But do n't get the chopped meat there . Go to Werner 's for that . Get round steak chopped , ten cents worth , and do n't let him give it to you off the plate . Take an onion with you , too . " Francie and her brother stood at the counter a long time before the butcher noticed them . " What 's yours ? " he asked finally . Francie started the negotiations . " Ten cents worth of round steak . " " Ground ? " " No . " " Lady was just in . Bought a quarter 's worth of round steak ground . Only I ground too much and here 's the rest on the plate . Just ten cents ' worth . Honestly , I only just ground it . " This was the pitfall Francie had been told to watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter what the butcher says . " No . My mother said ten cents worth of round steak . " Furiously the butcher hacked off a bit of meat and slammed it down on the paper after weighing it .

" He hacked up the meat and shoved it into40BOOK ONE 41the chopper . Tricked again , he thought bitterly . The meat came out in fresh red spirals . He gathered it up in his hand and was just about to slam it down on the paper when ... . " And mama said to chop up this onion in it . " Timidly , she pushed the peeled onion that she had brought from home across the counter . Neeley stood by and said nothing . His function was to come along for moral support . " Jesus ! " the butcher said explosively . But he went to work with two cleavers chopping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loving the drumbeat rhythm of the cleavers . Again the butcher gathered up the meat , slammed it down on the paper and glared at Francie . She gulped . The last order would be hardest of all . The butcher had an idea of what was coming . He stood there trembling inwardly . Francie said all on one breath , " **34;8903;TOOLONG . " " Son-of-a-bitchin ' bastard , " whispered the butcher bitterly . He slashed off a piece of white fat , let it fall to the floor in revenge , picked it up and slammed it on the mound of meat . He wrapped it furiously , snatched the dime , and as he turned it over to the boss for ringing up , he cursed the destiny that had made him a butcher . After the chopped meat deal they went to Hassler 's for the soup bone . Hassler was a fine butcher for bones but a bad butcher for chopped meat because he ground it behind closed doors and God knows what you got . Neeley waited outside with the package because if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudly tell you to go get your bone where you got your other meat . Francie ordered a nice bone with some meat on it for Sunday soup for five cents . Hassler made her wait while he told the stale joke : how a man had bought two cents worth of dog meat and how Hassler had asked , should he wrap it up or do you want to eat it here ? Francie smiled shyly . The pleased butcher went into the icebox and returned holding up a gleaming white bone with creamy marrow in it and shreds of red meat clinging to the ends . He made Francie admire it . " After your mama cooks this , " he said , " tell her to take the marrow out , spread it on a piece of bread with pepper , salt , and make a nice samwish for you . " " I 'll tell mama . " " You eat it and get some meat on your bones , ha , ha . " After the bone was wrapped and paid for , he sliced off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gave it to her . Francie was sorry that she had deceived that kind man by buying the other meat elsewhere . Too bad mama did n't trust him about chopped meat . It was still early in the evening and the street lights had not yet come on . But already , the horse-radish lady was sitting in front of Hassler 's grinding away at her pungent roots . Francie held out the cup that she had brought from home . The old mother filled it halfway up for two cents . Happy that the meat business was over , Francie bought two cents worth of soup greens from the green grocer 's . She got an emasculated carrot , a droopy leaf of celery , a soft tomato and a fresh sprig of parsley . These would be boiled with the bone to make a rich soup with shreds of meat floating in it . Fat , homemade noodles would be added . This , with the seasoned marrow spread on bread , would make a good Sunday dinner .

Although there was no signal nor agreement , the boys always gathered on the corner after supper where they stood the whole evening , hands in pockets , shoulders hunched forward , arguing , laughing , pushing each other around and jigging in time to whistled tunes . Maudie Donavan came around to go to confession with Francie . Maudie was an orphan who lived with two maiden aunts who worked at home . They made ladies ' shrouds for a living at so much per dozen for a casket company . They made satin tufted shrouds : white ones for dead virgins , pale lavender for the young married , purple for the middle-aged and black for the old . Maudie brought some pieces . She thought Francie might like to make something out of them . Francie pretended to be glad but shuddered as she put the gleaming scraps away . The church was smoky with incense and guttering candles . The nuns had put fresh flowers on the altars . The Blessed Mother 's altar had the nicest flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jesus or Joseph . People were lined up outside the confessionals . The girls and fellows wanted to get it over with before they went out on their dates . The line was longest at Father O'Flynn 's cubicle . He was young , kind , tolerant and easy on the penances . When her turn came , Francie pushed aside the heavy curtain and knelt in the confessional . The old , old mystery took hold as the priestBOOK ONE 43slid open the tiny door that separated him from the sinner and made the sign of the cross before the grilled window . He started whispering rapidly and monotonously in Latin with his eyes closed . She caught the mingled odors of incense , candle wax , flowers , and the good black cloth and shaving lotion of the priest . " Bless me , Father , for I have sinned .... " Quickly were her sins confessed and quickly absolved . She came out with her head bowed over her clasped hands . She genuflected before the altar , then knelt at the rail . She said her penance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maudie , who lived a less complicated life , had had fewer sins to confess and had gotten out sooner . She was sitting outside on the steps waiting when Francie came out . They walked up and down the block , arms about each others ' waists , the way girl friends did in Brooklyn . Maudie had a penny . She bought an ice cream sandwich and treated Francie to a bite . Soon Maudie had to go in . She was n't allowed out on the street after eight at night . The girls parted after mutual promises were asked and given to go to confession together the following Saturday . " Do n't forget , " called Maudie , walking backwards away from Francie , " I called for you this time and it 's your turn to call for me next time . " " I wo n't forget , " promised Francie . There was company in the front room when Francie got home . Aunt Evy was there with her husband , Willie Flittman . Francie liked Aunt Evy . She looked a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to make you laugh like people did in a show and she could mimic anybody in the world . Uncle Flittman had brought his guitar along . He was playing it and all were singing . Flittman was a thin dark man with smooth black hair and a silky mustache . He played the guitar pretty well considering that the middle finger of his right hand was n't there . When he came to where he was supposed to use that finger , he 'd give the guitar a thumping whack to do for the time when the note should be played . This gave a queer rhythm to his songs . He had nearly reached the end of his repertoire when Francie came in . She was just in time to hear his last selection . After the music , he went out and got a pitcher of beer . Aunt Evydeleted linesme . Do you know what he did to me just the other day ? " .. sweet Molly Malone . He leaned forward and Francie saw his eyes brighten with unshed She drove her wheel barrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was washing him in the stable and I was washing under his belly and he went and wet on me . " Crying ... . Katie and Evy looked at each other . Their eyes were dancing with hidden laughter . Katie looked suddenly at Francie . The laughter was still in her eyes but her mouth was stern . Francie looked down on the floor and frowned although she was laughing inside . " That 's what he did . And all the men in the stable laughed at me . Everyone laughs at me . " He drank another glass of beer . " Do n't talk like that , Will , " said his wife . " Evy does n't love me , " he said to mama . " I love you , Will , " Evy assured him in her soft tender voice that was a caress in itself . " You loved me when you married me but you do n't love me now , do you ? " He waited . Evy said nothing . " You see , she do n't love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's time we went home , " said Evy . Before they went to bed , Francie and Neeley had to read a page of the Bible and a page from Shakespeare . That was a rule . Mama used to read the two pages to them each night until they were old enough to read for themselves . To save time , Neeley read the Bible page and Francie read from Shakespeare . They had been at this reading for six years and were halfway through the Bible and up to Macbeth in Shakespeare 's Complete Works . They raced through the reading and by eleven , all the Nolans , excepting Johnny who was working , were in bed . On Saturday nights Francie was allowed to sleep in the front room . She made a bed by pushing two chairs together in front of the window where she could watch the people on the street . Lying there , she wasMama had the door open on " crying . " It was a game papa had . If they got the door opened before he finished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finish it out in the hall , he won . Francie and Neeley got out of bed and they all sat around the table and ate after papa had put three dollars down on the table and given the children each a nickel which mama made them put in the tin-can bank explaining they had already received money that day from the junk . Papa had brought home a paper bagful of food not used at the wedding because some of the guests had n't come . The bride had divided the unconsumed food among the waiters . There was half of a cold broiled lobster , five stone-cold fried oysters , an inch jar of caviar and a wedge of Roquefort cheese . The children did n't like the lobster and the cold oysters had no taste and the caviar seemed too salty . But they were so hungry that they ate everything on the table and digested it too , during the night . They could have digested nails had they been able to chew them . After she had eaten , Francie at last faced the fact that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to have lasted until after mass next morning . Now she could not receive communion . Here was a real sin to confess to the priest next week . Neeley went back to bed and resumed his sound sleep . Francie went into the dark front room and sat by the window . She did n't feel like sleeping . Mama and papa sat in the kitchen . They would sit there and talk until daybreak . Papa was telling about the night 's work ; the people he had seen , what they had looked like and how they spoke . The Nolans just could n't get enough of life . They lived their own lives46 A Tree Grows in Brooklynup to the hilt but that was n't enough . They had to fill in on the lives of all the people they made contact with . So Johnny and Katie talked away the night and the rise and fall of their voices was a safe and soothing sound in the dark . Now it was three in the morning and the street was very quiet . Francie saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come home from a dance with her feller . They stood pressed close together in her vestibule . They stood embracing without talking until the girl leaned back and unknowingly pressed the bells . Then her father came down in his long underdrawersand , with quiet but intense profanity , told the fellow what he could go and do to himself . The girl ran upstairs giggling hystericallywhile the boy friend walked away down the street whistling , " When I Get You Alone , Tonight . " Mr. Tomony who owned the pawnshop came home in a hansom cab from his spendthrift evening in New York . He had never set foot inside his pawnshop which he had inherited along with an efficient manager . No one knew why Mr. Tomony lived in the rooms above the sho  --  man with his money . He lived the life of an aristocratic New Yorker in the squalor of Williamsburg . A plasterer who had been in his rooms reported them furnished with statues , oil paintings , and white fur rugs . Mr. Tomony was a bachelor . No one saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evenings . Only Francie and the cop on the beat saw him come home . Francie watched him , feeling like a spectator in a theater box . His high silk hat was tipped over an ear . The street light picked up the gleam of his silver-knobbed cane as he tucked it under his arm . He swung back his white satin lined Inverness cape to get some money . The driver took the bill , touched the butt of his whip to the rim of his plug hat and shook the horse 's reins . Mr. Tomony watched him drive away as though the cab were the last link in a life that he had found good . Then he went upstairs to his fabulous apartment . He was supposed to frequent such legendary places as RiesenwebeA and the Waldorf . Francie decided to see these places some day . Some day she would go across Williamsburg Bridge , which was only a few blocks away and find her way uptown in New York to where these fine places were and take a good look at the outside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accurately . A fresh breeze blew in over Brooklyn from the sea . From far away on the north side where the Italians lived and kept chickens in theirBOOK ONE 47yards , came the crowing of a rooster . It was answered by the distant barking of a dog and an inquiring whinny from the horse , Bob , comfortably bedded in his stable . Francie was glad for Saturday and hated to end it by going to sleep . Already the dread of the week to come made her uneasy . She fixed the memory of this Saturday in her mind . It was without fault except for the old man waiting for bread . Other nights in the week she would have to lie on her cot and from the airshaft hear the indistinct voices of the childlike bride who lived in one of the other flats with her ape-like truck-driver husband . The bride 's voice would be soft and pleading , his , rough and demanding . Then there would be a short silence . Then he would start snoring and the wife would cry piteously until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instinctively her hands flew to cover her ears . Then she remembered it was Saturday ; she was in the front room where she could n't hear sounds from the airshaft . Yes , it was still Saturday and it was wonderful . Monday was a long time away . Peaceful Sunday would come in-between when she could think long thoughts about the nasturtiums in the brown bowl and the way the horse had looked being washed while standing in sunshine and shadow . She was growing drowsy . She listened a moment to Katie and Johnny talking in the kitchen . They were reminiscing . " I was seventeen when I first met you , " Katie was saying , " and I was working in the Castle Braid Factory . " " I was nineteen then , " recalled Johnny , " and keeping company with your best friend , Hildy O'Dair . " " Oh , her , " sniffed Katie . The sweet-smelling warm wind moved gently in Francie 's hair . She folded her arms on the window sill and laid her cheek on them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenement roofs . After awhile she went to sleep . , VIIT WAS IN ANOTHER BROOPLYN SUMMER BUT TWELVE YEARSearlier in nineteen hundred , that Johnny Nolan first met Katie Rommely . He was nineteen and she was seventeen . Katie worked in the Castle Braid Factory . So did Hildy O'Dair , her best friend . They got along well although Hildy was Irish and Katie came from parents who had been born in Austria . Katie was prettier but Hildy was bolder . Hildy had brassy blond hair , wore a garnet-colored chiffon bow around her neck , chewed sen-sen , knew all the latest songs and was a good dancer . Hildy had a feller , a beau who took her dancing Saturday nights . His name was Johnny Nolan . Sometimes he waited for Hildy outside the factory . He always brought some of the boys along to wait with him . They stood loafing on the corner , telling jokes and laughing . One day , Hildy asked Johnny to bring someone for Katie , her girl friend , the next time they went dancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Canarsie on the trolley . The boys wore straw katies with a cord attached to the brim and the other end to their coat lapel . The stiff ocean breeze blew the hats off and there was much laughter when the boys pulled the skimmers back by the cords . Johnny danced with his girl , Hildy . Katie refused to dance with the feller provided for her , a vacuous vulgar boy given to remarks like : " I thought you musta fallen in , " when Katie returned from a trip to the ladies ' room . However , she let him buy her a beer , and she sat at the table watching Johnny dancing with Hildy and thinking that in all the world , there was nobody like Johnny. sx52 A Tree Grows in BrooklynJohnny 's feet were long and slender and his shoes were shiny . He danced with his toes pointed in and rocked from heel to toe with beautiful rhythm . It was hot , dancing . Johnny hung his coat over the back of his chair . His trousers settled well on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wore a high stiff collar and a polkadottedtie ( which matched the band on his straw hat ) , baby-blue sleeve garters of satin ribbon shirred on to elastic which Katie jealously suspected Hildy had made for him . So jealous was she that for the rest of her life she hated that color . Katie could n't stop looking at him . He was young , slender and shining with blond curly hair and deep blue eyes . His nose was straight and his shoulders broad and square . She heard the girls at the next table say that he was a nifty dresser . Their escorts said he was a nifty dancer , too . Although he did not belong to her , Katie was proud of him . Johnny gave her a courtesy dance when the orchestra played " Sweet Rosie O'Grady . " Feeling his arms around her and instinctively adjusting herself to his rhythm , Katie knew that he was the man she wanted . She 'd ask nothing more than to look at him and to listen to him for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those privileges were worth slaving for all her life . Maybe that decision was her great mistake . She should have waited until some man came along who felt that way about her . Then her children would not have gone hungry ; she would not have had to scrub floors for their living and her memory of him would have remained a tender shining thing . But she wanted Johnny Nolan and no one else and she set out to get him . Her campaign started the following Monday . When the whistle blew dismissal , she ran out of the factory , reached the corner before Hildy did and sang out , " Hello , Johnny Nolan . " " Hello , Katie , dear , " he answered . After that , she 'd manage to get a few words with him each day . Johnny found that he was waiting around on the corner for those few words . One day Katie , falling back on a woman 's always-respected excuse , told her forelady that it was the time of the month ; she did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing time . Johnny was waiting on the corner with his friends . They were whistling " AnnieBoox Two 53Rooney " to pass the time away . Johnny cocked his skimmer over one eye , put his hands in his pockets and did a waltz clog there on the sidewalk . Passers-by stopped to admire . The cop , walking his beat , called out , " You 're losing time , Sport . You ought to be on the stage . " Johnny saw Katie coming along and stopped performing and grinned at her . She looked mighty fetching in a tight-fitting gray suit , trimmed with black braid from the factory . Intricately whorled and squirled , the braid trimming was designed to call attention to her modest bust already helped out by two rows of ruffles pinned to her corset cover . With the gray suit , she wore a cherry-colored tam pulled over one eye and vici-kid high buttoned shoes with spool heels . Her black eyes sparkled and her cheeks glowed with excitement and shame as she thought how fresh she must loo  --  unning after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other boys drifted away . What Katie and Johnny said to each other on that special day , they never remembered . Somehow during their aimless but oh-so-significant conversation with its delicious pauses and thrilling undercurrents of emotion , they came to know that they loved each other passionately . The factory whistle blew and the girls streamed out of the Castle Braid . Hildy came along in a mud-colored brown suit and a black sailor skewered on to her ratted brassy pompadour with an evil-looking hatpin . She smiled possessively when she saw Johnny . But the smile changed to a spasm of hurt , fear and then hate when she saw Katie with him . She rushed down on them pulling her long hatpin from her sailor . " He 's my feller , Katie Rominely , " she screamed , " and you ca n't steal him away . " " Hildy , Hildy , " said Johnny in his soft unhurried voice . " I guess this is a free country , " said Katie tossing her head . " Not free for robbers , " yelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped between the girls and got the scratch down his cheek . By this time , a crowd of Castle Braid girls had gathered and were watching them with delighted cluckings . Johnny took each girl by the arm and steered them around the corner . He crowded them into a doorway and imprisoned them there with his arm while he talked to them. 54 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " Hildy , " he said , " I 'm not much good . I should n't have led you on because I see now that I ca n't marry you . " " It 's all her fault , " wept Hildy . " Mine , " acknowledged Johnny handsomely . " I never knew what true love was till I met Katie . " " But she 's my best friend , " said Hildy piteously as though Johnny were committing a kind of incest . " She 's my best girl now and there 's nothing more to say about it . " Hildy wept and argued . Finally Johnny quieted her down and explained how it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hildy was to go her way and he 'd go his . He liked the sound of his words . He repeated them again , enjoying the drama of the moment . " So you go your way and I 'll go mine . " " You mean , I go my way and you go her way , " said Hildy bitterly . Finally Hildy went her way . She walked down the street with her shoulders sagging . Johnny ran after her , and there on the street put his arms about her and kissed her tenderly in farewell . " I wish it could have been different with us , " he said sadly . " You wish no such thing , " snapped Hildy . " If you did " ? she started crying again ? " you 'd just give her the gate and start going out with me again . Katie was crying too . After all , Hildy O'Dair had been her best friend . She too kissed Hildy . She looked away when she saw Hildy 's tear-wetted eyes so close to hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and Johnny went Katie 's way . They kept company for a little while , became engaged , and were married in Katie 's church on New Year 's Day , nineteen hundred and one . They had known each other not quite four months when they married . Thomas Rommely never forgave his daughter . In fact he never forgave any of his daughters for marrying . His philosophy about children was simple and profitable : a man enjoyed himself begetting them , put in as little money and effort into their upbringing as was possible , and then put them to work earning money for the father as soon as they got into their teens . Katie , at seventeen , had only been working four years when she married . He figured that she owed him money . BooK Two 55Rommely hated everybody and everything . No one ever found out why . He was a massive handsome man with iron-gray curly hair covering a leonine head . He had run away from Austria with his bride to avoid being conscripted into the army . Although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new country . He understood and could speak English if he wanted to . But he refused to answer when addressed in English and forbade the speaking of English in his home . His daughters understood very little German . ( Their mother insisted that the girls speak only English in the home . She reasoned that the less they understood German , the less they would find out about the cruelty of their father . ) Consequently , the four daughters grew up having little communion with their father . He never spoke to them except to curse them . His Gott verdammte came to be regarded as hello and goodbye . When very angry , he 'd call the object of his temper , Du Russe ! This he considered his most obscene expletive . He hated Austria . He hated America . Most of all he hated Russia . He had never been to that country and had never laid eyes on a Russian . No one understood his hatred of that dimly-known country and its vaguely-known people . This was the man who was Francie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hated him . Mary Rommely , his wife and Francie 's grandmother , was a saint . She had no education ; she could not read or write her own name , but she had in her memory over a thousand stories and legends . Some she had invented to entertain her children ; others were old folk tales told to her by her own mother and her grandmother . She knew many oldcountrysongs and understood all the wise sayings . She was intensely religious and knew the life story of every Catholic saint . She believed in ghosts and fairies and all supernatural folk . She knew all about herbs and could brew you either a medicine or a charm ? provided you intended no evil with the charm . Back in the old country she had been honored for her wisdom and much sought out for advice . She was a blameless sinless woman , yet she understood how it was with people who sinned . Inflexibly rigid in her own moral conduct , she condoned weaknesses in others . She revered God and loved Jesus , but she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had been virgin when she married and had humbly submitted to her husband 's brutal love . His brutality early killed all of her latent56 A Tree Grows in Brooklyndesires . Yet she could understand the fierce love hunger that made girl  --  s people put i  --  o wrong . She understood how a boy who had been driven from the neighborhood for rape could still be a good boy at heart . She understood why people had to lie and steal and harm one another . She knew of all pitiful human weaknesses and of many cruel strengths . Yet she could not read or write . Her eyes were soft brown , limpid and innocent . She wore her shining brown hair parted in the middle and drawn down over her ears . Her skin was pale and translucent and her mouth was tender . She spoke in a low , soft , warmly melodious voice that soothed those who listened . All of her daughters and granddaughters inherited this quality of voice from her . Mary was convinced that because of some sin she had unwittingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil himself . She really believed this because her husband told her so . " I am the devil , himself , " he told her frequently . She often looked at hi  --  he way two locks of his hair stood up on either side of his head , the way his cold gray eyes slanted upward at the outer corners , and she sighed and said to herself , " Yes , he is the devil . " He had a way of looking full into her saintly face and in a falsely caressing tone he would accuse Christ of unspeakable things . This always terrified her so much that she 'd take her shawl from the nail behind the door , throw it over her head and rush forth into the street where she would walk and walk until concern for her children drove her back into the house . She went to the public school that the three youngest girls attended and in halting English told the teacher that the children must be encouraged to speak only English ; they were not to use a German word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them against their father . She grieved when her children had to leave school after the sixth grade and go out working . She grieved when they married no-account men . She wept when they gave birth to daughters , knowing that to be born a woman meant a life of humble hardship . Each time Francie began the prayer , Hail , Mary , full of grace , the Lord is with thee , her grandmother 's face came before her . Sissy was the oldest child of Thomas and Mary Rommely . She had been born three months after her parents landed in America . She hadBooK Two 57never gone to school . At the time when she should have started , Mary did not understand that free education was available for people like them . There were laws about sending children to school but no one sought out these ignorant people in order to enforce the law . By the time the other girls reached school age , Mary had learned about free education . But Sissy was then too big to start in with the six-year-olds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sissy was as fully developed as a woman of thirty and all the boys were after Sissy and Sissy was after all the boys . At twelve , she started keeping steady company with a lad of twenty . Her father nipped that romance by beating up the boy . At fourteen , she was going with a fireman of twenty-five . Because he licked her father , instead of the other way around , this romance ended in the fireman marrying Sissy . They went to City Hall , where Sissy swore that she was eighteen , and were married by one of the clerks . The neighbors were shocked but Mary knew that marriage was the best thing that could happen to her highly-sexed daughter . Jim , the fireman , was a good man . He was considered educated , having graduated from grammar school . He made good money and was n't home much . He was an ideal husband . They were very happy . Sissy demanded little from him except a lot of love-making , which made him very happy . Sometimes he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write . But she was so witty and clever and warmheartedthat she made of living a high joyous thing and in time he began to overlook her illiteracy . Sissy was very good to her mother and her younger sisters . Jim gave her a fair household allowance . She was very careful with it and usually had money left over to give her mother . She became pregnant a month after marriage . She was still a hoyden girl of fourteen in spite of her womanly status . The neighbors were horrified when they watched her skipping rope on the street with other children , heedless of the yet-to-be-born baby who was now an almost unwieldy bulge . In the hours not devoted to cooking , cleaning , love-making , rope skipping and trying to get into the baseball game with the boys , Sissy made plans for the coming baby . If it were a girl , she was going to call it Mary after her mother . If a boy , it would be named John . For some unknown reason , she had a great affection for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began calling Jim by the name of John . She said she wanted to name him after the baby . At first , it was an affectionate nickname but soon everyone got to calling him John and many people believed that that was his real name . The baby was born . It was a girl and a very easy birth . The midwife down the block was called in . Everything went fine . Sissy was in labor only twenty-five minutes . It was a wonderful delivery . The only thing wrong with the whole business was that the baby was born dead . Coincidently , the baby was born and died on Sissy 's fifteenth birthday . She grieved awhile and her grief changed her . She worked harder at keeping her house spotless and clean . She became even more thoughtful of her mother . She stopped being a tomboy . She was convinced that the rope skipping had cost her the child . As she quieted down , she seemed younger and more child-like . By the time she was twenty , she had had four children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion that her husband was at fault . It was n't her fault . Had n't she stopped skipping rope after the first child ? She told Jim that she did n't care for him any more since nothing but death grew out of their love-making . She told him to leave her . He argued a little but went finally . At first he sent her money from time to time . Sometimes when Sissy got lonesome for a man , she 'd walk past the firehouse where Jim would be sitting outside with his chair tilted against the brick wall . She 'd walk slow , smiling and swaying her hips , and Jim would take unauthorized leave , run up to the flat and they 'd be very happy together for a half hour or so . Eventually Sissy met another man who wanted to marry her . What his real name was nobody in her family knew , because she began calling him John right away . Her second marriage was arranged very simply . Divorce was complicated and expensive . Besides she was a Catholic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been married by a clerk in City Hall . She reasoned that it had n't been a church , or real marriage so why let it stand in her way ? Using her marriage name and saying nothing about her previous marriage , she was married again in City Hall but by a different clerk . Mary , her mother , was distressed because Sissy had n't married in the church . This second marriage provided Thomas with a new imple- ment of torture for his wife . He often told her that he was going to tell a policeman and have Sissy arrested for bigamy . But before he could get around to it , Sissy and her second John had been mar Boox Two 59ried four years , she had given birth to four more children , all born dead , and she had decided that this second John was n't her man either .

He liked Sissy and had been fairly happy with her . But she was like quicksilver . In spite of her terrifying frankness and overwhelming naivete , he really knew nothing about her and he was tired of living with an enigma . He did n't feel too bad about going away . Sissy at twenty-four had borne eight children , none of whom had lived . She decided that God was against her marrying . She got a job in a rubber factory where she told everyone she was an old maid ( which no one believed ) , and went home to live with her mother . Between her second and third marriage , she had a succession of lovers all of whom she called John . After each futile birth , her love of children grew stronger . She had dark moods in which she thought she would go crazy if she did n't have a child to love . She poured out her frustrated maternity on the men she slept with , on her two sisters , Evy and Katie , and on their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Sissy was a bad girl but she loved her fiercely just the same . Evy and Katie tried to be mad at their erring sister but she was so good to them that they could n't hold out against her . Soon after Francie was eleven , Sissy married for the third time at City Hall . The third John was the one who worked in the magazine company and through him Francie had those fine , new magazines each month . She hoped the third marriage would endure because of the magazines . Eliza , the second daughter of Mary and Thomas lacked the prettinessand fire of her three sisters . She was plain and dull and indifferent to life . Mary , wanting to give one of her daughters to the church , decided that Eliza was the one . Eliza entered a convent at sixteen . She chose a very rigid order of nuns . She was never permitted to leave the convent walls except on the occasion of her parents ' death . She took6o A Tree Grows in Brooklynthe name of Ursula and as Sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw her once when she came out of the convent to attend Thomas Rommely 's funeral . Francie was nine at the time . She had just made her first communion and had given herself so wholeheartedlyto the church that she thought she might like to be a nun when she grew up . She awaited Sister Ursula 's coming with excitement . Just think of it ! An aunt who was a nun ! What an honor . But when Sister Ursula stooped to kiss her , Francie saw that she had a fine fringe of hair on her upper lip and chin . This frightened Francie into believing that hair grew on the faces of all nuns who entered the convent at a tender age . Francie decided against sisterhood . Evy was the third Rommely girl . She , too , had married young . She married Willie Flittman , a handsome , black-haired man with a silky mustache and liquid eyes like an Italian . Francie thought that he had a very comical name and she laughed to herself every time she thought of it . Flittman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bum , he was just a weak man who whined all the time . But he played the guitar . Those Rommely women had a weakness for any kind of man who was by way of being a creator or a performer . Any kind of musical , artistic or story-telling talent was wonderful to them and they felt it their duty to nurture and guard these things . Evy was the refined one of the family . She lived in a cheap basementflat on the fringes of a very refined neighborhood and studied her betters . She wanted to be somebody ; wanted her children to have advantages she had never had . She had three children ; a boy named after his father , a girl named Blossom and another boy called Paul Jones . Her first step towards refinement was to take her children out of the Catholic Sunday School and put them in the Episcopal Sunday School . She had gotten it into her head that the Protestants were more refined than the Catholics . Evy , loving talent in music and lacking it herself , sought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blossom would like to sing and that Paul Jones would want to play the fiddle and Little Willie the piano . But there was no music in the children . Evy took the bull by the horns . BOOK Two 6tThey would have to love music whether they wanted to or not . Ii talent was n't born in them , maybe it could be shoved in at so much per hour . She bought a second-hand fiddle for Paul Jones and negotiatedlessons for him at fifty cents an hour from a man who called himself Professor Allegretto . He taught little Flittman fearsome scrapingsand at the end of the year gave him the piece called " Humorcsque . " Evy thought it was wonderful when he got a piece to play . It was better than playing the scales all the time . . . well , a little better . Then Evy got more ambitious . " Beings , " she said to her husband , " that we 've got the fiddle for Paul Jones , little Blossom could take lessons too and both could practice on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope , " replied her husband sourly . " What do you think , " she answered indignantly . So fifty cents more a week was scraped up and folded into Blossom'sreluctant hand and she was sent off to take fiddle lessons , too . It so happened that Professor Allegretto had a very slight peculiarity concerning his girl pupils . He made them take off their shoes and stockings and stand in their bare feet on his green carpet while they sawed away . Instead of beating time or correcting their fingering , he spent the hour in a revery staring at their feet . Evy was watching Blossom getting ready for a lesson one day . She noticed that the child removed her shoes and stockings and washed her feet carefully . Evy thought that commendable but a little strange . " And why do you wash your feet now ? " " For my fiddle lesson . " " You play with your hands , not your feet . " " I feel ashamed standing in front of the professor with dirty feet . " " He can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so because he always makes me take my shoes and stockings off . " This made Evy jump . She knew nothing of Freud and her scanty knowledge of sex did not include any of its deviatons . But her commonsense told her that Professor Allegretto should not charge fifty cents an hour and not attend to his work . Blossom 's musical education was terminated then and there . Upon being questioned , Paul Jones said that he had never been asked to take anything off but his hat when he went for a lesson . He was allowed to continue . In five years , he could play the fiddle162 A Tree Grows in Brooklynalmost as well as his father , who had never taken a lesson in his life , could play the guitar . Aside from his music , Uncle Flittman was a dull man . At home , his only topic of conversation was the way Drummer , the milk wagon horse , treated him . Flittman and the horse had been feuding for five years and Evy hoped that one of them would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although she could not resist mimickinghim . She 'd stand in the Nolan kitchen and pretend that she was the horse , Drummer , and she 'd give a good imitation of Uncle Flittman trying to put the feedbag on the horse .

He 's just about to put it on , when up goes the horse 's head . " Here Evy would jerk her head high and whinny like a horse . " Will waits . The horse 's head goes down again . You 'd think he never could get it up in the air . The horse makes out like he 's got no bones . " Evy 's head lolled alarmingly . " Comes Will with the feedbag , up goes the head .

" You know , Kate , sometimes I think my man is jealous the way the horse , Drummer , likes me . " Katie stared at her a moment with her mouth open . Then she started to laugh . Evy laughed and Francie laughed . The two Rommelygirls and Francie who was half a Rommely stood there laughingabout a secret they shared concerning the weakness of a man . Those were the Rommely women : Mary , the mother , Evy , Sissy , and Katie , her daughters , and Francie , who would grow up to be a Rommelywoman even though her name was Nolan . They were all slender , frail creatures with wondering eyes and soft fluttery voices . But they were made out of thin invisible steel . VIIITHE ROMMELYS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to weak and talented men . Johnny 's family was dying out . The Nolan men grew handsomer , weaker and more beguiling with each generation . They had a way of falling in love but of ducking marriage . That was the main reason why they were dying out . Ruthie Nolan had come from Ireland with her handsome young husband soon after their marriage . They had four sons born a year apart . Then Mickey Nolan died at thirty and Ruthie carried on . She managed to get Andy , Georgie , Frankie , and Johnny through the sixth grade . As each boy reached the age of twelve , he had to leave school to go out to earn a few pennies . The boys grew up , handsome , able to play music , to dance and to sing and with all the girls crazy for them .

They had quick feet in shoes that were kept highly polished . Their trousers hung just so and their hats set jauntily on their head . But they were all dead before they were thirty-fiv  --  ll dead , and of the four , only Johnny left children . Andy was the eldest and the handsomest . He had red-gold wavy hair and finely molded features . He had consumption , too . He was6364 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Boo x Two 65mass said once a month for the repose of his soul which she knew wandered about in Purgatory . In little more than a year , Ruthie Nolan had lost three sons ; two by death and one by marriage . She grieved for the three .

All died sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own bad way of living . Johnny was the only one who lived past his thirtieth birthday . And the child , Francie Nolan , was of all the Rommelys and all the Nolans . She had the violent weaknesses and passion for beauty of the shanty Nolans . She was a mosaic of her grandmother Rommely 's mysticism , her tale-telling , her great belief in everything and her compassionfor the weak ones . She had a lot of her grandfather Rommely 's cruel will . She had some of her Aunt Evy 's talent for mimicking , some of Ruthie Nolan 's possessiveness . She had Aunt Sissy 's love for life and her love for children . She had Johnny 's sentimentality without his good looks . She had all of Katie 's soft ways and only half of the invisible steel of Katie . She was made up of all of these good and these bad things . She was made up of more , too . She was the books she read in the library . She was of the flower in the brown bowl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing rankly in the yard . She was the bitter quarrels she had with her brother whom she loved dearly . She was Katie 's secret , despairing weeping . She was the shame of her father staggering home drunk . She was all of these things and of something more that did not come from the Rommelys nor the Nolans , the reading , the observing , the living from day to day .

They had been the Nolan Quartette until Andy got too sick to work . They became the Nolan Trio then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that on liquor and horse-racing bets . When Andy took to his bed for the last time , the boys bought him a genuine swansdown pillow that cost seven dollars . They wanted him to have a luxury before he died . Andy thought it was a wonderful pillow . Andy used it two days , then there was a last great gush of blood which stained the fine new pillow a rusty brown and Andy died . His mother keened over the body for three days . Francie Melaney made a vow that she would never marry . The three remaining Nolan boys swore that they would never leave their mother . Six months later , Johnny married Katie . Ruthie hated Katie . She had hoped to keep all of her fine boys home with her until either she or they died . So far all had avoided marriage . But that gir  --  hat girl , Katie Rommely ! She did it ! Ruthie was sure that Johnny had been tricked into marriage . Georgie and Frankie liked Katie but thought it was a dirty trick for Johnny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their mother . They made the best of it , however . They looked around for a wedding present and decided to give Katie the fine pillow they had bought for Andy and which he had used so briefly . The mother sewed a new ticking over it to hide the ugly stain that had been the last part of Andy 's life . The pillow thus passed on to Johnny and Katie . It was considered too good for ordinary use and only brought out when one of them was sick . Francie called it " the sick pillow . " Neither Katie nor Francie knew that it had been a death pillow . About a year after Johnny 's marriage , Frankie , whom many thought even handsomer than Andy , wavered home after a drinking party one night and stumbled over some taut wire that a bucolic Brooklynite had strung around a square foot of grass before his house stoop . The wire was held up by sharp little sticks . As Frankie stumbled , one of the sticks pierced his stomach .

Johnny chose the street because its name had a thrilling dark sound . They were very happy there the first year of their marriage . Katie had married Johnny because she liked the way he sang and danced and dressed . Womanlike , she set about changing all those things in him after marriage . She persuaded him to give up the singing waiter business . He did so , since he was in love and anxious to please her . They got a job together taking care of a public school and they loved it . Their day started when the rest of the world went to bed . After supper , Katie put on her black coat with the big leg-o-mutton sleeves , lavishly trimmed with brai  --  er last loot from the factor  --  nd threw a cherry wool fascinator over her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she and Johnny set off for work . The school was old and small and warm . They looked forward to spending the night there . They walked arm-in-arm ; he in his patent leather dancing shoes and she in her high laced kid boots . Sometimes when the night was frosty and full of stars , they ran a little , skipped a little and laughed a lot . They felt very important using their private key to get into the school . The school was their world for a night . They played games while they worked . Johnny sat at one of the desks and Katie pretended she was a teacher . They wrote messages to each other on the blackboards . They pulled down the maps which rolled up like shades and pointed out foreign countries with the rubber-tipped pointer . They were filled with wonder at the thought66Boox Two 67of strange lands and unknown languages . ( He was nineteen and she was seventeen . ) They liked best to clean the assembly room . Johnny dusted the piano and , while doing so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some chords . Katie sat in the front row and asked him to sing . He sang to her ; sentimental songs of the time : " She May Have Seen Better Days , " or " I 'm Wearin ' My Heart Away For You . " People living near-by would be coaxed out of their midnight sleep by the singing . They 'd lie in their warm beds , listening drowsily and murmur to each other , " That feller , whoever he is , is losing time . He 's losing time . He ought to be in a show . " Sometimes Johnny went into one of his dances on the little platform that he pretended was a stage . He was so graceful and handsome , so loving , so full of the grandness of just living , that Katie , watching him , thought she would die of being happy . At two , they went into the teachers ' lunch room where there was a gas plate . They made coffee . They kept a can of condensed milk in the cupboard . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wonderful smell . Their rye bread and bologna sandwiches tasted good . Sometimes after supper , they 'd go into the teachers ' rest room where there was a chintz-covered couch and lie there for awhile with their arms about each other . They emptied the wastebaskets , last thing , and Katie salvaged the longer bits of discarded chalk and the pencils that were not too stubby . She took them home and saved them in a box . Later when Francie was growing up , she felt very rich having so much chalk and so many pencils to use . At dawn , they left the school scrubbed , shiny , warm and ready for the daytime janitor . They walked home watching the stars fade from the sky . They passed the bakers where the smell of freshly-baked rolls came up to them from the baking room in the basement . Johnny ran down and bought a nickel 's worth of buns hot from the oven . Arriving home , they had a breakfast of hot coffee and warm sweet buns . Then Johnny ran out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with running comments , while she cleaned up their rooms . At noon , they had a hot dinner of pot roast and noodles or something good like that . After dinner they slept until it was time to get up for work . They earned fifty dollars a month which was good pay for people of68 A Tree Grows in Brooklyntheir class in those days . They lived comfortably and it was a good life they had . . . happy and full of small adventures . And they were so young and loved each other so much . In a few months , to their innocent amazement and consternation , Katie found out that she was pregnant . She told Johnny that she was " that way . " Johnny was bewildered and confused at first . He did n't want her to work at the school . She told him she had been that way for quite a while without being sure and had been working and had not suffered . When she convinced him that it was good for her to work , he gave in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust under the desks . Soon she could do little more than go along with him for company and lie on the gay couch no longer used for love-making . He did all the work now . At two in the morning , he made clumsy sandwiches and over-boiled coffee for her . They were still very happy although Johnny was getting more and more worried as the time wore on . Towards the end of a frosty December night , her pains started . She lay on the couch , holding them back not wanting to tell Johnny until the work was finished . On the way home , there was a tearing pain that she could n't keep back . She moaned and Johnny knew that the baby was on the way . He got her home and put her to bed without undressing her , and covered her warmly . He ran down the block to Mrs. Gindler , the midwife and begged her to hurry . That good woman drove him crazy by taking her time . She had to take dozens of curlers out of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to officiate without them . Johnny helped her search and they found them at last in a glass of water on the ledge outside the window . The water had frozen around the teeth and they had to be thawed before she could put them in . That done , she had to go about making a charm out of a piece of blessed palm taken from the altar on Palm Sunday . To this , she added a medal of the Blessed Mother , a small blue bird feather , a broken blade from a penknife and a sprig of some herb . These things were tied together with a bit of dirty string from the corset of a woman who had given birth to twins after only ten minutes of labor . She sprinkled the whole business with holy water that was supposed to have come from a well in Jerusalemfrom which it was said that Jesus had once quenched His thirst . She explained to the frantic boy that this charm would cut the pains and assure him of a fine , well-born baby . Lastly she grabbed herBooK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and believed by all the youngsters to be the satchel in which they had been delivered , kicking , to their mother  --  nd she was ready to go . Katie was screaming in pain when they got to her . The flat was filled with neighbor women who stood around praying and reminiscing about their own child-bed experiences . " When I had my Wincent , " said one , " I ... " " I was even smaller than her , " said another , " and when . . . " " They did n't expect me to come through it , " proudly declared a third , " but ... " They welcomed the midwife and shooed Johnny out of the place . He sat on the stoop and trembled each time Katie cried out . He was confused , it had happened so suddenly . It was now seven in the morning . Her screams kept coming to him even though the windows were closed . Men passed on their way to work , looked at the window from behind which the screams were coming and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber look came over their faces . Katie was in labor all that day and there was nothing that Johnny could d  --  othing that he could do . Towards night , he could n't stand it any longer . He went to his mother 's house for comforting . When he told her that Katie was having a baby , she nearly raised the roof with her lamentations . " Now she 's got you good , " she wailed . " You 'll never be able to come back to me . " She would not be consoled . Johnny hunted up his brother , Georgie , who was working a dance . He sat drinking , waiting for Georgie to finish , forgetting that he was supposed to be at the school . When Georgie was free for the night , they went to several all-night saloons , had a drink or two at each place and told everyone what Johnny was going through . The men listened sympathetically , treated Johnny to drinks and assured him that they had been through the same mill . Towards dawn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny fell into a troubled sleep . At nine , he woke up with a feeling of coming trouble . He remembered Katie and , too late , he remembered the school . He washed and dressed and started for home . He passed a fruit stand which displayed avocados . He bought two for Katie . He had no way of knowing that during the night , his wife in great pain , and after nearly twenty-four hours of labor , gave bloody birth to a fragile baby girl . The only notable thing about the birth was17o A Tree Grows in Brooklynthat the infant was born with a caul which was supposed to indicate that the child was set apart to do great things in the world . The midwife surreptitiously confiscated the caul and later sold it to a sailor from the Brooklyn Navy Yard for two dollars . Whoever wore a caul would never die by drowning , it was said . The sailor wore it in a flannel bag around his neck . While he drank and slept the night away , Johnny did not know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he was supposedto tend had gone out and the water pipes had burst and flooded the school basement and the first floor . When he got home , he found Katie lying in the dark bedroom . The baby was beside her on Andy 's pillow . The flat was scrupulously clean ; the neighbor women had attended to that . There was a faint odor of carbolic acid mixed with Mennen 's talcum powder . The midwife had gone after saying , " That will be five dollars and your husband knows where I live . " She left and Katie turned her face to the wall and tried not to cry . During the night , she had assured herself that Johnny was working at the school . She had hoped that he would run home for a moment during the two o'clock eating period . Now it was late morning and he should be home . Maybe he had gone to his mother 's to snatch some sleep after the night 's work . She made herself believe that no matter what Johnny was doing , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind at ease . Soon after the midwife left , Evy came over . A neighbor 's boy had been sent for her . Evy brought along some sweet butter and a package of soda crackers and made tea . It tasted so good to Katie . Evy examined the baby and thought it did n't look like much but she said nothing to Katie . When Johnny got home , Evy started to lecture him . But when she saw how pale and frightened he looked and when she considered his ag  --  ust twenty years old , she choked up inside , kissed his cheek , told him not to worry and made fresh coffee for him . Johnny hardly looked at the baby . Still clutching the avocados , he knelt by Katie 's bed and sobbed out his fear and worry . Katie cried with him . During the night , she had wanted him with her . Now she wished she could have had that baby secretly and gone away somewhere and when it was over come back and tell him that everything was fine . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boiled alive inBoox Two 71scalding oil and not being able to die to get free of it . She had had the pain . Dear God ! Was n't that enough ? Why did he have to suffer ?

She was so weak that she could n't lift her head an inch from the pillow , yet it was she who comforted him and told him not to worry , that she would take care of him . Johnny began to feel better . He told her that after all it was nothing ; that he had learned that a lot of husbands had been " through the mill . " " I 've been through the mill , now , too , " he said . " And now I 'm a man . " He made a big fuss over the baby then . At his suggestion , Katie agreed to name her Francie , after the girl , Francie Melaney , who had never married his brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her broken heart if she were made godmother . The child would have the name she would have carried had Andy lived : Francie Nolan . He fixed the avocados with sweet oil and pickle vinegar and brought the salad in to Katie . She was disappointed at the flat taste . Johnny said you had to get used to it , like olives . For his sake and because she was touched by his thinking of her , Katie ate the salad . Evy was urged to try some . She did and said that she 'd sooner have tomatoes ; ; While Johnny was in the kitchen drinking coffee , a boy came from the school with a note from the principal which said that Johnny was fired because of neglect . He was told to come around and get what money was due him . The note ended by telling Johnny not to ask for a recommendation . Johnny 's face got pale as he read it . He gave the kid a nickel for bringing the note and a message saying he would be around . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Johnny saw the principal and tried to explain . The principal told Johnny that since he knew the baby was coming , he should have been more careful of his job . As a kindly afterthought , he told the boy that he would n't have to pay the damage caused by the burst pipes ; the Board of Education would see to that . Johnny thanked him . The principal paid him from his own pocket after Johnny had signed a voucher turning over the coming pay check to the principal . All in all , the principal did the best he could according to the way he saw things . Johnny paid the midwife and gave the landlord the next month 's rent . He got a little frightened when he realized that now there was a baby and that Katie would n't be strong enough to do much for72 A Tree Grows in Brooklynquite some time , and that they were out of a job . He consoled himself finally with the thought that the rent was paid and that they were safe for thirty days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon , he walked over to tell Mary Rommely about the new baby . On the way there , he stopped at the rubber factory and asked for Sissy 's foreman . He asked the man to tell her about the baby and would she stop over after work ? The foreman said he would , winked , poked Johnny in the ribs and said , " Good for you , Mac . " Johnny grinned and gave him ten cents with instructions . " Buy a good cigar and smoke it on me . " " I 'll do that , Mac , " promised the foreman . He pumped Johnny 's hand and again promised to tell Sissy . Mary Rommely wept when she heard the news . " The poor child !

" What would I get if I mated a canary with a crow ? " was his argument . After Johnny had escorted his mother-in-law over to his house , he went out looking for work . Katie was glad to see her mother . With the memory of her own birth pangs still lingering , she had knowledge now of what her mother had suffered when she , Katie , was born . She thought of her mother bearing seven children , bringing them up , watching three of them die , and knowing that those who lived were doomed to hunger and hardship . She had a vision that the same cycle was destined for her less than day-old child . She became frantic with worry . " What do I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach her anything more than I , myself , know and I know so little . You are poor , Mother . Johnny and I are poor . The baby will grow up to be poor .

It is said that these stories are plays to be acted out on the stage . I have never spoken to anyone who has seen this great thing . But I heard the lord of our land back in Austria say that some of the pages sing themselves like songs . " " Is Shakespeare a book in the German ? " " It is of the English .

She did n't even take time to brush the gray rubber powder from her hair bow . She went into choking hysterics over the baby , pronouncing it the most beautiful baby in the world . Johnny looked skeptical . The baby looked blue and wizened to him and he felt that there must be something wrong with it . Sissy washed the baby . ( It must have been bathed a dozen times the first day . ) She rushed out to the delicatessen store and beguiled the man into letting her open a charge account until Saturday payday . She bought two dollars ' worth of delicacies : sliced tongue , smoked salmon , creamy-white slices of smoked sturgeon and crisp rolls . She bought a sack of charcoal and made the fire roar . She brought a tray of supper in to Katie , then she and Johnny sat in the kitchen and ate together . The house smelled of warmth , good food , sweet powder and the stronger candy-like smell that came from a hard chalkish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chain around her neck . Johnny studied Sissy as he smoked an after-supper cigar . He wondered what criterion people used when they applied the tags " good " and " bad " to their fellowmen . Take Sissy . She was bad .

" BooK Two 79When Sissy announced that she was going to stay the night , Katie looked worried and said there was but the one bed which she and Johnny shared . Sissy declared that she was willing to sleep with Johnny if he could guarantee her a fine baby like Francie . Katie frowned . She knew Sissy was joking of course . Yet there was somethingtrue and direct about Sissy . She started to give her a lecture . Johnny cut the whole thing short by saying he had to get over to the school . He could n't bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He hunted up his brother , Georgic , who was working that night . Fortunately , they needed another man to wait tables and sing inbetween . Johnny got the job and was promised another for the following week . He drifted back into the singing waiter business and from that time on never worked at any other job . Sissy got into bed with Katie and they talked most of the night away . Katie told of her worry about Johnny and her fears of the future . They talked about Mary Rommely ; what a good mother she was to Evy and Sissy and Katie . They spoke of their father , Thomas Rommely . Sissy said he was an old rip and Katie said Sissy ought to show more respect . Sissy said , " Oh , fudge ! " and Katie laughed . Katie told Sissy of the talk she had had with their mother that day .

The loud banging at three o'clock in the morning woke the other tenants . They pounded on the ceiling from below and on the floor from above . Sissy threw Katie into another spasm of giggles by mumbling from the closet that the tenants had a nerve raising such a racket when there was a sick woman in the house . " How can anybody sleep ? " she asked , giving the last nail a terrific bang . The bank in place , she put on her nightgown again , started off the land account by putting a nickel in the bank and got back into bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two books. 8o A Tree Grows in BrooklynShe promised that she would get the two books ; they would be her christening present to the baby . Francie spent her first night on earth sleeping snugly between her mother and Sissy . The next day , Sissy set about getting the two books . She went to a public library and asked the librarian how she could get a Shake- speare and a Bible for keeps . The librarian could n't help her out on the Bible but said there was a worn-out copy of Shakespeare in the files , about to be discarded which Sissy could have . She bought it . It was a tattered old volume containing all of the plays and sonnets . It had intricate footnotes and detailed explanations as to the play- wright 's meaning . There was a biography and picture of the author and steel-cut engravings illustrating scenes from each play . It was printed in small type , two columns to the page on thin paper . It cost Sissy twenty-five cents . The Bible , while a little harder to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact , it cost Sissy nothing . It had a name , Gideon , on the front . A few days after buying the volume of Shakespeare , Sissy woke up one morning and nudged her current lover , with whom she was spending the night in a quiet family hotel . " John , " ( she called him John although his name was Charlie ) , " what 's that book on the dresser ? " " A Bible . " " A Protestant Bible ? " " That 's right . " " I 'm going to hook it . " " Go ahead . That 's why they put it there . " " No ! " " Yeah ! " " No kidding ! " " People swipe it , read it , reform and repent .

" " How do you know you wo n't ? " " I never listen to what people tell me and I ca n't read . The only way I know what is right and wrong is the way I feel about things . If I feel bad , it 's wrong . If I feel good , it 's right . And I feel good being here with you . " She threw her arm across his chest and exploded a kiss in his ear . " I sure wish we could get married , Sissy . " " So do I , John . I know we could hit it off . For awhile , anyhow , " she added honestly . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic religion . No divorce . " " I do n't believe in divorce anyhow , " said Sissy who always remarried without the benefit of a divorce . " You know what , Sissy ? " " What ? " " You got a heart of gold . " " No kidding ? " " No kidding . " He watched her snap a red silk garter over the sheer lisle stocking she had just pulled up over her shapely leg . " Give us a kiss , " he begged suddenly . " Have we time ? " she asked in a practical way . But she pulled the stocking off again . That 's how the library of Francie Nolan was started. 1XFRANCIE WAS N'T MUCH OF A BABY . SHE WAS SKINNYand had a blue look and did n't thrive . Katie nursed her doggedly although the neighbor women told her that her milk was bad for the child . Francie was put on the bottle soon enough because Katie 's milk stopped suddenly when the child was three months old . Katie worried . She consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but said nothing . Katie went to the midwife for advice . The woman asked her a foolish question . " Where do you buy your fish of a Friday ? " " Paddy 's market . Why ? " " You would n't be after seeing an old woman in there buying a codfish head for her cat , would you now ? " " Yes . I see her every week . " " She did it ! She dried up your milk on you . " " Oh , no ! " " She put the eye on you . " " But why ? " " Jealous she is because you 're too happy with that pretty Irish lad of yours . " " Jealous ? An old woman like that ? " " A witch she is . I knew her back in the old country . Sure and did n't she come over on the same boat as meself . When she was young she was in love with a wild County Kerry boy . And did n't he go and get her that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two 83when her old father went after him . He slipped away on a boat for America in the dead of the night . Her baby died when it was born .

" " ' T was then she put the eye on you . " " How can I get my milk back ? " " I 'll tell you what you must do . Wait until the moon is Lull . Then make a little image out of a lock of your curling hair , a cutting from your finger nail and a bit of rag sprinkled with holy water .

That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon was full , she made the little doll and stabbed it and stabbed it . She remained dry . Francie sickened on the bottle . In desperation , Katie called Sissy in for advice . Sissy listened to the witch story . " A witch my foot , " she said scornfully . " It was Johnny who did it and it was n't with an eye . " In that way Katie knew that she was pregnant again . She told Johnny and he started to worry . He had been fairly happy back in the singing waiter business and he worked pretty often , was steady , did n't drink too much and brought home most of his money . The news that a second child was on the way made him feel trapped . He was only twenty and Katie was eighteen . He felt that they were both so young and so defeated already . He went out and got drunk after he heard the news . The midwife came around later to see how the charm had worked . Katie told her that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not to blame . The midwife lifted her skirt and dug down into a capacious pocket made in her petticoat . She brought up a bottle of evil-looking dark brown stuff . " Sure and there is nothing to worry about , " she said . " A good dose of this night and morning for three days and you 'll come around again . " Katie shook her head negatively . " You 're not afraid of what the priest would be saying to you if you did it ? " " No . It 's just that I could n't kill anything . " 84 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " It would n't be killing . It do n't count until you 've felt life . You'renot after feeling it move , are you ? " " No ? " There ! " she slammed her fist on the table triumphantly . " I 'll only be charging you a dollar for the bottle . " " Thank you , I do n't want it . " " Do n't be foolish . You 're just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you do be having already . And your man is pretty but not the steadiest boy in the world . " " The way my man is , is my own business and my baby is no trouble . " " I 'm only after trying to help you out . " " Thank you and goodbye . " The midwife returned the bottle to her petticoat pocket and got up to go . " When your time comes , you know where I live . " At the door , she gave a last bit of optimistic advice . " If you keep running up and down the stairs , maybe you 'll have a miscarriage . " That fall in the false warmth of a Brooklyn Indian summer , Katie sat on the stoop and held her sickly baby against the bigness which was another child soon to be born . Pitying neighbors stopped to commiserateover Francie . " You 'll never raise that one , " they told her . " Her color ai n't good . If the good Lord takes her , it will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a poor family ? There is too many children on this earth already and no room for the weak ones . " " Do n't say that , " Katie held her baby tightly . " It 's not better to die . Who wants to die ? Everything struggles to live . Look at that tree growing up there out of that grating . It gets no sun , and water only when it rains . It 's growing out of sour earth . And it 's strong because its hard struggle to live is making it strong . My children will be strong that way . " " Aw , somebody ought to cut that tree down , the homely thing . " " If there was only one tree like that in the world , you would think it was beautiful , " said Katie . " But because there are so many , you just ca n't see how beautiful it really is . Look at those children . " She pointed to a swarm of dirty children playing in the gutter . " You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dress him up and sit him in a fine house and you would think he was beautiful . " " You 've got fine ideas but a very sick baby , Katie , " they told her . BooK Two 85 " This baby will live , " said Katie fiercely . " I 'll make it live . " And Francie lived , choking and whimpering her way through that first year . Francie 's brother was born a week after her first birthday . This time Katie was not working when the pains came . This time she bit her lip and did not scream out in her agony . Helpless in her pain , she was capable still of laying the foundation for bitterness and capability . When the strong healthy boy , howling at the indignity of the birth process , was put to her breast , she felt a wild tenderness for him . The other baby , Francie , in the crib next her bed , began to whimper . Katie had a flash of contempt for the weak child she had borne a year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . She was quickly ashamed of her contempt . She knew it was n't the little girl 's fault . " I must watch myself carefully , " she thought . " I am going to love this boy more than the girl but I must n't ever let her know . It is wrong to love one child more than the other but this is something that I can not help . " Sissy begged her to call the boy after Johnny but Katie insisted that the boy had a right to a name all his own . Sissy got very angry and told Katie a thing or two . Finally Katie , more in anger than in truth , accused Sissy of being in love with Johnny . Sissy answered , " maybe , " and Katie shut up . She was a little afraid that if they quarreled further , she would find out that it was so about Sissy loving Johnny . Katie called the boy Cornelius after a noble character she had seen a handsome actor represent on the stage . As the boy grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was known as Neeley . Without devious reasoning or complicated emotional processes , the boy became Katie 's whole world . Johnny took second place and Francie went to the back of her mother 's heart . Katie loved the boy because he was more completely hers than either Johnny or Francie . Neeley looked exactly like Johnny . Katie would make him into the kind of man Johnny should have been . He would have everything that was good about Johnny ; she would encourage that . She would stamp out all of the things that were bad about Johnny as they came up in the boy , Neeley . He would grow up and she would be proud of him and he would take care of her all of her days . He was the one that she had to see through . Francie and Johnny would get by some-86 A Tree Grows in Brooklynhow , but she would take no chances with the boy . She 'd see to it that he more than got by . Gradually , as the children grew up , Katie lost all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . She became capable , hard and far-seeing . She loved Johnny dearly but all the old wild worship faded away . She loved her little girl because she felt sorry for her . It was pity and obligation towards her that she felt rather than love . Johnny and Francie felt the growing change in Katie . As the boy grew stronger and handsomer , Johnny grew in weakness and went further and further down hill . Francie felt the way her mother thought about her . She grew an answering hardness against her mother and this hardness , paradoxically enough , brought them a little closer together because it made them more alike . By the time Neeley was a year old , Katie had stopped depending on Johnny . Johnny was drinking heavily . He worked when he was offered one-night jobs . He brought home his wages but kept his tips for liquor . Life was going too swiftly for Johnny . He had a wife and two babies before he was old enough to vote . His life was finished before it had a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it better than Johnny Nolan . Katie had the same hardships as Johnny and she was nineteen , two years younger . It might be said that she , too , was doomed . Her life , too , was over before it began . But there the similarity ended . Johnny knew he was doomed and accepted it . Katie would n't accept it . She started a new life where her old one left off . She exchanged her tenderness for capability . She gave up her dreams and took over hard realities in their place . Katie had a fierce desire for survival which made her a fighter . Johnny had a hankering after immortality which made him a useless dreamer . And that was the great difference between these two who loved each other so well . XItJOHNNY CELEBRATED HIS VOTING BIRTHDAY BY GETTINGdrunk for three days . When he was coming out of it , Katie locked him in the bedroom where he could n't get anything more to drink . Instead of sobering up , he started to get delirium tremens . He wept and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was suffering . She told him it was a good thing , that suffering would harden him , would teach him such a lesson that he 'd stop drinking . But poor Johnny just would n't harden . He softened into a wailing , screaming banshee . Neighbors banged on her door and told her to do something for the poor man . Katie 's mouth set in a hard cold line and she called out to them to mind their own business . But even as she defied the neighbors , she knew that they would have to move as soon as the month was up . They could n't live in the neighborhood after the way Johnny was disgracing them . In the late afternoon , his tortured cries unnerved even Katie . Crowdingthe two babies in the buggy she went over to the factory and had Sissy 's long-suffering foreman get her away from her machine . She told Sissy about Johnny , and Sissy said she 'd come over and fix him up as soon as she could get away . Sissy consulted a gentleman friend about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she bought a half pint of good whiskey , concealed it between her full breasts and laced her corset cover and buttoned her dress over it . She went over to Katie 's and told her that if she could be left alone with Johnny she 'd get him out of it . Katie locked Sissy in the bedroom8788 A Tree Grows in Brooklynwith Johnny . She went back into the kitchen and spent the night with her head on her arms on the table , waiting . When Johnny saw Sissy , his poor mixed-up brain unscrambled for a minute and he grabbed her arm . " You 're my friend , Sissy . You 're my sister . For God 's sake give me a drink . " " Take it slow , Johnny , " she said in her soft comforting voice . " I 've got a drink right here for you . " She unbuttoned her waist releasing a cascade of foaming white embroidered ruffles and dark pink ribbon . The room filled up with the sweet scent of the warm strong sachet she used . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her corset cover . The poor fellow remembered her reputation and misunderstood . " No , no , Sissy . Please ! " he moaned . " Do n't be a dockle , Johnny . There 's a time and a place for everything and this is n't the time . " She pulled out the bottle . He grabbed it . It was warm from her . She let him take a long drink , then she dug the bottle out of his clutching fingers . He quieted down after the drink ; got sleepy and begged her not to go away . She promised . Without bothering to tie up her ribbons or button her waist , she lay on the bed beside him . She put her arm under his shoulders and he rested his cheek on her bare warm-scented breast . He slept and tears came from under his closed lids and they were warmer than the flesh they fell on . She lay awake , holding him in her arms and staring into the darkness . She felt towards him as she would have felt towards her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She stroked his curling hair and smoothed his cheek gently . When he moaned in his sleep , she soothed him with the kind of words she would have spoken to her babies . Her arm cramped and she tried to move it . He woke up for a moment , clutched her tightly and begged her not to leave him . When he spoke to her , he called her mother . Whenever he woke up and got afraid , she gave him a swallow of whiskey . Towards morning he woke . His head was clearer but he said it hurt . He jerked away from her and moaned . " Come back to mama , " she said in her soft fluttering voice . She opened her arms wide and once more he crept into them and rested his cheek on her generous breast . He wept quietly . He sobbed out his fears and his worries and his bewilderment at the way things were in the world . She let him talk , she let him weep . She held himBoox Two 89the way his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never did ) . Sometimes Sissy wept with him . When he had talked himself out , she gave him what was left of the whiskey and at last he fell into a deep exhausted sleep . She lay very still for a long time not wanting him to feel her withdrawingfrom him . Towards dawn , his tight holding of her hand relaxed ; peace came into his face and made it boyish again . Sissy put his head on the pillow , expertly undressed him and put him under the covers . She threw the empty whiskey bottle down the airshaft . She figured that what Katie did n't know could n't possibly bother her . She tied her pink ribbons carelessly and adjusted her waist . She closed the door very softly when she went out . Sissy had two great failings . She was a great lover and a great mother . She had so much of tenderness in her , so much of wanting to give of herself to whoever needed what she had , whether it was her money , her time , the clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friendship or her companionship and love . She was mother to everything that came her way . She loved men , yes . She loved women too , and old people and especially children . How she loved children ! She loved the down-and-outers . She wanted to make everybody happy , She had tried to seduce the good priest who heard her infrequent confessions because she felt sorry for him . She thought he was missing the greatest joy on earth by being committed to a life of celibacy . She loved all the scratching curs on the street and wept for the gaunt scavenging cats who slunk around Brooklyn corners with their sides swollen looking for a hole in which they might bring forth their young . She loved the sooty sparrows and thought that the very grass that grew in the lots was beautiful . She picked bouquets of white clover in the lots believing they were the most beautiful flowers God ever made . Once she saw a mouse in her room . The next night she set out a tiny box for him with cheese @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's troubles but no one listened to hers . But that was right because Sissy was a giver and never a taker . When Sissy came into the kitchen , Katie looked at Sissy 's disordered clothing with swollen and suspicious eyes . " I 'm not forgetting , " she said with pitiful dignity , " that you are my sister . And I hope you remembered that , too . " 190 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " Do n't be such a heimdickischer ass , " said Sissy , knowing what Katie meant . But she smiled deeply into Katie 's eyes . Katie was suddenly reassured . " How 's Johnny ? " " Johnny will be fine when he wakes up . But for Christ 's sweet sake , do n't nag him when he wakes up . Do n't nag him , Katie . " " But he 's got to be told . . . . " " If I hear that you nag him , I 'll get him away from you . I swear it . Even though I am your sister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little frightened . " I wo n't then , " she mumbled . " Not this time . " " Now you 're growing up into a woman , " approved Sissy as she kissed Katie 's cheek . She felt sorry for Katie as well as for Johnny . Katie broke down then and cried . She made hard ugly noises because she hated herself for crying , yet could n't help it . Sissy had to listen , to go through again all she had gone through with Johnny , only this time from Katie 's angle . Sissy handled Katie differently than she had handled Johnny . She had been gentle and maternal with Johnny because he needed that . Sissy acknowledged the steeliness that was in Katie . She hardened to that steeliness as Katie finished her story . " And now you know it all , Sissy . Johnny 's a drunk . " " Well , everybody 's something . We all got a tag of some kind . Take me now : I never took a drink in my life . But do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance , " that there are some people who talk about me and call me a bad woman ? Can you imagine that ? I admit that I smoke a Sweet Caporal once in awhile . But bad . . . . " " Well , Sissy , the way you carry on with men makes people . . . " " Katie ! Do n't nag ! All of us are what we have to be and everyone lives the kind of life it 's in him to live . You 've got a good man , Katie . " " But he drinks . " " And he always will until he dies . There it is . He drinks . You must take that along with the rest . " " What rest ? You mean the not working , the staying out all night , the bums he has for friends ? " " You married him . There was something about him that caught your heart . Hang on to that and forget the rest . " " Sometimes , I do n't know why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why you married him . You married himBooK Two 91because you wanted him to sleep with you but you were too religious to take a chance without a church wedding . " " How you talk . The whole thing was that I wanted to get him away from someone else . " " It was the sleeping . It always is . If it is good , the marriage is good . If it is bad , the marriage is bad . " " No . There are other things . " " What other things ? Well , maybe there are , " conceded Sissy . " If there are other good things too , that 's so much velvet . " " You 're wrong . That might be important to you , but . . . " " It 's important to everybody or should be . Then all marriages would be happy . " " Oh , I admit that I liked the way he danced , how he sang a song ... the way he looked . . . " " You 're saying what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How can you win out with a person like Sissy , thought Katie . She 's got everything figured out her way . Maybe her way is a good way to figure things out . I do n't know . She is my own sister but people talk about her . She is a bad girl and there is no getting around that . When she dies , her soul will wander through Purgatory through all eternity . I have often told her that and she always answered that it would n't wander alone . If Sissy dies before I do , I must have masses said for the repose of her soul . Maybe after awhile she 'll get out of Purgatory because even if they say she is bad , she is good to all the people in the world who are lucky enough to run across her . God will have to take that into consideration . Suddenly Katie leaned over and kissed Sissy on the cheek . Sissy was astonished because she could not know Katie 's thoughts . " Maybe you 're right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes down to this : Aside from his drinking , I love everything else about Johnny and I will try to be good to him . I will try to overlook ... " She said no more . In her heart , Katie knew that she was not the overlooking kind . Francie lay awake in the wash basket set up near the kitchen range . She lay sucking her thumb and listening to the conversation . But she learned nothing from it ; being but two years old at the time. rwsi.w . XIIKATIE WAS ASHAMED TO STAY IN THE NEIGHBORHOODafter Johnny 's great spree . A good many of the neighbors ' husbands were no better than Johnny , of course , but that was no standard for Katie . She wanted the Nolans to be better and not as good as anybody . Too , there was the question of money . Although it was no question because they had very little and now there were two children . Katie looked around for a place where she could work for their rent . At least , they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house where she would get rent free in return for keeping it clean . Johnny swore that he would n't have his wife a janitress . Katie told him in her new crisp hard way that it was janitor or no home , as it was harder and harder each month to get the rent money together . Johnny finally gave in after promising that he would do all of the janitor work until he got a steady job when they would move again . Katie packed their few belongings : a double bed , the babies ' crib , a busted-down baby buggy , a green plush parlor suit , a carpet with pink roses , a pair of parlor lace curtains , a rubber plant and a rose geranium , a yellow canary in a gilt cage , a plush picture album , a kitchen table and some chairs , a box of dishes and pots and pans , a gilt crucifix with a music box in its base that played " Ave Maria " when you wound it up , a plain wooden crucifix that her mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a roll of bedding , a pile of Johnny 's sheet music and two books , the Bible and the Complete Works of Wm . Shakespeare . Boox Two 93There was such a little bit of stuff that the ice man could load it all on his wagon and his one shaggy little horse could pull it . The four Nolans rode along on the ice wagon to their new home . The last thing Katie did in their old home after it had been stripped bare and had that look of a near-sighted man with his glasses off , was to rip up the tin-can bank . It had three dollars and eighty cents in it . Out of that she knew regretfully , she would have to give the ice man a dollar for moving them . The first thing she did in the new home , while Johnny was helping the ice man carry in the furniture , was to nail down the bank in a closet . She put two dollars and eighty cents back in it . She added a dime from the few pennies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't going to give to the ice man . In Williamsburg , it was the custom to treat the movers to a pint of beer when they had completed their job . But Katie reasoned : " We 'll never see him again . Besides , the dollar is enough . Think of all the ice he 'd have to sell to make a dollar . " While Katie was putting up the lace curtains , Mary Rommely came over and sprinkled the rooms with holy water to drive out any devils that might be lurking in the corners . Who knows ? Protestants might have been living there before . A Catholic might have died in the rooms without the last absolution of the church . The holy water would purify the home again so that God might come in if He chose . The baby Francie crowed with delight as her grandmother held up the cruet and the sun shone through it and made a small fat rainbow on the opposite wall . Mary smiled with the child and made the rainbow dance . " Schone ! Schone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Francie and held out her two hands . Mary let her hold the half-filled cruet while she went to help Katie . Francie was disappointed because the rainbow went away . She thought it must be hidden in the bottle . She poured the holy water out into her lap expecting a rainbow to come slithering from the bottle . Later Katie noticed that she was wet and paddled her softly telling her that she was too big to wet her pants . Mary explained about the holy water . " Ai , the child has but blessed herself and a spanking comes from the blessing . " Katie laughed then . Francie laughed because her mama was n't mad anymore . Neeley exposed his three teeth in a baby laugh . Mary9294 A Tree Grows in Brooklynsmiled at them all and said it was good luck to start life in a new home with laughter . They were settled by supper time . Johnny stayed with the children while Katie went to the grocery store to establish credit . She told the grocer she had just moved into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until Saturday payday ? The grocer obliged . He gave her a bag of groceries and a little book in which he jotted down her indebtedness . He told her she was to bring the book along each time she came to " trust . " With that little ceremony , Katie 's family was assured of food until the next money came in . After supper , Katie read the babies to sleep . She read a page of the introduction to Shakespeare and a page of begats from the Bible . That was as far as she had gotten to date . Neither the babies nor Katie understood what it was all about . The reading made Katie very drowsy but doggedly she finished the two pages . She covered the babies carefully , then she and Johnny went to bed too . It was only eight o'clock but they were tired out from moving . The Nolans slept in their new home on Lorimer Street which was still in Williamsburg but almost near where Greenpoint began . XIII JORIMER STREET WAS MORE REFINED THAN BOGARTStreet . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were affluent enough not to have to live in the rooms in back of the store . The flat had a bathroom . The tub was an oblong wooden box lined with zinc . Francie could n't get over the wonder of it when it was filled with water . It was the largest body of water she had seen up to that time . To her baby eyes , it seemed like an ocean . They liked the new home . Katie and Johnny kept the cellar , halls , the roof , and the sidewalk before the house spotlessly clean in return for their rent . There was no airshafts . There was a window in each bedroom and three each in the kitchen and front room . The first autumn there was pleasant . The sun came in all day long . They were warm that first winter , too . Johnny worked fairly steadily , did not drink much and there was money for coal . When summer came , the children spent most of the day outdoors on the stoop . They were the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stoop . Francie , who was going on four , had to mind Neeley , who was going on three . She sat for long hours on the stoop with her thin arms hugging her thin legs and with her straight brown hair blowing in the slow breeze that came laden with the salt smell of the sea , the sea which was so near-by and which she had never seen . She kept an eye on Neeley as he scrambled up and down the steps . She sat , rocking to and fro , wondering about many things : 9596 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn BOOS Two 97what made the wind blow and what was grass and why Neeley was a boy instead of a girl like her . Sometimes Francie and Neeley sat regarding each other with steady eyes . his eyes were the same as hers in shape and depth but his were a bright clear blue and hers a dark clear gray . There was steady unbrokencommunication between the two children . Neeley spoke very little and Francie spoke a lot . Sometimes Francie talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upright on the steps with his head against the iron rail . Francie did " stitching " that summer . Katie bought her a square of goods for a penny . It was the size of a lady 's handkerchief and had a design outlined on it : a sitting Newfoundland dog with his tongue lolling out . Another penny bought a small reel of red embroidery cotton and two cents went for a pair of small hoops . Francie 's grandmothertaught her how to work the running stitches . The child became adept at stitching . Women passing would stop and cluck in pitying admiration at the tiny girl , a deep line already showing at the inner edge of her right eyebrow , pushing the needle in and out of the taut material while Neeley hung over her to watch the bright sliver of steel disappear like magic and then come back up again through the cloth . Sissy gave her a fat little cloth strawberry for cleaning the needle . When Neeley got restless , Francie let him push the needle through the strawberry for awhile . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squares and then sew them together to make a bedspread . Francie heard that some ladies had actually made a bedspread that way and that was Francie 's great ambition . But though she worked intermittentlyon the square all summer , autumn found it only half done . The bedspread had to be saved for the future . The fall came again , winter , spring and summer . Francie and Nee-ley kept getting bigger , Katie kept working harder and Johnny worked a little less and drank a little more with each season . The reading went on . Sometimes Katie skipped a page when she was tired at night , but most of the time she stuck with it . They were in " Julius Caesar " now and the stage direction " Alarum " confused Katie . She thought it had something to do with fire engines and whenever she came to that word , she shouted out " clang-clang . " The children thought it was wonderful . Pennies accumulated in the tin-can bank . Once it had to be rippedopen and two dollars taken out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into her knee . A dozen times one prong was unfastenedand a nickel fished out with a knife to provide Johnny with car-fare to get to a job . But the rule was that he had to put ten cents back out of his tip money . So the bank profited . On the warm days , Francie played alone on the streets or on the stoop . She yearned for playmates but did not know how to make friends with the other little girls . The other youngsters avoided her because she talked funny . Owing to Katie 's nightly reading , Francie had a queer way of saying things . Once , when taunted by a youngster she had retorted , " Aw , you do n't know what you 're saying . You 're jus ' full of soun ' ' n furry siggaflying nothing . " Once , trying to make friends with a little girl she said , " Wait here and I 'll go in and begat my rope and we 'll play jumping . " " You mean you 'll git your rope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll begat my rope . You do n't git things . You begat things . " " What 's tha  --  egat ? " asked the little girl who was just five years old . " Begat . Like Eve begat Cain . " " You 're buggy . Ladies do n't git canes . Only men git canes when they ca n't walk good . " " Eve begat . She begat Abel too . " " She gits or she do n't git . You know what ? " " What . " " You talk just like a Wop . " " I do not talk like no Wop , " cried Francie . " I talk like . . . like .. . God talks . " " You 'll be struck down dead saying a thing like that . " " I wo n't neither . " " Nobody home upstairs in your house . " The little girl tapped her forehead . " There is so . " " Why do you talk like that then ? " " My mother reads those things to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house , " corrected the little girl . " Well anyhow , my mother ai n't a dirty slob like your mother . " That was the only reply Francie could think of. ii98 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Boo x Two 99The little girl had heard this many times . She was shrewd enough not to debate it . " Well , I 'd sooner have a dirty slob for a mother than a crazy woman . And I 'd rather have no father than a drunken man for my father . " " Slob ! Slob ! Slob ! " shouted Francie passionately . " Crazy , crazy , crazy , " chanted the little girl . " Slob ! Dirty slob , " screamed Francie sobbing in her impotence . The little girl skipped away , her fat curls bouncing in the sun and sang in a clear high voice : " Sticks and stones will break my bones but names will never hurt me . When I die , you will cry for all the names you called me . " And Francie did cry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lonesome and nobody wanted to play with her . The rougher children found Francie too quiet and the better behaved ones seemed to shun her . Dimly , Francie felt that it was n't all her fault . It had something to do with Aunt Sissy who came to the house so often , the way Sissy looked and the way the men in the neighborhood looked after Sissy when she passed . It had something to do with the way papa could n't walk straight sometimes and walked sideways down the street when he came home . It had something to do with the way neighbor women asked her questions about papa and mama and Sissy . Their wheedling offhand questions did not deceive Francie . Had not mama warned her : " Do n't let the neighbors pick on you . " So in the warm summer days the lonesome child sat on her stoop and pretended disdain for the group of children playing on the sidewalk . Francie played with imaginary companions and made believe that they were better than real children . But all the while her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song the children sang while walking around in a ring with hands joined . Walter , Walter Wildflower . Growing up so high . As we are all young ladies And very sure to die . Excepting Lizzie Wehner Who is the finest flower . Hide , hide , hide for shame . Turn your back andTell your beau 's name . They paused while the chosen girl , after much coaxing , finally whispered a boy 's name . Francie wondered what name she 'd give if they ever asked her to play . Would they laugh if she whispered Johnny Nolan ? The little girls whooped when Lizzie whispered a name . Again they joined hands and walked around in a circle genially advertising the boy . Hermy BachmeierIs a fine young man . He comes to the doorWith his hat in his hand . Down comes sheAll dressed in silk . Tomorrow , tomorrow , The wedding shall begin . The girls stopped and clapped their hands joyously . Then without motivation , there was a change in mood . The girls went around the ring slower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . Send for the doctor , Quick , quick , quick ! Doctor , Doctor , shall I die ? Yes , my darling , By and by . How many coaches shall I have ? Enough for you andYour family , too . In other neighborhoods there were different words to the song but essentially it was the same game . No one knew where the words had come from . Little girls learned them from other little girls and it was the most frequently played game in Brooklyn . There were other games . There were jacks that two little girls could play together sitting on the steps of a stoop . Francie played jacks by herself , first being Francie and then her opponent . She 'd talk to the imaginary player . " I 'm for threesies and you 're for twosies , " she 'd say. loo A Tree Grows in BrooklynPotsy was a game that the boys started and the girls finished . A couple of boys would put a tin can on the car track and sit along the curb and watch with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 'd fold it and put it on the track again . Again it was flattened , folded and flattened again . Soon there was a flat heavy square of metal . Numbered squares were marked off on the sidewalk and the game was turned over to the girls who hopped on one foot pushing the potsy from , square to square . Who ever got through the squares with the least number of hops won the game . Francie made a potsy . She put a can on the tracks . She watched with a professional frown as the car ran over it . She shuddered in delighted horror when she heard the scrunch . Would the motorman be mad , she wondered , if he knew that she was making his trolley car work for her ? She made the squares but could only write one and seven . She hopped through a game ardently wishing someone were playing with her as she was sure she won with less hops than any other little girl in the world . Sometimes there was music in the streets . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A three-piece band came around once a week . They wore ordinary suits but funny hats , like a motorman 's hat only the top was squashed in . When Francie heard the children shouting , " Here comes the Biebleboobers , " she 'd run out on the street , sometimes dragging Neeley with her . ! The band consisted of a fiddle , drum and cornet . The men played old Viennese airs and if they did n't play well , they at least played loud . Little girls waltzed with each other , round and round on the warm summer sidewalks . There were always two boys who did a grotesque dance together , mimicking the girls and bumping into them rudely . When the girls got angry , the boys would bow with great exaggeration ( being sure their buttocks would bump another dancing couple ) , and apologize in flowery language . Francie wished she could be one of the brave ones who took no part in the dancing but stood close to the hornblower sucking noisily on big dripping pickles . This made saliva flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If provoked enough , he 'd let out a string of oaths in German ending up with something that sounded like Gott verdammte Ehrlandiger Jude . Most Brooklyn Germans had a habit of calling everyone who annoyed them a Jew . Francie was fascinated by the money angle . After two songs , theBooK Two I0Ifiddle and horn carried on alone while the drummer went around hat in hand ungraciously accepting the pennies doled out to him . After canvassing the street , he 'd stand on the curb 's edge and look up at the house windows . Women wrapped two pennies in a bit of newspaper and tossed them down . The newspaper was essential . Any pennies thrown loose were considered fair game by the boys and they scrambled for them , picked them up and ran off down the street with an angry musician after them . For some reason , they would n't try to get the wrapped pennies . They 'd pick them up sometimes and hand them to the musicians . It was some sort of code that made them agree as to whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 'd play another song . If the take was meager , they 'd move on hoping for greener fields . Francie , usually dragging Neeley along , often followed the musicians from stop to stop , street to street , until it got dark and time for the musicians to disband . Francie was but one of a crowd as many children followed the band Pied Piper fashion . Many of the little girls towed baby brothers and sisters along , some in home-made wagons , others in busted-down baby buggies . The music cast such a spell over them that they forgot about home and eating . And the little babies cried , wet their pants , slept , woke to cry again , wet their pants again and to sleep again . And " The Beautiful Blue Danube " played on and on . Francie thought the musicians had a fine life . She made plans , When Neeley got bigger , he would play the hot-hot ( his name for an accordian ) and she would bang a tambourine on the street and people would throw them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to work anymore . Although she followed the band , Francie liked the organ grinder better . Every once in a while a man came around lugging a small organ with a monkey perched atop it . The monkey wore a red jacket with gold braid and a red pill box hat strapped under his chin . His red pants had a convenient hole in them so that his tail could stick out . Francie loved that monkey . She 'd give him her precious penny-forcandyjust for the happiness of seeing him tip his hat to her . If mama was around , she 'd come out with a penny that should have gone into the tin-can bank and give it to the man with sharp instructions not to mistreat his monkey ; and if he did and she found out , she would report him . The Italian never understood a word she said and always102 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn made the same answer . He pulled off his hat , bowed humbly with a little crook of the leg and called out eagerly , " Si , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that came around it was like a fiesta . The organ was pulled by a dark curly-haired man with very white teeth . He wore green velveteen pants and a brown corduroy jacket from which hung a red bandana handkerchief . He wore one hoop earring . The woman who helped him pull the organ wore a swirling red skirt and a yellow blouse and large hoop earrings . The music tinkled out shrilly , a song from Carmen or Il Trovatore . The woman shook a dirty , be-ribboned tambourine and listlessly punched it with her elbow in time to the music . At the end of a song , she 'd twirl suddenly showing her stout legs in dirty white cotton stockings and a flash of multi-colored petticoats . Francie never noticed the dirt and the lassitude . She heard the music and saw the flashing colors and felt the glamor of a picturesque people . Katie warned her never to follow the big organ . Katie said that those organ grinders who dressed up so were Sicilians . And all the world knew that the Sicilians belonged to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidnapped little children and held them for ransom . They took the child and left a note saying to leave a hundred dollars in the cemetery and signed it with the black imprint of a hand . That 's what mama said about those organ grinders . For days after the organ grinder had been around , Francie played organ grinder . She hummed what she recalled of Verdi and bumped her elbow on an old pie tin pretending it was a tambourine . She ended the game by drawing an outline of her hand on paper and filling it in with black crayon . Sometimes Francie wavered . She did n't know whether it would be better to be a band when she grew up or an organ grinder lady . It would be nice if she and Neeley could get a little organ and a cute monkey . All day they could have fun with him for nothing and go around playing and watching him tip his hat . And people would give them a lot of pennies and the monkey could eat with them and maybe sleep in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able that Francie announced her intentions to mama but Katie threw cold water on the project telling her not to be silly ; that monkies had fleas and she would n't allow a monkey in one of her clean beds . Francie toyed with the idea of being a tambourine lady . But thenBooK Two 103 ' she 'd have to be a Sicilian and kidnap little children and she did n't want to do that , although drawing a black hand was fun . There was always the music . There were songs and dancing on the Brooklyn streets in those long ago summers and the days should have been joyous . But there was something sad about those summers , something sad about the children , thin in body but with the baby curves still lingering in their faces , singing in sad monotony as they went through the figures of a ring game . It was sad the way they were still babies of four and five years of age but so precocious about taking care of themselves . " The Blue Danube " that the band played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sad eyes under his bright red cap . The organ grinder 's tune was sad under its lilting shrillness . Even the minstrels who came in the back yards and sang , If I had my way , You would never grow old. were sad , too . They were bums and they were hungry and they did n't have talent for song-making . All they had in the world was the nerve to stand in a back yard with cap in hand and sing loudly . The sad thing was in the knowing that all their nerve would get them nowherein the world and that they were lost as all people in Brooklyn seem lost when the day is nearly over and even though the sun is still bright , it is thin and does n't give you warmth when it shines on you .

It was Sissy 's business with the tricycle and the balloons that ruined and disgraced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decided to go over and look after Francie and Neeley while Katie was working . A block before she got to their house , her eyes were dazzled by the sun glinting off the brass handlebar of a handsome tricycle . It was a kind of vehicle that you do n't see nowadays . It had a wide leather seat , big enough for two little children , with a back to it and an iron steering bar leading to the small front wheel . There were two larger wheels in the back . There was a handlebar of solid brass on top the steering rod . The pedals were in front of the seat and a child sat in it at ease , pedaled it while leaning back in the seat and steered it with the handlebars which lay across the lap . Sissy saw that tricycle standing there unattended in front of a stoop . She did n't hesitate . She took the tricycle , pulled it around to the Nolan house , got the children out and gave them a ride . Francie thought it was wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled them around the block .

Francie thought that if she touched it , it would burn her hand surely . Then something happened . A small crowd bore down on them headed by a hysterical womanI04BooK Two 105and a bawling boy . The woman rushed at Sissy yelling " Robber ! " She grabbed the handlebars and pulled . Sissy held on tightly . Francie almost got thrown out . The cop on the beat came rushing up . " What 's this ? What 's this ? " Thus he took over . " This lady is a robber , " reported the woman . " She stole my little boy 's tricycle . " " I did n't steal it , Sergeant , " said Sissy in her soft appealing voice . " It was just standing there and standing there so I borrowed it to give the kids a ride . They never rode in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a kid . It 's just heaven . " The cop stared at the mute children in the seat . Francie grinned at him in trembling panic . " I was only going to ride them once around the block and then take it back . Honest , Sarge . " The cop let his eyes rest on Sissy 's well-shaped bust which was not spoiled any by the tight waists that she liked to wear . He turned to the harassed mother . " Why do you want to be so stingy for , Lady ? " he said . " Let her give the kids a ride around the block . It ai n't no skin off your teeth . " ( Only he did n't say " teeth " to the snickering delight of the youngsters clustered around . ) " Let her give them a spin and I 'll see that you get the bike back safe . " He was the law . What could the woman do ? The cop gave the bawling kid a nickel and told him to shut up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send for the pie wagon and take them all down to the station house if they did n't twenty-three skidoo . The crowd scattered . The cop , swinging his club , gallantly escorted Sissy and her charges around the block . Sissy looked up at him and smiled into his eyes . Whereupon he stuck his club in his belt and insisted on pulling the bike for her . Sissy trotted along beside him on her tiny high-heeled shoes and cast a spell over him with her soft fluttering voice . They walked around the block three times , the cop pretending not to notice the hands that went up to hide smiles as the people saw a fully-uniformed officer of the law so engaged . He talked warmly to Sissy , mostly about his wife who was a good woman , you understand , but you know , a kind of invalid . Sissy said she understood . After the bike episode , people talked . They talked enough about Johnny coming home drunk once in awhile and about how the meno6 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn BOOK Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . Katie thought of moving . It was getting like Bogart Street where the neighbors knew too much about the Nolans . While Katie was thinking about looking for another place , something else happened and they had to move right away . The thing that finally drove them from Lorimer Street was stark raw sex . Only it was very innocent looked at in the right way . One Saturday afternoon , Katie had an odd job at Gorling 's , a large department store in Williamsburg . She fixed coffee and sandwiches for the Saturday night supper that the boss gave the girls in lieu of overtime money . Johnny was at Union Headquarters waiting for a job to find him . Sissy was n't working that day . Knowing that the children would be left alone locked in the rooms , she decided to keep them company . She knocked at the door calling out that she was Aunt Sissy . Francie opened the door on the chain to make sure before she let her in .

Today she brought a sweet-smelling cedar cigar box , several sheets of tissue paper , some red and some white , and a jar of paste . They sat around the kitchen table and went to work decorating the box . Sissy outlined circles on the paper with a quarter and Francie cut them out . Sissy showed her how to make them into little paper cups by molding the circles around the end of a pencil . When they had a lot of cups made , Sissy drew a heart on the box cover . The bottom of each red cup was given a dab of paste and the cup was pasted on the penciled heart . The heart was filled in with red cups . The rest of the lid was filled in with white . When the top was finished it looked like a bed of closely-packed white carnations with a heart of red ones . The sides were filled in with white cups and the inside lined with red tissue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was that beautiful . The box took up most of the afternoon . Sissy had a chop suey date at five and she got ready to leave . Francie clung to her and begged her not to go . Sissy hated to leave , yet she did n't want to miss her date . She searched in her purse for something to amuse them in her absence . They stood at her knee helping her look . Francie spied a cigarette box and pulled it out . On the cover was a picture of a man lying on a couch , knees crossed , one foot dangling in the air and smoking a cigarette which made a big smoke ring over his head . In the ring was a picture of a girl with her hairin her eyes and her bust popping out of her dress . The name on the box was American Dreams . It was out of the stock at Sissy 's factory . The children clamored for the box . Sissy reluctantly let them have it after explaining that the box contained cigarettes and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any circumstances to be opened . They must not touch the seals , she said . After she left , the children amused themselves for a time by staring at the picture . They shook the box . A dull swishing mysterious sound resulted . " They is snakes in there and not zingarettes , " decided Neeley . " No , " corrected Francie . " Worms are in there . Live ones . " They argued , Francie saying the box was too small for snakes and Neeley insisting that they were rolled-up snakes like herring in a glass jar . Curiosity grew to such a pitch that Sissy 's instructions were forgotten . The seals were so lightly pasted , it was a simple matter to pull them off . Francie opened the box . There was a sheet of soft dulled tin foil over the contents . Francie lifted the foil carefully . Neeley prepared to crawl under the table if the snakes became active . But there were neither snakes , worms nor cigarettes in the box and its contents were very uninteresting . After trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest , clumsily tied the contents of the box to a string , trailed the string out of the window and finally secured the string by shutting the window on it . They then took turns jumping on the denuded box and became so absorbed in breaking it into bits that they forgot all about the string hanging out of the window . Consequently , there was a great surprise waiting for Johnny when he sauntered home to get a fresh dicky and collar for his evening 's job . He took one look and his face burned with shame . He told Katie when she came home . Katie questioned Francie closely and found out everything . Sissy was condemned . That night after the children had been put to bed and Johnny was away working , Katie sat in her dark kitchen with blushes coming and going . Johnny went about his work with a dull feeling that the world had come to an end . Evy came over later in the evening and she and Katie discussed Sissy . " That 's the end , Katie , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does is her own business until her own business makes a thing like this108 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn Boo K Two 109happen . I 've got a growing girl , so have you , we must n't let Sissy come into our homes again . She 's bad and there 's no getting around it . " " She 's good in many ways , " temporized Katie . " You say that after what she did to you today ? " " Well . . . I guess you 're right . Only do n't tell Mother . She does n't know how Sissy lives and Sissy is her eye-apple . " When Johnny came home , Katie told him that Sissy was never to come to their house again . Johnny sighed and said he guessed that was the only thing to do . Johnny and Katie talked away the night and in the morning , they had their plans all made for moving when the end of the month came . Katie found a janitor place on Grand Street in Williamsburg . She took up the tin-can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight dollars in it . Two had to go to the movers , the rest was put back when the can was nailed down in the new home . Again Mary Rommely came and sprinkled the flat with holy water . Again there was the settling process and the establishing of trust or credit at the neighborhood stores . There was resigned regret that the new flat was not as nice as their Lorimer Street home . They lived on the top floor instead of the ground floor . There was no stoop as a store occupied the street floor of the house . There was no bathroom and the toilet was in the half and shared by two families . The only bright spot was that the roof was theirs . By an unwritten agreement , the roof belonged to the people who lived on the top floor as the yard belonged to the people who lived on the first floor . Another advantage was that there was no one living overhead to make vibrations on the ceiling and cause the Welsbach gas mantle to crumble into powder . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the roof . She saw a whole new world . Not far away was the lovely span of the Williamsburg Bridge . Across the East River , like a fairy city made of silver cardboard , the skyscrapers loomed cleanly . There was the Brooklyn Bridge further away like an echo of the nearer bridge . " It 's pretty , " said Francie . " It 's pretty the same way pictures of in-the-country are pretty . " " I go over that bridge sometimes when I go to work , " Johnny said . Francie looked at him in wonder . He went over that magic bridge and still talked and looked like always ? She could n't get over it . She put out her hand and touched his arm . Surely the wonderful experience of going over that bridge would make him feel different . She was disappointed because his arm felt as it had always felt . At the child 's touch , Johnny put his arm around her and smiled down at her . " How old are you , Prima Donna ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be going to school in September . " " No . Mama said I must wait until next year till Neeley 's old enough so we can start together . " " Why ? " ? " So we can help each other against the older kids who might lick us if there was only one . " " Your mother thinks of everything . " Francie turned around and looked at the other roofs . Near-by was one with a pigeon coop on it . The pigeons were safely locked up . But the pigeon owner , a youth of seventeen , stood on the edge of the roof with a long bamboo stick . It had a rag on the end and the boy stood waving the stick in circles . Another flock of pigeons was flying around in a circle . One of them left the group to follow the flying rag . The boy lowered the stick cautiously and the silly pigeon followed the rag . The boy grabbed him and stuck him in the coop . Francie was distressed . " The boy stole a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his , " said Johnny . " But the poor pigeon , taken away from his relations . Maybe he 's got children . " Tears came into her eyes . " I would n't cry , " said Johnny . " Maybe the pigeon wanted to get away from his relatives . If he does n't like the new coop , he 'll fly back to the old one when he gets out again . " Francie was consoled . They did n't say anything for a long time . They stood hand-in-hand on the roof 's edge looking across the river to New York . Finally Johnny said , as if to himself , " Seven years . " " What , Papa ? " " Your mama and I have been married seven years already . " " Was I here when you got married ? " " No . " A Tree Grows in Brooklyn " I was here , though , when Neeley came . " " That 's right . " Johnny went back to thinking aloud . " Married seven years and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . " Francie did n't notice that he said my last home instead of our last home . BOOK THREExvFOUR ROOMS MADE UP THE NEW FLAT . THEY LED ONE into the other and were called railroad rooms . The high narrow kitchen faced on the yard which was a flagstone walk surrounding a square of cement-like sour earth out of which nothing could possibly grow . Yet , there was this tree growing in the yard . When Francie first saw it , it was only up to the second story . She could look down on it from her window . It looked like a packed crowd of people of assorted sizes , standing umbrella-protected in the rain . .. There was a lean clothes pole in the back of the yard from which six washlines on pullies connected with six kitchen windows . The neighborhood boys kept themselves in pocket money by climbing the poles to replace a washline when it slipped off a pulley . It was believed that the boys climbed the pole in the dead of night and sneaked the line off the pulley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunny windy day , it was pretty to see the lines filled , the square white sheets taking the wind like the sails of a story-book boat and the red , green and yellow clothes straining at the wooden pins as though they had life . The pole stood against a brick wall which was the windowless side of the neighborhood school . Francie found that no two bricks were alike when she looked real close . It was a soothing rhythm the way they were put together with crumbly thin lines of white mortar . They glowed when the sun shone on them . They smelled warm and porous when Francie pressed her cheek against them . They were the first to receive the rain and they gave off a wet clay odor that was like theI13114 A Tree Grows in Brooklynsmell of life itself . In the winter , when the first snow was too delicate to last on the sidewalks , it clung to the rough surface of the brick and was like fairy lace . Four feet of the school yard faced on Francie 's yard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The few times Francie got to play in the yard ( it was pre-empted by the boy who lived on the ground floor who would let no one in it while he was there ) , she managed to be there at recess time . She watched the horde of children playing in the yard . Recess consisted of getting several hundred children herded into this small , stone-paved enclosure and then getting them out again . Once in the yard , there was no room for games . The children milled about angrily and raised their voices in one steady , monotonous shrieking which continued unabated for five minutes . It was cut off , as if with a sharp knife , when the end-of-recess bell clanged . For an instant after the bell there was dead silence and frozen motion . Then the milling changed to pushing . The children seemed as desperately anxious to get in as they had been to get out . The high shrieking changed to subdued wailing as they fought their way back . Francie was in her yard one mid-afternoon when a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clapped two blackboard erasers together to free them from chalk dust . To Francie , watching , her face close to the iron mesh , this seemed the most fascinating occupationever devised . Mama had told her that this was a task reserved for teachers ' pets . To Francie , pets meant cats , dogs and birds . She vowed that when she was old enough to go to school , that she would meow , bark and chirp as best she could so that she would be a " pet " and get to clap the erasers together . On this afternoon , she watched with a heart full of admiration in her eyes . The clapper , aware of Francie 's admiration , showed off . She clapped the erasers on the brick wall , on the stone walk and as a finale , behind her back . She spoke to Francie . " Want to see ' em real close ? " Francie nodded shyly . The girl brought an eraser close to the mesh . Francie poked a finger through to touch the vari-colored felt layers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was about to touch this soft beautifulness , the little girl snatched it away and spat full in Francie 's face . Francie closed her eyes tightly to keep the hurt bitter tears from spilling out . The other girl stood there curiously , waiting for the tears . When none came , she taunted : BOOK THREE 115 " Why do n't you bust out crying , you dockle ? Want I should spit in your face again ? " Francie turned and went down into the cellar and sat in the dark a long time waiting until the waves of hurt stopped breaking over her . It was the first of many disillusionments that were to come as her capacity to feel things grew . She never liked blackboard erasers after that . The kitchen was living room , dining room , and cooking room . There were two long narrow windows in one wall . An iron coal-range was recessed in another wall . Above the stove the recess was made of coral-colored bricks and creamy white plaster . It had a stone mantelpieceand a slate hearthstone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stove was a water boiler which got hot when the fire was going . Often on a cold day , Francie came in chilled and put her arms around the boiler and pressed her frosty cheek gratefully against its warm silveriness . Next to the boiler was a pair of soapstone washtubs with a hinged wooden cover . The partition could be removed and the two thrown into one for a bath tub . It did n't make a very good bath tub . Sometimes when Francie sat in it , the cover banged down on her head . The bottom was rubbly and she came out of what should have been a refreshing bath , all sore from sitting on that wet roughness . Then there were four faucets to contend with . No matter how the child tried to remember that they were inflexibly there and would n't give way , she would jump up suddenly out of the soapy water and get her back whacked good on a faucet . Francie had a perpetual angry welt on her back . Following the kitchen , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airshaft dimensioned like a coffin was built into the bedrooms . The windows were small and dingy gray . You could open an airshaft window , maybe , if you used a chisel and hammer . But when you did , you were rewarded with a blast of cold , dank air . The airshaft was topped by a miniature , slant-roofed skylight whose heavy , opaque , wrinkled glass was protected from breakage by heavy , iron netting . The sides were corrugated iron slats . This arrangement supposedly supplied light and air to the bedrooms . But the heavy glass , iron fencing and dirt of many years refused to filter the light through . The openings in the sides were choked with dust , soot andii6 A Tree Grows in Brooklyncobwebs . No air could come in , but , stubbornly enough , rain and snow could get in . On stormy days , the wooden bottom of the airshaftwas wet and smoky and gave out a tomb-y smell . The airshaft was a horrible invention . Even with the windows tightly sealed , it served as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the bottom . There was always the danger of fire . A match absently tossed into the airshaft by a drunken teamster under the impression that he was throwing it into the yard or street would set the house afire in a moment . There were vile things cluttering up the bottom . Since this bottom could n't be reached by man ( the windows being too small to admit the passage of a body ) , it served as a fearful repository for things that people wanted to put out of their lives . Rusted razor blades and bloody cloths were the most innocent items . Once Francie looked down into the airshaft . She thought of what the priest said about Purgatory and figured it must be like the airshaft bottom only on a larger scale . When Francie went into the parlor , she passed through the bedrooms shuddering and with her eyes shut . The parlor or front room was The Room . Its two high narrow windowsfaced on the exciting street . The third floor was so high up that street noises were muted into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dignity . It had its own door leading into the hall . Company could be admitted without having to walk through the bedrooms from the kitchen . The high walls were covered with a somber wall paper , dark brown with golden stripes . The windows had inside shutters or slatted wood which telescoped into a narrow space on either side . Francie spent many happy hours pulling out these hinged shutters and watching them fold back again at a touch of her hand . It was a never-tiring miracle that that which could cover a whole window and blot out light and air , could still meekly compress itself in its little closet and present an innocently paneled front to the eye . A low parlor stove was built into a black marble fireplace . Only the front half of the stove was in view . It looked like a giant halved melon with the round side out . It was made of numerous isinglass windows with just enough thin carved iron to form a framework . At Christmas time , the only time Katie could afford to have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glowed and Francie felt a great joy sitting there , BOOK THREE 117feeling the warmth and watching the windows change from rosy red to amber as the night wore on . And when Katie came in and lit the gas , chasing the shadows away and paling the light in the stove windows , it was like a great sin that she committed . The most wonderful thing about the front room was the piano . This was a miracle that you could pray for all your life and it would never come to pass . But there it stood in the Nolan parlor , a real true miracle that had come without a wish or a prayer . The piano had been left there by the previous tenants who could not afford to pay to have it moved . Piano-moving in those days was a project . No piano could be gotten down those narrow steep stairs . Pianos had to be bundled up , roped and hoisted out of the windows with an enormous pulley on the roof and with much shouting , arm-waving and brass-hatting on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roped off , the policeman had to keep the crowds back and children had to play hooky from school when there was a piano moving . There was always that great moment when the wrapped bulk swung clear of the window and twisted dizzily in the air for a moment before it righted itself . Then began the slow perilous descent while the children cheered hoarsely . It was a job that cost fifteen dollars , three times what it cost to move all the rest of the furniture . So the owner asked Katie could she leave it and would Katie mind it for her ? Katie was glad to give her the promise . Wistfully the woman asked Katie not to let it get damp or cold , to leave the bedroom doors open in winter so a little heat would get through from the kitchen and prevent warping . " Can you play it ? " Katie asked her . " No , " said the woman sorrowfully . " No one in the family can play . I wish I could . " " Why did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich house . The people were selling it cheap . I wanted it so much . No , I could n't play it . But it was so beautiful . . . It dresses up the whole room . " Katie promised to take good care of it until the woman could afford to send for it but as things turned out , the woman never did send for it and the Nolans had this beautiful thing for always . It was small and made of black polished wood that glowed darkly . The front of thin veneers was cut out to make a pretty pattern and118 A Tree Grows in Brooklynthere was old-rose silk behind this fretted wood design . Its lid did not fold back in sections like other uprights . It just turned back and rested against the designed wood like a lovely , dark , polished shell . There was a candle holder on either side . You could put pure white candles in them and play by the candlelight which threw dreamy shadows over the creamy ivoried keys . And you could see the keys again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front room on their first possessive tour of inspection , the piano was the only thing that Francie saw . She tried to get her arms around it but it was too big . She had to be content to hug the faded-rose brocade stool . Katie looked at the piano with dancing eyes . She had noticed a white card in the flat window below which said , " Piano Lessons . " Katie had an idea . Johnny sat on the magic stool , which turned around and went up or down according to your size , and played . He could n't play , of course . He could n't read notes in the first place but he knew a few chords . He could sing a song and strike a chord now and then and really it sounded as though he were singing to music . He struck a minor chord , looked into the eyes of his oldest child and smiled a crooked smile . Francie smiled back , her heart waiting in anticipation . He struck the minor chord again ; held it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ true voice : Maxwellton 's braes are bonny , Whe ' early fae 's the dew . ( Chor  --  hord . ) An " t was there that Annie Laurie , Gied me her promise true . ( Chor  --  hor  --  hor  --  hord . ) Francie looked away , not wanting papa to see her tears . She was afraid he 'd ask her why she was crying and she would n't be able to tell him . She loved him and she loved the piano . She could find no excuse for her easy tears . Katie spoke . Her voice had some of the old soft tenderness in it which Johnny had been missing in the last year or so . " Is that an Irish song , Johnny ? " " Scotch . " " I never heard you sing it before . " " No , I guess not . It 's just a song I know . I never sing it because it'sBOOK THREE 119not the kind of song people want to hear at the rackets where I work . They 'd sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're drunk . Then nothing but Sweet Adeline ' will do . " They were quickly settled in the new place . The familiar furniture looked strange . Francie sat on a chair and was surprised that it felt the same as it had in Lorimer Street . She felt different . Why did n't the chair feel different ? The front room looked pretty after papa and mama got it fixed up . There was a bright green carpet which had great pink roses . There were starched cream-colored lace curtains for the windows , a table with a marble top for the center of the room and a three-piece green plush parlor suit . A bamboo stand in the corner held a plush-covered album in which were pictures of the Rommely sisters as babies lying on their stomachs on a fur rug , and patient-looking great-aunts standingat the shoulders of seated , big-mustached husbands . Little souvenir cups stood on the small shelves . The cups were pink and blue and had gold-encrusted designs of blue forget-me-nots and red American beauty roses . There were phrases like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tiny cups and saucers were memories of Katie 's old girl friends and Francie was never permitted to play house with them . On the bottom shelf stood a curly , bone-white conch shell with a delicate rosy interior . The children loved it dearly and had given it an affectionate name : Tootsy . When Francie held it to her ear , it sang of the great sea . Sometimes for the delight of his children Johnny listened to the shell , then held it dramatically at arm 's length , looked at it meltingly and sang : Upon the shore I found a shell . I held it to my ear . I listened gladly while it sang , A sea song sweet and clear . Later , Francie saw the sea for the first time when Johnny took them to Canarsie . The sea was remarkable only in that it sounded like the tiny sweet roar of Tootsy , the conch shell . XVITHE NEIGHBORHOOD STORES ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF Acity child 's life . They are his contact with the supplies that keep life going ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they hold the unattainable that he can only dream and wish for . Francie liked the pawnshop almost the bes  --  ot for the treasures prodigiously thrown into its barred windows ; not for the shadowy adventure of shawled women slipping into the side entrance , but for the three large golden balls that hung high above the shop and gleamed in the sun or swayed langorously like heavy golden apples when the wind blew . There was a bakery store to one side of it which sold beautiful charlotte russes with red candied cherries on their whipped-cream tops for those who were rich enough to buy . On the other side was Gollender 's Paint Shop . There was a stand in front of it from which was suspended a plate with a dramatically mended crack across it and a hole bored into the bottom from which hung a heavy rock suspended on a chain . This proved how strong Major 's Cement was . Some said the plate was made of iron and painted to resemble cracked China . But Francie preferred to believe it was a real plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the miracle of the cement . The most interesting store was housed in a little shanty which had been there when the Indians prowled through Williamsburg . It looked queer among the tenements with its tiny small-paned windows , clapboardsand steep slanting roof . The store had a great small-paneledBOOK THREE I2Ibay window behind which a dignified man sat at a table and made cigar  --  ong thin dark-brown ones which sold four for a nickel . He chose the outside leaf very carefully from a hand of tobacco and filled it expertly with bits of tobacco of mixed browns and rolled it all very beautifully so that it was tight and thin and the ends had squared corners . ' A craftsman of the old school , he scorned progress . He refused to have gas light in his store . Sometimes when the days grew dark early and he still had a lot of cigars to finish , he worked by candlelight . He had a wooden Indian outside his store which stood in a threatening stance on a wooden block . He held a tomahawk in one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore Roman sandals with the lacings coming to his knees , a short skirt of feathers and a war bonnet all of which were painted in bright reds , blues and yellows . The cigar maker gave him a fresh coat of paint four times a year and carried him inside when it rained . The neighborhood children called the Indian " Aunt Maimie . " One of Francie 's favorite stores was the one which sold nothing but tea , coffee and spices . It was an exciting place of rows of lacquered bins and strange , romantic , exotic odors . There were a dozen scarlet coffee bins with adventurous words written across the front in black China ink : Brazil ! Argentine ! Turkish ! Java ! Mixed Blend ! The tea was in smaller bins : beautiful bins with sloping covers . They read : Oolong ! Formosa ! Orange Pekoe ! Black China ! Flowering Almond ! jasmine ! Irish Tea ! The spices were in miniature bins behind the counter . Their names marched in a row across the shelves : cinnamon ? clove  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn  --  agethym  --  arjoram . All pepper when purchased was ground in a tiny pepper mill . There was a large hand-turned coffee grinder . The beans were put into a shiny brass hopper , and the great wheel was turned with two hands . The fragrant grounds pattered down into a scarlet box that was shaped like a scoop at the back . ( The Nolans ground their coffee at home . Francie loved to see mama sitting debonairly in the kitchen with the coffee mill clutched between her knees , grinding away with a furious turn of her left wrist and looking up to talk sparklingly to papa while the room filled up with the rich satisfying odor of freshly-ground coffee . ) The tea man had a wonderful pair of scales : two gleaming brass plates which had been rubbed and polished daily for more than twenty-I20122 A Tree Grows in Brooklynfive years until now they were thin and delicate and looked like burnished gold . When Francie bought a pound of coffee or an ounce of pepper she watched while a polished silver block with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase was conveyed gently by means of a silver-like scoop into the other . Francie , watching , held her breath while the scoop dropped in a few more grains or gently eased some out . It was a beautiful peaceful second when both golden plates were stilled and stood there in perfect balance . It was as if nothing wrong could happen in a world where things balanced so stilly . ' The mystery of mysteries to Francie was the Chinaman 's one- windowed store . The Chinaman wore his pigtail wound around his head . That was so he could go back to China if he wanted to , mama said . Once he cut it off , they would never let him return . He shuffled back and forth silently in his black felt slippers and listened patiently to instructions about shirts . When Francie spoke to him , he folded his hands in the wide sleeves of his nankeen shirt coat and kept his eyes on the ground . She thought that he was wise and contemplative and listened with all his heart . But he understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All he knew was tickee and shirtee . When Francie brought her father 's soiled shirt there , he whisked it under the counter , took a square of mysteriously textured paper , dipped a thin brush into a pot of India Ink , made a few strokes and gave her this magic document in exchange for a common dirty shirt . It seemed a wonderful barter . The inside of the store had a clean warm but fragile scent , like odorless flowers in a hot room . He did the washing in some mysterious recess and it must have been in the dead of night because all day , from seven in the morning until ten at night , he stood in the store at his clean ironing board pushing a heavy black iron back and forth . The iron must have had a tiny gasoline arrangement inside it to keep it hot Francie did not know this . She thought it part of the mystery of his race that he could iron with an iron never heated on a stove . She had a vague theory that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the shirts and collars . When Francie brought a ticket and a dime back and pushed them across the counter , he gave her the wrapped shirt and two lichee nuts in exchange . Francie loved these lichee nuts . There was a crisp easily broken shell and the soft sweet meat inside . Inside the meat was aBOOK THREE 123hard stone that no child had ever been able to break open . It was said that this stone contained a smaller stone and that the smaller stone contained a smaller stone which contained a yet smaller stone and so on . It was said that soon the stones got so small you could only see them with a magnifying glass and those smaller ones got still smaller until you could n't see them with anything but they were always there and would never stop coming . It was Francie 's first experience with infinity . The best times were when he had to make change . He brought out a small wooden frame strung with thin rods on which were blue , red , yellow and green balls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swiftly , clicked them all back into place and announced " dirty-nine cent . " The tiny balls told him how much to charge and how much change to give . Oh , to be a Chinaman , wished Francie , and have such a pretty toy to count on ; oh , to eat all the lichee nuts she wanted and to know the mystery of the iron that was ever hot and yet never stood on a stove . Oh , to paint those symbols with a slight brush and a quick turn of the wrist and to make a clear black mark as fragile as a piece of a butterfly wing ! That was the mystery of the Orient in Brooklyn . XV I I p ANO LESSONS ! MAGIC WORDS ! AS SOON AS THE Nolans were settled , Katie called on the lady whose card announced piano lessons . There were two Miss Tynmores . Miss Lizzie taught piano and Miss Maggie cultivated the voice . The charge was twenty- five cents per lesson . Katie proposed a bargain . She 'd do one hour 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each week . Miss Lizzie demurred , claiming her time had more value than Katie 's time . Katie argued that time was time . Finally she got Miss Lizzie to agree that time was time and arrangements were made . The history-making day of the first lesson arrived . Francie and Neeley were instructed to sit in the front room during the lesson and to keep their eyes and ears open . A chair was placed for the teacher . The children sat side by side on the other side of the piano , Katie nervously adjusted and readjusted the seat and the three sat waiting . Miss Tynmore arrived on the dot of five . Although she only came from downstairs , she was formally attired in street clothes . A taut spotted veil was stretched over her face . Her hat was the breast and wing of a red bird tormentingly pierced by two hatpins . Francie stared at the cruel hat . Mama took her into the bedroom and whispered that the bird was n't a bird at all just some feathers glued together and that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes kept going back to the tormented effigy . Miss Tynmore brouvl ) l everything with her but the piano . She had a nickel alarm cloo ' ' k and a battered metronome . The clock said five o'clock . She set it for six and stood it on the piano . She took the privi- BOOK THREE I25lege of using up part of the precious hour . She removed her pearl-gray ; skin-tight kid gloves , blew into each finger , smoothed and folded them and placed them on the piano . She undid her veil and threw it back over her hat . She limbered up her fingers , glanced at the clock , was satisfied she had taken enough minutes , started the metronome ; took her seat and the lesson began . Francie was so fascinated by the metronome that she found it hard to listen to what Miss Tynmore said and to watch the way she placed mama 's hands on the keys . She weaved dreams in time to the soothing monotonous clicking . As for Neeley , his round blue eyes rolled back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself into unconsciousness . His mouth relaxed and his blond head rolled over on his shoulder . A little bubble came and went as he breathed moistly . Katie dared not wake him lest Miss Tynmore catch on that she was teaching three for the price of one . The metronome clicked on dreamily ; the clock ticked querulously . Miss Tynmore , as if not trusting the metronome , counted , one , two , three ; one , two , three . Katie 's work-swollen fingers struggled doggedly with her first scale . Time passed and it grew dark in the room . Suddenly the alarm clock rang out shatteringly . Francie 's heart jumped and Neeley fell off his chair . The first lesson was ended . Katie 's words tumbled over each other in gratitude . " Even if I never take another lesson , I could go on with what you taught me today . You are a good teacher . " Miss Tynmore , while pleased by the flattery , nevertheless told Katie what was what . " I wo n't charge extra for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fooling me . " Katie blushed and the children looked down on the floor , ashamed of being found out . " I will permit the children to stay in the room . " Katie thanked her . Miss Tynmore stood up and waited . Katie verifiedthe time she was to do Miss Tynmore 's housework . Still she waited . Katie felt that something was expected of her . Finally she inquired , " Yes ? " Miss Tynmore flushed a shell pink and spoke proudly . " The ladies ... where I give lessons ... well . . . they offer me a cup of tea afterwards . " She put her hand to her heart and explained vaguely , " Those stairs . " " Would you sooner take coffee ? " Katie asked . " We have no tea . " 126 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn BOOK THREE 127heart was willing but his skill was nil . In attempting to get the window back in to keep out the cold winter rain that was blowing into the room while he was figuring out about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The deal fell through . The Tynmores had to get a regular window man in to fix it . Katie had to do two washings free forthe girls to make up for it and Francie 's voice lessons were abandoned 11 forever . " Gladly ! " Miss Tynmore sat down in relief . Katie rushed out to the kitchen and heated the coffee which was always standing on the stove . While it was warming , she put a sugar bun and a spoon on a round tin tray . In the meantime , Neeley had fallen asleep on the sofa . Miss Tynmore and Francie sat exchanging stares . Finally Miss Tynmore asked , " What are you thinking about , little girl ? " " Just thinking , " Francie said . " Sometimes I see you sitting on the gutter curb for hours . What do you think of then ? " " Nothing . I just tell myself stories . " Miss Tynmore pointed at her sternly . " Little girl , you 'll be a story ' writer when you grow up . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ma'am , " agreed Francie out of politeness . Katie came in with the tray . " This may not be as refined as you 're used to , " she apologized , " but it 's what we have in the house . " " It 's very good , " stated Miss Tynmore daintily . Then she concentrated on trying not to wolf it down . To tell the truth , the Tynmores lived on the " tea " they got from their pupils . A few lessons a day at a quarter a lesson did not make for prosperity . After paying their rent , there was little left to eat on . Most of the ladies served them weak tea and soda crackers . The ladies knew what was polite and would come through with a cup of tea but they had no intention of supplying a meal and paying a quarter , too . So Miss Tynmore came to look forward to the hour at the Nolans . The coffee was heartening and there was always a bun or a bologna sandwichto sustain her . After each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taught . She made them practice half an hour each day . In time , all three of them learned to play the piano . When Johnny heard that Maggie Tynmore gave voice lessons , he figured that he could do no less than Katie . He offered to repair a broken sash cord in one of the Tynmore windows in exchange for two voice lessons for Francie . Johnny , who had never even seen a sash cord in all his life , got a hammer and screw driver and took the whole window frame out of its case . He looked at the broken rope and that was as far as he could go . He experimented and got nowhere . HisSCHOOL DAYS WERE EAGERLY ANTICIPATED BY PRANCIE . She wanted all of the things that she thought came with school . She was a lonely child and she longed for the companionship of other children . She wanted to drink from the school water fountains in the yard . The faucets were inverted and she thought that soda water came out instead of plain water . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to see the map that pulled down like a shade . Most of all , she wanted " school supplies " ; a notebook and tablet and a pencil box with a sliding top filled with new pencils , an eraser , a little tin pencil sharpener made in the shape of a cannon , a pen wiper , and a six-inch , soft wood , yellow ruler . Before school , there had to be vaccination . That was the law . How itwas dreaded ! When the health authorities tried to explain to the poorand illiterate that vaccination was a giving of the harmless form ofsmallpox to work up immunity against the deadly form , the parentsdid n't believe it . All they got out of the explanation was that germswould be put into a healthy child 's body . Some foreign-born parentsrefused to permit their children to be vaccinated . They were notallowed to enter school . Then the law got after them for keeping thechildren out of school . A free country ? they asked . You should live solong . What 's free about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your children and then endangers their lives to get them intoschool ? Weeping mothers brought bawling children to the healthcenter for innoculation . They carried on as though bringing their innocentsto the slaughter . The children screamed hysterically at the first128XV1IIBOOK THREE I29sight of the needle and their mothers , waiting in the anteroom , threw their shawls over their heads and keened loudly as if wailing for the dead . Francie was seven and Neeley six . Katie had held Francie back wishing both children to enter school together so that they could protect each other against the older children . On a dreadful Saturday in August , she stopped in the bedroom to speak to them before she went off to work . She awakened them and gave instructions . " Now when you get up , wash yourselves good and when it gets to be eleven o'clock , go around the corner to the public health place , tell them to vaccinate you because you 're going to school in September . " Francie began to tremble . Neeley burst into tears . " You coming with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to go to work . Who 's going to do my work if I do n't ? " asked Katie covering up her conscience with indignation . Francie said nothing more . Katie knew that she was letting them down . But she could n't help it , she just could n't help it . Yes , she should go with them to lend the comfort and authority of her presence but she knew she could n't stand the ordeal . Yet , they had to be vaccinated . Her being with them or somewhere else could n't take that fact away . So why should n't one of the three be spared ? Besides , she said to her conscience , it 's a hard and bitter world . They 've got to live in it . Let them get hardened young to take care of themselves . " Papa 's going with us then , " said Francie hopefully . " Papa 's at Headquarters waiting for a job . He wo n't be home all day . You 're big enough to go alone . Besides , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ higher key . Katie could hardly stand that . She loved the boy so much . Part of her reason for not going with them was that she could n't bear to see the boy hurt . . . not even by a pin prick . Almost she decided to go with them . But no . If she went she 'd lose half a day 's work and she 'd have to make it up on Sunday morning . Besides , she 'd be sick afterwards . They 'd manage somehow without her . She hurried off to her work . Francie tried to console the terrified Neeley . Some older boys had told him that they cut your arm off when they got you in the Health Center . To take his mind off the thing , Francie took him down into the yard and they made mud pies . They quite forget to wash as mama had told them to . They almost forgot about eleven o'clock , the mud pie making was sot130 A Tree Grows in Brooklynbeguiling . Their hands and arms got very dirty playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gaddis hung out the window and yelled down that their mother had told her to remind them when it was near eleven o'clock . Neeley finished off his last mud pie , watering it with his tears . Francie took his hand and with slow dragging steps the children walked around the corner . They took their place on a bench . Next to them sat a Jewish mama who clutched a large six-year-old boy in her arms and wept and kissed his forehead passionately from time to time . Other mothers sat there with grim suffering furrowed on their faces . Behind the frosted glass door where the terrifying business was going on , there was a steady bawling punctuated by a shrill scream , resumption of the bawling and then a pale child would come out with a strip of pure white gauze about his left arm . His mother would rush and grab him and with a foreign curse and a shaken fist at the frosted door , hurry him out of the torture chamber . Francie went in trembling . She had never seen a doctor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiteness of the uniforms , the shiny cruel instruments laid out on a napkin on a tray , the smell of antiseptics , and especially the cloudy sterilizer with its bloody red cross filled her with tongue-tied fright . The nurse pulled up her sleeve and swabbed a spot clean on her left arm . Francie saw the white doctor coming towards her with the cruelly-poised needle . He loomed larger and larger until he seemed to blend into a great needle . She closed her eyes waiting to die . Nothing happened , she felt nothing . She opened her eyes slowly hardly daring to hope that it was all over . She found to her agony , that the doctor was still there , poised needle and all . He was staring at her arm in distaste . Francie looked too . She saw a small white area on a dirty dark brown arm . She heard the doctor talking to the nurse . " Filth , filth , filth , from morning to night . I know they 're poor but they could wash . Water is free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nurse . " The nurse looked and clucked in horror . Francie stood there with the hot flamepoints of shame burning her face . The doctor was a Harvard man , interning at the neighborhood hospital . Once a week , he was obligated to put in a few hours at one of the free clinics . He was going into a smart practice in Boston when his internship was over . Adopting the phraseology of the neighborhood , he referred to hisBOOK THREE 13EBrooklyn internship as going through Purgatory when he wrote to his socially prominent fiancee in Boston . The nurse was a Williamsburg girl . You could tell that by her accent . The child of poor Polish immigrants , she had been ambitious , worked days in a sweatshop and gone to school at night . Somehow she had gotten her training . She hoped some day to marry a doctor . She did n't want anyone to know she had come from the slums . After the doctor 's outburst , Francie stood hanging her head . She was a dirty girl . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now asking the nurse how that kind of people could survive ; that it would be a better world if they were all sterilized and could n't breed anymore . Did that mean he wanted her to die ? Would he do something to make her die because her hands and arms were dirty from the mud pies ? She looked at the nurse . To Francie , all women were mamas like her own mother and Aunt Sissy and Aunt Evy . She thought the nurse might say something like : " Maybe this little girl 's mother works and did n't have time to wash her good this morning , " or , " You know how it is , Doctor , children will play in dirt . " But what the nurse actually said was , " I know . Is n't it terrible ? I sympathize with you , Doctor . There is no excuse for these people living in filth . " A person who pulls himself up from a low environment via the boot-strap route has two choices . Having risen above his environment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above it and never forget it and keep compassion and understanding in his heart for those he has left behind him in the cruel up climb . The nurse had chosen the forgetting way . Yet , as she stood there , she knew that years later she would be haunted by the sorrow in the face of that starveling child and that she would wish bitterly that she had said a comforting word then and done somethingtowards the saving of her immortal soul . She had the knowledge that she was small but she lacked the courage to be otherwise . When the needle jabbed , Francie never felt it . The waves of hurt started by the doctor 's words were racking her body and drove out all other feeling . While the nurse was expertly tying a strip of gauze around her arm and the doctor was putting his instrument in the sterilizer and taking out a fresh needle , Francie spoke up . " My brother is next . His arm is just as dirty as mine so do n't be surprised . And you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They stared132 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn B o o K T H R E E 133at this hit of humanity who had become so strangely articulate . Francie 's voice went ragged with a sob . " You do n't have to tell him . Besides it wo n't do no good . He 's a boy and he do n't care if he is dirty . " She turned , stumbled a little and walked out of the room . As the door closed , she heard the doctor 's surprised voice . " I had no idea she 'd understand what I was saying . " She heard the nurse say , " Oh , well , " on a sighing note . Katie was home for lunch when the children got back . She looked at their bandaged arms with misery in her eyes . Francie spoke out passionately . " Why , Mama , why ? Why do they have to . . . to . . . say things and then stick a needle in your arm . " " Vaccination , " said mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a very good thing . It makes you tell your left hand from your right . You have to write with your right hand when you go to school and that sore will be there to say , uh-uh , not this hand . Use the other hand . " This explanation satisfied Francie because she had never been able to tell her left hand from her right . She ate , and drew pictures with her left hand . Katie was always correcting her and transferring the chalk or the needle from her left hand to her right . After mama explained about vaccination , Francie began to think that maybe it was a wonderfulthing.It was a small price to pay if it simplified such a great problem and let you know which hand was which . Francie began using her right hand instead of the left after the vaccination and never had trouble afterwards . Francie worked up a fever that night and the site of the injection itched painfully . She told mama who became greatly alarmed . She gave intense instructions . " You 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Why ca n't I scratch it ? " " Because if you do , your whole arm will swell up and turn black and drop right off . So do n't scratch it . " Katie did not mean to terrify the child . She , herself , was badly frightened . She believed that blood-poisoning would set in if the arm were touched . She wanted to frighten the child into not scratching it . Francie had to concentrate on not scratching the painfully itching area . The next day , shots of pain were shooting up the arm . Whilepreparing for bed , she peered under the bandage . To her horror , the place where the needle had entered was swollen , dark-green and festeringyellowly . And Francie had not scratched it ! She knew she had not scratched it . But wait ! Maybe she had scratched it in her sleep the night before . Yes , she must have done it then . She was afraid to tell mama . Mama would say , " I told you and I told you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was Sunday night . Papa was out working . She could n't sleep . She got up from her cot and went into the front room and sat at the window . She leaned her head on her arms and waited to die . At three in the morning she heard a Graham Avenue trolley grind to a stop on the corner . That meant someone was getting off . She leaned out the window . Yes , it was papa . He sauntered down the street with his light dancer 's step whistling " My Sweetheart 's the Man in the Moon . " The figure in its tuxedo and derby hat , with a rolled-up waiter 's apron in a neat packet under its arm , seemed like life itself to Francie . She called to him when he got to the door . He looked up and tipped his hat gallantly . She opened the kitchen door for him . " What are you doing up so late , Prima Donna ? " he asked . " It 's not Saturday night , you know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered , " waiting for my arm to drop off . " He choked back a laugh . She explained about the arm . He closed the door leading into the bedrooms and turned up the gas . He removed the bandage and his stomach turned over at sight of the swollen festering arm . But he never let her know . He never let her know . " Why , Baby , that 's nothing at all . Just nothing at all . You should have seen my arm when I was vaccinated . It was twice as swollen and red , white and blue instead of green and yellow and now look how hard and strong it is . " He lied gallantly for he had never been vaccinated . He poured warm water into a basin and added a few drops of carbolic acid . He washed the ugly sore over and over again . She winced when it stung but Johnny said that stinging meant curing . He sang a foolish sentimental song in a whisper as he washed it . He never cares to wander from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to roam .. . 134 A Tree Grows in BrooklynHe looked around for a clean bit of cloth to serve as a bandage ? Finding none , he took off his coat and shirt dicky , pulled his undershirtoff over his head and dramatically ripped a strip of cloth from it , " Your good undershirt , " she protested . " Aw , it was all full of holes anyhow . " He bandaged the arm . The cloth smelled of Johnny , warm and cigarish . But it was a comforting thing to the child . It smelled of protection and love . " There ! You 're all fixed up , Prima Donna . Whatever gave you the idea your arm was going to drop off ? " " Mama said it would if I scratched it . I did n't mean to scratch it but I guess I did while I was sleeping . " a " Maybe . " He kissed her thin cheek . " Now go back to bed . " She went and slept peacefully the rest of the night . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days the arm was normal again . After Francie had gone to bed , Johnny smoked another cigar . Then he undressed slowly and got into Katie 's bed . She was sleepily aware of his presence and in one of her rare impulses of affection , she threw her arm across his chest . He removed it gently and edged as far away from her as he could . He lay close to the wall . He folded his hands under his head and lay staring into the darkness all the rest of that night . XIXFRANCIE EXPECIED GREAT THINGS FROM SCHOOL . SINCEvaccination taught her instantly the difference between left and right , she thought that school would bring forth even greater miracles . She thought she 'd come home from school that first day knowing how to read and write . But all she came home with was a bloody nose gained by an older child slamming her head down on the stone rim of the water trough when she had tried to drink from the faucets that did not gush forth soda water after all . Francie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk ( meant only for one ) with another girl . She had wanted a desk to herself . She accepted with pride the pencil the monitor passed out to her in the morning and reluctantly surrendered it to another monitor at three o'clock . She had been in school but half a day when she knew that she would never be a teacher 's pet . That privilege was reserved for a small group of girls . . . girls with freshly-curled hair , crisp clean pinafores and new silk hairbows . They were the children of the prosperous storekeepersof the neighborhood . Francie noticed how Miss Briggs , the teacher beamed on them and seated them in the choicest places in the front row . These darlings were not made to share seats . Miss Briggs ' voice was gentle when she spoke to these fortune-favored few , and snarling when she spoke to the great crowd of unwashed . Francie , huddled with other children of her kind , learned more that first day than she realized . She learned of the class system of a great Democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Obviouslyz33136 A Tree Grows in Brooklynthe teacher hated her and others like her for no other reason than that they were what they were . Teacher acted as though they had no right to be in the school but that she was forced to accept them and was doing so with as little grace as possible . She begrudged them the few crumbs of learning she threw at them ! Like the doctor at the health center , she too acted as though they had no right to live . It would seem as if all the unwanted children would stick together and be one against the things that were against them . But not so . They hated each other as much as the teacher hated them . They aped teacher 's snarling manner when they spoke to each other . There was always one unfortunate whom the teacher singled out and used for a scapegoat . This poor child was the nagged one , the tormented one , the one on whom she vented her spinsterly spleen . As soon as a child received this dubious recognition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's torments . Characteristically , they fawned on those close to teacher 's heart . Maybe they figured they ' were nearer to the throne that way . Three thousand children crowded into this ugly brutalizing school that had facilities for only one thousand . Dirty stories went the roundsof the children . One of them was that Miss Pfieffer , a bleached blond jjteacher with a high giggle , went down to the basement to sleep with , tU bbthe assistant janitor those times when she put a monitor in charge and explained that she had to " step out to the office . " Another , passed around by little boys who had been victims , was that'the lady principal , a hard-bitten , heavy cruel woman of middle years who wore sequin-decorated dresses and smelled always of raw gin , got recalcitrant boys into her office and made them take down their pants so that she could flay their naked buttocks with a rattan cane . ( She whipped the little girls through their dresses . ) Of course , corporal punishment was forbidden in the schools . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not the whipped children , certainly . It was a tradition in the neighborhood that if a child reported that he had been whipped in school , he would receive a second homewhippingbecause he had not behaved in school . So the child took his punishment and kept quiet , leaving well enough alone . The ugliest thing about these stories was that they were all sordidly true . BOOK THREE 137Brutalizing is the only adjective for the public schools of that district around 1908 and ' 09 . Child psychology had not been heard of in Williamsburg in those days . Teaching requirements were easy : graduations , from high school and two years at Teachers Training School , Few teachers had the true vocation for their work . They taught because it was one of the few jobs open to them ; because it was better paying than factory work ; because they had a long summer vacation ; because they got a pension when they retired . They taught because no one wanted to marry them . Married women were not allowed to teach in those days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by starved love instincts . These barren women spent their fury on other women 's children in a twisted authoritative manner . The cruelest teachers were those who had come from homes similar to those of the poor children . It seemed that in their bitterness towards those unfortunate little ones , they were somehow exorcizing their own fearful background . Of course , not all of the teachers were bad . Sometimes one who was sweet came along , one who suffered with the children and tried to help them . But these women did not last long as teachers . Either they married quickly and left the profession , or they were hounded out of their jobs by fellow teachers . The problem of what was delicately called " leaving the room " was a grim one . The children were instructed to " go " before they left home in the morning and then to wait until lunch hour . There was supposed to be a time at recess but few children were able to take advantage of that . Usually the press of the crowd prevented a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lucky enough to get there ( where there were but ten lavatories for five hundred children ) , he 'd find the places pre-empted by the ten most brutalized children in the school . They 'd stand in the doorways and prevent entrance to all corners . They were deaf to the piteous pleas of the hordes of tormented children who swarmed before them . A few exacted a fee of a penny which few children were able to pay . The overlords never relaxed their hold on the swinging doors until the bell clanged the end of recess . No one ever ascertained what pleasure they derived from this macaber game . They were never punished since no teacher ever entered the children 's washrooms . No child ever snitched . No matter how young he was , he knew that he must n't squeal . If he tattled , he knew he138 A Tree Grows in Brooklynwould be tortured almost to death by the one he reported . So this evil game went on and on . Technically , a child was permitted to leave the room if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One finger held aloft meant that a child wished to go out but a short time . Two fingers meant desire for a longer stay . But the harassed and unfeeling teachers assured each other that this was just a subterfuge for a child to get out of the classroom for a little while . They knew the child had ample opportunity at recess and at lunch time . Thus they settled things among themselves . Of course , Francie noted , the favored children , the clean , the dainty , the cared-for in the front seats , were allowed to leave at any time . But that was different somehow . As for the rest of the children , half of them learned to adjust their functions to the teachers ' ideas of such things and the other half became chronic pants-wetters. s . It was Aunt Sissy who fixed up the leaving-the-room business for Francie . She had not seen the children since Katie and Johnny had told her she was not to visit the house again . She was lonesome for them . She knew they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were getting along . It was in November . Work was slack and Sissy was laid off . She sauntered down the school street just as school was letting out . If the children reported meeting her , it would seem like an accident , she figured . She saw Neeley first in the crowd . A bigger boy snatched his cap off , trampled on it and ran away . Neeley turned to a smaller boy and did the same to his cap . Sissy grabbed Neeley 's arm but with a raucous cry , he twisted loose and ran down the street . With poignancy , Sissy realized that he was growing up . Francie saw Sissy and put her arms around her right there on the street and kissed her . Sissy took her into a little candy store and treated her to a penny chocolate soda . Then she made Francie sit down on a stoop and tell her all about school . Francie showed her the primer and her homework book with block letters in it . Sissy was impressed . She looked long into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering . She saw that she was inadequately dressed against the raw November day in a threadbare cotton dress , ragged little sweater andBOOK THREE 139thin cotton stockings . She put her arm around her and held her close to her own life warmth . " Francie , baby , you 're trembling like a leaf . " Francie had never heard that expression and it made her thoughtful She looked at the little tree growing out of the concrete at the side of the house . There were still a few dried leaves clinging to it . One of them rustled dryly in the wind . Trembling like a leaf . She stored the phrase away in her mind . Trembling ... . " What 's the matter ? " Sissy asked . " You 're ice cold . " Francie would n't tell at first . But after being coaxed , she buried her shame-hot face in Sissy 's neck and whispered something to her . " Oh , my , " said Sissy . " No wonder you 're cold . Why did n't you askto ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . " " Oh , well . Do n't worry about it . It could happen to anyone . It happened to the Queen of England when she was a little girl . " But had the Queen been so shamed and sensitive about it ? Francie wept quietly and wrackingly , tears of shame and fear . She was afraid to go home , afraid that mama would make scornful shame of her . " Your mama wo n't scold you . . . such an accident could happen to any little girl . Do n't say I told you but your mama wet her pants when she was little and your grandma did too . It 's nothing new in the world and you 're not the first one it happened to . " " But I 'm too big . Only babies do that . Mama 'll make shame on me in front of Neeley . " " Tell her right out before she finds out for herself and promise never to do it again . She wo n't shame you then . " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us go . " " From now on , your teacher will let you leave the room any time ? you have to . You believe Aunt Sissy , do n't you ? " " Y-e-e-es . But how do you know ? " " I 'll burn a candle in church about it . " Francie was consoled with the promise . When Francie went home , Katie did a little routine scolding but Francie was armored against it in the light of what Sissy had told her about the cycle of wetting . The next morning , ten minutes before school started , Sissy was in that classroom confronting the teacher.
