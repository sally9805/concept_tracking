txt Overloaded Golf Bags I certainly appreciated John Kieran 's recent remarks on overloaded golf bags . I 've never been able to understand why the majority of golfers , many of whom can not handle even one club properly , insist on carrying full sets of irons and woods , not to mention a miscellaneous assortment of other articles . It 's a wonder the caddies do n't go on strike . I 've played the game for years and never used more than five clubs : a brassie. a mid-iron , a mashie , a niblick and a putter . My par is 100 and , if I break it , I 'm content . All the other clubs would n't help my game a stroke and if the truth were acknowledged that holds true of most golfers . I 've seen a professional , on a bat , go around a regulation course in 83 , using only a putter . But he had absolute control of it . We duffers have n't such control over any of our clubs .
