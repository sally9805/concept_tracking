One of the perennial and unflagging interests of the world is native crystallized carbon , which we call by the more romantic name , diamond . Nobody knows what ancient man first set great value on this substance ( if transparent and without flaw ) , but for many centuries it has aroused the desire for possession and the avidity of all manner of people . Only in the past few hundred years has the diamond become democratized , so that many humble suitors now can plight their troth with such a lasting token . Diamonds once were the exclusive property of royalty . Louis XIV used them as buttons on his coat , and Henry III concealed his bald spot with a cap , in the front l of which glittered a 50-carat gem . As there never were many tre- ' mendous , Arabian Nights ' stones , there was heavy competition for them . From the fourteenth century to the eighteenth , Indian rajahs fought over the Kohinoor , a famed diamond weighing 186 carats . This large stone once embellished India 's jeweled Peacock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the eighteenth century , they made off with the Peacock Throne and all the other jewels of the Mogul treasury . The Kohinoor brought nothing but bad luck to its succession of Persian owners . All the customs of the day ? torture , blinding , and assassination ? were used by covetous shahs as a means of getting the stone . At last it was smuggled back to India just before the invasion of the British , who quietly confiscated it . It was sent under special guard to Queen Victoria and belongs to her heirs . The British royal family also owns the Cullinan , which originally weighed 3,106 carats , approximately 11/3 pounds , the largest diamond ever mined . At first there was no buyer for this tremendous stone , the size and shape of a woman 's fist ; but finally the Transvaal Colony bought it for 8800,000 and sent it to England as a gift for the king and queen . Several huge diamonds were cut from it . The largest , called Cullinan I , weighs 530 carats and is a superb , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighs 317 carats , seven others range from 4.39 to 95 carats , and 96 have a total weight of about 8 carats . These jewels are kept in the Tower of London , under guard , and taken out only on special occasions . Russian rulers shared the royal passion for gems . One story is that Prince Orloff , a courtier of Catherine the Great , being out of favor , presented her with an enormous diamond of 200 carats , as large as a half-egg , for which he paid a quarter of a million dollars . The stone , called the Orloff , to which Catherine gave the place of honor at the tip of her scepter , unfortunately brought the Prince no special privileges . History reports that she remained cool to him . Catherine 's favorite , Potemkin , made no gifts ; he received them . Catherine presented him with a sumptuously furnished palace and , as an afterthought , a scintillating , oval diamond of 51 carats . Some time later , Napoleon III bought the stone and gave it to his wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wore it mounted in a necklace until the troubled days of the Franco-Prussian War . Most of her jewelry was sold at auction in London in 1872 . The diamond , called the Empress Eugenie ; was sold for $75,000 to the Gaekwar of Baroda , who already had a fabulous collection of precious stones . According to Eastern custom gems were not cut but merely polished . One of these is . the Shah of Persia , a shining oblong of 88 ? carats , on which the names and dates of different owners are engraved in tiny letters . The Shah is the shape of a miniature coffin and once was sent as a peace offering after a man had been murdered . The man , famous writer and Russian ambassador to Persia , had been very popular in his native land , and when he was mysteriously killed in Teheran , in a way that seemed to implicate Persian officials , feeling in Russia was intense and war was in the air . Much alarmed , the Persian government sent the diamond to Czar Alexander III . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the Sancy , which was forwarded by trusted messenger to King Henry of Navarre by De Sancy , his minister of finance . The Sancy , a dazzling 53-carat stone about the size and shape of a peach pit , was much prized by its owner . The messenger was murdered on his way to the king . The stone had disappeared . De Sancy then did an extraordinary thing . Convinced that his servant was devoted to him and had found some way of outwitting the robbers , he ordered an autopsy . The knife revealed the stone . Some years later Louis XIV heard this moving tale and insisted on having the stone . He paid $125,000 for it . After passing through many hands , it is now in the vault of the Maharajah of Patiala . On full-dress occasions he wears it on a chain around his neck . NOT all the celebrated stones have so dramatic a history . The Pasha of Egypt , a sparkling jewel of octagonal cut , once in the treasury of the Egyptian government , was last heard of in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it appear heavier than its 26 carats , was owned by Archduke Ferdinand of Austria , whose assassination was a prelude to the First World War . The Archduke paid $25,000 for this fine stone , whose whereabouts at present are unknown . Joseph Bonaparte gave $10,000 for the Polar Star , comparatively little for that round , 40-carat diamond , now in the Soviet Union 's Diamond Treasure . The Dudley , 46 carats , is extremely valuable because of its fire and brilliance . It was found during the South African diamond rush by a canny native , who refused to part with it . However , a Dutch farmer determined to have it and after many fruitless offers finally gave the African all his possessions ? his house , land , sheep , and cattle ? in exchange for the diamond , which he sold for $56,000 . Cutting produced a fine brilliant . The Countess of Dudley paid $125,000 for it and made it the center of a tiara composed of 95 jewels . South African mines have yielded three giant stones this century . The Jonker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last was a goldenyellow stone . However , as it is almost impossible to find buyers for such gems , it was considered practical to have them fashioned into smaller ones . The Jonker , 726 carats , was sold to a New York jeweler , cut into 12 brilliants , the largest of which weighs 125 carats and is valued by the owner at a million dollars . The Excelsior , a magnificent stone of great purity , weighing 995 carats , was made into 21 stones . The Baumgold , 609 carats , produced 25 brilliants . The Jubilee , a perfect South African stone of 650 carats , was sold to an East Indian prince . Most of these giant gems come from India and Africa , but one of the most beautiful was found in a Brazilian mine at the beginning of the nineteenth century , by a slave woman . She promptly carried the stone , which looked like a great lump of dirty glass , to her owner . Appreciating her honesty , he immediately set her free and gave her a pension for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weighed 128 carats and was a flashing brilliant , as large as a peach stone , just the sort to please the Gaekwar of Baroda , who gave $400,000 for it to a French syndicate . If the native of India who picked up the diamond later to be known as the  | Pitt had been as faithful as the Brazilian slave , perhaps he , too , would have reaped a reward . Instead , he cut his leg with a knife , hid the stone in the bloody bandage , and escaped to the coast . There he promised the diamond to a British sea captain in exchange for passage to another country . But the captain was not a man of his word . He took the diamond and pitched the slave into the sea . Later on , it came into the possession of Sir Thomas Pitt , governor of Madras , for the equivalent of $100,000 . This transaction was supposedly secret , but on his return to London Sir Thomas was shocked to learn that everyone knew about the huge stone , and what was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violent means . Afraid of being robbed , he fastened the diamond to his belt , disguised himself as a beggar , and slept each night at a different inn until he could arrange for the stone to be cut . The cutting cost $25,000 , but the result was a magnificent stone of 143 carats . The Regent of France , during the minority of Louis XV , bought it for $625,000 . One of the most famous of the French crown jewels , it was stolen during the Revolution , along with other precious stones . Most of them never were seen again , but a week later an anonymous letter informed the Commune that the Pitt would be found at a certain spot near the Champs Elysees . Although convinced of a hoax , the government sent soldiers to the place . They found a bundle containing the diamond . Until the Second World War the stone remained in the Louvre , and it is to be hoped that it was hidden before the Germans took over . MOST of these immense diamonds are colorless ; a yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But a few deeply colored diamonds have been eagerly vied for by gem collectors . The most nearly perfect and the largest green diamond , the Dresden Green , is an apple-green , almond-shaped stone of 41 carats . The King of Saxony paid the equivalent of $60,000 for it nearly three hundred years ago . Two beautiful canary-yellow stones are the Tiffany and the Florentine . The latter , 137 carats , one of the largest cut diamonds , is shield-shaped and has a blazing , fiery splendor . It was owned for generations by the Austrian imperial family and was appraised at $950,000 as far back as the seventeenth century . Due to its remarkable , smoldering fire , the Tiffany , 128 carats , is considered by many experts to be the finest yellow diamond . The Hope diamond , a pear-shaped stone of 45 carats , combines glitter and transparency with the cornflower blue of the best sapphires . Nothing is known of the early history of this unique stone , which appeared before the astonished eyes of a London pawnbroker about the middle of the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stolen from the French crown jewels during the Revolution . A banker , Henry Hope , bought it for Edward B. McLea of Washington D. C. for , according to rumor , $300,000 . The spectacular responsibility involved in owning one of these monster diamond : is so great it is no wonder a tradition of bad luck has grown up around them Tiny diamonds , to which sentiment rather than responsibility attaches , seem to be the ones that make people happy . Cara weight does n't have much to do with that  |
