txt BIG BATTLES LOOM , EDEN TELLS HOUSE 3 Parleys in Middle East Have Shortened , but Not , Softened , the Conflict , He Warns By JAMES B. RESTON By Wireless to THE NEW YORE Timms . LONDON , Dec. ** war will be shortened as a result of the Teheran ' and Cairo conferences , but great battles are impending that will demand " all our strength , all our courage and all our unity , " Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden told the House of Commons today . His address opened a two-day debate on foreign affairs . In a speech that was a model of diplomatic deportment and that added little to the communiqu  --  s issued by President Roosevelt , Prime Minister Churchill , Premier Stalin and Generalissimo Chiang Kaishek , the Foreign Secretary said he was " encouraged " by the fact that the United States , Great Britain , Russia and China had achieved such a measure of agreement not only for the prosecution of the war but for the attainment of orderly progress and continuing peace in the world after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawn did not constitute a battle won , and he directed the attention // BIG BATTLES LOOM , EDEN TELLS HOUSE // of the House to the solemn tasks that were ahead . " Plans , however good , " he said , " can only yield results if the forces of all the citizens of all the lands are behind us . We have set ourselves a hard task in our determination to achieve victory at the earliest possible date . Some great battles are impending . For this effott we shall need all our strength , all our courage and all our unity in greater measure than ever before . " Reviews Three Conferences Mr. Eden , who spoke to almost a full house , including Mrs. Churchill , Mrs. Eden , United States Ambassador John J. Winant and the diplomatic representatives of Yugoslavia , Poland , Greece and Belgium , not only reviewed the three conferences at Cairo and Teheran and the military campaign in Italy , but also redefined the principles that were guiding British policy in the tangled political situation in Yugoslavia and Greece . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war against Germany is by no Means over . Mr. Churchill , admitted Mr. Eden , is still busy in planning and conferring here and there with this group and that . But partly because the British want to keep the Germans guessing and partly because Washington has complained so loudly about being " scooped , " nobody in authority is saying any more than is absolutely necessary . Li reviewing the work of the first Cairo conference , which opened Nov. 22 and ended Nov. 26 , Mr. Eden emphasized two points : First , that the United States , Britain and China were determined , not for any purposes of aggrandizement , but in the interest of justice , to bring about the total defeat of Japan and to punish her past aggressions and make it impossible for her to threaten the peace of the world again ; second , that in this task Britain had an equal part with China and the United States . Reiterates Pledge on Pacific " The war with Japan , " he said , " is not one in which we in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if we are compelled , for the time being , to devote the greater part of our human and material resources to the task of defeating Germany , we are still a principal in the Far Eastern war . Japan is just as great a menace to the security of the British Commonwealth as to the security of either the United States or China . * * We should be Utterly unworthy of our heritage and of our tradition if we did not at the earliest possible moment deploy all our resources for the purpose of establishing security of the British Dominions on a firm basis . For that , we have to fight Japan to the bitter end , whatever the cost and however long it takes . " In the course of his report on the first Cairo conference the Foreign Secretary diverged from the broad terms of the communiqu ? only when he paid tribute to the personal qualifications of Mme. and Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek , Mme. Chiang , he told the House , was a great help , not only as interpreter , but as counselor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he remarked that it was difficult not to be deeply impressed by the Generalissimo , even on first meeting . " Under the outward gentleness and gracefulnes of this remarkable personality , " he said , . " there is a a core of supple steel . His is a strength , you feel , that can not be broken . It can only be bent , and then it will spring back with even greater force . " Has Faith in the Future Mr. Eden reported on the Teheran conference with the same studied determination not to go beyond what had been announced in the communiqu ? . After remarking that he had flown from Cairo across the Dead Sea and the Persian hills to Teheran in five and a half hours , the Foreign Secretary emphasized that the Teheran conference , which was held from Nov. 28 to Dec. 1 , had marked the new phase in Anglo-American-Russian collaboration , both for the war . and post-war periods . Attributing much of the success of the conference to the fact that the leaders had met informally in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all hours of the night , Mr. Eden said that when he had returned from the Moscow conference he was confident that the foundations for enduring collaboration among the United States , Britain and the Soviet Union had been laid , but , he added , " I am many times more confident of this today . " Summing up the results of this conference , which he said was directed mainly toward military problems the Foreign Secretary said that the war would be shortened because of the close coordination of military plans that had been attained . " Every plan is now agreed to , " he said , " and the timing is now agreed to and in due course the decisions of the Teheran conference will be unrolled on the field of battle . " The war , however , he emphasized , was but the means of creating an international order so firm in strength and unity that no enemy could seek to challenge it . Six months ago , Mr. Eden said , he could not have been sure that such an order would be created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foundations of that order were a reality . As evidence of this closer collaboration , he said he had seen representatives of the United States , Britain , Russia and France at work on the Advisory Council for Italy , and that this work was " proceeding smoothly and well . " Similarly , the personnel of the European Advisory Commission had been completed with the appointment of Ambassador Winant , whom he called " a most admirable choice . " He said the commission would have its first preliminary meeting tomorrow . Mr. Eden was even more secretive about the conversations that President Roosevelt , Prime Minister Churchill and President Inonu had held in Cairo on the prospect of Turkey 's future relationship to the war . The strategy of silence is clearly being applied to Germany as far as this conference is concerned . About all that the the Foreign Secretary would say , beyond a few polite pleasantries , was that he could say nothing at this time , but had " good hopes " for the future relationship of Turkey , the United States , Britain and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three main conferences without disclosing any important new details , the Foreign Secretary then turned to the relations of Britain with France , Yugoslavia and Greece , all of which have been subject to considerable controversy here during the past few weeks . The statement on France seemed directed to those who had been disturbed by the recent statement of Premier Smuts that France was " gone and would not return as a great power for a long time . " " We believe that this great people , 40,000,000 strong , enriched by the moral and intellectual qualities which have been theirs throughout their history , " he said , " will find the spirit to lift them up again from the heavy blows that have been dealt them in the past four years . " " We believe in the gallantry of the French forces in Tunisia and Libya , which I have heard from our own officers who served with them , and I believe do the heroic and ever-increasing resistance movement in France , some of whose representatives I have met within the past few days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real soul of France . So I say at this time , despite all difficulties , we extend to France our sympathy and our confidence . " Mr. Eden also sought to reassure the other nations of Europe that the United States , Britain and Russia had no intention of establishing a three-power dictatorship over Europe , and he expressed the hope
