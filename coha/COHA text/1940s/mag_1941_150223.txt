Last week , before the President returned from fishing , spring-and something else more ominous than spring-were waiting for him at the White House . <P> Spring came with all the familiar sights and sounds of peaceful generations . The ten acres of White House lawn turned green overnight ; gaspowered , rubber-tired lawn mowers began to whir over the sward 's long roll , barbering the Kentucky bluegrass to the regulation two inches . A man painted the tennis-court backstop ; other men with shears trimmed the California privet hedges in pyramid style . <P> Tiny green feathers delicately blurred the heavy black-purple branches of the Japanese fernleaf beech trees near the Executive Office . Tight green buds popped all over what Calvin Coolidge used to call " the south lot . " One forsythia shrub , near the office , already sprayed yellow . <P> But the something else that came to the White House had none of the happy sights or sounds of peacetime . There were newspapers that told of the look in the eyes of women who last week boarded the Magallanes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some were in tears , some stolid . They were Germans-142 women , 14 children , 35 men-sailing to the Fatherland in what appeared to be a general evacuation . One woman wrote , desperately : " Hitler has ordered our husbands who are members of the Bund to come back to Germany at once . We had to sell our insurance and take all our money to the consul , who gives us only a piece of paper . God help us , we leave our soul and life in America to go , we know not where , only to leave here before Hitler strikes at New York . " Blankly , sadly the women went up the gangplank . Fortnight before , another ship , the Marques de Comillas , had taken 180 Germans . Hitler 's people were fleeing before the shadow of events to come . <P> Nor were Hitler 's people the only refugees . Although the fact was not advertised , Washington knew that U. S. reporters were leaving or preparing to leave Berlin , and reporters do not scare easily . <P> Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Germany were growing imminent . The sign with which the new week opened was the most suggestive of all . <P> In Port Newark , N. J. , an Italian seaman with no love for Il Duce tipped off a customs official that Italian ships in U. S. ports were being systematically sabotaged by their crews . In a few hours word reached the President . Back came an order from the Potomac : seize all German and Italian ships to prevent their being further damaged ; put all Danish ships in protective custody . In Washington , tall , mild , Acting Treasury Secretary Herbert Earle Gaston put his finger on Section I of Title II of the Espionage Act of June 15 , 1917 , authorizing seizure of foreign vessels " to prevent damage or injury to any harbor or waters of the U. S. "
