The train of events which the U.S. had set in motion in North Africa moved ineluctably ahead . How fast it would go , and how far , no man could say . But the nation got a broad hint of the timetable in a significant utterance by future-minded Assistant Secretary-of State Adolf A. Berle Jr . <P> At an Italian-American dinner in Manhattan , Adolf Berle spoke to about 400 Americans and anti-Fascist refugees . But his words were meant for the ears of 45,000,000 bewildered , tired and unhappy people 5,000 miles away . Hardly had the sound died down when they were repeated , via short-wave radio , to the people of Italy . <P> Said Adolf Berle : <P> " As the march of dictatorship began in the Mediterranean , so the march of freedom has at length begun there . <P> " In this new military situation , Italy once more enters the valley of decision . She must decide whether she will exhaust her remaining men , and let her nationhood ebb out as servant of a decaying Nazi state , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Fascists have led her . . . . <P> " We in America insist on hoping that the day will come when we can once more welcome into the brotherhood of civilization a free and friendly Italian nation , giving again to the world the fruit of her shining culture and her splendid traditions . <P> " ... The Italian people now , while the struggle is in progress , can give unquestioned evidence that the philosophy of conquest and force has been conclusively put aside , by joining the struggle against Nazi and Fascist tyranny . . . . <P> " To those true patriots who undertake the liberation of Italy we say , you do not act alone . The armies of America and the United Nations are close at hand . "
