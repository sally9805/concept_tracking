To do a job long left undone , Food Czar Claude Wickard last week put the Department of Agriculture on a wartime basis and picked two energetic lieutenants to help him . The job : to end doodling over a food situation that is rapidly getting out of hand . The men : big , shaggy , 38-year-old Roy Frederick Hendrickson , who became Director of Food Distribution ; tall , sober , 47-year-old Herbert William ( " Parse " ) Parisius , the new Director of Food Production . <P> Both men have had wider Departmental and executive experience than their boss . Roy Hendrickson ( Iowa-born , Minnesota-educated and Associated Press-trained ) in his nine years with the Department has been director of personnel , head of the Surplus Marketing Administration and chief of the Agricultural Marketing Administration . As AMAdministrator he has bought as much as 550 million pounds of foodstuffs a month worth $114 million for Lend-Lease , Red Cross , domestic distribution and reserve stockpiles . <P> Parse Parisius was reared on a Wisconsin farm , taught in Northwestern ( Wis . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wis. , directed Farm Security work in Wisconsin , before becoming assistant to the Secretary of Agriculture . He got to be associate director of Agricultural War Relations last June , when Claude Wickard set up the ineffectual Food Requirements Committee . <P> The Job . Claude Wickard 's Departmental reorganization was his second attempt to streamline his sprawling bureaus . Now , in generalities , he told of the work ahead : The Department is obligated to assure an adequate supply and efficient distribution of food to meet war and essential civilian needs . Waste must be curbed . The U.S. will continue to be the best-fed country in the world . The task is mostly a matter of managing huge U.S. food reserves and keeping housewives informed so they will keep in the program , said he . <P> But well do Roy Hendrickson and Parse Parisius know that the 1943 food problem will not be solved by exhortation and lament , but by painfully undoing the blunders which have reduced the " best-fed nation " to conditions in some places bordering on a food panic . Evidence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angeles food scarcities and labor shortages forced 900 restaurants and 100 butcher shops to close . Slaughtering quotas were used up 20 days ahead of schedule . Canned-milk supply was only 50 to 75% of normal . Butter was unobtainable for many wholesale outlets . Hospitals ran short of some foods . Not a single bid was received to supply food for the 40,000 inmates of California State institutions . <P> &gt; Because of a meat shortage , a Boston wholesaler started selling horse meat at 25 to 50 a Ib . <P> &gt; Chicago was almost out of butter and lard . Also short were prepared flour , vegetable shortenings , macaroni , canned meat . <P> &gt; San Diego residents swarmed across the Mexico line to buy all the food they could . <P> &gt; Philadelphia stores had had next to no beef or veal in a fortnight . Food dealers preferred to mention items in ample supply : cereals , dried beans &; peas , fats , turkeys . Grocery chains were rationing canned goods against hoarding .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
