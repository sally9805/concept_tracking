From Nanking , TIME Correspondent Fred Gruin reported : <P> Although he had a private understanding with President Truman that he would take up the portfolio of the Department of State when Byrnes put it down , General Marshall , too , was surprised at the sudden call from Washington informing him that the time had come . On Monday evening he drove to the Gimo 's to break the news of his departure . <P> <P> Tuesday was crowded with a schedule of packing and farewells that never quite caught up with Marshall . Ambassador Stuart and Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh dropped in for lunch at the general 's high-walled residence on Ning Hai Road . They were still talking over their coffee when the capital 's foreign correspondents arrived for a few off-record remarks and an on-record goodbye . <P> The correspondents were still waiting for an appointment when most of the sub-teenagers of Nanking 's foreign colony straggled in . The General had invited them some time ago for afternoon movies and ice cream ; he would not break this date even for affairs of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of callers , including T. V. Soong and Chou En-lai 's secretary , Chang Wen-chin , the General looked in on the moppets as they disposed of a gallon or so of vanilla . That evening he drove to the Gimo 's again for family dinner . <P> Casual &; Informal . By 7.30 a.m . Wednesday , the huge , four-motored transport 49149 , with five stars on its tailfin , was warmed up and waiting at Nanking Military Airport . It was the same plane which had brought Marshall to China more than a year ago . <P> General Marshall himself arrived at 10 minutes before 8 . On a cold concrete apron , wet with melted snow , a cluster of photographers and dignitaries were waiting . Among the latter were Ambassador Stuart , Premier T. V. Soong , Chief of Staff Chen Cheng , Communications Minister Yu Ta-wei , Foreign Minister Wang Shih-chieh , General G. Q. Huang , Communist spokesman Wang Ping-nan . It was all very casual and informal-no ropes , no visible guards ; everyone intermingled . <P> Marshall shook hands all around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Formosan shaddock and pomelo ( akin to grapefruit ) , urged everyone not to wait in the chill damp outdoors . For a few moments he stood alone by the ramp ; he seemed a trifle impatient because the Gimo and Madame were late . <P> They arrived five minutes after the hour . As they stepped out , one on each side of the Cadillac limousine , Marshall moved up . He greeted Madame first . " Give my love to your madame , " she said , " and come back , come back soon . " <P> Then the Gimo , his nose red in the cold , saluted and haoed . They trailed Marshall up the ramp into the plane for final words . As they emerged the Gimo almost brushed off his military cap against the hatch top ; he caught it in time and came down smiling . The hatch door slammed ; 49149 rolled away . As it lifted into the air , with the snow-dusted purple mountain as a backdrop , the last one to wave adieu was Ambassador Stuart . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next hour-that the great man was flying off to a greater job .
