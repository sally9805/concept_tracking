ST . MALACHY 'S COURT ( 170 pp ) - Olivia Robertson-Odyssey Press ( $2 ) . <P> Olivia Robertson is a well-bred young Irishwoman who has done social work in an improved Dublin slum . Like many other social workers who make copy of their experiences , Author Robertson sometimes commits to print anecdotes and adventures that probably sounded fine at the time but , in type , only seem strained and amateurish , like a genteel effort to make a smutty-faced child blow its nose . The savor of the subject , however , often rises above her polite intentions . <P> The caretaker of St. Malachy 's Court was n't sure how to explain the fact that his flats teemed with children . Said he : " Some say it 's the sea air or the Liffey or potatoes , and more that it 's just contrariness . " <P> Miss Robertson , in charge of the playground , found , like others before her , that the children got far more affection than those of small upper-class families . But it was casual affection ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told-the police could always pick up a score or so of babies left behind on Dublin Bay strand . <P> One of the prolific mothers , a Mrs. Fitzgerald , paid impartial homage to statesmanship by calling her eighth Eamon , her ninth Winston ; Mrs. Noonan named her 13th and 14th Pius and Pascal . A connoisseur of hospitals , Mrs. Noonan scorned the nurses who had attended her on the occasion of Padraic . " Nosey . They was that nosey that they turned out me locker for to clean it . Quare sort of cleaning they gev it . Examinin ' me belongin 's . Jest because I had put away a couple of biscuits and crunchies and some fish and chips me cousin got me and pickled pigs ' trotters , they told me I was encouragin ' the mice with me larder . Larder . Impedence . I said there would n't be anny mice in that hospital with all the CATS in APERRONS . That shook ' em . " <P> Some of the slum families were consumptive , some " harmless " ( a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down upon for reasons of caste : tinkers , or beggars , or those who live on charity , in the tenements ( once fine 18th Century houses ) of Napper Tandy Street . Twisty Nellie , a professional beggar who always promised a prayer to her benefactors , explained with spirit : " Sure how could I say a prayer for each one of them separate ! I 'd be at it all the day . I says a little prayer for the whole huroosh . " Twisty Nellie 's story , like the story of how the tinker 's daughter quelled " blowing " ( a nasty kind of shivaree ) after her wedding , cries aloud for more narrative art than Miss Robertson has .
