The battlefield east of Celles was a white silence , darkly blotched with corpses and wreckage . At Celles , three miles short of the Meuse River , the German spearhead which had reached 50 miles into Belgium was blunted and turned back . <P> When Field Marshal Gerd von Rundstedt 's advanced forces reached Celles they were jumped by First Army tanks , artillery and infantry , aided by U.S. and British planes . The enemy lost 63 tanks , 49 guns , 177 vehicles , 1,200 prisoners , uncounted dead . Then , in a wild two-day battle the German remnants were driven back to Rochefort . <P> Rocks in the Stream . The German drive had already been slowed down by the heroic stand of the 101st Airborne at Bastogne ( see below ) , which confined Rundstedt 's columns to secondary roads north and south of the town . The 82nd Airborne had put up a fierce defense around Stavelot , the 7th Armored between Saint-Vith and Vielsalm , the 1st Infantry at the north shoulder of the salient below Monschau , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The two infantry outfits had prevented Rundstedt from widening the salient 's base . They were pegs that did not pull out . <P> In the path of the Germans , U.S. troops died with knives clenched in their fists , having run out of ammunition . Others , bypassed and trapped , lived for days on raw potatoes . The situation looked bad when the two German prongs merged in one bulge . It seemed the enemy might reach the great sweep of the Meuse from Lige to Sedan , dig in behind the river . <P> In the early days of the attack , General Eisenhower had hustled to a headquarters at Verdun , conferred with his top generals . In 15 minutes he had appraised the scope and probable aims of the push , taken his decisions , issued his orders . First Army reserves bore down from the north , compressed the salient 's right flank , recaptured Grandmenil and Manhay . On the south , General Patton 's armor blasted a corridor to Bastogne , pushed on to the north and then west to encircle the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacking front all the way east to Echternach . <P> Shrinking Salient . Last week Patton 's wedge was only 13 miles from the First Army dents in the north . The German position was something like that in the Falaise-Argentan pincers of last summer . Could the Germans get out ? It was well to remember that last summer , when the Wehrmacht was less ably commanded than it is now , the Germans who had seemed hopelessly bottled in the Falaise trap were able to extricate five divisions of armor almost intact . If Rundstedt was content with the delay and damage already wrought against his foes in the west , he might be able to pull back to the West Wall without serious loss . <P> Up to this week , however , he gave no sign of preparing such a move . His salient was contracting , but it was shrinking around a hard armored shell-in which he might be regrouping for another thrust at Lige , main Allied rear base for the Aachen-Cologne sector . The first heavy German blow in four days was an assault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
