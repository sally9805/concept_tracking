For weeks the head of America 's only Popular Front Government , Chile 's President Pedro ( " Don Tinto " ) Aguirre Cerda , has been on an uneasy seat in Santiago 's grey , pillared Moneda Palace . Struggling for power have been members of the President 's own Radical Party , Communists , Rightists , Germanophile Army officers . <P> While the Popular Front swayed , bushy-mustached President Aguirre felt more &; more like a man who does not govern but merely presides . He spent more &; more time with the red wine he cultivates . Fort night ago he was reported ill . <P> This week his journalistic enemy , El Imparcial , called for a medical bulletin to allay " public anxiety . " Don Tinto issued a political bulletin . He announced his temporary retirement on account of bronchitis and grippe , by law turned over his powers to Minister of the Interior Mndez.
