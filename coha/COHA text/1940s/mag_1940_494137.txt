enmark under Duress ONE of the most shocking Nazi triumphs is in the war of propaganda . Every day you find evidences of this in American talk and in the American press . All kinds of people , and most of them by no means stupid , do the dirty work for Hitler without stopping for an instant to reflect how dirty it is . They could protect themselves against propagating error if they paused for a single moment to ask themselves what the real facts happen to be , but no , out of thoughtlessness or out of insensitiveness they take the appearance of events just as the Germans wish them to , and they pass on the counterfeit quite airily . It is this uncritical habit of mind that the Germans have traded on so successfully . And , bad as this is for the British , who have so many fault-finders to reckon with , it is infinitely worse for the less powerful nations which the Germans have invaded and occupied . The British , at least , have the means of counter-assertion . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The less powerful peoples , especially those who are not fighting and can not fight , are only sure of public attention and public sympathy when they are hot news . The minute they pass out of the spotlight , inattentive people either suppose that the fight is over and that sympathy would consequently be wasted , or else they conclude that the submerged nation has in some way gone over to the Germans and must be considered , if not a positive enemy at least an unwilling ally of the monstrous Nazi game . This injustice , so heedless but so damnable , is something the Nazi cynics can count on . They promote this confusion . They spread this smoke screen . Denmark is particularly in my mind . The facts about the Danish invasion are perfectly plain . I left Denmark last December when the war had been in progress for over three months . At times during the previous year there had been rumors in the American press that there were Nazi sympathizers in Denmark . During that period , before England and France declared war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much Nazi sympathy there actually was . I can read the Danish papers well enough to know what they report . I had close relationships with many Danes . I was in touch with a few officials and some of the foreign residents . Speaking as a witness of this casual but thoroughly interested type , I assert that Denmark was overwhelmingly pro-British in her sympathies . I do not say 95 percent . I think 95 percent is too low . Out of the total population of nearly four millions , there might have been 50,000 who actively favored Germany either because of German blood , German affiliations or German business connections . The estimates that men gave me varied between 50,000 and 75,00o . To say 200,000 ? which would be five percent ? is to exaggerate the number and to misrepresent the weight of Nazi sentiment . Among the leaders there was no Nazi sentiment . I met one prominent man who had been honored by Hitler and thought Hitler a genius . There were perhaps half a dozen known to me who thought Denmark " soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of admiration and anti-Semitism were about as common as the study of Greek . But in aristocratic military circles , certainly , a few pro-Nazi Danes could be found , and Berlingske Tidende , the Conservative paper , took out a lot of insurance in spite of printing Nic . Blaedel 's devastating articles and editorials on Nazi Germany . On . the eve of signing trade agreernents , Germany put on what pressure she could . Blaedel took a vacation , in consequence , and several of the more pungent cartoonists were asked to go easy . Accompanying this , however , there was the action of the Danish state against the Nazi ex-Communists who ran a Nazi paper and were a bunch of blackmailers . The prosecution of these Nazis was public . The leaders were put in jail . And Denmark , in addition , rounded up and jailed a big batch of German spies , not so long before the outbreak of war . These positive acts refute the charge that Denmark , knowing herself weak , was abject in deference to her mighty neighbor . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the processes of law , Denmark , taking every care not to arouse the pathological Hitler , did set in motion those processes that , up to April 9 , 1940 , were a practical assertion of sovereign being and sovereign right . Now we come to April 9 , the morning of invasion . The Danes woke up to see the air black with bombing planes . The troops that had been sneaked into the harbor in coal ships were poured into the city . A great army crossed the border . And , with these menaces directed at a small and relatively helpless nation , there was obviously no way of avoiding the " protectorate " that Germany thrust on Denmark , under conditions not yet made public . There were , of course , a few acts of resistance that amounted to suicide . But did Danish sovereignty vanish because Denmark took no military stand ? Against the army that crumpled Holland and Belgium and without the least chance of obtaining kelp from Britain , I can not for the life of me see what Denmark could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , indeed , have sent her small army to its death . She might have made Copenhagen a burnt offering . But where the duel can only be waged on another plane with any prospect of success , I can not believe any sensible man would desire , or even countenance , a brute resistance which , however exciting to newspaper readers , would have been a military absurd . ity of the most excruciating kind . The only critics 1 respect in this affair are the individuals who feel so strongly as to enlist themselves . They mean what they say . The others hold up a standard for Denmark which neutrals in this war , especially powerful neutrals , have scarcely the right to put forward . To the movie-goer , if we are to believe Miss Cecelia Ager in PM ( December 2 , 1940 ) , " there was a time when it would seem plausible that the captain of a Danish freighter would do and dare all to help a lady British spy outwit some dastardly German spies , and not be a German spy himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hero of " Blackout , " who is a Dane , " is mistaken for the villain " just because he is a Dane . He is suspected of being a German spy ! One despairs of popular audiences that know no better than this They live in a world so elementary in its classifications that a Goebbels can play them like a piano . Denmark , it is , true , did not become the ally of a Britain that was , until recently , the Britain of Chamberlain , Simon and Hoare . Neither did Norway become Britain 's ally . But the only difference between Denmark and Norway , after April 9 , is the difference between a flat , thickly populated Scandinavian country and a mountainous , thinly populated one The national spirit is so fundamentally similar in both countries that the movie audience that thinks of the Dane as a viilain is even more muddleheaded than a movie audience has a license to be . The invasion of Denmark was a treacherous invasion . It was also irresistible . But this does not mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The weapon that was thrust into the Danes by the Germans did not make them hurl themselves on the Germans physically , but ever since April 9 the Danes have been so stirred by the outrage that every fiber is roused . Instinctively and from their depths these people have begun to accrete that power to endure which is one of the characters of a healthy body when assaulted ? to endure , and to resist . Before April 9 , Danishness was in solution . Now it has precipitated around the foreign intrusion . It has done so concretely , and beyond all mistake . I saw a Dane the other day in New York who had just come out of Denmark . He wore a small Danish flag in his buttonhole . He told me that the man who made this flag had at once sold three hundred thousand of them . On the Sundays this summer the Danes found themselves assembling for a " sing , " an " all-sing . " As many as 150,000 came to one place in Copenhagen to join in song . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same purpose , but as the words of the best-known patriotic and spiritual songs were not entirely familiar to everyone , a single volunteer decided to print and send out the indispensable songs . These were mailed to 1,100,000 Danes ? every householder and more in all Denmark . The machinery of the famous folk high schools has been retuned to meet the emergency . Unemployed are sent free to folk high schools . Books on every aspect of the national life are being circulated as in the old days , after the war of 1864 . The most popular lectures are lectures on Grundtvig , the inspiring national leader of that period , as well as lectures on tragic heroes , on figures such as Socrates and Jesus . In fervor such as this there is craving for symbols , and for figures that can be held symbolic . The King of Denmark , who was seventy years old the other day , has now become just such a figure , after long years of tolerant acceptance as a monarchical holdover . " The King 's birthday , " word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Copenhagen . It was the occasion for a vast personal tribute to the old King and hundreds of people followed him on his early morning ride , strewing flowers in front of his horse and crying , pressing his hand and generally letting go of all their pent-up feelings . In the afternoon when he drove through the city there were probably a million people on the streets . When you consider that it was a drive without any military display ( four mounted policemen and two police cars ) , it showed that we wanted to show the King and our guests exactly what we thought . Personally I saw only the top of the radio receiver on the last police car . There were no guests ' on the street that day , which was very wise . The children had good places in a window . I am glad they saw him ; they will never forget it . Curiously enough , the monarchy is an asset in our present situation . It is above parties and politics , and were it not for the King 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job and the high respect he rates , I am sure we would by this time have another government along the lines of poor Norway . " That is the mood of Denmark six weeks ago . The answer to Hitler 's war ? which has a spiritual intention in it ? is the proof of a contrary intention in the bone and marrow of the Scandinavians . All the values that are paraded in " Mein Kampf " can not rally a bigger uniformed force of Danes ? Nazi Danes ? than 600 . Denmark has business men , of course , who may be tempted by the organization of companies dominated from Germany . The natural aim of the Reich is to weave Denmark into the German economic realm , and to break down the strong Danish labor organizations . The killing of cattle is not only a food measure ; it is863 part of the deliberate purpose that runs all through Nazi statecraft , striving to exploit the desperation of hampered and needy classes . But against this , against the seductions as well as the bullying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of meeting compulsion with compulsion , she translates herself on to the plane where , as a national being , she has existed for hundreds and hundreds of years . The Danes are at once gentle and tenacious . They do everything in their power to reduce conflict , and to abide by existing law . But lawlessness and treachery , such as marked the German invasion , create in them an obduracy that is immeasurable . Slesvig , after all , was occupied by the Germans for six and fifty years . The Danes in SlesVig had to send their children to German schools in the morning . " What did you hear today ? " they 'd ask the pupils on their return home . The pupils would say , " We were told so and so . " " Lies , lies , " said the Danes to these little captives of the Prussians . Out of this captivity they emerged as Danish as ever . The captivity they have now entered upon wo n't be different .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
