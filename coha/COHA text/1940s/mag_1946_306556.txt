Under President Truman 's " reamrmation " of an outdated China policy ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , Mediator George C. Marshall has nothing left to mediate . Chiang Kaishek , who , when he was less strong , refused to trust the Communists with a veto position in his Government , is obviously not going to do so after his recent military victories over the Reds . <P> Instead , Chiang might try to win Marshall 's support in a way more realistic than that suggested by the Truman statement . A democratic constitution democratically drafted would give the U.S. a chance to revise its policy and move closer to wholehearted cooperation with Chiang . As if he recognized that opportunity , Chiang last week appeared in dramatic opposition to ideological reactionaries in his own party in China 's National Assembly . <P> Subcommittee Setback . Truculent Kuomintang fundamentalists seized the initiative in some of the subcommittees set up to study the draft constitution . Their most fiery leader was goat-bearded Kung Keng , 73 , who discourses mystically and interminably on the relationship between chuan and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were properly defined only in the specific constitutional directives of Kuomintang Founder Sun Yatsen . A tired Young China partyman disrespectfully shouted : " This is no place for orations . " Kung Keng , who looks like a medieval wizard , but has a long revolutionary record , paled with anger . His supporters hurled abuse at his critics . <P> After military police restored order , Kung 's men won on the vote-they amended Article 27 of the constitution draft , to give the future Assembly ( and therefore the Kuomintang ) almost absolute powers . Young China delegates and Democratic Socialists talked darkly of Kuomintang dictatorship , threatened to walk out of the Assembly . Cried the newspaper Ta Kung Pao : " The fundamental spirit of the constitution is shaking ! " <P> Limited Victory . When the subcommittees reported to the steering committee , the diehards reached their high-water mark , angrily amended the first article to eliminate the Lincolnesque phrase " of the people , by the people , for the people , " kept only Sun Yat-sen 's credo of government on the basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle groups : " Since only one party is enacting the constitution , who will hold the Assembly ? " Carson Chang , boss of the Democratic Socialists , wired from Shanghai instructions that his delegation must not yield to the Kuomintang diehards on Articles 1 or 27 . <P> At that point , the Generalissimo intervened . He angrily lectured Kuomintang delegates in a party caucus , told them they must consider external as well as internal situations and respect other parties opinions . The oldsters subsided . Next day the steering committee reconsidered , restored the original Article 27 , the original Article I. But the final victory had to await the full Assembly session .
