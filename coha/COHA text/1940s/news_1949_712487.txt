txt BERLIN , Nov. ** interference with the freedom and liberty of nations outside the Soviet bloc must be met where it occurs , Secretary of State Dean Acheson declared today . The senior member of the Cabinet of the United States flew to Berlin through fog and rain this morning to bring to the people of the city 's Western sectors a message of hope and encouragement for " the continuing struggle " in Germany . After conferring with Lord Mayor Ernst Reuter and other West Berlin officials and United States , British and French occupation authorities Secretary Acheson departed for the United States by plane at 9:35 o'clock tonight after about seventy-five hours in Germany . The climax of a crowded day in Berlin came when , speaking to a press conference , the Secretary of State laid down the courses of acton to be followed in solving the " problems of the world . " These problems , he said , fall into two general categories . " There are those problems which exist because a group of powers , led by the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interfere with the whole environment of freedom and liberty which many nations still have and intend to keep , " Mr. Acheson said . " Now those thrusta have to be met where they occur , " he added bluntly . Other problems , he said , would exist whether the Soviet Union existed or not . " Those are the great problems of economic recovery in Britain , France , in Germany , in Southeast Asia and the entire Middle East , " Mr. Acheson declared . " Those problems call for what we might describe as the most constructive ; I , part of domestic policy here and of American policy abroad . " Answering a question , the Secretary of State said he knew of no immediate plan for a fourpower meeting aimed at solving these problems , particularly in Germany . The Secretary of State was the // Acheson in Berlin Pledges Help In Countering the Soviet 's Moves // epitome of diplomacy when he greeted Gen. Vassily I. Chuikov and other Russian leaders in Germany at a reception this evening . General Chuikov , who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Control Commission for the East German Democratic ( Communist ) Republic , headed a group that included Maj. Gen. Alexander G. Kotikov , Soviet Commander in Berlin , and V. S. Semyenov , political adviser to Genera , Chuikov . No two men are less alike than squat , burly General Chuikov and the scholarly , debonair United States Secretary of State . Yet the latter apparently bridged the gap between them , and General Chuikov 's craggy face broke into frequent smiles during their conversation . When General Chuikov came to say good night Secretary Acheson offered him a stirrup cup . The hard bitten Russian general and the easy smiling diplomat drank ? and it was the Russian who shook his head after drinking , not the American . The jaunty and vigorous Secretary apparently made as deep an impression on the harried Berliners today as he did upon the stolid Rhinelenders yesterday at Bonn . About 500 persons stood in the rain outside Tempelhof airfield to watch his car leave the field . Four or five hundred more were gathered at the Western sector 's City Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the municipal government . They cheered and applauded as the Secretary entered and left the building . Mr. Acheson responded by waving his black homburg hat . Mayor Reuter , confident Mr. Acheson 's visit would show not only the Soviet Union but the politicians of Western Germany how much Berlin means to the United States , assured the Secretary of State the Germans would work " hand in hand " with the United States in meeting their common problems . " I want you to go back to your Government fully conscious that we are standing with you in the common fight , " Mayor Reuter told Mr. Acheson at the City Hall . " And just as we can depend on you , so you can rely on us . Your visit here is proof that Berlin has not been abandoned and will not be abandoned , " the Lord Mayor added . Speaking at the press conference , Mr. Acheson declared the United States intention to stand by the Germans and to " meet with complete resolution and without wavering of any sort at any time " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany . It was at this point in response to a question that the Secretary of State outlined two categories of problems facing the world . Berlin , he said , was a symbol of courage during the blockade , and today it is a symbol " of the continuing struggle which must go on in Germany and which calls for firm effort and resolution on the part of the Germans . " The United States and the other occupation powers will respond to this effort " by continued and determined help , " he asserted . Again , as at Bonn , the Secretary of State reminded the Germans that American aid would go to those determined to help themselves . He had been irritated , Mr. Acheson recalled , by people in the United States who had talked about the failure of American policy in China . " It was not the failure of American policy in China , " he said . " It was the failure of Chinese policy in China . " If a nation has got within inself the resources of mind and spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is faced with some difficulties which are too much for it to overcome alone , then the United States can help , " he declared . But if a nation has not got the necessary resources of mind , spirit and energy , Mr. Acheson declared , " all the help in the United States " will not achieve results . The Secretary of State urged Berliners to " nurture and develop the liberties and opportunities which are now yours and which over a period of time you can bring to great fruition . " For the second time since his arrival in Germany , Mr. Acheson prefaced his remarks to the press with assurance that John J. McCloy , United States High Commissioner , who was seated at his right , " has the full and complete support of the President of the United States and the Secretary of State of the United States . " Secretary Acheson 's visit here included a luncheon at the home of Maj. Gen. Maxwell D. Taylor , United States commander in Berlin , attended by Dr. Reuter and Dr. Otto . Suhr , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call to City Hall , Mr. Acheson discussed the Berlin situation with General Taylor and senior members of the High Commission 's Berlin element . Later Dr. Reuter and a group of German officials arrived and the discussion continued .
