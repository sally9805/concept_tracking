txt In a brief address last night , Herbert Hoover noted the world 's and his country 's affairs , contented himself with a terse comment on each , and then told 1,200 diners in the grand ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel that " for the good of your digestion " he would not speak on any of the subjects he had mentioned . The audience of business men and distinguished guests gathered at the " Business Speaks " dinner of the New York Board of Trade heard him nevertheless deliver comments tinged with sarcasm on balancing the Federal budget , loans to foreign governments , the welfare state , Federal reorganization , world unity ( or its lack ) , and financing of the Point 4 progrant The audience , obviously surprised at the humor of Mr. Hoover 's seven-minute address , greeted it at first with polite smiles . As he continued , the smiles changed to bursts of laughter . Mr. Hoover received at the dinner , along with Gen. George C. Marshall a gold plaque awarded by the organization each year to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Others who spoke were Gen. Hoyt S. Vandenberg , Chief of Staff of the Air Force , land Paul G. Hoffman , head of the/Economic Cooperation Administration . General Vandenberg 's appearance before the House Armed ' , Services Committee was postponed a day so that he could attend the dinner . The former ' resident prefaced his remarks with the observation that he had been searching for a topic that would make Page 1 , yvhich he said seemed to be the " real test " of whether the recipient has said anything to justify the award . " I found , " Mr. Hoover said , " they all relate to ideas of alarm , emergency , crisis , warning , purge , execution , condemnation , or the current practice of diplomats in denouncing other governments . So // HOOVER MAKES BID FOR PAGE OM PLAY . // looked over those intellectual ovinces to see if I could find a shot that might land . " Mr. Hoover said he thought it ought to shock the world if he said something about balancing the Federal budget but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last eighteen years . " He considered , he said , a " mordant economic discourse on why loans by our taxpayers to foreign governments physically can not and never will be repaid . " That idea he found " has not been news since the first World War . " " I thought , perhaps , " Mr. Hoover went on , " I might define the welfare state . But I feel it would be respectful to concede the President has a monopoly of shocks from that quarter . " Mr. Hoover said it would be natural for him to discuss his work as chairman of the Commission on the Reorganization of the Executive Branch of the Government . On this point he said he found all I political parties agreed in the same fashion of universal acceptance " which our grandmothers established for mustard plasters . " " But it has the same sort of exception  --  the fellow to be reorganized , " he commented .

It is vitriolic international conversation that gets Page 1 , Column 1 . " The Point 4 program , " whereby American private enterprise is presumed to go abroad and fill the world with milk and honey , " he ruled out because " you already know that by double taxation at home . " " Business , " he said , " now has more than it can bear without seeking to expose itself twice more to the tax mercies of two countries ' at the same time . To suggest a mitigation of taxes between these two might help but you can not make headline stuff of double taxation in this world , to say nothing I of such quadruple taxation . " " For all these reasons and for the good of your digestion , " Mr. Hoover ? closed , " I will speak on none of these subjects . " I will content myself with expressing my deep gratitude for the honor which you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tribute to General Marshall that except for the Marshall Plan , Europe now would be dominated by the Russians . General Vandenberg also paid tribute to General Marshall as soldier and statesman .
