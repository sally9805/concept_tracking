The University of Oklahoma has changed presidents almost as often as the State changed Governors , and for the same reason-politics . One of its few professors of distinction , the late Vernon Louis Parrington , was fired in 1908 for smoking cigarets . He later won a Pulitzer prize in history ( for Main Currents in American Thought ) . <P> Last year Oklahoma made Joseph August Brandt , 41 , a red-haired newspaperman , its president . Even Brandt 's opponents admit that the results have been extraordinary . <P> Big , bony Joe Brandt , who has been a Rhodes Scholar , city editor of the Tulsa Tribune , director of Oklahoma 's and later Princeton 's University Press , breezed into his new job with one big if unoriginal idea : the university should be a place where people learned to think . Said he : " It 's time to discover a Harvard in the Middle West . " <P> First thing Prexy Brandt did was to liquidate some ivy-covered traditions . His wife , an ex-newspaperwoman herself , cut out the reception @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oklahoma 's presidents ) . Joe invited groups of honor students to join him in the " White House " game room , where they ate wieners and hashed over the state of the world . He strode around the campus hatless and with a pipe in his mouth , worked in his shirtsleeves , installed a typewriter at his desk on which to bat out ideas . Undergraduates soon began to cry " Hello , Joe " when they passed his house at night . He abolished fraternity rush week and undergraduate car-driving ( because of the war ) , made short shrift of flunkers . <P> Then he attacked the catalogue of courses . Most State university presidents agree that the worst handicap to education in their universities is the curriculum , a Sears , Roebuck affair that makes little connected sense . Inveighing against this " trade-school " trend in U.S. higher education , President Brandt launched a plan ( like the Hutchins plan at the University of Chicago ) whereby every Oklahoma undergraduate must complete a two-year course of liberal education before he is allowed to specialize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creative thought , " Brandt rotated department chairmanships among them ; they soon began to turn out more original research . He went to the Legislature , breezily asked for $452,000 to raise professors ' salaries and build an industrial research laboratory . A legislator drawled : " Well , President Brandt . . . " " Call me Joe , " flashed Joe . He got the $452,000 . <P> By last week Oklahoma , like other universities , had been hit by the draining of its men into war service ( 17% of its 6,000 students ) , but rode on a crest of Brandtian optimism . Thanks to Brandt who helped get a naval base and aviation school established at Norman , the University town , University and Town were booming . <P> President Brandt pooh-poohs the idea that liberal education will be a casualty of World War II , says confidently : " There will be no place in the world after the war for gentlemen in the old European sense of men trained merely in Greek and in Latin , but there will always be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
