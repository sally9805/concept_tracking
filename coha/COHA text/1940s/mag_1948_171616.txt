There was not a political germ in the room . Secretary of State George C. Marshall looked at the representatives of 41 nations , including Russia , and remarked dryly : " Thank God , your purpose here , without recriminations , without undue argument , is solely to do good in the world . " The 2,000 doctors , scientists and public health officials had gathered in Washington , D.C. to wage biological warfare against a common enemy , tropical disease . <P> Slowing Malaria . The best news concerned man 's No. 1 enemy in the tropics : malaria . Every year , malaria strikes 300,000,000 people , and kills 3,000,000 of them . But with the now common household spray DDT , " it is a safe statement that at least 90% of the malaria of the world can be wiped out in the next ten years , and that 's conservative , " said Dr. Fred Soper of the Pan American Sanitary Bureau . <P> Cost : about $280 million , besides what local governments in the tropics spend . But there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money . A medical entomologist in the British colonial service warned : " If work should cease , even for a relatively short time , the vectors mosquitoes would return and we would be in the position of having produced a population without natural immunity . " <P> Fears that veterans returning from the Pacific would increase malaria in the U.S. have proved groundless , said Dr. Justin Andrews of the U.S. Public Health Service . Though 30,000 veterans are still drawing disability pay for malaria , there has been only one case of a veteran transmitting malaria to another person . <P> What could be done about malarial mosquitoes which escape DDT campaigns ? Four war-born drugs help their victims , the conference was told : 1 ) chloroquine , more active than quinine or atabrine , and much less toxic ; 2 ) pentaquine , which has reduced the relapse rate in the vivax form of malaria from 98% to 25% ; 3 ) iso-pentaquine , a variant of pentaquine , so far tried on only 100 cases ; 4 ) Paludrine , which controls vivax malaria with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news about another old enemy of man : worms . There are some 2,000,000,000 people in the world and around 2,200,000,000 cases of worm infestation ( some people have more than one kind of worms ) , reported the Rockefeller Institute 's Dr. Norman R. Stoll . Most worms thrive in the tropics , home of half the human race , and a reservoir of food and raw materials for the rest of the world . <P> In one belt extending almost around the world ( from East Pacific islands to southeast Asia , equatorial Africa , northeast coast of South America , and up to the Caribbean islands ) , 189,000,000 people have filariasis , which causes swelling in the lymphoid tissues . About 20,000,000 people have oncocerciasis , which causes blindness when the worms get into the eyes . A new antimony compound called Neostibosan has proved effective against filariasis , and another new drug , hetrazan , against oncocerciasis . <P> But there was nothing new for schistosomiasis , which attacks the liver and intestines of 114,000,000 people a year , mostly in the tropics . Nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease , hookworm , which afflicts 457,000,000 people in the world , including 1,000,000 in the U.S. There is , said Dr. Stoll , no ideal drug for any worm disease , and meanwhile the worm population is keeping pace with the human . <P>
