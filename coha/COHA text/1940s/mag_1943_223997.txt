Sousa Swung <P> Sirs : <P> I have just read with complete disgust . . . that Captain Glenn Miller has begun to " swing " the age-old , magnificent marches of John Philip Sousa ( TIME , Sept. 6 ) . . . . <P> When Sousa wrote them he left no room for improvement . <P> -* <P> Portland , Me . <P> Sirs : <P> Captain Glenn Miller has the right idea swinging those Sousa marches . The tunes are marvelous but the way Army bands have played them in the past has made them sound like an old-fashioned victrola which needed to be wound up . . . . <P> LEE TYLER <P> Newton , Mass . <P> Sirs : <P> There is so much more I could and should have said against the " swinging " of legitimate and famous military marches . . . . No ! Sousa marches do not need " streamlining " - but probably a few of the " bandmasters " who advocate the " swinging " of his music do . <P> Any good band under a capable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) or any other standard march will thrill and inspire the marching soldiers . The sad thing is that most bands never rehearse marches at all or , if they do , not as they should . . . . <P> Personally , I feel that the question of swinging military marches is a question for commanding officers to settle . Do they want their armies to march with military bearing , to fine inspiring rhythm-or do they prefer them to " jitterbug " their way along ? . . . <P> EDWIN FRANKO GOLDMAN <P> Mt . Tremper , N.Y . <P> Greek Words For It <P> Sirs : <P> I would like to protest against Mr. Winston Churchill 's terrible term " triphibious , " as applied to Lord Louis Mountbatten . . . . Amphibious , derived from the Greek words double and life , means adapted to both elements of life , i.e. , land and water ; hence the correct neologism would be ( in the case of Lord Louis , able to fight on land , water and air ) tribious . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City <P> - Mr. Churchill will not be disturbed . He took careful exception to his own phrase : " Mountbatten is what , pedants notwithstanding , I will venture to call a complete triphibian. . . .

SIDDERS <P> New York City <P> Tundra Troopers <P> Sirs : <P> . . . I am the wife of Captain Robert Thompson , who commands the Alaska Scouts ( TIME , Aug. 9 ) , and the picture , which you identify as him , is actually Sergeant Hiram Walker . This mistake has appeared in three magazines now . . . . Also , your picture of Larry ( " Diamond Jim " ) Beloff , half-breed , is William ( " Diamond Jim " ) Seaton . William Seaton is no more half-breed than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The article itself was very good and accurate and I am very proud of it . . . . <P> I am enclosing a recent picture of my husband taken upon his return from a scouting trip . <P> MRS .
