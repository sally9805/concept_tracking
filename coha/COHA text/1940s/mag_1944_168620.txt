In Halifax one day last week , a tall , grey-eyed Scottish stranger called on Nova Scotia Premier A. Stirling MacMillan . The stranger announced that he was " glad to be home . " He would , he said , like to buy part of Nova Scotia . <P> The idea was not so dizzy as it seemed . The Scot was William Francis Forbes-Sempill , 50 , Colonel the Baron Sempill , and also possessor of a title many Nova Scotians had not known existed : Baronet of Nova Scotia . An ancestor , one Sir William Forbes , served King James I in England 's 17th-Century civil wars , had been rewarded with the baronetcy and 16,000 acres in " New Scotland . " When " New Scotland " was ceded to the French in 1632 , Sir William lost the land but kept the title . <P> Lord Sempill fought with the Royal Flying Corps in World War I , later served in the British Air Ministry and as aeronautical adviser to the Greek and Japanese Governments . He sits in Britain 's House @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aberdeenshire . <P> His lordship ( a Roman Catholic ) was in Canada on wartime business for the Knights of Columbus . Looking at Nova Scotia had given him his great idea . He would purchase a chunk of provincial acreage , after war 's end transplant Scots from his own bleak estate . A new link between old and new Scotland would be forged , his hereditary holdings would in a sense be reclaimed , everyone would be happy .
