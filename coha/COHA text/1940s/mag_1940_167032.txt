Last week staggering events and mighty pressures brought out the strength and weaknesses of the U. S. character . Signs of weakness there were aplenty . The most mechanically-minded people on earth-the builders of 166,794 factories , of 65% of the world 's automobiles-learned to their dismay that they did not have enough airplanes to fight the kind of war Hitler had loosed on the world , did not have enough trained men to build the plants that could create them . In a fury of frustration they jumped on each other , developed morbid fears of invisible enemies , chased ghosts and phantoms , looked backward to bemoan old mistakes and ancient blunders . Greater sign of weakness was that-though no longer was a crisis doubted-no great national program came into being that could give each man his place in a giant effort , give a creative release to pent-up emotions . <P> Plentiful were signs of strength : <P> &gt; Strong was the approval of President Roosevelt 's recommendations for defense , of the speed of Congress in appropriating $3,297,000,000 . Few were complaints about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $7,100,000,000 spent in the last seven years flourished despite the President 's explanation in his fireside talk ) ; unanimous was the realization that a Hitler triumph demanded sacrifice . <P> &gt; But defense corps and rifle clubs that popped up all over the U. S. made it plain that no mere appropriation of money could give the U. S. a sense of security , satisfy the U. S. demand for action . Springing from hysteria , an itch for publicity , a deep-seated fear that official defense measures might be botched , or a resurgence of the old backwoods instinct that nothing so calms a man 's nerves as polishing a rifle , defense organizations flourished so widely last week that they belonged , as did fifth-column talk , in the category of a national phenomenon . In Manhattan leaders of the National Legion of Mothers of America organized the Molly Pitcher Rifle Legion , pledged to target practice once a week . Purpose : to pick off descending parachute troops , when and if . <P> In California the legislature approved a plan to organize Citizen Guards units patterned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crack shots of the Illinois Skeet Association , the American Police Revolver League , etc. , formed the Sports men 's Defense Reserve , pledged to organize the 7,000,000 members of U. S. shooting and rifle clubs into " a civilian army of modern minute men . . . . " <P> Aid to the Allies . There was strength in the U. S. 's final acceptance of the fact that whatever policy the U. S. followed meant risk . In Emporia , Kans. , Editor William Allen White did what few observers of Midwest sentiment believed possible a fortnight ago : organized a Committee to Defend America by Aiding the Allies . Editor White 's program : all possible legal aid short of armed force . <P> Relief . Strong were reactions to aid for the victims of war . Besides polishing their rifles and plumping for aid to the Allies , U. S. citizens also : <P> &gt; Doubled their relief for Hitler 's victims , as fear of Hitler came home to them . <P> &gt; Began raising $3,000,000 for Netherlands refugees .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
