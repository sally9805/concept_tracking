txt Freedom From Ignorance Sought Recently the press reported the organization of a new society called Education for Freedom . According to the brief write-ups this organization is going to engage in a radio campaign to inform the people that without true literacy no youth and no people can attain genuine freedom . Those of us who are in the profes- sion of teaching will look forward most anxiously to this project . Let us hope that it becomes the cause of a nationwide debate on all the vital aspects of education . Of all the freedoms that have been discussed and propagandized in recent years none has received as little attention as the freedom from ignorance . Perhaps it is not far from the truth that were the people richly possessed of this freedom all the other freedoms would follow necessarily . MARTIN WOLFSON . Brooklyn , Oct. 8 , 1943.
