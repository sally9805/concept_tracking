Every civilian in the Pentagon knew by heart how much leave he was entitled to under Civil Service regulations . But every civilian also had had it made clear to him that in wartime he could not expect to get in days off what he was entitled to . In Miss Percy 's office every leave had to be begged personally from Colonel Freeman . This was something of an emotional ordeal and kept leaves at a minimum . But Miss Percy 's last had been before Christmas , and two months of ill-will and defensiveness had left her ex hausted . She wanted to sleep late , have her hair done , and do an immense amount of accumulated shopping . She had set her heart on being given two days . Then , with Sunday , she would have three days in which to walk abroad a free woman . She felt she needed the time to repair the damaged battlements of her soul . She sat quietly at her desk until after eleven , watching Colonel Freeman 's office door like a cat . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trousers , suck his long lower lip , and go in , with his shambling , old man 's gait . A few minutes later he came out again , rubbing his hands aimlessly together , obviously relieved . Miss Percy threw an article into her our basket and rose . Bravely she went in . " Are you busy ? " she whispered , and immediately cleared her throat . Colonel Freeman sat hunching his slight figure over his neat desk . " It 's all right , " he said , " come in . " " I was wondering if I could take some leave next Friday and Saturday . " Colonel Freeman threw himself back in his chair and looked at her . " My God . Here 's another one ! " he said . Miss Percy 's heart flew to her throat . This was not at all what she had expected . She grinned at him helplessly . " How long has it been since you had a day off ? " he asked . " Well I had a day early last Decem-ber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and rose himself . This gave him an immediate advantage over her , for when they both stood she was taller than he was . He had a small , nicely shaped head , with lank blond hair that fell over his forehead . His eyes weregray and his face was thin . His uniform hung like Brooks Brothers ' best . Every time Miss Percy saw him she was grateful for this . He moved to the front of his desk now , taking small steps . " Do you realize how much time this office loses on leaves ? Well , I wish to hell some of you would . You 're the third one this morning . Somebody comes whining in here every damn day for leave , and they think they can get it every time . Well , it 's time they learned it is n't true . " Miss Percy rubbed her hands together , and was incapable of raising her voice . " This is rather important to me . I have to go see a friend of who 's about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out very easily . " That 's what they all say , " he said roughly . He sat on the corner of his desk nearest her and swung a polished shoe . " Every damn one of you thinks she has some special reason . Do you know how long it 's been since I 've had a vacation ? A year and a half . And Major Carpenter has n't taken one since December 7 , 1941 . We 're in the Army . " Miss Percy reflected that it sounded like a fate worse than death , but she said nothing . " Let me tell you what it 's like in here . Two people have already come in today asking for leave  --  you make the third . I have to sit at this desk and read about men who lose their lives flying airplanes  --  dozens every day  --  lives that this office might have saved . That 's our job , and I 'm supposed to see that it 's done . When you and Mrs. Robinson and Miss Pratt come prancing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day , what am I to tell you ? I put it to you : what am I to say ? " Miss Percy remained silent with bowed head . His words stirred only wells of resentment . " Well , by God , I 'm going to see that it 's done . Sure it seems dull in here sometimes . I know that . Every man in this office , including myself , has moved heaven and earth to get an overseas assignment . We do n't because somebody has got to stay behind , so we keep plugging away at it and try to forget where we really want to be . And " ? his voice dropped ? " you can thank God boredom is all you 're suffering . " Supposing I do n't give you your damned leave . You 'll raise a stink because I gave Mrs. Robinson hers and Miss Pratt hers . All right , you 'll just have to go ahead and raise a stink . Understand this is n't just you . It 's everybody from now on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a matter of life and death . You civilians can do the same . " Miss Percy at last raised her eyes to his face . " I 've never taken all the leave I 'm entitled to , " she said , and instantly knew it was the wrong thing to say . His mouth curled in sarcasm . " Ahh  --  entitled ! This is war , my girl . " Miss Percy rose , overwhelmed with disappointment , while matters of life and death presented themselves mistily in her mind . " Yes , sir , " she said . " Well , thank you , " and she went out . um returned to her desk in a tide of emo- tion . Still quivering , she launched into a violent interior dialogue that took up where the real one left off . " Justice , Colonel Freeman ! Simple justice is all I ask . You seem to have forgotten entirely that you men are required by the Army to take a half-day every week for so-called exercise . You also seem to overlook the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with you , you have wives who cook and sew and scrub and shop for you . But we ! We sit here , slaves . We do n't have anyone who takes care of us at home . We live on the brink of exhaustion six days a week , and on the seventh day our bones ache , our thoughts are small and narrow , we have a week 's chores to do , and we are unrefreshcd . We are still subject to dreams . We 're sapped , " she hissed , almost aloud . " What 's the matter with you ? " came Major Carpenter 's voice pleasantly . You look as though the baked beans in the cafeteria did n't sit so good . " " I have n't eaten yet , " she said crossly . " I just asked the Colonel for a day of leave and he would n't give it to me . " Major Carpenter sucked his lower lip and his eyes grew serious . With a small sigh he dropped his hands like pale birdson her desk and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble , " he said at last . " All you girls ever think about around here is leave , leave , leave . Sure , I know how you feel . You think you need a day off  --  we all do . " Miss Percy wished he would go away . " But the thing you got ta realize is that this is a kind of battlefield in here , see ? " He paused and met Miss Percy 's hostile stare . But he went on , not unkindly . " Whenever my wife begins pestering and worrying me about taking a vacation , I just think of my son  --  he 's in the Philippines now  --  and I wish to hell I could be out there doing his job for him . An old man like me  --  it do n't much matter . I 've had my day and it was a good one . But I tell myself at least I wo n't lay down on the job here . See what I mean ? " Miss Percy saw what he wanted her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . " Are n't we civilians ever to get a day off ? Not orwe during the year , even to get our hair cut ? " Major Carpenter 's blue eyes smiled . " Ah  --  it wo n't kill you . Now take the last war . . . . " and his face looked happy . He had almost become a famous ace . Miss Percy did not take the last war . Over her head the Major 's voice recounted the story of the leave he had waited from 1916 to 1918 to get . But he still did not go . The Major was a sociable man . Conversation with him ran on . " Yes sir , this war is a serious business . Colonel Freeman knows what he 's doing . Putting a little discipline into the office . Remember last summer , when we all thought the doggone thing was about over ? Ah , those were the days . Well , we sure learned better since then . No sir , this ai n't the time for slacking . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude her quarrel with disappointment . It continued through lunch in the cheerless cafeteria , and it was still continuing when she came back . She sat down , launching into a long , new interior dialogue with Colonel Freeman , when she saw him come out of his office and wave to Major Carpenter . The old man came toward him , a big grin on his face . They met at the coat rack and put on their coats together . TN a savage , vindictive flash Miss Percy understood where they were going . They were on their way to Bolling Field , where they would fly . Colonel Freeman was only thirty-five , and the Air Forces decreed that he was not to lose his standing as a pilot . Sometimes he took Major Carpenter along for the ride , because he knew that to the older man flying was the source of all love and life . They were going out into the afternoon free men , leaving Miss Percy , young Miss Percy , imaginative Miss Percy , condemned to her desk in the chambers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gre'at ache of sadness . " In the name of humanity and in the interests of self-development . . . " she pleaded to her gods . The answer came like a candle lit in her brain . She would resign . Her hands trembled with pleasure and vindication at the idea . She would explain to Colonel Freeman  --  she saw the scene and heard her own brave , piteous voice  --  that she was not strong . She felt unable to keep up the long hours and the long weeks without rest throughout the year . Perhaps then he would see what a terrible sentence he had passed on her , but it would be too late . Countering her resolve , small voices reminded her of past reasons for not resigning . There was her mother . Her relations with her mother were poor enough so that the prospect of admitting a shameful defeat to her stirred depths of angry pride . And unless she got a release she would have to live with her for sixty days . Then there was the almost overwhelming problem of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not solve these problems , she was able to dismiss them . The next morning she had not changed her mind . She had grown accustomed to her decision . She was even able to view the office as she wanted to view it  --  with amusement and tolerant scorn . By the time she reached the bus corner she felt in command of herself for the first time in months . A bus drew up and she was the first one in it . With a rumble and a pungent smell of exhaust it jolted off . It was a steaming , crowded world of green leather and nickel plate which the passengers shared , in sleepy , silent brotherhood . Miss Percy turned her attention to the window . There were the lemon sky , the match-stick trees by the Munitions Building , the black wasteland of the park . She remembered some lines of poetry and changed only one word . Let us go then , you and I , When the morning is spread out against the sky Like a patient etherized upon a cable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moment they seemed only fresh and clean . She was weaving familiar dreams of romance when the sound of her own name recalled her . " Miss Percy . Saaay  --  Miss Percy . " She looked up and found Mary , one of the secretaries from the office , standing in the aisle beside her . Mary was a quiet girl , but no less offensive to Miss Percy for that . She had excessively pale blue eyes which bulged slightly . " Hello , " said Miss Percy calmly . Mary became very solemn instantly . " Have you heard about it ? I mean have you heard the news ? " Miss Percy had time to reflect that Mary was certainly repulsive and her confidences unwanted before she answered , " No , what ? " " Colonel Freeman and Major Carpenter were both killed yesterday afternoon in an airplane crash . " Miss Percy felt her cheeks grow stiff and the bottom of her stomach fall . " What ? " she said . " Yeah , is n't it terrible ? " said Mary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't believe it , " Miss Percy exclaimed . Mary leaned closer with authority . " It crashed somewheres in Virginia yesterday afternoon , about five o'clock . Captain Saunders told me about it . I just happened to meet him last night ? / mean , I was gain ' to a movie , and we just passed each other , you know what I mean ? He said it was a pretty had crash and they were probably killed instantly . He said probably the carburetor froze or something like that , you know what I mean ? Anyways , he heard about it first and had to telephone General Kirk to telephone Mrs. Freeman and Mrs. Carpenter . He was out at Bolling to meet them , so he heard about it first . Is n't it terrible ? " Miss Percy was deeply shaken . " It 's too frightful , " she said , to help herself believe it , and to her surprise gave a nervous titter . Visions raced before her mind . With tight terror she saw the officers sitting at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the engines . They were relaxed . They had their confident plans for the future . Then suddenly the engine missed , they grew panicky , the plane went into a spin . . Frightful , frightful . It was terrible to think of their bodies smashed , together with all their vanities and frustrations . HEN Miss Percy realized that these deaths had stolen the glory of her resignation . For a second she put the thought aside as unworthy , but she re-turned to it almost immediately . She saw the office under their impact . For a week at least everyone would be very grave , titillated by the excitement , and full of protestations to prosecute the war harder than ever to the finish . She would never get a release under those conditions . Her joy in the day was gone , and she had only another bitter problem to face . She took a last suffering look at the sun . It blinded her eyes and splashed over the earth , and then the bus pulled into the Pentagon . Miss Percy fastened her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk through marble halls to her office . Could she resign or could n't she , could she or could n't she ? It seemed hours since she had got up . Her eyes and the top of her head already were prickling with weariness . This new problem was more than she could bear . She was so tired of the everlasting war and its complications that she wanted to cry . Old pressures began to work on her again . She had no money , no new job , and no courage . It was a revelation to Miss Percy , and one that shook her more profoundly than sudden death , that she , she herself , who wanted only beauty and some small leisure in her life , had to live in a world as brutal as everyone else 's . She entered her office . Some papers to be translated were already on her desk , she saw with irritation . She did not want to walk toward them , but there was nowhere else to go , really , where the same problems , created @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , making herself face the fact that her future lay in ruins before her . The editor of Horizon ( London review of liter- ) ature and the arts ) produces some scattered ) reflections which will be incorporated in his forthcoming book , The Condemned Playground . ) ENGLAND AND THE ARTS CYRIL CONNOLLY - 7T- T is sad on a spring evening to walk through the bombed streets of Chelsea . There are vast districts of London  --  Bayswater , for example , or Kensington  --  which seem to have been created for destruction , where squares and terraces for half a century have invited dilapidation , where fear and hypocrisy have accumulated through interminable Sunday afternoons until one feels ( so evil is the atmosphere of unreality and suspense ) that had it not been for the bombers , the houses would have been ignited one day of their own accord by spontaneous combustion . Behind the stucco porches and the lace curtains the half-life of decaying Victorian families guttered like marsh-gas . One has no pity for the fate of such houses , and no pity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a standing appeal to heaven to rain vengeance down on them . But Chelsea in the milky green evening light , where the church where Henry James lies buried is a pile of red rubble , where tall eighteenth-century houses with their insides blown out gape like ruined triumphal arches , is a more tragic spectacle . For here the life that has vanished with the buildings that once housed it was of some consequence : here there existed a fine appreciation of hooks and pictures , and many quiet work-rooms for the people who made them . Here was one of the last strongholds of ? the cultivated haute hourgeoisie in which leisure , however ill-earned , has seldom been more agreeably and intelligently made use of . Now , when the sun shines on these sandy ruins and on the brown and blue men working there , one expects to see goats , and a goatherd in a burnous ? " sirenes in deluhris volupt atis " ? pattering among them . Meanwhile the bombs , which have emptied so many drawing-rooms , have also been blasting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changing . War shrinks everything . It means less time , less tolerance , less imagination , less curiosity , less play . We can not read the leisurely wasteful masterpieces of the past without being irritated by the amount they take for granted . I have lately been reading both Joyce and Proust with considerable disappointment ; they both seem to me very sick men , giant invalids who , in spite of enormous talent , were crippled by the same disease , elephantiasis of the ego . They both attempted titanic tasks , and both failed for lack of that dull but healthy quality without which no masterpiece can be contrived , a sense of proportion . Proust , like Pope , hoaxed his contemporaries ; he put himself over on them as a reasonable , intelligent , kind , and sensitive human being , when his personality was in fact diseased and malignant , his nature pathologically cruel and vacillating , his values snobbish and artificial , his mind ( like a growth which reproduces itself at the expense of the rest of the body ) a riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decision and the fear of leaving anything out are lurking behind his love of truth . For Joyce there seems almost less to be said ; Proust 's endless and repetitive soliloquies are at least the thoughts of an intelligent man , while those of Joyce reflect the vacuous mediocrity of his characters ; both relive the past to the point of exhaustion . Both are men of genius whose work is distorted by illness , by the struggle of one to see and of the other to breathe ; both seem to us to have lacked all sense of social or political responsibility . Yet we must remember that the life which many of us are now leading is unfriendly to the appreciation of literature ; we are living history , which means that we are living from hand to mouth and reading innumerable editions of the evening paper . In these philistine conditions it is as unfair to judge art as if we were seasick . It is even more unfair to blame writers for their action or inaction in the years before the war , when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , second-rate faces , with their indomitable will to power , and their self-sealing tanks of complacency . T r would not be unfair to say that the England of Baldwin , MacDonald , and Chamberlain was a decadent country ? " Cabbage Land , " " Land of lobelias and tennis flannels , " " This England where nobody is well " ? its gods were wealth and sport ; from any unpleasant decision it flinched in disgust ; though assailed by critics from the right and left , it still wallowed supinely in a scented bath of stocks and shares , race-cards and roses , while the persecuted , who believed in the great English traditions of the nineteenth century , knocked in vain at the door . Since Dunkirk we have seen the end of the political and militarydecadence of England . Whatever residue of complacency , sloth , and inefficiency there may be left , England is now a great power , and able to stand for something in the world again . When the war is over we shall live in an Anglo-American world . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the West reposes will be the ideas for which England and America have fought and won , and the machines behind them . We had all this in 1918 and made a failure of it . The ideas expired in the impotence of Geneva . The machines spouted Ford cars , Lucky Strike , Mary Pickford , and . Coca-Cola . The new masters of the world created Le Touquet and Juan les Pins , fought each other for oil and reparations , blamed each other for the slump , and wandered blandly and ignorantly over Europe with a dark blue suit , letter of credit , set of clean teeth , and stiff white collar . Fascism arose as a religion of disappointment , a spreading nausea at the hypocrisy of the owners of the twentieth century . It is important to see that fascism is a disease , as catching as influenza ; we all when tired and disillusioned have fascist moments , when belief in human nature vanishes , when we burn with anger and envy like the underdog and the sucker , when we hate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Goebbels , that all fine sentiment is ballyhoo , that we are the dupes of our leaders , and that the masses are evil , to be resisted with the cruelty born of fear . This is the theological sin of despair , a Haw-Flaw moment which quickly passes , but which fascism has made permanent , and built up into a philosophy . In every human being there is a Lear and a fool , a hero and a clown who comes on the stage and burlesques his master . He should never be censored , but neither should he be allowed to rule . In the long run all that fascism guarantees is a Way of Death ; it criticizes the easy life by offering a noisy way of killing and dying . The key philosophies which the world will need after the war are , therefore , those which believe in life , which assert the goodness and sanity of man , and yet which will never again allow those virtues to run to seed and engender their opposites . The greatest discovery we can make from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible , is what human beings are really like ; what is good for them , what standard of living , what blend of freedom and responsibility , what mixture of courage and intelligence , heart and head makes for progress and happi-
