txt WASHINGTON , Aug. 18 ? Three witnesses said to have known both Alger Hiss , former State Department official , and Whittaker Chambers when , Mr. Chambers charges , Mr. Hiss was a leader in a Communist " underground " in Washington were subpoenaed today by the House Committee on Un-American Activities Later this week the committezi plans to question these witnesses . former Government - mployes , in an effort to bring closer together the still highly conflicting stories ot Mr. Hiss and Mr. Chambers regarding the alleged secret movement started in the early days of the New Deal to get Communists into key posts in the Federal Government . The first break in the deadlock of sworn testimony given previously by Mr. Hiss , now president of the Carnegie Foundation for International Peace , and Mr. Chambers , now a senior editor of Time magazine , came last night . Mr. Hies , after a dramatic bringing of the two together in a hotel room in New York , identified Mr. Chambers as a one-time friend he had known as " George Crosley . " Until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had known Mr. Chambers by that name or as " Carl , " the only name under which Mr. Chambers said Mr. Hiss knew him . House committee sources said today that evidence at this point indicated that Mr. Hiss and Mr. Chambers knew each other so well that when Mr. Chambers subleased the Hiss Twenty - ninth Street apartment here in 1934 Mr. Hiss " gave " him an old Ford car . While a house on P Street was being // readied for the Hiss family the Hiss and Chambers families lived together in the leased apartment for several days , these sources added . Major Gaps in Stories The committee has set out to close the gaps , by corroborative evidence on both sides , of testimony which still conflicts on such points as the ' following : Mr. Hiss , while identifying Mr. Chambers as " George Crosley , " continues to swear that he is not now and never has been a Communist , by party card or by following the party 's ideology . Mr. Chambers contends that Mr. Hiss knew him as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mr. Chambers says he quit the Communist party in 1937 and later implored Mr. Hiss to " break away " Mr. Hiss insists that there never was such an episode . Mr. Hiss , in the " confrontation " session in New York yesterday , required considerable time in making up his mind that the man before him was the " George Cros/ey " he had known in 1934 and 1935 . Before he made this identification , Mr. Hiss , according to Robert E. Stripling , chief investigator for the House committee , demanded to know what , if any , dental treatment Mr. Chambers might have had . He recalled " Crosley , " Mr. Stripling reported , as a man with " bad front teeth . " According to Mr. Stripling also , Mr. Hiss declared at first that he did not recognize the voice of Mr. Chambers . Mr. Chambers was asked to read from a news magazine . Doubts Car Record Is Available While Mr. Chambers continued to swear that Mr. Hiss knew him only as a paid hand of the Communist party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chambers was a free-lance writer seeking information for magazine articles about the Senate ( Nye ) committee then inquiring into the munitions industry . Mr. Hiss was then a legal assistant to the committee . Mr. Hiss was reported to have testified that he transferred the title of the old Ford car to Mr. Chambers . A spokesman for the District of Columbia Department of Vehicles and Traffic said today that it would be impossible , in such transactions so long ago , to supply evidence unless the engine number or the number of the title transfer were known . There appeared to be no available copy of a lease under which the Twenty-ninth Street Hiss apartment was rented to Mr. Chambers . Mr. Hiss stated last night , after he had made the identification of Mr. Chambers as " George Crosley , " that the rent was never paid . He added that " Crosley " had complained of hard luck and financial embarrassment 1when the matter was brought up . Clash on First Meeting ? There still ... remained a discrepancy in testimony concerning the original meeting of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reports of closed session ' - stimony , testified that this meeting was in the office he occupied as legal assistant to the Senate Investigating Committee and occurred when Mr. Chambers asked for information for magazine articles . Mr. Chambers is represented to maintain that his introduction to Mr. Hiss was formal , and not in the investigating committee 's office . The person making the introduction , it was said , had not yet been identified . It was still not certain that the three witnesses subpoenaed by the committee would be able to help straighten out the contradictions in the stories of the two men . In some quarters it was hinted that they might be even " uncooperative . " . In New York today , Representative Richard M. Nixon , Republican , of California , a committee memher , questioned " a number " of per , sons said to have known Mr. Chambers " before and after dental treatment . " The questioning covered difficulty or ease in identifying him now . Effort was made also , Mr. Nixon said , to determine Mr. Chambers ' standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in which he confessed to being a courier for the party . Some of the witnesses , Mr. Nixon stated , might have been Communists . These witnesses and others , he added , appeared to know Mr. Chambers as a former Communist . Late tonight the committee had not received from Mr. Hiss his reply to suggestions that he submit to a " lie detector " test . He was reported to have held Monday , as an initial reaction when the proposal was made at a closed session hearing , ' that such an instrument might turn out to be a recorder of physical and mental reactions rather than a measurer of veracity . He was reported then to have promised to give his answer today and to have stated last night that he would mail the answer in New York . Mr. Chambers has been reported to have said he was willing to take the lie test . The committee has set Wednesday , Aug. 25 , as a formal " day of of confrontation , " with Mr. Hiss and Mr. Chambers facing each other publicly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
