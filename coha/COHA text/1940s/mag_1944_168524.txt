Before the 100th anniversary meeting of Toronto 's Board of Trade , lanky Lord Halifax touched off a political explosion that rocked all Canada . <P> Britain 's Ambassador to Washington proposed a revolutionary change in the British Commonwealth of Nations : that the Dominions assume equal responsibility with Great Britain in the making of a common foreign policy . <P> Said he : " Not Great Britain only , but the British Commonwealth and Empire , must be the fourth power in that group upon which . . . the peace of the world will henceforth depend . " <P> As South Africa 's Jan Christiaan Smuts had been before him ( TIME , Dec. 13 ) , Halifax was concerned lest Britain be dwarfed by Russia and the U.S. in the postwar world . <P> Words Without Warning . Halifax 's audience liked it . Ontario 's Premier George Drew , an imperialist of the old school , led Toronto businessmen to their feet , applauding . Said he : " A great speech that may well change the thinking of our people . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There Lord Halifax 's words broke without warning on the East Block , where Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King and his experts on External Affairs frame Canadian policies . <P> They had seen the speech before Lord Halifax delivered it only because a friendly newspaperman brought it over for comment . And on that first copy they could not fail to note that Lord Halifax 's single mention of Canada 's first minister was a blunt " Mr. Mackenzie King . " <P> To the East Block the speech looked like a kite deliberately flown to test the political winds in Canada before the meeting of the Commonwealth 's Prime Ministers in London scheduled soon , when Empire policies will finally be threshed out . The provocation for direct reply was great : some of the Prime Minister 's supporters talked angrily of an " imperialist ramp " ( i.e. , " Swindle " ) . <P> The First Answer . The French Canadian press , in bitter nationalist editorials , al most unanimously rejected the Halifax plan as a step back to colonialism . <P> Socialist C.C.F. Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The genius of the British Commonwealth is its recognition of basic unity in diversity . Lord Halifax proposes that we abandon this historic principle . Such rigidity would destroy the Commonwealth . . . . " <P> Returning members of Parliament buzzed with speculation : Had Lord Halifax inadvertently given Mr. King the issue he needs to reunite suspicious , isolationist Quebec behind his Liberal Party ? <P> For a United Front . On Monday , when Parliament got down to business , moderate Opposition Leader Gordon Craydon of the Progressive-Conservative Party tried to water the briskly blazing political fires . His equivocal view : " Common sense indicates that every effort must be made to secure a united front in a united Canada in a greater and more powerful British Commonwealth . . . . " <P> Polite but Firm . Well-meaning Mr. Craydon 's pussyfooting words were wasted . When the Prime Minister rose to give the definitive answer for his Government , he was neither hesitant nor embarrassed about roundly rebuking Lord Halifax for an ill-advised speech .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
