Hundreds of dapper , middle-aged men buzzed around a spooky , blacked-out picture gallery in Cincinnati 's Netherland Plaza Hotel . They were X-ray specialists , members of the American Roentgen Ray Society , who met last week to exhibit their art , discuss their progress . <P> Cyclotron for Cancer . Winner of the Society 's gold medal was Dr. John Hundale Lawrence of Berkeley , Calif. , brother of Nobelman Ernest Orlando Lawrence , who splits atoms with a giant cyclotron . Brother John said last week that cyclotron bombardment can give any element the emanating qualities of radium . These radioactive elements , when swallowed in liquid form , have two great uses for medicine : 1 ) in minuscule amounts , they settle in specific organs for a brief time , then can be traced in their journey through the body , providing a clue to the process of growth and repair ; 2 ) in larger doses they settle in the organs for a longer time . There , like radium or Xray , they destroy cancers . <P> Of the body 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far only three are now in actual clinical use for cancer treatment . The three : <P> &gt; Phosphorous , which settles in the bone marrow and spleen , is used for the cancer-like blood disease , leukemia . <P> &gt; Iodine , which lodges in the thyroid , eats away cancer tissue without disturbing the tiny parathyroid glands which lie underneath . In fact , said Dr. Lawrence , the entire gland can be removed " blood-lessly . " <P> &gt; Strontium of the calcium group sinks to the bones , has been used to treat cancers which migrate from breast to bone . <P> T. B. Snapshots . Only a classical full-sized ( 14 by 17 inches ) X-ray on celluloid can give a perfect picture of the lungs . But these plates take too long for mass examination , cost anywhere from $2 to $25 . Last week Dr. Arthur Carlisle Christie of Washington , D.C. discussed two new methods of X-ray that are quick and cheap : miniature films and paper rolls . <P> The films ( four inches by five ) are used to take photographs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A fluoroscope shows up internal organs but does not take permanent pictures . ) With a special camera , a technician can take one picture a minute , for about 25 . Although difficult to interpret , the films are only a trifle less accurate than large plates . They have been used on thousands of people in several large cities , notably Detroit and Chicago . <P> Pictures on paper film are standard size , taken on a long roll , instead of separate celluloid plates . Over 125 X-rays can be made in an hour for a little less than a dollar apiece . In Manhattan , paper films have been used to X-ray 50,000 draftees and National Guardsmen.
