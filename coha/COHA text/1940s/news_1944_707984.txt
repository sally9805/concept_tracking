txt ST . LOUIS , Aug. 2 ? Accumulating returns from yesterday 's primary election in Missouri showed Senator Bennett Champ Clark was defeated in his third-term bid for a seat in the United States Senate . The nomination was won by Roy , State Attorney General , who will face Forrest C. Donnell , retiring Governor , in the general election . Governor Donnell received a large plurality in a sevenman race for the Republican nomination , leading his nearest opponent , Howard V. Stephens , a St. Louis shoe manufacturer , by approximately 75,000 . The result in the Democratic Senatorial contest was as near a verdict on the issue of supporting President Roosevelt as has been rendered in any party primaries this year . Despite his eleventh-hour attempts to smooth over his anti-Roosevelt record by pledging allegiance to the President in his war and peace efforts , Mr. Clark was known in this State as a consistent critic of the policies , both domestic and foreign , of the Roosevelt Administration , and according to local observers was judged basically on that ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was trailing by 19,106 votes , Senator Clark conceded his defeat , blaming it on the " Communist-controlled CIO . " " I cheerfully accept the verdict of the polls , " he asserted in a statement . " No man snould ever offer himself for political office unless he is // prepared to stand on his record and accept defeat if it should come to him . I am not the first Missourian who was defeated for reelection . Thomas E. Benton , Francis P. Blair and Champ Clark ? to mention a few  --  had the same experience . " I have confidence that the long range view of the people of Missouri , when the hysteria of war has passed , will not be unfavorable to my record in the Senate . I am perfectly willing to take a chance on . the long pull so far as my reputation is concerned . " The election represents a notable temporary triumph for the Communist-controlled CIO in its efforts to take control of the Democratic party . That fight , however , is not conclusive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I carried the bona fide Democratic counties of rural Missouri with whom I have been associated so long . The people of rural Missouri were alert , like the minute men of Revolutionary fame , to the menace of the CIO . It behooves the people of St. Louis and St. Louis County to be similarly minded . " I am grateful to the people of Missouri for the opportunity of serving them in the Senate of the United States in times of great stress for twelve long years . " Mr. attacked Senator Clark throughout the campaign as an " obstructionist " and an " isolationist " and called upon Missouri Democrats to banish him and send to Washington a " helping hand for President Roosevelt . " Roosevelt sentiment made itself evident in two Southern States . South Carolina Democrats in convention ordered its candidates for electors ? to support the President . In Texas pro-Roosevelt delegates will hold the " edge " at the State convention Sept. 12 , but final control may rest on the outcome of delegate contests in four counties . Local issues undoubtedly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paying too little attention to his constituency between campaigns , of failing to answer mail and to do the small favors which voters have come to expect of their Senators and Representatives in Washington . He was charged with promising more than he delivered in the way of patronage . But , according to the observers ere , no one factor contributed near so much as the general underlying dissatisfaction among Missouri Democrats , notably those in the tier of counties known as " Little Dixie , " for Senator Clark 's frequent excursions away from the administration reservation , particularly in relation to defense and preparedness measures prior to Pearl Harbor . Republican leaders were elated over the result , both in their own and the Democratic Senatorial selections . Governor Donnell came out of the fray an unmistakable vote-getter , and his party adherents contended his prowess would be even more effective against Mr. than Mr. Clark . Yesterday 's primary was held to select candidates for State , county and municipal offices throughout the State . In the Republican Gubernatorial test , Jean Paul Bradshaw of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Republican national committeeman , appeared to have won . State Senator Phil M. Donnelly seemed assured of the Democratic nomination for Governor .
