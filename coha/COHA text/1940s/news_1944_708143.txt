txt An American soldier guarding a group after their capture The New York Times ( C ) . S. Siena/ Corps Ftaalotelephoto ) 3,000 Civilians Quit Aachen Amid Stony Glances of GI 's By DREW MIDDLETON Br Wireless to TEre NEW Yonc Mss . OUTSIDE AACHEN , Germany , Oct. ** a tree-lined road from a burning city straggled a mile-long column of refugees , just such a- procession as those that , hounded by German fighter planes , have trudged the roads of Europe these past five years , with one exception . This was a German column . These were the people of Aachen , 3,000 of them , caught at last in the war whose start they cheered lustily a little more than five years ago . They came in safety . No fighters dived to machine-gun them as German . fighters did the Belgians and French in 1940 . They were . firmly but politely directed by M. P. 's as they reached the top of a long hill near Brand and turned into a concentration area . Once four Thunderbolts roared over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and asked , " Amerikaner ? " I nodded . She smiled and walked on toward an interrogation tent . The world has turned upside down when a German is happy to see American planes . There were young men in the procession , but most of the Germans were women , old and young , children and old men . Everyone carried something , an old valise stuffed to the bursting point , a coffee urn , a bundle of clothes . The women pushed baby carriages piled high with household goods . The men pushed little twowheeler carts bearing the entire family 's belongings . They were not all poor people . There was a blonde in a good fur coat . There // were many men dressed well , carrying neat suitcases . They seemed eager to make friends with the Americans , eager to do what they were told . A sergeant said : " Geez ! They seem to like being ordered around . " Now mortars were bursting in the city behind them and for miles around American batteries were adding their iron clamor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they entered the concentration area and looked down at Aaceen at the end of the leafy road . Clouds of smoke were rolling over the city . Through them the wreckage of the shattered city was faintly discernible . Women Weep at Destruction The older women cried . The younger stood with children hanging to their hands and looked with stony faces . The men scuttled along under orders of M. P. 's , with never a backward glance . The refugees will stay in the concentration area tonight . Tomorrow they will be moved farther out of the fighting zone to camps where they will be kept until they can be moved back to Aachen . Military government officials herded them from shed to shed , where they were interrogated and searched . They seemed , as the sergeant said , eager to be ordered around . Most of them have been living in the cellars and air raid shelters of Aachen for the past week . They have had little water and almost no food . They are grimy and they smell . They said : " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " why has this happened ? " You think back to the people of Louvain and Arras and London and Coventry and there is no answer . " Hitler ist ein Teufel ( Hitler is a devil ) , " said an old woman . " How I hate him ; he has stolen our young people . " Most of Refugees Hungry And did you think of that , mother , when everyone sang " We Are Sailing Against England " and Hitler sneered at the American Army and told you you were the master race ? Military government officers men will feed these 3,000 refugees tonight . None of them have any food . The only order given to them after they had been assigned to the rooms in the surrounding buildings was that they must not show lights , because they would draw fire from . German batteries . A sardonic lieutenant said in English : " They will , have light enough from the fire in Aachen . " Lieut . Col. Bion C. Welker , now military government officer and formerly the editor of the Harrisburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They all want to be our friends  --  now , he said. , " I do n't think the boys are fallingl for it . They , are sorry for the old women , I think , but they do n't like any of them . Fighting in the line hardens a man . " Few of the Germans would talk about the war , but almost all of them said they were glad the Americans had come . They said it so often it sounded like the song of the penitent burglar , " This time I 'm going straight . " As they walked along the road GI 's stood impassive , watching them . The Germans turned and smiled shyly at them . No one smiled back . When a young man went by the soldiers ' eyes hardened . " I hope they 're checking on those guys , " said one . All ' Patriotic Germans " Pretty soon a sergeant said : " All right , you guys , let 's get going , " and a platoon strode down the road toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany behind the smiles , behind the eagerness to please . A woman who spoke French told me , " No , we do not like the Nazis . " But in the next breath she added something it is well to remember : " But we are all patriotic Germans . " She wanted to know if there were any English soldiers near by . It was evident she hated the English . I asked her why . At first she said it was because they had shot German wounded . I told her that was absurd , that it was the Gestapo that did that . She shrugged and said , " Anyway if the English had only given in in 1940 we would have peace now . " The afternoon wore on . Still more Germans came from the burning city . Now there were hundreds milling around in the once empty concentration area . There was a shattering explosion in the city and a woman began to cry as the women had cried in Warsaw , Rotterdam and London .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
