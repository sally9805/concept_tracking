txt Ancient Persians Wore Pants To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES ! In your editorial " Pants and the Woman " you state : " The male trouser in its present form dates only to the French Revolution . " The qualification " in its present form " is not clear , but as to the origin of the trouser it may be of interest to say that during an examination of ancient sculpture by archaeological students at a European university a few years ago a photographic slide was shown exhibiting an early sculpture of Persians wearing long trousers , and I understood a celebrated archaeologist , who was inter- preting these slides , to state that that was the earliest representation of men wearing trousers , and that it is from the Persians ' costume that the trouser . derives . The Encyclopaedia Britannica states trousers were worn by the poorer classes of seventeenth-century Venice . KATHERINE LA SALLE BACON . Milibrook , N. Y. , July 6 , 1941.                @ @ @ @ @
