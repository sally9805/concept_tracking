Italy 's Socialist chieftain Pietro Nenni junketed to Paris and London , consulted with Socialists Lon Blum and Harold J. Laski . In London last week , Nenni told the press what they had talked about . All the world 's " true Socialists " would shortly be invited into a new International to provide a common political strategy . Its grand premiere was set for 1947 . <P> But gestation of a Fifth International had scarcely begun when the old quarrels-and some new ones-broke out among the confused legions of the Left . <P> Nenni 's " true Socialists " did not include the Communists , but he hopefully promised limited tactical cooperation with them . Labor 's Laski hastily agreed in a press statement . But Labor Party Secretary Morgan Phillips rejected the Communists ' twelfth plea for affiliation . Said he : " The gulf between us has not been narrowed . . . . " <P> In Paris , right-wing Socialist bigwigs sputtered that Nenni , " like Harold Laski , " talked too much . Socialists would not form a Fifth International , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Second International . They charged Nenni with trying to deliver Socialism to the Communist ogre . When reminded that in London Nenni had spoken out against a merger with the Communists , they snapped : " That was on an odd day of the month . On even days he 's for it . " Declared a like-minded right-wing socialist in New York : " This mountain will give birth to a little left-wing mouse . " <P> But Nenni 's embryonic International could expect a blast from the other side too . The Communists seemed ready to hurl their inevitable charge of a capitalist plot to form an anti-Soviet western bloc . When a reporter for Moscow 's Tass News Agency asked Lon Blum whether he really wanted to resurrect the Second International , Blum replied he did not understand the question . The Tassman rushed from the room , in a huff , slamming the door .
