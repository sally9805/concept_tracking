txt Both the United States and Great Britain have cast their eyes on the oil resources of the Middle East ? we to forestall the imminent exhaustion of our own fields , the British to make sure of their own supply . Our plans are centered on Saudi Arabia , which is probably the largest single undeveloped oil field in the world and one that we already control through leases made to the California Arabian Oil Company . This also holds good for the contiguous Bahrein Islands in the Persian Gulf . Plans have already been formulated by the Petroleum Reserves Corporation for the construction of a pipeline which will cross Saudi Arabia from the Persian Gulf to Alexandria and which will cost us not much less than $165 , - 000,000 . At Kuwait , on the Persian Gulf , oil is now tapped in equal shares by Gulf Oil and the British Anglo-Iranian Oil Company . Farther north lies Iraq , where great fields are controlled by British , French , American and Dutch companies . Still farther north are the fields of Iran , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arabian field is , the British dominate Near Eastern oil resources . Their control in that region amounts to about 80 per cent ; ours to not more than 15 . Whether or not these percentages have any political . significance , it is evident that the Near East is no longer a remote region inhabited largely by backward Arabian nomads whose destiny is no concern of ours . Through a quirk of technology and economics the problems of the Near East become our problems , just as Mexican and Venezuelan oil problems became ours . The good-neighbor policy must clearly be extended to a remote region . That policy will be put to the test when this country decides how and for whose benefit the Saudi Arabian oil fields are to be exploited . Up to the present we have left the American oil companies in Saudi Arabia more or less alone . Their concessions were granted , we are assured by their executives , precisely because no diplomatic pressure was exerted . That the Government will be compelled at least to observe the activities of American concessionaires and square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , follows from the British affiliations of King Ibn Saud , now the most important absolute Moslem monarch in the world . As for the Sheik of Bahrein Islands , which are included in our plans , that . ruler 's relations to Great Britain are much like those of an East Indian rajah . Fair as the leases may be under which Americans now operate in Saudi Arabia and the Bahrein Islands , it is clear that by entering the Near East for oil we also enter Near Eastern politics . This country therefore needs a foreign oil policy . We shall have to decide whether the State Department is to remain an agent of American concessionaires in Saudi Arabia in achieving their ends when necessary or whether the Government will have to participate with American companies in exploiting foreign oil resources without making the political mistakes that strained British and French relations in the Near East . These political considerations are ignored in the report of the Truman committee . A foreign policy conceived in the spirit of the At , lantic Charter can not afford to ignore I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
