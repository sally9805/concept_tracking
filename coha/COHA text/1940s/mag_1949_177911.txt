In downtown Chicago , the posters had been up for days- " State Street is ready for school . " The shops had been ready with new wardrobes , the stationery stores with book bags and fountain pens . Last week , schoolchildren in Chicago and elsewhere were reluctantly ready , too . Their jeep-hats bobbed in school corridors , their scat-talk filled the classrooms , some of their jackets bore the inscription " Bebop is spoken here . " In bebop or any other language , vacation was definitely over . Across the country , some 30,000,000 public , private and parochial schoolkids , the biggest crowd in history , were back in class or getting ready . <P> Opening day was a nerve-racker for some . High-school students in Hazleton , Pa. went on strike when they learned that the school board had voted to abolish football . " No sports-no school , " cried their picket signs . " Township unfair to students . " Worcester , Mass , was trying to find a teacher of Lithuanian to satisfy the parents who wanted the language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time since the war , the city had enough teachers . San Francisco and Denver reported the same . <P> In almost every city and town in the U.S. , the big problem was finding room for the war babies . New York City expected its biggest enrollment in seven years ; it had eight new school units to accommodate it , was building 20 more . Los Angeles had built 835 new classrooms for elementary pupils alone , then found that that was not nearly enough . Detroit had raised $55 million for new grade schools , but it knew that its troubles were just beginning . " This part is easy , " said one school-board member . " Just wait till this crop hits the high schools in 1956 ! "
