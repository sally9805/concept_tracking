Adolf Hitler appointed a successor to Rudolf Hess as second in the Nazi line of succession , following porcine Hermann Goring . The world had heard little of the appointee , Martin Bormann , but he was soundly qualified for the job . <P> Short , crop-haired , 42-year-old Martin Bormann was a schoolboy bully in Halberstadt near the Harz Mountains . After World War I he studied agriculture in Mecklenburg , where he joined a murderous anti-Republican gang whose pastime was beating workmen as they left their beer halls . This connection led him into the German Workers Party , predecessor of the Nazis . <P> In 1923 Bormann was arrested for taking part in Hitler 's attempted Munich Putsch , got a year in jail . Later he proved himself a nimble manipulator of Party funds , was treasurer of Hitler 's 1932 Hilf-skasse racket , whereby money supposedly collected for injured Storm Troopers was turned over to Nazi leaders . Bormann enjoyed Party finance ; in 1936 he bought a Mercedes-Benz deluxe for 38,000 marks . He rose to be Hess 's administrative right hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> During the weeks just before Hess 's flight to Britain , Bormann began to replace him ceremonially . He marched in Hess 's place directly behind Hitler during the Fhrer 's birthday celebration in April 1941 . Since Hess 's flight . Bormann has seen Hitler regularly , even on the Russian front . <P> In addition to his financial services to Nazidom , Bormann has made ideological contributions in the field of religion . Recently he told Party leaders : " Trying to produce order at the Vatican is a fault into which we Germans have unfortunately often fallen . . . . From the standpoint of the Reich it would have been most desirable if there had been , not one Pope , but at least two or , if possible , many more . They would have fought one another . The people must be wrested from the churches and their priests . Their influence must be permanently broken in the same way as the harmful influences of astrologers , soothsayers and similar swindlers . Our National Socialist world picture stands far above the teachings of Christianity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers than any Party official ever had before . He can ( theoretically ) veto any law , must countersign all official appointments . He will often exercise these powers clad in one of his two dozen pairs of riding breeches . He can not ride a horse .
