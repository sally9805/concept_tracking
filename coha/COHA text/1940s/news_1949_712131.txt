txt City to End Free Parking On Old World 's Fair Site Area to Remain Open Day and Night , With 25-Cent Charge for 12 Hours  --  System of Fees to Be Extended to Beach Lots By JOSEPH C. INGRAHAM Convinced that free . municipally operated parking lots are " unsound in principle , " the city plans to charge a fee at its 3,000-car facility on the old World 's Fair site in Queens , it was disclosed yesterday . The idea has been approved by the Board of Estimate on the recommendation of the Traffic Commission , and the shift in policy will be carried out after extensive reconditioning of the huge tract is completed by the Park Department , which will operate the enterprise . The traffic agency has recommended that the field , now run by the Police Department on . a temporary basis without fee , be kept open twenty-four hours a day , six days a week , with a charge of 25 cents for a twelve-hour period . At present the lot is open week-days from 6 A.M. to 9 P.M. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far advanced that the matter has been referred to the Director of the Budget to see where the 590,000 needed to put the area in prime condition can be obtained . It is expected that part of the funds will come from a reserve in the Flushing Meadow Park account and no serious barriers are in sight to stymie the project , it was . reported . The Police Department long has been anxious to be relieved of the burden of operating the field , a task which it undertook reluctantly on Nov. 17 , 1947 , when the area at the northern end of Flushing Meadow Park was designated for off-street parking in a " highly experimental " attempt at easing traffic congestion in mid-Manhattan . To encourage motorists to park on the fringe of the city and continue by rapid transit , the Board of Transportation set up special express service to and from the Willets Point station of the joint BMT-IRT Flushing subway line that bisects the field on the Roosevelt Avenue side . Advanced by the Mayor 's Special Traffic Committee , forerunner of the present traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely through city departments , the plan // FAIR SITE PARKING TO GO ON FEE BASIS // to use the old fair site was a desperate measure . It was initiated after the administration made it clear that it would not provide funds or direct subsidy for municipal operation of off-street parking facilities . Handles 2,000 Cars Daily After a slow start the field gained steadily in popularity and in recent months has handled an average of 2,000 cars a day . However , a recent check showed that a majority of the patrons were thrifty Nassau and Suffolk County residents who had turned to car and subway transportation to bypass the Long Island Rail Road , now collecting fares considerably higher than two years ago . In a letter to the Board of Estimate outlining the reconditioning program and the proposed method of operation , Robert Moses , Park Commissioner estimated that the expense of maintaining the field would be $21,560 a year . Allowing for a 25 per cent drop in trade , the 25-cent charge would enable the city to make an estimated annual profit , exclusive of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would go into the general city fund as do all fees now collected by the Park Department from its manifold enterprises , including some parking lots maintained in or near city beaches . All Sites to Charge Feet In addition , the Traffic Commissioand Mr. Moses , who is a member as chairman of the Triborough ' Bridge and Tunnel Authority , are pressing for elimination of all free parking sites maintained by the Park Department . They were said to have convinced Mayor O'Dwyer that the city probably would have to enter the parking business on a large scale and that the motorist should foot the bill . The Park Department now operates on a free basis three areas in Rockaway Beach with a capacity of 1,575 cars . It has plans for construction of additional space at Rockaway for 1,335 cars and 570. at Coney Island . The land is owned by the city and was acquired through tax lien foreclosure . The proposed parking fields are awaiting final Board of Estimates action now . Approval of the new fields has been held in abeyance because of the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city policy it was indicated that construction funds would be appropriated soon . While it is not likely that the new Rockaway and Coney Island lots will be ready before next summer , the existing car-park areas in Rockaway probably will go from a free to a fee basis before the resort season ends . The city 's second free parking area , in Cadman Plaza in the core of downtown Brooklyn , which accommodates 600 cars daily with separate sectors for short-and long-term parkers , will maintain its free policy only because the area is slated . to be abandoned within a year to make waytfor the Brooklyn War Memorial , it was reported . It is on land that was on the tax rolls at $2,690,000 in 1939 , and the ? tax loss of $80,000 a year plus the salaries of policemen assigned to operate the lots made for a substantial city subsidy that economy - minded administration leaders have held unjustified . The World 's Fair lot is supervised by six policemen who draw a total of $25,000 a year . Complete Overhaul Needed When the Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parking experiment , James A. Burke , Borough President of Queens , arranged to condition it . A recent check showed it now was full of- holes , needed a complete overhaul and installation of protective devices to make it suitable for a fee-operated enterprise . The reconditioning program proposed by Mr. Moses calls for strong metal fencing around the parking lot  --  only a section of the old main parking site that the Fair set up for 13,000 cars  --  and as a complete repaving of the field The Park Department plans to keep the remainder , which is the area furthest from the subway station , as a recreational spot for model airplane contests and soft-ball games . The entire tract is known informally as Willets Point Park . To handle the operation at a minimum cost , Mr. Moses proposed installation of a traffic-counter system for the collection of fees and a double barreled method of checking receipts . The counter system would be similar to that used now at the toll points of bridges operated by the Triborough Bridge Authority with a small booth for the attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ record automatically the amount of traffic . As a second safeguard it is planned to have the motorist put the 25 cents directly into a hand-coin collector like those in service on the Fifth Avenue bus line in the days of two-man operation . Two treadlebooths , costing $5,000 each , are to be installed . No changes are planned in the , approaches to the field , now accessible from Northern Boulevard and Grand Central Parkway , with the only entrance to the lot at 126th Street . The proposal to end free parking is expected to meet only minor opposition from civic groups in the North Shore , Queens , cbmmunities that were among the original sponsors . They were convinced that fringe parking not only would save motorists ' time but ease traffic impasses in the highly congested business sectors , both in Manhattan and near-by Flushing . Merchants in Jamaica , Queens , were reported delighted in the change in city policy , seeing - it as a happy augury for the realization of their own scheme to set up parking areas in the Jamaica business sector . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
