From an island in the St. Lawrence River , near Alexandria Bay , N.Y. , where Frank Orren Lowden , 80 , has his palatial summer home , came a statement of clear , unqualified opposition to the nation 's policy in a world at war . GOPatriarch Lowden , who was a great Governor of Illinois and missed the Presidency by a hair in 1920 , was a name to conjure with in days gone by . To go along with him on the statement , 14 other potent signatures of a slightly younger vintage were rounded up . Then Patriarch Lowden , who once was a brave Midwestern anti-isolationist , handed out an isolationist blast saying : <P> " The American people should insistently demand that Congress put a stop to step-by-step projection of the United States into undeclared war . . . . Exceeding its expressed purpose , the Lease-Lend bill has been followed by naval action , by military occupation of bases outside the Western Hemisphere , by promise of unauthorized aid to Russia and by other belligerent moves . . . . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with law , with sentiment or with security . ... It the war is not purely a world conflict between tyranny and freedom . The Anglo-Russian alliance has dissipated that illusion . . . . <P> " Few people honestly believe that the Axis is now , or will in the future , be in a position to threaten the independence of any part of this Hemisphere if our defenses are properly prepared . <P> " Freedom in America does not depend on the outcome of struggles for material power between other nations . " <P> Other signers : Herbert Hoover ; Felix Muskett Morley , for three years a League of Nations employe , until recently editor of the Washington Post , now president of Haverford College ; Joshua Reuben Clark , Herbert Hoover 's Ambassador to Mexico , and now , in effect , business manager of Mormon affairs with vast powers throughout the church 's Rocky Mountain territory and national holdings ; Alfred Mossman London ; Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , Hoover 's Interior Secretary , president of Stanford University ; Hoover 's Minister to Canada , Hanford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Prather Fletcher ; Robert Maynard Hutchins , precocious president of the University of Chicago ; John L. Lewis , still ambitious to be all labor 's boss ( see p. 14 ) ; ex-Vice President Charles Gates Dawes ( " Hell'n Maria " ) ; Philadelphia Industrialist Joseph Henry Scattergood , Quaker ; and an oldtime opera star , Soprano Geraldine Farrar , now 59 , in her youth a favorite of Germany 's Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm ( she was once called " The Darling of the Heir " ) .
