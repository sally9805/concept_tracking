As they read the Sddeutsche Zeitung one morning last week , Munich 's 3,400 Jews felt fresh vitriol in their old wounds . A letter to the editor , signed with the pseudonym " Adolf Bleibtreu " ( Stay True to Adolf ) , screamed at the Jews : " Go ahead and go to America , even though the people there have no use for you either . They have had enough of you bloodsuckers . Several of the Amis slang for Americans have already told me they forgive us for everything except one thing : that we did not gas all the Jews , for many are now enjoying life in America . " <P> A thousand Jews , mostly D.P.s from nearby camps , set out for the Sddeutsche 's offices . Munich police nervously phoned U.S. Military Government , were told that since the demonstration had no permit , the police could go ahead and ) break it up . Cops formed a line in the path of the crowd , but the Jews marched right through it . Two mounted police squads bore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bricks and clubs . Shots cracked ; three Jews fell , wounded by bullets . Enraged , the D.P.s overturned and burned a police truck , injured 26 policemen with bricks . Two companies of U.S. military police arrived . With a Jewish Army chaplain , they persuaded the demonstrators to disperse . <P> Next morning , the Sddeutsche apologized for its stupidity in printing the letter , explained it had done it only to prove that the danger of anti-Semitism still was rife in Germany . Unappeased by the hapless apology , Bavaria 's Jewish community proclaimed : " None of us wants to stay in this country . . . We have our own country now . "
