A FRIEND who is a member of the American Civil Liberties Union fist told me about him . " He 's a pacifist , but not a nut . Quite often pacifists ale also vegeterians or nudists or , something like that . But not the Reverend Ashton Jones . Besides , he does n't preach pacifism much these days . It 's gotten him into too much hot water with the federal government ; especially overseas , HAROLD FLENDER , novelist and TV writer , is the author of Paris Blues , a story with an interracial theme which will soon be released as a movie . 502 where the State Department took away his passport and had him-shipped home on the ground ' that his preachings were prejudicial to the best interests of the United States . Now he preaches brotherhood throughout the states . " " And the federal authorities leave him alone ? " " Yes ; but the local authorities give , him a hard time , especially in the South , where he defends brotherhood as integration . He travels in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the word love ' printed aboye the grillwork . He 's been jailed nineteen times , giv- en the sweatbox treatment , pushed down a flight of stairs , beaten with a rawhide whip , , had his face cracked open , and almost drowned . I understand the American Civil Liberties Union is backing him because they , feel the treatment he 's received ; par- ? ticillarly in Shreveport , Louisiana , violates the Constitution . ' ? My ACLU friend arranged forme to meet the Reverend Ashton Jones in an upper West Side New York apartment , where he was staying with friends - while waiting for his trial to be called in Shreveport . Mr. Jones 's face reveals his sixty-three years , although his tall , thin . The , NATION ' body is that of a ' younger athlete . His handclasp is warm and yigorous , he smiles broadly and easily , and he speaks in the thick Southern drawl of the state where he was born and bred ? Georgia . He is an , ordained Methodist minister , but for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , what he thinks more important , practicing ? the brotherhood of man under the Kingdom of God . " BUT how do you practice it , Mr. Jones ? " was one of my first questions after we were both comfortably settled on a Couch we shared with the New York Post , Linus Pauling 's book , No More War and An Anthology ? of Jewish , Authors . . " First , " he said , " I 'd prefer if we called each other by our first names . For many years I 've been associated with the Quakers , and I think their calling one another by their first names is a splendid idea . So , if I may , I 'd like to call you Harold , and you call me AshtOn . Okay ? " " " Okay . " The most important problem involving brotherhood in America today is integration . I live it by living with Negroes . I believe my wife and I have lived with more Negro farriilies than any other white couple in America . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrations . That 's hoW thy present ' difficulties started . " It ' began ' in Dallas , Texas , last Easter Sunday . I participated ' there in a sit-in with the Reverend T. D. R. V. Thompson at Kress , H. L. Green and Saenger 's Department Store . Everything went along smoothly and peacefully ? no violence , no ' incidents . ' But the story was carried in newspapers and on the air and people all over the South found out what had happened . ' " I left Dallas the next day on my way to ? Atlanta . At Marshall , ' Texas , about 135 miles east of Dallas , I spoke to the students on the campus of the all-Negro Wiley College and ; as I left the campus , . the sheriff of Marshall had me arrested , charging me with vagrancy . " I pointed out to him my fully equipped trailer truck and the fact December 21 , 1960 that I , had $89 in- my , wallet ; but it made : no difference to him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , use the telephone to call my wife , I was beaten with a rawhide whip and put into a sweatbox cell . After I was released from the sweat-box cell , the sheriff pushed me down a flight of steel steps . His deputies made sure I got to the bottom by kicking ' me along the way . At the trial , the judge defined a vagrant as ' a-hobo , a ' tramp , a bum , without any visible means of support , ' said I fitted this description , ' found me guilty , and fined me $200 plus $28 couit costs , or ninety days in jail . " After I spent ten days in jail , my wife got the services of a lawyer , Franklin Jones , who raised $450 for the bond . I was released after spending fourteen days in jail . The case is now being appealed to a higher court . While in jail , my trailer had been broken into and my clippings , letters of introduction and files containing the names of over a thousand friends here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DECIDED to drive straight through to Atlanta withoUt stopping . It had been my plan , when i left my borne in San Gabriel , California , to be in Atlanta about June 1 to bring my sister and her friend to California to visit with us . " About ' ten miles ' before Shreveport , I noticed that I was being followed by a police car . This kept on for about five . miles , until I stopped at a roadside diner for lunch . The police car stopped alongside mine , and the two policemen followed me into the diner . It seems they had heard all about me from the sheriff in Marshall , and they wanted to make sure I would leave town immediately . They refused to let me have any lunch . Instead , they forced the back into ' my car . One officer sat beside me , and the other followed us . I was taken to the Chief of Police ? his name is Teasley ? who ordered me to leave town . I told the chief that he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and freedom , and that I : had the right to travel wherever I wanted to in the States . Chief - Teasley conferred with the Police Commissioner and they had decided to let me go . " I was still hungry , not having had lunch , so I went into a Negro restaurant for a bite to eat . No sooner did I sit down at the counter than the two policemen came in and arrested me again . " The charge was vagrancy and - the bond Was set at $375 . The jailer who led me to the cell with the other prisoners said : ' l can kill you in the - name of the Lord , for what you are doing will bring about bloodshed between white and colored . ' He then showed the other prisoners in the cell a newspaper picture of me shaking hands with a ' Negro professor from Wiley College . After he left , the other prisoners started to use me as a punching bag . They worked me ' over for at least half an hour , beating me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my jaw . I was placed in solitary confinement until my trial four days later . ' " At the trial , it was decided that I had to submit to psychiatric observation ; and for seventeen days , I was observed by Coroner Butler and his investigator , Mr. Homer Bryant . During this time , Mr. Bryant , told me that he was a member of the White Citizens Council . " I was released on June 6 and tried on - June 10 . My wife had obtained the services of a lawyer , Mr. Jesse Stone . He was busy with another case on the morning of the trial date , and asked ' that my case be postponed a week , or at least until 3 P.M. of the same day . Judge Randall Whitmeyer refused . Without counsel , I was ' tried on charges Of disturbing the peace and vagrancy , 503 found guilty and sentenced to serve eight ' months on a prison farm . " The other prisoners of the farm had obviously been tipped off- as to my feelings on integration , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me a terrible beating , one after the other , smashing me in the head and face , kicking me all over my body . They also clipped all the hair off my head and body , even to my eyelashes . " They let me alone until the , following SUnday , which was visitors ' day . I was most heartened to find three local people coming to see me , a young couple , Mr. and Mrs. John Dowries , and their friend . They had attended the trial and had become interested in my case . They had tried to see me in jail , but were refused . Mrs. Dowries , a free-lance writer , had been asked by the Texas Observer , a weekly journal printed in Austin , to do an article on the trial . This was printed in the June 24 issue , and resulted in Mr. Downes 's being fired from his job and forced to move to Austin . His boss did n't like the idea of his wife 's writing an article that was so sympathetic to someone who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my fellow prisoners got to work on me again while the prison trusties looked on . I was tied to the top of a steel bunk and drenched with water from jars and buckets . Then they ripped , off all my clothes and beat me with towels and fists for thirty minutes . " There were some inmates who became friendly , but , they could n't do anything to stop the horrible beatings given me by the other prisoners . On one occasion , I was tied by my feet to the top steel bars and left swinging head-down with my shoulders barely touching the ' 504 bunk I was worked over hr-utally . During the night the prisoner who had beaten me the worst repented , and asked me to forgive him for what he had done to me . Of course I did , and we became good friends . " But the beatings by the other prisoners continued , and one time I was taken out to the lake on the farm and pushed under the water and held there some twenty-five or more times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I felt if my body did n't break , my spirit surely would . I was in terrible pain and my nerves were in an awful condition . For the first time in my life , I felt myself on the verge of a nervous breakdown . " THE appeal in my case finally came up and a $500 bond was asked for my release . Mr. and Mrs. Downes offered to post the bond , but when they arrived with the money , they found that Judge Whitmeyer had decided to increase , the amount to $1,500 . And so I had to remain in jail for several more days until an additional $1,000 could be found . On July 14 , 1960 , I was released . " While in prison , the outside of my car , with its messages of brotherhood , was ruined beyond repair . Once again , the inside had been broken into and my papers stolen . One of my new rear tires had been slashed , and I had to pay $44 88 storage charges . " I am now waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think . it 'll be some time in December . " " Then you 'll be going back to Shreveport ? " I asked . " I have to be present at the trial . " We sat for an hour or so more in the living room of his friends ' comfortable West Side apartment . We chatted about the over-all integration picture in the South . Mr. Jones was optimistic . He pointed out that more and more schools and restaurants were opening up on a desegregated basis . It was his opinion that the segregationists were very conscious that world opinion was against them and were sensitive to critical publicity . Therefore he felt that the publicity involved in his own trial would aid the cause of integration . We also spoke of his family ? his wife , who almost always travels with him , his two children and six grandchildren . His son and daughter , both from the Deep South , disapprove of their parents ' activities , and will have nothing to do with them . Mr. Jones forgives them , explaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it was time to go , Mr. Jones walked me outside the apartment to the elevator . He leaned his rangy body against the hall wall , smiled broadly , and said in his deep Southern drawl : " It certainly was wonder- : ful of you to come up here to see me . I hope to see you again . " The elevator arrived at the floor . I wished him good luck , stepped inside , and watched the door close on the anxious but determined face of the Rev. Ashton Jones .
