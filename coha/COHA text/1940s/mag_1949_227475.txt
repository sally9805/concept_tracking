During the last year , Russia 's ex post facto craving to lead the world in discoveries and inventions has reached the proportions of a national mania . Not content with claiming the airplane , telegraph , radio and electric light as Russian inventions , Soviet propagandists have been staking out their claims in every branch of the arts &; sciences . Among the many Russian scientists who " were discussing " evolution long before Darwin , say the propagandists , was the 18th Century scholar , Mikhail Lomonosov . Scientist Lomonosov was quite a fellow ; he also invented the helicopter and developed the theory of conservation of energy . <P> Another unsung Russian genius named Glinkov " considerably forestalled " Briton James Hargreaves in inventing the flaxspinning loom . Dr. N. I. Lunin of Dorpat discovered vitamins . Professor Kataev constructed the world 's first electronic television transmitter . In 1801 , the self-taught genius of the Urals , Artomonov , built the first bicycle in the world 's history , then pedaled the 1,000 miles from Nizhny Tagil to Moscow to prove it . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rightful glory is amply illustrated by the case of V. S. Pyatov . In 1859 , Pyatov tried to get a patent on his method of rolling armor plate . The czarist government submitted it to " foreign vultures " for their opinion , was informed that the invention was dangerous and impractical . A year later , the Soviet press asserted , the plate was produced by a vulture named Brown , in Sheffield , England . The list of Russian firsts which pulls Pyatov up from obscurity starts with the adding machine , anesthesia , Antarctica , atomic fission , runs on to the wedge breechblock and the wool-combing machine . <P> Last week , Soviet Bandleader Leonid Utesov produced a satiric view of Russian inventiveness . In a skit at Moscow 's Hermitage Gardens , Utesov tells a friend that he is to be congratulated-he has just invented the umbrella . The friend points out that the umbrella has already been invented . " Yes , " says Utesov , " but I am the first man to invent the umbrella for the second time . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been invented again &; again . A Chinese legend attributes its invention to a woman who lived some 3,000 years ago . The Greeks and Romans had it , but most of Europe forgot its umbrella during the Middle Ages . In the 16th Century some unnamed Italian invented it again . Two centuries later , however , umbrellas were being greeted with amazement in England and Scotland . North America 's first umbrella appeared on the streets of Baltimore in 1772 . According to one account , " Pedestrians stood transfixed , women were frightened , horses ran away , and naughty children threw stones . Finally , the town watch was called out to quiet the disturbance . "
