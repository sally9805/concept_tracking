The Dark Passage ( Warner ) builds up a remarkably long and effective delayed entrance for its star , Humphrey Bogart . During the first several reels , the camera-along with the audience-sees the world through the hero 's eyes : rolling downhill in a barrel ( he is a convict making a break ) ; watching a cop 's hand paw dangerously into his hideout in Lauren Bacall 's auto ( he is a convict getting a break ) ; watching Miss Bacall register lovelight as she looks into the lens ( a break cinemaddicts have had before ) . <P> Eventually , the camera gazes up at a sinister doctor ( Housely Stevenson ) who proposes to revise Bogart 's face beyond the Law 's recognition . For several reels more , the hero is visible only as an actor staging efficient silhouettes in a dark suit , his head masked in a glaring white , highly photogenic bandage . When at last this surrealist cocoon is peeled off to reveal nothing but Bogart , it is bound to be a little anticlimactic-but not too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plot . He finds out who murdered his wife and his best friend ( he is accused of murdering them ) , disposes of a petty crook ( Clifton Young ) who has latched onto him for blackmail , and gets set for the ultimate clinch with Miss Bacall . <P> Quite aside from Mr. Bogart 's high-skilled labor , The Dark Passage has the benefit of an unusually good script and direction by Delmer Daves , who also wrote and directed another unconventional thriller , The Red House ( TIME , Feb. 17 ) . Daves 's first-person-singular manipulation of the camera profits by Robert Montgomery 's good pioneering in Lady in the Lake ( TIME , Jan. 27 ) . Director Daves also has a sensitive hand with atmosphere and mood : there is a beautiful outdoor scene , for instance , in which the exhausted , bandaged Bogart , like a figure in a nightmare , staggers through the cold dawn light up a prodigious flight of empty wooden steps . <P> And Daves knows how to break players effectively out of type ( Agnes Moorehead , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role ) . The picture is greatly enriched through minor characters and minor incidents . As added frights , the doctor and the crook are such well-conceived , well-played parts that they practically steal the show . And just as Bogart is about ready to try for his final getaway , the question of whether two cops in a bus terminal are oblivious of him or waiting for him adds a realistic kind of suspense that is too seldom used in movies . This thriller is not quite up to the best Hitchcock , but it does prove that Delmer Daves is a man to watch . And The Dark Passage is a picture to see . <P> Frieda ( Rank ; Universal-International ) , an English film , is very much in earnest about a subject worth talking about : the question of war guilt among rank- &-file; Germans . Unfortunately , the movie has n't much to recommend it except its earnestness . Most of it is far too obviously a stage play , and a rather elementary problem play at that .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
