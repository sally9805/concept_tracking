After three and a half years in service , Yank last week got its honorable discharge . Its Manhattan HQ was emptying ; its final issue ( dated Dec. 28 ) was on the way to presses in eight countries . Its circulation , once 2.6 million in 16 editions , was down to 1.2 million and dropping fast as the Army dwindled . Two-thirds of its staff was discharged , and the rest could hardly wait to get out . <P> The Yankees were stepping into good jobs . Highest stepper was dark , barrel-chested , 30-year-old ex-Sergeant Joe McChester Carthy , Yank 's managing editor for three years . Before the war he was a $40-a-week Boston sportswriter , later a racetrack pressagent . Recently he was offered and took a $26,000-a-year job as an editor of Hearst 's Cosmopolitan . <P> Sergeant Marion ( See Here , Private ) Hargrove , whose best-selling book made him perhaps the richest alumnus of Yank , signed up for a lecture tour , plans to write another book . Cartoonist George Baker 's crude , snafued Sad Sack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was about to become a civilian himself . Some of the Yanks and their neighbors on the daily Stars &; Stripes were getting together on a new magazine , to be named Salute-a word presumably unpleasing to a G.I. ear . Among the Saluters : Cartoonist Bill ( " Up Front " ) Mauldin , New Yorker Staffman Walter Bernstein , Playwright Irwin Shaw . <P> Yet to be seen : whether the G.I. staff would produce such latterday giants as the Stars &; Stripes ' Class of ' 18 : F.P.A. , Steve Early , Grantland Rice , the New Yorker 's Harold Ross , the late Alexander Woollcott.
