The War Department last week let a whopping batch of orders ( $100,000,000 ) for tanks , set up a new organization to see that they are made well and fast . <P> Boss of Army tank design and procurement is big , blue-eyed Lieut . Colonel John Kay ( " Jack " ) Christmas , whom Army Ordnance rates tops among U.S. tank experts . No West Pointer , Jack Christmas is a mechanical engineer ( Lafayette College ) who got interested in tanks while he was an artilleryman in France during World War I. From tank testing at the Army 's Aberdeen ( Md . ) Proving Ground , last week he was shifted to Washington , given charge of a new Ordnance section . The new section 's province : tanks , other armored vehicles , and the all-important development of self-propelled " tank chasers " ( mobile artillery which travels in constant readiness to fire from wheeled mounts ) . <P> Jack Christmas wants tanks which can get there first , hit hardest . Says he : " A tank is n't a defensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go in for passive defense , ring the point to be defended with anti-tank guns , sure . But you 'll never win a-war that way . " He further believes that U.S. tanks are the best in over-all design , armor and guns , thinks the Germans have the edge only in numbers . <P> Rolling Out . The U.S. Army had about 500 tanks in service a year ago , now has some 1,500 . Its immediate aim ( in addition to production-for-Britain ) : some 880 medium tanks , 2,300 light tanks , 1,096 scout cars for eight armored divisions ( plus equipment for 15 separate tank battalions , equal to about five more divisions ) . <P> Bulk of present tank production is coming from American Car &; Foundry Co. ' s light ( 13-ton ) tank plant at Berwick , Pa . This week , with its rate up to 200 a month , A.C.F. delivers its 1,000th tank . Almost ready for production is an improved , 18-ton model with more armor , more punch . A.C.F. last week received a $12,500,000 Army order-presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started late , is still far behind wartime requirements but growing fast . The medium-tank producer the public has heard most about is Chrysler Corp . To a $53,200,000 order for 1,000 heavily armed , 28-ton tanks which Chrysler got last August , the War Department last week added another $74,568,000 for some 1,600 more tanks of later design . First to begin actual production of mediums was American Locomotive Co . ( Schenectady , N.Y. ) . Also building mediums is Baldwin Locomotive Works at Eddystone , Pa. , which is now turning out three tanks a day , expects to be up to twelve a day by fall . <P> A highly secret Army project is the development of a heavy tank ( about 60 tons ) . The Army has no heavies in service , long doubted that it would ever need any . Where &; when the new heavies will be produced in service quantities , the Army does not say . Neither is it saying anything about the tanks ' armament . But land-battleships of that size could carry perhaps two six-inch guns , a 75-mm. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Army men once thought that they had something when they got their first new medium , with less than a third that much fire power .
