June , traditional month for weddings , is also the month with the year 's longest days . Professor Thomas Hume Bissonnette , of Trinity College at Hartford , Conn. , thinks this no coincidence but scientific cause &; effect . Last week he told of some experiments on animals which seem to prove that light ( not temperature , as long supposed ) is the prime external factor controlling love and mating . <P> Pink-cheeked , twinkling Biologist Bissonnette is one of the world 's leading authorities on photoperiodicity - the study of the effect of light on animals ' and plants ' seasonal cycles . The earliest application of this science , so far as he knows , was by Spanish peasants who in 1602 used torchlight to stimulate hens ' egg-laying . Poultrymen used to believe that the reason artificial light improved hens ' production was that it made them eat and exercise more . But Professor Bissonnette showed that the light itself stimulates laying . <P> He pursued his researches further with pheasants , starlings , weasels , goats , mink and raccoons . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he made raccoons bear two litters a year instead of one , made goats breed in summer instead of winter , induced pheasants , which normally lay their eggs in April , to lay them on the snow in midwinter . By the same means , he fooled minks into growing a rich brown winter pelt in summer and shedding in winter , made weasels change their coats from brown to white and back to brown again most unseasonably . <P> Duration , Not Intensity . Professor Bissonnette concludes that all this proves that the pituitary gland , which lies at the base of the brain , is affected by light transmitted by the optic nerve . He points out that if an animal 's optic stalk ( connecting the eye and the brain ) is cut , the animal will change its breeding season . He also found that the intensity of light seems to make little difference ; what counts is its duration . The pituitary gland apparently is also stimulated by color : red light , for example , moves starlings to mate more than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affect all animals alike , and that in the tropics , where the length of days varies little with the seasons , mating animals must be affected by something else . But he would like to know , if his theory is not correct , why swallows always arrive at Capistrano on the same day of the year , regardless of temperature . <P> Photoperiodicity , still a brand-new theory , has little data as yet on the effect of light on man , but Professor Bissonnette notes that the long Arctic night seems to dull the mating urge among Eskimos . The professor hopes some day to investigate this report ; the American Philosophical Society and other scientific groups are already subsidizing his animal investigations .
