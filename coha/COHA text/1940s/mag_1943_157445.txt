Englishmen were offered a long vista last week . From London Bridge they could look through an open door and see the Statue of Liberty . This surrealist panorama , in eight colors , was the cover of the first issue of a brand-new digest-size monthly magazine called Transatlantic ( price : one shilling ) . Its purpose : to give the British a candid , unpropagandized look at the U.S. <P> Editor of this hopeful publication is Geoffrey Crowther , who is also editor of the Economist ( TIME , Aug. 30 ) . To the 50,000 British readers which Transatlantic wants , Editor Crowther observes : " Transatlantic 's hope is that it may help you to base your likes and dislikes on knowledge instead of on ignorance . . . . It is not an attempt to seduce you from your proper loyalties . . . . Will it look at America through rose-tinted spectacles ? Certainly not . . . . Friendly candor is to be the keynote . " <P> Angeled by London 's rich , young Allen Lane , publisher of Penguin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) a Crowther commentary on what is going on in the U.S. ; 2 ) a Washington letter by the Christian Science Monitor 's Roscoe Drummond ; 3 ) " incidental notes on the state of the States " by U.S. Critic Carl Van Doren . The rest ( save the advertising at 75 a page ) is and will be an all-American contribution . The U.S. editorial staff is a " steering committee " headed by Author Margaret Leech ( Reveille in Washington ) . <P> Transatlantic 's 64-page debut fell short of the prospectus . Author Van Doren 's discussion of his Dutch-English ancestry and why he is nonetheless American was more charming than illuminating . Ellsworth Huntington , Yale professor of geography , discussed What Geography Does To America with too much educational zeal and a faint flavor of patronage . Paul Gallico relieved this solemn though unponderous tone with a lightweight piece designed to prove that Americans love baseball because it is their one escape from female domination . <P> With application and time , Transatlantic should improve . No improvement is necessary , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are sold out .
