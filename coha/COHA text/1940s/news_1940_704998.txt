txt The Senate finance committee yesterday struck from the excess profits tax bill the Treasury Department 's scheme to give the federal government indefinite control over defense plant expansions made by private companies under the terms of the special fiveyear amortization plan . As the bill now stands , a corporation can construct facilities certified by the Defense Commission . and either the War or Navy Departments . as essential for national defense and write off the costs for tax purposes over a period of five years with the assurance that . t. and not the government , will control the future disposition of these facilities . The committee recessed until Wednesday to give the drafting experts time to write changes made in the House-approved bill into legislative form The committee hopes to act on the bill Wednesday and have it ready for Senate consideration on Thursday . In addition ot the changes in the amortization title of the hill . the committee yesterday announced four other amendment-. + . These provided for . - 1 Elimination of the special 10,4. excess prods tax the committee had voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts " with the United States and foreign governments . 2 . A flat excess profits exemption of $10. - 000. instead of $5,000 for all corporations . 3 . Suspension of the recapture provisions of the Merchant Marine Act as they apply to subcontractors , only . 4 . Permissive authority for corporations to include tax exempt bonds as invested capital if the interest from these bonds is reported as income for excess profits tax purposes . and a mandatory requirement that partially tax exempt bonds be counted as capital and the interest from them reported as intome . Favored by Advisory Commission In changing the amortization title of the bill , the finance committee followed the recommendations of the Defense Advisory Commission , which had the support of the War and Navy Departments . The commission had warned that if the controls inserted in the bill by the House ways and means committee at the specific request uI the Treasury Department were retained , the primary purpose of the amortization plan  --  encouragement of private capital to provide , at its own risks , increased facilities for production of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hampered . The commission insisted that the Interest of the government in such plants could be protected by individual contracts and that legislative restrictions would be a hindrance . The committee , however , made what was referred to by one member as a ' slight concession " to the Treasury Department by writing into the bill limited restrictions covering socalled Class Two contracts ? contracts under which private capital will construct defense facilities and be reimbursed over a period of five years by the government . The committee inserted a provision that before facilities covered by Class Two contracts can take advantage ot the five-year amortization plan . the contracts must be made public and the Defense Commission , and either the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy . must certify that the contracts protect the interests of the government Treasury Agrees to Pros-Mos The Treasury agreed to this new provisidoo over the week-end .. Observers here were inclined to interpret the new provision as " window dressing " and an attempt at " face-saving " for the benefit of the Treasury Department , which has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill rejected by the Senate finance committee . In the first place it was pointed out , Class Two contracts give the government control over facilities constructed under them . The contractor goes ahead and builds the facilities and operates them , but the government over a period of five years , repays , in installments : the cost of the facilities . At the end of the five-year period . the builder could then buy the facilities from the government at their fair value , otherwise the government would have title to them . In the second place , it was pointed out , the five-year amortization plan is designed primarily to encourage companies , which have not specific cdmmitnients from the War and Navy Departments , to expand their facilities for production of war materials These are considered by the Defense Commission as Class One plant expansions and would not be affected by the new language inserted in the amortization provision by the committee . The language Which the committee eliminated from the House bill is contained in subsections I , J and K of the amortization title . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five-year plan could not demolish or substantially alter the facilities without the approval of either the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy . If approval was refused , the government would then take the facilities over at their book value but not leas than $1 . Purchase Price Would Be $1 For example . if the facilities cost $1,000,000 and amortization had been taken for four years at the rate of $200,000 or 20 , ; - , a year , the government could then take the plant over for $200,000 . If five years amortization had been taken , the government 's purchase price Would be $1 . Provision was made whereby the original owner could repurchase such facilities at the price paid by the government when the government had no further use for the plant . There was no limit on the number of years the Secretaries of War or Navy could exercise their control . They could keep " strings " on facilities amortized under the five-year plan for an indefinite period . John D. Biggers , chairman of the Advisory Commission 's committee on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that manufacturers of articles that have some future potential use in normal industry , such as turbines for a ship , would expand their facilities now , if given the encouragement offered by the five year amortization plan . He explained to the committee that the government was not repaying these manufacturers , through increased prices . for their plants . In discussing the amortization plan , Mr. Biggers said : " The average manufacturer would not elect to proceed under this , which is the most precarious method of serving the government . unless he made a product for which he thought there would be a continued government demand , or at the end of the government demand a peacetime demand . " Many Corporations Likely to Benefit The new for tax exempt and partially tax exempt bonds was proposed by the Treasury Department and may prove of considerable benefit to many corporations . Its importance grows out of the fact that the Senate bill uses the invested capital method to provide a minimum credit against excess profits . No corporation with earnings of 8 ' " c or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay excess profits taxes . As explained by Senator Harrison , a corporation with a part of its surplus invested in wholly tax exempt government bonds would be permitted to count these bonds in computing its invested capital for excess profits tax purposes , provided the income from them was reported for excess profits tax purposes . This will operate to increase the excess profits credit of some companies . For example , if corporation A has equity capital of $1,000 , - 000 , its credit against excess profits would be 8% of this amount , or $80,000 . If , in addition to the equity capital , the company had $100.000 of surplus , ' invested in government bonds . it could include the additional amount represented by these bonds and increase its excess profits credit by $8,000 , or 8% of the amount of the bonds . In the case of partially tax-exempt bonds , it was explained , the corporation is given no option . It must include these securities in computing its capital funds and report the income from them for excess profits tax purposes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and partially tax exempt bonds were treated as nonadraisaible assets and were excluded from the computation of invested capital . Also , the income from them was excluded in determining excess profits income . The committee 's decision to reconsider its vote imposing an additional tax of 10% on that portion of a corporation 's excess profits attributable to war materials contracts and subcontracts was influenced by the Defense Commission . Leon Henderson , member of the commission , told the committee this extra tax would result in complications and asked that it be eliminated . Committee complied with this recommendation . The committee rejected , by a voice vote , the proposal of Senator Lee ( Dem. , Okla. ) , for socalled " forced loans " to the government . As the excess profits tax bill now stands in the Senate committee , it is substantially different from the measure approved by the House . The most outstanding of the changes made by the finance committee was the decision to give all corporations an excess profits credit equal to ? their average earnings during the 198689 base period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess profits taxes was greatly restricted , and now serves as a minimum credit for all corporations , exempting from the tax those which fail to earn 8% on their taxable year invested capital . It was estimated the amendment raising from$5,000 to $20,000 the at excess profits exemption allowed ' all corporations would cut the estimated ' revenue yield of the bill from 11485,040 , Q00 031 1.9110 earnings to 1E466,000,000
