txt Much careful thinking , and perhaps some future planning . lay behind the use by the State Department in Washington of the phrase " Soviet proconsul " to describe the new job given to Soiet Army Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky in Poland . In the days of ancient Rome the assignment of a proconsul to a conquered or tributary 1 country was a sign that the country in question was being converted into a province of the empire . Up to this time the Russians have been careful to avoid the appearance of appointing a man to high office in a satellite country who could be described technically as a proconsul . Until last week power in all such countries was wielded by men who were at least technically citizens of that country . Some have lived in Moscow for many , many years . But . by and large . they were all born in the countries they now rule . Marshal Rokossovsky was born in Poland . But there is a difference between his case and those which have gone before . The other men were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been trained in Moscow , but trained for returning to their home lands . Not even Moscow could claim that Marshal Rokossovsky had been Pole-trained in Moscow for a career in Poland . He may have been Polish born . But his career has been in a Soviet Army , and he became one of its top commanders during the war. , And he is now the minister of defense in Poland , and therefore commander of all Polish armed forces Moscow plainly is not satisfied with the degree of control it has exercized in Poland up until this time , and Moscow plainly wants more direct and effective control * A A This move coincides with the apparent arrival in Poland of the wave of purging which has swept up through the curtain area , beginning in Bulgaria early in the year . Hungary and Czechoslovakia have had purges which apparently bit deep into the ranks of the local Communist parties , and now the movement is under way in Poland with a fresh outburst against Wladyslaw Gomulka , former secretary-general of the Polish Communist Party , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is not by any means all bad tor the cause of the West . Up until this time any appeal from the West to countries " east of the curtain " had to be directed to the people against what appeared to the people to be a native government . It is not easy to rouse a people against a government of its own kind , even though it may be a highly unpopular government . Any attempt to drive a wedge between a people and its government can be presented as interference in the domestic affairs of another country . During the war Germans and Japanese made no real headway with their attempts to appeal to those Americans who disapproved of President Roosevelt . But when Moscow sends a marshal of the Soviet Army to become minister of defense in one of the satellite countries , several things change . For one thing , it is a confession of weakness . It proves something worth knowing  --  that not even a Polish Communist trained in Moscow is able to make Poland a reliable satellite . When one twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows there is dissension and potential revolt deep inside the Communist Party of Poland . A , For another thing , there is now evidence , which can be brought home to the Poles by the Voice of America that Moscow wishes to make their government more amenable to Moscow than even Polish Communists can make it . A Soviet Army marshal is not a Pole , no matter where he was born . He can only be a Russian " proconsul . " To call him that is no longer subject to the weakness of an obvious attempt to drive a wedge between a people and their own native government . It can no longei-be described as an effort to interfere in the internal affairs of another country . On the contrary , it is merely to call attention to the fact that the issue is no longer between the Poles and their government , but has become an issue between Poland and Russia . And in the process , the Russians have expressed their contempt for the government of their own choosing in Poland . The label " Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet put into the hands of the West for use in eastern Europe . It will not be wasted .
