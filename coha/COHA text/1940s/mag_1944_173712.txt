( see Cover ) <P> This week the Massachusetts Legislature gathers in special session to perfect its soldier vote law . When the Representatives finish their deliberations beneath the Sacred Cod on the wall , and the State Senate concurs , Massachusetts will probably have the most intelligent - and non-controversial - soldier vote law in the U.S. Anyone in the family can get a ballot sent to a serviceman . Even a constitutional requirement that new voters must be able to read the State Constitution in English will cause no trouble . Five lines of the Constitution will be printed on the ballot envelope . A sergeant on the remotest Pacific atoll will be witness enough that a soldier can read it . <P> The fact that this machinery is workable , constitutional and noncontroversial , is another demonstration of the plain horse sense of Massachusetts ' governor , Leverett Saltonstall . And the fact that it permits a maximum of servicemen to vote is in the let-everyone-speak tradition of New England 's time-crusted town meet ing . Massachusetts acts from three centuries ' experience of sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New England - her land from the Indians . War got New England its independence . Now war has given New England a new lease on life . <P> Past with a Present . Some $14 billion in war contracts are surging around in New England , thrusting the old land into one wave of prosperity after another . In the nationwide spread of the war bonanza , other regions may make more noise : the colossal doings of California 's giant air plants have been trumpeted in Hollywood style ; Detroit 's auto manufacturers have four-colored their achievements ; the war prosperity of the New South is an old story . But New England has done its mighty bit with hardly a buglenote or breastbeat . <P> The war and the recurrent shocks of prosperity have shaken New England out of a resigned preoccupation with its past . From the Penobscot to the Housatonic , shipyards clang . Spindles are singing again in textile mills , turning out Army uniforms . Pretty , white-spired New England villages , asleep in their history , have stirred themselves to produce millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firearms , propellers and engines , rightfully calls herself the No. 1 Arsenal in the Arsenal of Democracy . Small , bellicose Vermont was the first state to declare war on the Axis-nine weeks before Pearl Harbor , Vermont began paying soldier bonuses because the U.S. was " already in a shooting war . " In the green hills where Ethan Allen 's Green Mountain boys trod , lean , lank Vermonters turn out landing craft and gun-mounts in Burlington , aircraft ignition parts in Vergennes . The Massachusetts shoreline is one long row of shipyards and shipways , with convoys loading up . Its yards and plants produce everything from the $60 million aircraft carrier Lexington to G.I. shoelaces.
