New Musical in Manhattan <P> Something for the Boys ( book by Herbert and Dorothy Fields ; music &; lyrics by Cole Porter ; produced by Michael Todd ) gives Broadway the musicomedy it has been thirsting for since September . It reveals Songblitzer Ethel Merman at her absolute peak and Songwriter Cole Porter well above the timberline . Its book has more laughs , if no more logic , than most . It has the bright Broadway look that , despite the show 's light wartime motifs , suggests the gaudier years of peace . <P> Something for the Boys tells of three uninhibited cousins ( Ethel Merman , Paula Laurence , Allen Jenkins ) who inherit a Texas ranch next door to Kelly Field and set up a boardinghouse for soldiers ' wives . In their spare time they also make defense gadgets out of carborundum . The hostelry turns into a scandal , and Actress Merman , by getting some carborundum in her teeth , turns into a radio receiving set . After that nothing even tries to make sense . <P> Having long since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other musicomedy voices , Ethel Merman today puts herself across as brilliantly as she does a song . In Something for the Boys she is everywhere , doing everything . She torches and trollops , blares and beguiles , and late in the evening she and Actress Laurence , as a pair of wacky Indian women , bring down the house larruping through By the Mississinewa . <P> The Porter tunes in Something for the Boys are lively , but lack the old throbbing magic of Night and Day and Begin the Beguine . The Porter lyrics are clever , but lack the old high-style smartness of Let 's Do It and You 're the Top . If this means loss of power , it also suggests change of purpose : Composer Porter is gearing his tunes for Broadway productions and tailoring them for the brash Merman . <P> At 49 , small , dark , shiny-haired Cole Albert Porter shares top rank for musicomedy tunes with Irving Berlin , Jerome Kern , Richard Rodgers . Behind Porter lie 17 Broadway shows , including such hits as Fifty Million Frenchmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Du Barry Was a Lady , Panama Hattie . <P> Musicomedy 's most sophisticated composer was born in Peru , Ind. , the son of a fruitgrowing farmer . After graduating from Yale ( where he wrote the still popular Bulldog and Bingo ) in 1913 , Porter went for a year to Harvard Law School , then switched to the department of music . While still a student he had a musical , See America First , produced on Broadway . It contained one Porter song which still makes middle-aged sentimentalists blink over their highballs : I 've a Shooting Box in Scotland ( words by Porter 's good friend T. Lawrason Riggs , longtime Catholic chaplain at Yale ) . In 1917 Porter joined the French Foreign Legion , going to the wars with a tiny portable piano on his back .
