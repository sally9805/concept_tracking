txt Heavy building activity will receive marked stimulus In coming months from plant expansion programs of shipbuilding and aircraft companies . Navy awards were made publics yesterday of $63.4$2,000 to seven shipbuilding companies for yard extensions and of $33 , - 509,000 to four steel companies to build facilities for processing Navy steel . Announcement will be made shortly of contracts between the government and aircraft companies for new plants , many of which have already been disclosed by companies Involved . In addition , a new plane production program . involving erection of government-owned plants , is under discussion . With heavy building on the upgrade , total construction may reach a new peak shortly , perhaps before 1940 ends . Weekly building volume is steadly gaining momentum . In September It was the largest In more than a decade and third largest on record . WASHINGTON  --  Shipbuilding and aircraft companies , two industries forming the backbone of the defense program , yesterday moved forward with plant expansion programs . Shipbuilding companies received the actual go-ahead signal on new plants from Secretary of the Navy Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given 563.452,000 with which to expand their yards and that four steel companies had been given $33.503,000 to build heat-treatment furnaces and other plants for processing Navy steel . This 396,961,0000 program , together with $12,950,000 previously allotted to four other shipbuilding companies , exhausts all but about $20.000.000 of the funds which the Navy has for enlarging facilities to accommodate its " two-ocean navy " building program . Aircraft Expansion Scheduled Expansion of aircraft plants will be the next big industrial news from the rearmament pro-grata . Announcement of contracts between the government and aircraft ' companies providing for new plants , many of which have already been announced by the companies involved . is expected to begin within the next few days . Bell Aircraft Corp . may be the first company to complete arrangements . President Roosevelt cleared the way for announcement . of the aircraft plant contracts when be signed the excess profits tax bill . This bill sets up the five-year amortization allowance for defense plants , provides that the National Defense Advisory Commission must certify that contracts taking advantage of this allowance protect the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contracts . Unlike the new shipbuilding facilities announced yesterday , the new airplane plants contemplated in the existing aircraft procurement program will not be financed in the first instance by government funds . The plants will be built under contracts obligating the government to reimburse the aircraft companies for the plant outlays in five annual installments . Once these plant-reimbursement contracts are signed , the aircraft companies may be able to secure bank loans covering the original cost of the plants , posting the contracts as collateral . Assignment of government contracts to a lender in such instances is authorized by another bill soon to be signed by President Roosevelt . New Program Being Discussed In addition to the aircraft procurement plans already mapped out , a new plane production program , perhaps involving construction of government-owned plants , is beginning to be discussed here . As yet the conferences in this connection have been confined to a few officials , and the fate of the tentative plan is uncertain . Additional appropriations would be necessary , and , barrink greater disturbances abroad , no request for them appears imminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be determined until the Administration whips together its next defense program , probably sometime in November . The fact that influential groups already are discussing bigger airplane production indicates that the next defense program will aim to push U. S. aircraft manufacturing capacity beyond the maximum of 36.000 planes annually which is now set for 1942 . President Roosevelt originally mentioned 50,000 as the production capacity he desired . Measures to speed up procurement of all rearmament items , including airplanes , are also beginning to be discussed . In this connection , cflicials generally are dissatisfied with aircraft production results as disclosed by William S. Knudsen. defense commissioner in charge of production . According to Mr. Knudsen. the October output of planes will be between 900 and 950 , about 16 to 20% below the 1,130 planes which were scheduled . This situation , together with the desire for a larger capacity . has revived discussion of the " arsenal plan " for producing aircraft under which the government would build and own new plants , leasing them to private operators .
