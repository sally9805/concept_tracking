The only leader of open warfare against Adolf Hitler on the continent of Europe today is a gallant , stocky man who likes to play peasant songs on the mandolin . For months , in the Yugoslav mountains south of Belgrade , General Draja Mihailovich and his 100,000 super-guerrillas have fought off as many as seven German divisions ( TIME , Dec. 15 ) , inspired by a magnificent will to resist . But recently General Mihailovich radioed the exiled Yugoslav Government in London that his ammunition was running low . <P> He holds none of Yugoslavia 's munitions factories . He has some outside aid from unrevealed sources-perhaps by air from Russia . Last week the Government asked the " U.S. for Lend-Lease aid . It would be hard to deliver such aid-the nearest fixed Allied base is in Alexandria , 1,200 miles away-but in a world of desperate and needy fighters there was no one more deserving of help .
