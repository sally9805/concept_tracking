txt Merchant Seaman Denied Extra Gas I am a merchant seaman . Having two weeks ashore , I wanted to use my car and sought tot avail myself of the extra gas ration given to servicemen . Going to the ration board , I was informed that merchant seamen are not entitled to the extra ration , whereas a soldier waiting ahead of me on line in I do not deny him the right to gasoline , but I have worked on tankers , commonly called floating targets , and carried gasoline to the fighting fronts . Merchant seamen are in the minority compared with the Army and Navy . They are mostly seen only in the larger seaports from which the troops and supplies for the armies overseas leave ; they are a part of this chain of supply that makes the winning of the war possible , yet they are disowned and discriminated against as in no other maritime power in the world .
