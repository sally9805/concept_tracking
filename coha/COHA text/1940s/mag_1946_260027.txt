An oldtime newspaperman once said to Stringfellow Barr : " You know the trouble with the present generation ? They 've never read the minutes of the previous meeting . " <P> For nine years at tiny St. John 's College in Annapolis , Md. , Stringfellow ( " Winkie " ) Barr has helped his students catch up on the minutes of mankind 's most memorable meetings : the " 100 Great Books , " from Homer to Bertrand Russell . ( His list , which is flexible , differs from the University of Chicago 's , now numbers 109 . ) Last week President Barr announced he was quitting St. John 's , going off somewhere else to start a new college-almost exactly like the one he was leaving . <P> Oxford Was Right . Amiable Winkie Barr was parting amicably from 250-year-old St. John 's . An ex-Rhodes Scholar , he thinks Oxford University has the right idea in insisting on small colleges . Says he : " Learning is a kind of contagion . The group must be compact enough for the contagion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's to get any bigger . We 've always assumed we would start another college when it got too big . " St. John 's , which graduated only seven students during one wartime year , expects to enroll 225 students this September-an all-time high . Barr has agreed to stick around until a St. John 's " insider " is picked to succeed him . <P> <P> For the new college , Barr still had no name , no faculty , no campus or buildings . He wants to start his new " colony " in ready-made buildings , suitable for September 1947 occupancy , near but not in a big city . He has n't the least idea where to find them . All he has is a president ( himself ) , a plan ( the St. John 's idea , with variations ) - and $4,500,000 . This tidy endowment came from the Old Dominion Foundation , set up five years ago by young aluminum heir Paul Mellon , who enrolled in St. John 's at 33 , when he already had degrees from Yale and Cambridge . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Liberated Teachers . Barr plans to borrow a few faculty members from St. John 's , persuade some recent St. Johnnies to try their hand at teaching , and raid established schools to " liberate oppressed minorities " who believe in the St. John 's way . A teaching task-force from " College X " will invade the nearest city , bring the great books to grownups who are too old or too busy to go to college . <P> The new school will offer no graduate degrees , but plans to encourage research " between " - instead of " within " - fields . ( " We need to cut passages between shafts we have already dug , instead of merely digging the same old shafts deeper &; deeper . " ) <P> Colonist Barr thinks the time is ripe for a new school , both because of the " shocking " shortage and because " I 'm getting old . " ( He is 49 . ) Will there be still more Barr-built colleges on the St. John 's pattern ? " I 'd like to think this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start the next one . "
