U.S. industry last week began adding up the bill against the nation 's economy for the month-long coal strike . Items : <P> Members of John L. Lewis ' United Mine Workers lost more than $100,000,000 in wages . <P> The steel industry suffered a production loss estimated at 900,000 tons of ingots ( equal to about 675,000 tons of finished steel ) . With about one-third of the 400,000 soft-coal miners still out , awaiting the court decision on John L. Lewis ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , Iron Age estimated that the loss will reach 1,400,000 tons before normal production could possibly be resumed . <P> General Motors announced that it would lay off some 200,000 workers-more than half its total force-for at least a week , because of steel and pig-iron shortages . The motor industry , Ward 's Automotive Reports said , would make about 265,000 fewer cars and trucks this quarter than expected . <P> To steelmen , these losses were only a down payment . Gambling on a quick end to the strike , they had used most of their coal reserves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They would hardly be able to rebuild the reserves by June 30 , when the miners ' contract expires and another strike is expected . The next one , if it comes , would force a quick and sharp cut in steel production . <P> The new pinch in steel , plus the added demand from EGA , had already put new life in the dying grey market . To spread the steel , some companies planned to cut customers ' quotas under the industry 's present voluntary rationing , system . Others , convinced that this would not do the job , feared a system of Government allocations by fall .
