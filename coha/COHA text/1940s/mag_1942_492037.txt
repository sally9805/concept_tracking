THE TERRIBLE-TEMPERED DR . BARNES BEFORE this country was at war , a titled refugee arrived in the United States with but a single hope to solace her exile . She wanted to satisfy a lifelong desire to see the finest collection of modern art in the world , owned by Dr. Albert Coombs Barnes , of Philadelphia . She was hardly off the clipper when she wrote to Doctor Barnes , She wondered if she might have the pleasure and privilege of seeing his 200 Renoirs , 100 Cezannes , seventy-five Matisses and thirty-five Picassos and the rest of his thousand or so art treasures . Barnes ' reply was gracious in the extreme . It saddened him to be obliged to tell Her Highness that on the day she mentioned the Barnes gallery had been reserved for a charity affair by the fashionable suburb in which he lived . This was to be an art exhibit of a somewhat different sort . If Her Highness must know , he said , it was to be a strip-tease contest for debutantes . And to his distress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , out of consideration for the intrinsic modesty of the delis , it had been decided to limit the guests to the boy friends of the contestants . Whether the lady realized it or not , she was impaled on the most brutal pen of our times . But she need not have felt too bitter . What happened to her , happens regularly to many of the elect in America at the hands of Barnes . Barnes ' victims , nursing ugly wounds to their vanity , are , nevertheless , the first to acknowledge his several distinctions . Barnes is the discoverer of Argyrol , an antiseptic that has done much for humanity while bringing in millions to Barnes . He is an international authority on art , held in even more respect in Europe than in his native land . As a collector he has been the outstanding champion and benefactor of modern art . In fact , he made the market for modern art , and then he cornered the market , with the result that his collection cost him less than one fourth its present estimated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of some very practical theories . As a kind of special mission in life , he has striven to take the swoon out of art appreciation . Yet in spite of these solid accomplishments , Barnes gets his greatest personal satisfaction out of writing poison-pen letters , of which the one to the noblewoman was a gentle example . Comprehending the doctor is not easy . It involves a fascinating problem in dual personality ? a scientist , art connoisseur and educator , who , in his dealings with the public , is a combination Peck 's Bad Boy and Donald Duck . Barnes is a product of a particularly tough section of South Philadelphia . In his behavior and social reactions no one has been more loyal to his early environment . He kept faith with it by becoming successively a boxer and a semiprofessional baseball player . He did not deviate from it while he worked his way through the University of Pennsylvania for an M.D. degree and went on to Berlin and Heidelberg . And even after Argyrol made him a millionaire at thirty-five , with many more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of South Philadelphia ; instead of trying to buy his way into Philadelphia society , Barnes continued to view the Social Register set with racy contempt and he never lets an opportunity pass to snub it . Barnes aligns himself vigorously with the plain people . Twenty years ago he built the Barnes Foundation in Merion , a Main Line suburb , and he announced that it was to be a working embodiment of democracy as well as a dwelling for his art . A frustrated artist himself , he has endowed the foundation with $10 , - 000,090 , so that poor but ambitious young men and women can study art there free under a new , down-to-earth system of education against the background of his paintings . But if you suppose that he would throw open his gallery to the masses so that they could brighten their workaday existence by communing with art and beauty , you are wrong ; such consistency is for less imaginative men . The general public is strictly barred from the Barnes Foundation . Celebrities occupy a position immediately below Social Registerites on Barnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what he does to celebrities is illustrated by what he did to the colossus himself , Alexander Woollcott . It happened when that popular merchant of cyanide and sirup came to Philadelphia in the guise of an actor in The Man Who Came to Dinner , a play based upon the life and insults of Alexander Woollcott . Offstage during that visit Woollcott played The Man Who Came to Philadelphia , his boyhood home . He did not go to a hotel as other actors do , but took a house in Rittenhouse Square for the three weeks of the play 's run . There he held levees each night after the show , and invitations to these suppers were more sought after than a hid to the Assembly . Philadelphians emerged from their customary torpor to attempt the enchanting business of making Woollcott at least as happy as he had been during his stay at the White House while the play was in Washington . If Woollcott began to believe in his own legend , it is understandable . So Woollcott loftily dictated a telegram to Barnes asking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to send word to him at the stage door if that was agreeable . Woollcott put his coat of arms on the message by sending it collect . That was on a Sunday . Awaiting Woollcott when he arrived at the theater the next night was a letter . It read : " I was alone in the house this morning when a telegraph-office employee telephoned that she had a telegram for Dr. Barnes , charges collect . I explained that our financial condition made it impossible for us to assume the additional responsibility and I declined to accept the telegram . She explained that it was from such an important man that I should call Dr. Barnes to the phone to take the message . . . . My reply was that Dr. Barnes was out on the lawn singing to the birds and that it would cost me my job if I should disturb him at his regular Sunday-morning nature worship . " The telegraph-office girl is evidently a person . either very sympathetic to my lowly station or an individual who knows that to thwart a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the telegram to me . " I write you thus , frankly , so that you will understand the dilemma I was in , and in the hope that you will forgive my not knowing what a distinguished person you are . " The letter was signed : " Fiddle de PortManech , Secretaire de Dr. Barnes . " Woollcott was still pondering the signature when someone explained to him that Fickle was Doctor Barnes ' French dog  --  a mongrel  --  which on occasion acts as his spokesman in affairs of this sort . The next day , after the news got out , the Philadelphia Record ran an editorial , under the heading Ai , t . WOOLLCOTT AND A YARDWTDER , hailing Barnes ' daring touche , and exclaiming , " The Man Who Came to Dinner has been served a metaphorical bellyful . " Woollcott rapidly marshaled his sophisticated forces . He wrote to Barnes , acknowledging receipt of " the naughty letter from Fiddle . " He professed disappointment that Fiddle did n't have as gifted a ghost writer as Figaro , Booth Tarkington 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending the telegram collect . He said he had been wrong in asking to see a dozen pictures . He could not possibly look at more than six in any one day . He concluded : " I know you will not object if I take the whole matter up in an interview I am doing on the radio sometime tomorrow . In that interview I shall have to explain that I have not enough leisure during this week in Philadelphia to see half the things I would like to see . In that connection I shall make it clear that whereas I quite understand the pardonable pride in your collection which has led you to besiege me with invitations to examine it , my engagement at the theater and my preoccupation with more important matters simply will not leave me time to see your pictures . " The doctor was not to be caught off guard by coyness . He dispatched a bristling challenge to the Town Crier . He said that if Woollcott would " furnish incontrovertible evidence that I ever invited you to ' examine ' our pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you , free of charge , the most important painting in our collection . " Woollcott 's Waterloo T HE painting Barnes had in mind for this clincher was Seurat 's The Models , for which the French government once offered him half a million dollars . Woollcott did a graceful minuet around the doctor 's challenge . " I am afraid it will be impossible for me to continue this correspondence after I have left Philadelphia , " he replied . " Perhaps that is just as well because inevitably you would grow more wary and not fall so readily into such a trap as my bogus threat to do a broadcast about you . . . I am sorry my Philadelphia visit must be so crowded , but I promise to come out and see the pictures the next time I pass this way . " Barnes then sounded the tom-toms of a Barnes victory . He wrote that " tears dimmed my sight " when he read that the Town Crier could n't keep up the correspondence . " My sorrow was like that of the prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off because his adversary has been inflicted with an acute attack of cold feet . To switch the metaphor , Philadelphia enjoyed the trimming of the fringe of your intellectual trousers carried so high that your mental bottom was exposed to the public at large . " As for falling into Woollcott 's trap , " Well , I bet that you would no more face a showdown on that score than you would on the larger , general issue which you ducked . Eight persons besides myself saw the ' trap ' and I decided to utilize what you actually said to prove that I would set the pace for what I hoped would develop into a worthwhile set-to . " And , finally , concerning Woollcott 's promise to drop in at the foundation on his next trip to Philadelphia , Barnes said , " I must warn you that thousands of birds inhabit our park and they swoop down on every visible lump of suet and peck it to pieces . " Another aversion of Barnes ' is rich men , and this antipathy has grown in intensity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exceptions  --  one of whom is William C. Bullitt , former ambassador to Russia and France  --  Barnes will have nothing to do with his fellows in the upper brackets . He is especially bitter toward inherited wealth . Walter P. Chrysler , Jr. , himself an art collector of some reputation , did n't know that when he wrote to the doctor : " We have so many mutual interests in connection with modern art which are as deeply rootedwith me 213 they are with you that I feel confident you will not think me too presumptuous in writing you to ask if it might be possible for a close friend of mine and myself to take advantage of your hospitality in seeking your permission to view the magnificent group of pictures you have collected in the Barnes Foundation . " A lethal answer , signed by " Peter Kelly , Secretary " ? who alternates with Ficl  --  le as Barnes ' alter ego in these matters  --  was mailed promptly to Mr. Chrysler . It read : " It is impossible at this time to show to Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders that he is not to be disturbed during his present strenuous efforts to break the world 's record for goldfish swallowing . " However , since I take it from . . your letter that you are very important and also a punctilious observer of the social amenities , I shall assume the responsibility of breaking a universal rule and enclose a statement of the regulations concerning admission to the gallery of the Barnes Foundation . The rule I break in sending this information is that the card is sent only to those persons who enclose a stamped envelope for reply . " The card said : " Admission to the gallery is restricted to students enrolled in the classes . " Twentieth-Century Shangri-La B ARNES , like Bernard Shaw , has made capital out of rudeness , but Barnes has a Sunday punch that Shaw was never able to extract from a vegetable diet . Barnes reserves his Sunday punch to tear the stuffing out of the more  --  to him  --  overatuffed shirts . A murderous performance was his handling of George Biddle , the artist , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington and is a member of the Biddle clan of Philadelphia . Biddle wrote to Barnes in June , 1940 , and was met with the doctor 's considered opinion that Biddle was a whose paint-ings stank . Barnes said he expected to be sued for his reply , but Biddle did nothing about it . The doctor , however , preferred not to have the Post publish his vituperative letter . Biddle is a brother of Francis Biddle , Attorney General of the United States , at that time Solicitor General . The Barnes Foundation is a $500,000 palace built out of cream-colored limestone imported from France . It is set in a twelve-acre tract containing some of the rarest trees and shrubs in the United States . A tall iron-spiked fence encircles the grounds protectively . It is a walled-in little universe . Barnes is hardly the type to be a Grand Lama of this twentieth-century Shangri-La . He resembles the late Warren G. Harding , a circumstance that embarrasses Barnes . He is heavy-set and muscular . He has silvery-gray hair , as well trimmed as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has an outdoorsy ruddiness . He has quick , penetrating dark eyes , and his chin is solid and belligerent . He always appears to be bursting at the seams with energy and walks with short , brisk steps . Assertive in manner , he arbitrarily conveys the impression of speaking the last word on whatever subject he 's talking about . In the pitch of controversy he is one of the phenomena of the age . He has been called " The Terrible-Tempered Dr. Barnes " ? a title he does n't think he merits . A neighbor once remarked , " Having him around , we know what the people of Pompeii went through when Vesuvius erupted . " Barnes ' dress , like his temperament , loudly contradicts the tranquillity of his Shangri-La . At home and about the grounds his favorite garb is a pair of bright-red Breton fisherman 's pants , a blue-and-redplaid shirt and a blouse . Sometimes he varies this by wearing bright blue Breton fisherman 's pants and a vivid red coat , or gray slacks , a lumberjack shirt , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressing up , which he does not oftener than once a month  --  and it must be for something extra special  --  Barnes will go to his wardrobe and try to decide which suit to put on . He has fifteen suits , all made by the same London tailor who formerly served the Duke of Windsor . For more than twenty-five years after Barnes became a millionaire , this gentleman 's outfitter turned him out in the height of fashion . Barnes is by nature bizarre and that is crystallized in his bizarre achievements . Everything he is , Barnes says , he owes to psychology . In his youth he became a disciple of the pragmatism of William James . Later he followed the teachings of John Dewey , the philosopher , who has developed and extended the James principles of being practical . When he was past forty and a multimillionaire , Barnes enrolled in Dewey 's seminar for graduate students at Columbia . Every week for three years Barnes went to New York and took his place in Dewey 's class with students half his age . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has not met Barnes ' equal for sheer brain power . Since Barnes lives scientifically , his approach to art is scientific . According to Barnes , art is simply an expression of everyday experience . He once adjudged Connie Mack the greatest artist that Philadelphia had ever produced , to the bewilderment of the veteran manager of the Athletics . Delivering a eulogy for a deceased fireman , Barnes said , " Charlie fought fires with his imagination . Charlie was an artist , " In Barnes ' theory the viewer of a picture must understand what the artist meant to put there before the viewer can enjoy the picture . This is in line with his crusade to take the swoon out of art . He was disgusted with the too-too-divine drool over art . He concluded that the droolers carried on this way because they did n't know what else to do . It is presumptuous , Barnes maintains , for the uninitiated to think that they can walk right up to a picture and say , " It 's beautiful ! " Without prior training in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture . In his book , The Art of Renoir , he says , " Most of the looking at pictures by those untrained to see , is a search for something to be recognized as already familiar from past experience ; it is to-tally unrelated to the experience which prompted the artist to make of the painting a record of what he saw and felt in his intercourse with a particular objective situation . . . . To have a landscape stir up the pleasant memory of a familiar scene , or a portrait that of a friend , is merely to recognize , not to perceive ; that is , to refresh one 's memory , not to grow in experience by increasing the value of what one already knows through perception of new relationship and values . Recognition , in other words , is seeking a resting place in the past instead of being alive to the present . . . . " Art appreciation , Barnes says , can be no more learned by an occasional afternoon in a gallery than surgery can be learned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . It must be learned through intelligent study . To teach it is the foundation 's aim . The foundation has approximately 200 students . They come from all over the United States . There are Jews , gentiles , Catholics , Protestants and Negroes . Only students of exceptional artistic ability who do not have jobs , or who do not have enough to live on , get financial aid amounting to as much as $100 a month . Before the war twelve or fourteen of the more promising students were sent to Europe each year for a summer of study with all expenses paid . " I like to help those who help them-se Iv es , " says Barnes . " That is the only thing I have in common with God . " In their four-year course at the foundation , the students are taught to examine a painting with the detachment of an automobile mechanic studying a crankshaft . They undertake a detailed analysis of the color , the line and the form , rather than a mere beholding of the subject matter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nude , or a cottage by a waterfall . In teaching matter-of-factness in art , in stripping it of the emotional bunk with which the long-haired phonies and that fading class of egoists , the " art patrons , " have encumbered it , Barnes feels he is helping to give art back to the people as something to be looked at with the naked eye , not through a lorgnette . " Art , " Barnes says , " is no device for the entertainment of the dilettante or upholstery for the houses of the wealthy , but a source of insight into the world for which there can be no substitute , and in which all persons who have the necessary insight may share . " And it is because he thinks the public does not have that necessary insight 94 that he bars it from his gallery . He believes this sincerely . Many , however , unabletoreconcile Barnes ' boycott with his flaunting of democracy , attribute his exclusiveness to sheer cussedness . Taxpayers particularly claim a denial of rights . They assert they have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he does not pay taxes on the foundation property . The Supreme Court of Pennsylvania upheld his contention that the foundation is an educational institution , not a private gallery , and ruled that it was within his discretion who , if anyone , should be admitted . Barnes sees the thing as wholly a matter of principle . For all he cares about the money , he says , he would give it to the cop on the corner , if that would serve any purpose . He says he spends $200,000 a year operating the foundation , whereas his taxes would amount to a mere $7500 . " And they call me a tax dodger , " he fumes . Some years ago , as an experiment , the doctor opened his gallery to the public one day each week . The result drove him mad . His holy of holies was overrun with emotional drunks . An analysis of the aesthetically hooched masses he found on his hands disclosed that the average art-gallery devotee 's dominant reaction upon viewing a picture was to gush . " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mere explosion of disembodied feelings  --  the ghost of experience wandering in an alien world of material objects . " When Barnes is reminded that most collectors like to show off their artistic possessions , he argues that they are prompted to do so only by egotism and misguided sentimentalism . He is alert to the importance of being different . Americans who are pretty vague about the art in the Barnes collection have heard that nobody can get in to see it , and so they yearn and plead to be allowed in the forbidden paradise . Barnes gets malicious fun out of this . He is aware of the honor it is his to award . The few upon whom he bestows his blessing instinctively feel better than their fellows . Ghost for a Day Apart from genuine apprentices at the art trade , there are perhaps a dozen scholars , actors and writers , ranging from Dr. Albert Einstein to Katharine Cornell , whom Barnes will admit any time they care to come . He never admits newspaper or magazine art critics , having a low estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to socialites . They continue to try , however . Whenever they have an out-of-town guest whom they are eager to impress , they pester Barnes to let them in . " Take your guest to the movies , " he will thunder ; " you can probably understand the movies . " He thinks he was truly inspired in administering a brush-off to one Philadelphia dowager who arrived at the foundation with a visiting friend . Barnes happened to be looking out the window and saw them . He gave rapid instructions to an assistant named Dora . So when the huge steel door of the gallery swung open , there was Dora , dabbing at her eyes with a handkerchief . " Will you please ask Doctor Barnes ? " the dowager began . Dora broke into loud weeping . " Doctor Barnes , " she sobbed , " has just died . " The rambunctious Barnes moves constantly in an atmosphere of beauty THE SATURDAY and good taste . Renoir 's son , Jean Renoir , the motion-picture director , now in this country , dedicated his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , Barnes " has assembled in his famous collection . all the most beautiful things in the world . " Barnes can wander through his gallery , full of incomparable art . Or he can go a few blocks away to his museum of early American furniture , where he has his offices . Or he can drive some twenty miles to Ker-Feal , his 166-yearold farmhouse , which he has furnished also entirely with antiques . The name " Ker-Feal " is Breton dialect meaning broadly , Fidele 's House . " It 's my doghouse , " says Barnes . Barnes and his wife live in an unpretentious home adjoining the gallery at the foundation . Mrs. Barnes , a gentle little woman , is the former Laura Leggett , of Brooklyn , whose father founded the Leggett wholesale-grocery firm . She and Barnes were married in 1901 , the year before he perfected Argyrol . They met in 1900 , soon after Barnes had returned from Heidelberg and was working on his Argyrol experiment . Barnes ' scientific daily routine begins at exactly six A.M. , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Raymond Gram Swing 's broadcast at ten P.M. , when he goes to bed . A spare breakfast follows his morning hike . Then he goes to his offices and swings into the day 's mail . Most of the letters are requests to see the pictures . Barnes will answer only the ones he deems worthy of his scorn . He starts pacing the floor . When he is sufficiently warmed up he summons one of his three secretaries , and proceeds to dictate phrases packed with assault and battery or chilling whimsey . Some of Barnes ' letters put a strain on the postal laws . He reached the EVENING POST ultimate in vitriol in a letter to Henry Luce , the publisher , whom Barnes accused of " playing horse " with his name in the pages of Time . Barnes concluded his generally unprintable expostulation with this : " My sending this letter to you by mail attests my readiness to have the dirt properly washed out ; you can manifest the same spirit by simply turning this letter over to the United States District Attorney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never been sued or haled into court on account of his pen poisonings . " It 's a miracle I have n't gone to jail for life , " he says , seriously . He eats lunch at his offices with his secretaries . Theysit at a table more than 100 years old . The menu is always the same  --  orange juice , salad and toast . In the afternoon Barnes will drop in at the gallery . To outsiders the Barnes Foundation is an austere place of mystery . Actually it is quite easygoing . Barnes himself , despite his reputation as an ogre , is , inside his Shangri-La , unassuming , sensitive , even shy . He is deadly serious about his work in art ; he is as touchy about criticism of it as an actor . But he has a sense of humor about himself . That he is regarded as eccentric amuses him . He is happiest in the company of the workmen  --  janitors , gardeners , laborers . Jim , an elderly Negro handy man , is one of Barnes ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think better than I can , " Barnes says . The exactitude of Barnes ' daily schedule reaches its climax at 5:40 P.M. At that moment he has his first drink of the day . All his whisky is pre-World War I. He has a stock of seven brands , one for each day of the week . His cellar has a bank-vault door , opened by a combination . There are shelves upon shelves around all four walls , March 21,1942 laden with vintage champagne , aged brandy and the whiskies . To some heretics Barnes ' collection of liquor is more soul-stirring than his collection of art . After Mrs. Barnes sets out the whisky for her husband , a maid appears with a tray . On the tray are two bottles of French mineral water and a measuring glass . Barnes pours out precisely an ounce and a half of whisky , then precisely two ounces of water , as carefully as a druggist filling a prescription . Scientific experiments have demonstrated to him that these are the most effective proportions , . he says . Between 5:40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he and Mrs. Barnes , with Fidele , will go in to dinner . He resents any suggestion that his food is French cuisine ; it is , he says , plain American chuck . With his meat course he sometimes has a bottle of Bordeaux . Once Charles Prendergast , the American wood sculptor , disparaged Barnes ' rare wine , saying that he had bought better in Italy for a few lire . " You 're the biggest damn fool I 've ever met ! " roared Barnes . " You 're worse than that ! You 're a barbarian ! " He did n't speak to Prendergast for two years . Merion Midas Barnes is an epicure , but in his reasoning that is not inconsistent with his being one of the common folk . " I 'm a true Communist , " he declared at a dinner in Paris , celebrating his becoming an Officer in the Legion of Honor . He had been made a Chevalier of the Legion in 1926 under the personal sponsorship of Aristide Briand . " Yes , my friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communist spirit . Let me explain : I do not think that I should have to make a place at my table for an ignorant truck driver . But I think that the truck driver should have the opportunity to be so educated in the amenities of good living that if he were to sit at my table he would know how to appreciate the fine food and fine wines and to participate in the dinner conversation . " It was neatly done , especially as Barnes is a hater of the Stalinist ideology . Barnes ' political philosophy is not influenced by his wealth . Money means nothing to him , he protests . He ca n't come to grips with it , he explains , because in his youth he never had enough money and after he became rich he had too much . He has , he says , only the vaguest idea how much money he has . All his finances are handled for him by a veteran employee , Miss Nelle Mullen . She began at the A. C. Barnes Company , sealing envelopes at eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , noticed in Miss Mullen the talents of an executive . He raised her salary to $15,000 a year and turned the management of the company over to her . Barnes sold the A. C. Barnes Company to the Zonite Products Corporation in 1929 for $6,000,000 . The details were settled by Miss Mullen . Barnes was unconcernedly in Paris , writing a book on French primitives in art . John Dewey is his closest friend and the only man he calls master . He makes few important decisions without asking Dewey 's advice . He once said to the gentle , eighty-two-year-old philosopher , " Jack , do you know why I like you ? It 's because you remind i me of a bartender I used to know . " Barnes , who can discuss scholarly ideas in the hairy-chested vernacular of the baseball diamond , addresses Dewey like a public meeting . But the philosopher stands his ground . In the heat of philosophical debate they swear loudly at each other . Now and then , Ambassador Bullitt , or Supreme Court Justice Owen J. Roberts , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teacher at the foundation , will come to dinner . Barnes serves his best champagne on these occasions , but he wo n't dress up . The Barneses go out socially not more than two or three times a year . In the past year they have accepted dinner invitations just twice  --  to the homes of Justice Roberts and Ambassador Bullitt . But Barnes never misses a get-together of the local fire department  --  of which he is honorary chief  --  unless the affair happens to come on a night when Charlie McCarthy , Barnes ' real hero , is on the radio . " The firemen are my kind , " he says . Some of Barnes ' friends have suggested that his palling around with the fire department has a bit of scientific forethought in it because of a dangerous little habit he has . After lighting a cigarette , he builds a fire in the ash tray by piling other matches on the lighted match . Then , with rapt attention , he watches it burn . his that he was persuaded to become an amateur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inherited . The male Barneses have participated in whatever war happened to be then in progress , including the American Revolution . Barnes ' father lost an arm at Cold Harbor , and his taste for the fray never abated . When he was eighty , the one-armed warrior took exception to a remark of a young plumber fixing some pipes in the B arneskitchen . He knocked the plumber down . Barnes alone was not able to maintain the family military record . He tried to enlist for the Spanish-American War , but was rejected because of defective eyesight . Before the Civil War , Barnes ' father was a butcher , and Barnes likes to tell how his father worked side by side in a slaughterhouse with the first P. A. B. Widener , later the founder of the great Widener trolley-line fortune . Joseph E. Widener , son of " Old Pete , " would as soon the world did n't recall his father 's slaughterhouse career . This was the background against which the famous Bathers battle was fought a few years ago . The Widener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe . The son , cold and haughty , never cared much for business , but he did take an interest in pictures , and added to and revised the Widener gallery . In 1937 Joe was commissioned to purchase a painting for the Philadelphia Museum . He went to Europe and , although the Widener art is almost solidly old masters , he returned with a painting by one of the moderns , Cezanne 's Bathers , for which he had paid $110,000 . With fanfare the museum acquisition was announced . The newspapers mentioned , quite incidentally , that another Cezanne Bathers was at the Barnes Foundation , but that this was a " smaller picture , a second version . " Barnes boiled over , for he takes pride in the fact that he owns the best of Channe 's works . He was n't too incensed , however , to realize that this was a golden opportunity for Barnes , the crusader . Writing to officials of the museum  --  to which he was in the habit of referring as " a house of artistic prostitution " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rectified . He told the museum people that while Joe Widener might know something about horses , " he is a boob when it comes to talking about and buying pictures . " He decried the evil of " an absentee dictator of the official art situation who functions principally at the race tracks of Miami , Saratoga and Deauville . " In a final outburst Barnes said , " I say to hell with Widener 's supposed power and prestige . " Barnes then sent a statement to the newspapers that the museum Bathers was a fifth-rate Cezanne that had been kicking around Paris and , in fact , been offered to him for $50,000 . Widener withdrew even farther into the cool sanctuary of Lynnewood Hall , the American Versailles , which is his home . The Widener butler said , " Mr. Widener is busily engaged . " The sequel was one of the memorable events in Barnes ' life . On a trip to Europe a few months later , he found his deck chair was next to Widener 's . Barnes would n't , he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Rembrandts . Widener was equally stubborn . Neither spoke during the voyage . " We just sat there , side by side , a couple of millionaires on the luxury liner Normandie , " says Barnes , " just as his old man and my old man had once worked , side by side , in a slaughterhouse . " In his youth Barnes got ten dollars a game playing for semipro baseball teams . In school he was proficient in chemistry , and was soon able to add to his income by tutoring . With this money plus his baseball earnings , Barnes paid his way through medical school . He insists that he learned more on the baseball diamond than in any university . Baseball taught him quick perception and the ability to see the relation of things . " And that , " he says , " is thinking . " Barnes recalls smugly that most of his cronies in his baseball days were either crooks or bartenders . He still likes the company of bartenders . While he does not knowingly associate with crooks any longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal  --  a kind of adult variation of cops and robbers . His playmate in this make-believe is Charles Laughton . When the actor comes East he always stops off to visit Barnes . Occasionally Barnes goes on to New York with him . Climbing into a taxicab at the station , they tell the driver to take them to the Hotel Gotham . They amuse themselves by assuming a hunted look and mouthing gangster talk . After he got his M.D. from Penn in 1892 , Barnes , who never has practiced medicine , was resident physician for a year at an insane asylum upstate , so he could study abnormal psychology . There he picked up spending money by applying normal psychology to crap-shooting with the interns , who , until then , did n't know that dice cared one way or another about psychology .
