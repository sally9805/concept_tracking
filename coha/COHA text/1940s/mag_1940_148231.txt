Last week , over Manhattan 's WABC , the Grace Line turned radio sponsor to launch an installment plan-a twelve-day , $250 Caribbean cruise , including hotels &; motor trips ashore , was offered for $25 down ( before sailing time ) , the rest in ten monthly payments . Sailing : every Friday . Object : to entice the war-marooned U. S. cruise trade off the beach . <P> In more piping times , Grace Line might have chosen for its radio debut travel-folder travelogues and bump Carib rhythms . But for 1940 audiences , it picked CBS News Analyst Elmer Davis for three 15-minute chats each week on the news of the day . Grace Line did not ask its broadcaster to pretend that there is no war at sea . In his broadcasts last week Davis reported a couple of sinkings , all the home-water problems involved in the Navy 's proposed new five-year ship building program ( see p. 77 ) . These mat ters served more clearly to point up Grace Line 's sales talk : the contrasting security of Western Hemisphere waters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for about two minutes of each program to tell of the bright , balmy , beckoning Caribbean , plug Grace Line 's bargain offer . <P> The voice to which Grace Line has entrusted the delicate job of giving its prospects the news without scaring them irrevocably off the high seas indulges in no huffing &; puffing , no pedantics , just tells it straight , like any well-informed guy reassuringly named Elmer . But 50-year-old , Indiana-born Elmer Davis , a onetime Rhodes Scholar , star of a booming decade ( 1914-24 ) on the New York Times , fictioneer and political pundit , has much more than a safe- &-sane,; down-home twang . In his ten years on the Times he rose swiftly from cub to something approaching an Elder Statesman , writing editorials , roving Europe , handling extra-special news stories , enjoying a leeway few Times reporters have had in the news columns . <P> He attained much of this freedom by creating , during the 1920 Democratic convention in San Francisco , a disputatious Jeffersonian character named Godfrey Gloom , honorary sergeant at arms from Amity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature , but the Times editoriat liked him . They kept sending him to conventions for 16 years , summoning Davis back from free-lancing to keep Godfrey on the record . After the 1936 Democratic convention , Davis killed off his aging Jeffersonian , interring Jeffersonianism along with his bones , and no less a Times bigwig than Washington Correspondent Arthur Krock wrote his obituary . <P> CBS engaged Davis last summer , when the approaching war found its ace , H. V. Kaltenborn , in Europe . Now , with his commercial program three times a week and daily breakfast-time and post-dinner broadcasts for CBS , he pockets $900 a week . Tall , well-proportioned and active-looking , Elmer Davis wears grey or pepper- &-salt; suits to match his grey hair , looks very un-Elmer-like except for his invariable little black bow ties . Many consider him a dead ringer for handsome Hoosier Paul V. McNutt , but Elmer Davis , turning 50 last week , saw another resemblance . Said he : " Now people think I look more like Cordell Hull .
