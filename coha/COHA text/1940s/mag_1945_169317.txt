With victory in Europe , men turned their eyes to UNRRA . What had this unwieldy , $2,000,000,000 United Nations Relief &; Rehabilitation Administration accomplished to date ? And what would it do now ? The answer to the first question was : not much . The answer to the second UNRRA began to write last week . <P> UNRRA , despite its international character , is predominantly American . The U.S. contributed the lion 's share ( 40% ) of its funds . Its main office is in Washington , in a converted apartment building on Du Pont Circle . Its director general is an American : balding , easygoing Herbert H. Lehman , onetime Governor of New York . <P> Thus , while any future success of UNRRA may possibly be credited to international cooperation , its failures will almost surely be laid at the door of the U.S. And in its 18 months of existence , UNRRA has been called a failure numberless times , by friends and enemies alike . <P> It has not yet been a complete failure . But to date it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away at its enormous problem . Its record : <P> Greece . On April 1 , UNRRA took over the overall relief job from the British military . Some 250 UNRRA personnel are at work in Greece . <P> Yugoslavia . UNRRA took over the relief job on April 15 , under an agreement with the Tito government . Work done so far : negligible . Controller : Tito . <P> Middle East . UNRRA camps in the Middle East are now caring for 100,000 displaced Greeks , Yugoslavs and Poles . Of these , some 43,000 will be repatriated as soon as ships are available , possibly within the next four months . The rest do not want to go back home . <P> Poland and Czechoslovakia . The first shipment of supplies for Poland and Czechoslovakia-10,000 tons-has arrived at a Black Sea port . Control of distribution : Russian . <P> Italy . Supplies averaging about 15,000 tons monthly are arriving in Italy-to supplement the deficient diet of 2,000,000 mothers and children . The program is operated by 200 UNRRA workers . <P> Western Europe . Very limited quantities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sugar , salt , etc. ) have been shipped into France , Belgium and The Netherlands . But since all three of these nations are " paying " countries in the UNRRA pool , they will receive no regular UNRRA supplies . Some 60 UNRRA teams of 13 workers each are now in Western Europe , helping to repatriate foreign workers . UNRRA does not feed the displaced persons ( the U.S. Army does that ) . <P> What 's Missing ? Considering the fanfare with which UNRRA was begun , and the vastness of its treasury , this record is small potatoes . One thing UNRRA does not lack is cash . But it woefully lacks : 1 ) prestige , 2 ) management , 3 ) efficient personnel . <P> As long as the war was on in Europe , UNRRA was the rankest stepchild at the combined United Nations food- &-supply; table . It got only what the military and Lend-Lease did not want , and it had to fight to get that . Its allocations from the various combined boards in Washington were merely " hunting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find it lying around loose . <P> The military snubbed UNRRA : not until last November did General Eisenhower sign an agreement permitting it to come into liberated areas . The Russians cared little for it either-unless they could control it .
