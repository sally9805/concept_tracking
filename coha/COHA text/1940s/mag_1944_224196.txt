In the vast plain , of Honan , gaunt Chinese farmers watched the enemy tanks crush their fat grain , watched the enemy horsemen feed their mounts on ripe wheat . <P> Angrily they said : " Ai-ah , last year the famine ; now the Jih-pen Kwei " - the Japanese devil . <P> Japanese tanks scooted along the dusty country roads like beetles . Behind them came cavalry columns , motorized troops , supply trains , artillery . The dust they raised made it plain that this was no usual spring raid . This time it was a full-scale offensive , and it seemed to fit snugly into the Tokyo pattern of global war . <P> What Can China Do ? The Chinese fell back rapidly . Chungking admitted retreat . Tokyo claimed that ten Chinese divisions had been trapped . Busy towns fell one after another . Loyang , where the emperors of the Chou dynasty held court seven centuries before Christ , was ablaze . At any moment the Japanese wedge , if pushed westward , might cut Chungking off from any contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do little . The Japanese thrust into India had cut down the already thin trickle of supplies to the U.S. Fourteenth Air Force in China . Acute shortage of trucks to move fuel and ammunition made it nearly impossible to set up air bases close to the new front or to give adequate supply to front-line troops . <P> Distressing , too , was the state of the Chinese Army in the 82nd grueling month of its war with Japan . Poorly clothed and fed , poorly trained and armed , it was no match for the Japanese war machine . <P> Japan 's first blow in mid-April fell on tough , little Tang En-po , one of Chung king 's ablest generals . But Tang 's tactical skill could not make up for the inadequate weapons of his men , for the lack of air cover , for the incredibly meager trans port facilities . <P> Target : Roadbeds . On the map of battle , Tokyo 's first objective now be gan to assume shape : full control of the Peiping-Hankow railway . In 1938 , the Chinese breached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize ; last week , Japanese columns driving from north and south seemed to be close to attaining it . <P> Little remained of that railway but the pitted roadbed ; the rails had been removed by the cautious Chinese . But intelligence reports now showed that the Japanese had dismantled other , less useful railroads , had carted the rails to Sinyang-presumably to be used in retracking the wrecked sections . <P> To cushion the new line against pressure from the west , the Japanese seemed also to be building a defense belt beyond the railroad . There was a worse , though still remote possibility : from Loyang , the Japanese might try to push on westward through the famed Tungkwan mountain pass , spill into the loess plain of Shansi . Then even China 's truck roads to Russia would be in peril . <P> This week Chungking gloomily predicted that once the Peiping-Hankow line was in use , a new drive would be launched to seize the stretch from Hankow to Canton . The day that line is captured-and repaired-Japan will be able to rush men and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her Asiatic fortress .
