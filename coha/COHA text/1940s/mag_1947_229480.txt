TIME , whose four international editions are now available almost anywhere in the world ( except Soviet Russia , her satellites , and some other inaccessible places ) on or before issue date , is , as you know , a journal of U.S. and world affairs written from the American viewpoint . Recently , Hans Bronkhorst , a Dutch journalist , set down his view of TIME for readers of The Netherlands weekly , De Linie . The following excerpts from it may interest you : <P> " Besides plastic combs and nylon stockings America also sends us many thick , colorful weeklies . The one . . . best known here is the magazine TIME . Since the Dutch press is still fighting the paper shortage and therefore can not keep us well enough informed , many look for additional news in the columns of this attractive magazine . . . . <P> " TIME is a ' weekly newsmagazine .

The edition which we get to read here is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original American edition and usually obtainable here exactly on the Monday that the issue is dated . . . The only other periodical that reaches us in a similar way is the daily New York Herald Tribune 's European edition , not identical in content to the original edition . . . . <P> " The factual trustworthiness of TIME 's content is rather great , even though here , in spite of all kinds of precautions , mistakes are still made . . . .

' America is a democratic country ; it is governed by the people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seems to say on every page . . . But this democracy can only stand fast by the grace of freedom , the safeguard for world peace . Therefore , TIME continually illuminates ( as does the majority of the outstanding American press ) the inroads being made by Communism on this human right . TIME 's tone toward Soviet Russia and her sphere of influence is now ironic , now reserved , now protesting , but not well wishing . Just as critical a stand is taken against the remaining utterances of fascism in Spain , Portugal , Argentina , Germany and America ( the Ku Klux Klan , etc . ) . TIME stands for religious freedom . . . . <P> " It also complements the news , whereby it is taken for granted that one keeps up somewhat with the daily papers ( here , American readers have an advantage ) . In addition , it gives later published facts about subjects that are in the center of the news , thus being able to bring off a good , all-round article about an event which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( e.g. , the Pearl Harbor scandal ) .
