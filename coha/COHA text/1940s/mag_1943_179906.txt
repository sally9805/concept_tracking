The barbaric American custom of drinking water with meals washed up to the House of Commons last week . Craggy , grey-haired M.P . Eleanor Rathbone and American-born Lady Astor protested that U.S. soldiers were being denied water by British waiters ( who , like all European waiters , spring from a line of camels and believe it is sacrilege to mix water and food at the same time ) . U.S. soldiers , said M.P . Eleanor , were being forced to order mineral waters and beer with their meals . The Government pondered the case , passed it off lightly by noting that British beer is now so watered down that many consider it no more than water anyway .
