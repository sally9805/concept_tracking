Des Moines , surrounded by Iowa 's fabulous black loam , is in the heart of U.S. farm country . There last week Elder Statesman Herbert Hoover , talking to the nation and twelve members of the Midwest Governors ' Conference , got quickly to the heart of the U.S. farm problem . <P> Said Herbert Hoover : " Of the different sectors of the home front , food is the greatest . It stands next to the military effort in importance . . . . Agriculture must rank with munitions . . . . <P> " Yet there are symptoms of a dangerously degenerating agriculture that must be stopped . . . . We have today at work in America uncanny parallels with the same degenerative forces that have been so disastrous in Europe . Like them , we have drawn undue manpower from the farms . . . . Our farm machinery is wearing out faster than the replacement . . . . Our protein feed for animals is very short . We are compelled to divert our nitrate fertilizers to explosives . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and distribution . And prices are often below the farmer 's cost and just wages . <P> " If we wanted any further evidence of this degeneration we can find it in the despair that leads to auction sales and in the abandonment of farms . We can find it in the undue killing of dairy cattle . We can find it in the shops without supplies for the housewife for days at a time . We can find it in local famines of meat or butter or potatoes or something else . We can find it in the epidemic of black markets all over the country . . . . " <P> 10,000,000 Acres . Yet , said Herbert Hoover , " there is no cause for alarm provided we set about remedy , and quickly . " He repeated his recommendations for better food administration , simpler price controls ( TIME , Feb. 1 ) . And he concluded with one real justification for optimism : <P> " There can be no doubt that the men &; women remaining on the farms are putting forth the absolutely maximum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 72-hour week at wages less than any other group . They are showing the highest courage and fortitude . But there are things that can not be remedied by them alone . " <P> Four days later came statistical documentation of Herbert Hoover 's tribute to the farmer . In Washington the Agriculture Department issued its annual spring planting forecast , based on reports from farmers all over the country . The figures were astonishing to the point of a 20th-century miracle : despite their troubles , despite bureaucrats , hell &; high water , farmers will plant 279,000,000 acres-10,000,000 more than last year . They will plant 20% more peas and beans ( good meat substitutes ) , 10% more soybeans , 21% more peanuts and flaxseed for oils , 14% more potatoes , 6% more corn to fatten their cattle and pigs . Food Administrator Claude Wickard had never dared hope for such figures . Nor had the nation .
