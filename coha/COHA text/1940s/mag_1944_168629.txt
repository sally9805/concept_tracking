Ever since the Japs ran him out of Burma nearly two years ago Lieut . General Joseph W. Stilwell has been on the hunt for enough troops and supplies to fight his way back. * News from Burma last week indicated that " Vinegar Joe " was making at least a small start in the land of names that sound like unpronounceable grunts . <P> To his divisions of Chinese , General Stilwell had finally managed to add at least part of a division of U.S. jungle-trained infantry under Brigadier General Frank Merrill ( see p. 30 ) . With the news that they were in action , also came news of a Chinese-American local victory . <P> New Ledo Road . Purpose of Uncle Joe Stilwell 's latest drive-460 miles northeast of Mountbatten 's southward push toward Akyab-is to march across northern Burma over some of the world 's cruelest , most miasmic terrain , clearing Japs from the path of the new Ledo Road which hopefully will connect with the old Burma Road . Thus eventually a route to China may be opened to supplement supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first week of the new attack General Stilwell 's troops did well . Total Japanese killed in the Walawbum-Maingkwan area were estimated at 2,000-800 by General Merrill 's marauding infantrymen , 700 by the Chinese 22nd and 38th divisions , 500 by Chinese-manned tanks under Colonel Rothwell H. Brown . Total Japanese dead in the Hukawng Valley by week 's end : 3,500 . <P> Fighting Chinese . Chinese and U.S. troops worked well together . Cabled TIME Correspondent James Shepley from the Burmese front : " The crack 18th Japanese division made three frantic attempts to cross the Nambyu River . . . . As the Japs poured into the stream in the cold light of the jungle winter moon the Americans mowed them down with machine-gun and rifle fire . At daybreak the river was swollen with 300 to 500 Jap bodies . Merrill lost seven killed , 37 wounded . . . . <P> " Anyone who still doubts the fighting ability of the Chinese troops ( now in their first truly offensive battle of the war ) did not see them at Maingkwan . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japs ' positions . <P> " The Japs counterattacked strongly two days and a night , but the Chinese beat them all off . When the Japs started to pull out the Chinese crawled through thick elephant grass within a few feet of the road and cut down the retreating column by scores . . . . <P> " The Chinese is the least complaining soldier I have ever seen . He carries tremendous loads over terrific distances . His greeting is almost always ' Ting hao ' ( ' Okay ' ) . <P> " At our bivouac area one night a Chinese sergeant found a sentry dozing . Next day he lined up all the sentries and turned on unshirted hell . ' We can have contempt for the Japs , ' he said . ' We can even be careless with our own people , but we can not fail our friends . ' " <P> * Once an officer on Stilwell 's boss Mountbatten 's staff rushed in : " Good news , General ! We 've got two expert planners coming from the Middle East . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get me two foot soldiers . "
