txt TRENTON , N. J. , May 26 ?

Mr. Dewey seemed a little piqued when he was asked by a reporter whether he would be willing to run in second place on a ticket headed by Senator Vandenberg . He declined to answer the question , saying he had answered it three weeks ago " categorically and definitely " in a radio interview . He referred the questioner to his executive assistant , James C.
