For nine bloody weeks the Allies have inched slowly up Italy 's shank , their progress slowed by mined roads , shattered bridges , fiercely resisting Germans in mountain emplacements . Last week the U.S. and British forces stepped up their attack , broke through the Germans ' strongest barrier below Rome . <P> That barrier consisted of a series of transverse ranges , stretching north eastward from Mount Massico on the Tyrrhenian coast , through Venafro and Isernia to Vasto on the Adriatic . No single engagement cracked this German line . The job was done in coordinated thrusts-the first by Lieut . General Mark Clark 's Fifth Army at Mount Massico , then one by General Sir Bernard Montgomery 's Eighth Army at Isernia , and another by General Clark 's men at Venafro . These break-throughs were followed by two smashes at the flanks . Vasto fell to the Eighth ; the Fifth probed into the Aurunci Mountains . <P> Before the Allies now lay parallel valleys . Entrenched on the mountains commanding these valleys were the Germans , still in excellent positions to delay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Clark 's Fifth Army , wound the Via Appia , most famous of all roads to Rome . Before the Eighth can think of Rome , it must hack up the Adriatic coast to Pescara.
