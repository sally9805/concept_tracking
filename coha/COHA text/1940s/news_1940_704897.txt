txt Just like the Republican delegates who checked out of Philadelphia about three weeks ago , the Democratic convention members are leaving this city fully conscious of the fact that are trying something new and different in politics , Both major parties have now named as their presidential candidates men who in normal times would have been left out of the picture by rule of thumb . 1 Of course .. in the case of the Democratic Party the outcome of the convention was no surprise . Technically the big question before the convention was answered for the first time just before adjournment late Thursday night when President Roosevelt accepted renomination . For many weeks the party has known that top place on the ticket for a third term race would be offered to him . The unenthusiastic , not to say rude , reception of a White House order to put Secretary of Agriculture Wallace in second place got a great deal of applause but the party leade ' know full well that this is a fairly unimportant , though briefly spectacular , matter . Tough Battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section of party opinion , the party knows it has a tough hada ahead of It . But the outcome does n't depend on the vice presidential candidate ? it depends on the ticket . One suspects that the mixed feelings of the delegates on the third term question , when they actually came , face to face with it , may be found elsewhere , too . The delegates who met ? here know full well the country 's reaction to it probably will be a vital element in ? the complex of political forces which will determine the outcome of the election next November . ? ** far as Mr. Wallace is concerned , by : the time they get home and get their thoughts collected the delegates who booed every mention ' of his name at Thursday 's night session will realize that when they drafted Mr. Roosevelt they placed the matter of selection of a running mate in his hands . In general , and as a matter of simply reporting facts as they are , the Democratic Party did n't get much of a " lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its leaders came here with much worry about next November on their minds , and this minority went away still worried ; but . as was surely the case with respect to the recent Republican convention , the conviction of having done the best thing in the circumstances may grow fast as the excitement and unpleasantness pertaining to a national party meeting are forgotten . That 's what in supposed to happen , and it usually does , Unknown Quantities In many ways , the forthcoming campaign will be unusual and interesting . Without disrespect , it can be asserted that the presidential tickets of both major parties are unknown quantities , politically , this year . While partisans of each man involved can make a strong a , gument for invincibility on the basis of known facts , obviously not all the facts are known and one of the two must be defeated next November , Willkie is a popular man , with a most engaging personality , but his vote getting power nearly four months hence can not be accurately estimated today , Mr. Roosevelt 's vote getting ability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President for a third term has never been placed before the electorate In the history of the nation . A good many political prophets will be go . Ing on vacations until this unprecedented puzzle becomes a bit clearer .
