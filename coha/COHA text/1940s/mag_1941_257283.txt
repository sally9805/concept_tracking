There was a number in the news last week which was easily mistakable for a first sign of rigor mortis : 148,038 . It appeared in the British Admiralty 's weekly confessional , representing the number of tons of merchant shipping lost by Britain in seven days ( see p. 77 ) . For only three weeks in the entire war had there been losses worse than 148,038 tons . This was more than twice the average weekly loss ( 63,342 tons ) , still more than twice the loss of the previous week ( 58,523 tons ) . <P> But to the resilient British , to those wonderfully tough-minded folk who saw a kind of victory in the horrible defeat at Dunkirk , there was no call for despair . There was more than ever a call for vigilance and sacrifice . But the British also found reasons to hope that the Battle of Britain might turn for the better . <P> Two knights of the realm and one baronet-Sir Arthur Salter , Sir Percy Noble , Sir Archibald Sinclair-personified this hope . <P> The long-range hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make a great difference ( see p. 26 ) . To arrange ways &; means for lending and leasing ships , Winston Churchill last week named Sir Arthur Salter to go at once to Washington . This envoy was peculiarly fitted to the emergency job : he is Parliamentary Secretary to the Shipping Ministry , during World War I was Chairman of the Allied Maritime Transport Executive ; has often visited the U. S. and last year married an American and a Washingtonian , Mrs. Ethel Bagg . <P> The interim hope , until U. S. aid began to tell , was the British Navy . Last week a job instead of a man got a promotion . The job : Commander in Chief of the Western Approaches of Britain , in charge of the Atlantic shipping lanes in general and in particular of Britain 's side of the Battle of the Atlantic . The man , who was not promoted but was entrusted with one of Britain 's hardest posts : Admiral Sir Percy Lockhart Harnam Noble , former Commander in Chief of the China Station . <P> Sir @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his 61 years , and he came out of World War I a Captain . Once a squash-courts pal of the Duke of Windsor , he is the possessor of a face which fancies somewhat " that little man with the mousetrap mouth , " Jellicoe of Jutland , of a sympathetic , discreet presence somewhere between the bedside manner of a family doctor and the last-testament-drafting manner of a family lawyer , and of a high reputation for naval alertness . <P> The immediate hope was the R. A. F. Last week Air Secretary Sir Archibald Sinclair told the House of Commons : " I can not conceal from the House my own belief that the war is about to enter a grimmer phase . It will be no easy task to defeat Nazi Germany , but it can and will be done , and my confidence is primarily based on the achievements of the R. A. F. and sister services . . . . " <P> Underlining Sir Archibald 's words , and making the Germans go in their cellars to think about the Lend-Lease Act , the R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it termed " heaviest yet " - on Berlin for the first time in 82 days , Hamburg , Cologne , the Ruhr , Kiel , Bremen . This week the Germans admitted that the North German Lloyd Liner Bremen was being consumed by a " fire of undetermined origin . " The R. A. F. thought it knew why .
