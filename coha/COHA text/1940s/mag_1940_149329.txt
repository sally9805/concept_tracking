Most white folks suppose that all colored folks are low class . Not so . U. S. Negroes " differ socially among themselves as far as the poles , " have at least six classes : lower-lower , upper-lower , lower-middle , middle-middle , upper-middle , upper . Upper-class Negroes describe their inferiors as " the common , ignorant sort of niggers . " It is his class , rather than his race , which determines a Negro 's behavior , personality , ambitions . <P> Basing their investigations on this fact , two sociologists-one white , one Negro-last week made a report on what it means to be born a Negro in the U. S. They had studied some 30 Negro adolescents of all classes in Natchez and New Orleans , summed up their findings in eight case studies ( Children of Bondage-American Council on Education , Washington , D. C. - $2.25 ) . <P> The authors were Dr. John Dollard , of Yale 's Institute of Human Relations , and Allison Davis , head of the social studies department at Dillard University , now lecturing at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper-class Negro , has degrees from Williams and Harvard , studied at the London School of Economics , won so many honors at Williams that he got a prize for winning prizes . <P> Authors Dollard &; Davis sketched in their background with a few statistics : e.g. , in Natchez the average Negro family 's income is less than $400 a year ; one child in three is a bastard . A Pullman porter rates as middle-middle class ; a family with $250 a month is upper-middle class ; more than three-fourths of Negroes are lower class ; a Negro 's social standing rises according to the lightness of his skin , the straightness of his hair .

" <P> Julia " will do anything-fight a man , curse a teacher , or kiss a boy in the schoolyard . " But she is sexually scared and she quit her husband as soon as she learned that her supposed pregnancy was only a stomachache . A golddigger , she says : " When you get a sucker , bump his head .
