In the town of Berea , Ohio , an elderly lady walked up to a student on the street last week and asked : " Are you the one ? " Harrison ( " Bones " ) Dillard , 24 , son of a day laborer , grinned . " Guess I am , " he replied . The old lady grabbed his hand and said that she was certainly glad to know him . <P> One of the few Negro students at Baldwin-Wallace College , Bones has been a campus celebrity for some time . Last year his fellow students raised $1,500 among themselves to set up a scholarship for his firstborn child ( if &; when he begins to raise a family ; he is still a bachelor ) . Bones 's fame has now spread far beyond the campus . A skinny 5 ft. 10 in. tall , he is the greatest high &; low hurdler who ever wore spikes . He holds nine world records at different distances , and is the safest bet the U.S. has for the Olympic Games in July . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) Spec Towns , who won the no-meters high hurdles in Berlin in 1936 , Bones drives hard into a hurdle . Towns used to float over them . A notoriously slow beginner , Towns seldom got into the race until he reached the third hurdle . Dillard believes that the first seven strides ( before taking the first hurdle in the 120 highs ) are all-important . Says he : " They say I am unorthodox . But I figure any form that gets you there fastest is orthodox form . " <P> At the start , Dillard sits in his blocks , then drops his head and looks at his right knee instead of the tape . It helps him to relax . He has an uncanny knack for anticipating the gun . Then it is seven steps and drive . He takes a tremendous ( 13 ft. 2 in. ) glide , the left leg cocked stiff and horizontal as it leads over the hurdle , the right knee up under his arm . When he is practicing , Bones concentrates on those first seven steps-developing speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was not invited to run in the traditional I.C.4-A . Championships at New York City 's Randalls Island Stadium ( his college is not a member ) , performed for the home folks . At Delaware , Ohio , he won three more races , stretching his record string of consecutive victories to 73 . Next month is graduation , and then the Olympics . After that Dillard would like to own a haberdashery . Says he : " I just like to be around good clothes . "
