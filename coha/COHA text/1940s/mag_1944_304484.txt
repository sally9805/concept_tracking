For Japs there was no longer protection from U.S. air power in distance . <P> They got the final proof last week when B-29 Superfortresses of the Twentieth U.S. Air Force bombed the great Palembang oil refineries in remote southeastern Sumatra in the longest-range air assault of the war . If the B-29s could reach Palembang they could reach anywhere in Japan 's homeland islands or in Greater East Asia . <P> For this mission , a " medium-sized " force of the great bombers flew from a base in the Southeast Asia Command near the equator , about 1,800 miles from the target . ( The only Allied fields meeting these specifications are on Ceylon . ) The blow was a bitter one for the Japs . Scorched by the Dutch , the refinery had been restored to something like its old capacity ( 18,000,000 barrels a year ) , reputedly was turning out aviation fuel as well as other petroleum products desperately needed by the enemy . Superfortressmen reported they had hit it fairly and squarely , thought it might take a year to put it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , from a base in China , another force of Superfortresses made the first incendiary raid on Japan . Target : Nagasaki . Flames spread like wildfire through its flimsy wood and paper buildings while demolition bombs thumped down among sea port , naval-station and manufacturing installations . <P> The B-29 crews took pains to make it a precision job . The big craft were over the city for an hour and a half . As at Palembang , bombermen reported antiaircraft fire and fighter opposition " weak to moderate . " Losses for both attacks : three B-29s missing . <P> Back to the Philippines . While Navy carrier-based aviation eased up its blistering pace the Empire was hit from both west and east by Army bombers in a foretaste of what was to come as new bases , now taken , were built up . For the first time since General MacArthur was evacuated from Mindanao to Australia , U.S. heavy bombers flew over the southern Philippines in force . Davao , principal seaport and military base of the southern Philippines , was attacked for three nights running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C. Kenney 's Liberators . <P> Far to the west , Major General L. Claire Chennault 's Liberators smashed at Japanese shipping on the Whangpoo near Shanghai . Northeast of the Philippines the Volcano Islands , halfway between the southern Marianas and Tokyo , were raided by Major General Willis Hale 's Liberators from new bases on Saipan . Hale 's Seventh Air Force heavies also smashed at the Bonins , still closer to Tokyo . From the north Aleutian-based bombers attacked the Kurils . <P> There was no peace for the Japs anywhere . The noose of aerial bombardment , from every point of the compass , was drawing tight .
