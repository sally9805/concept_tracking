The backbreaking burden of U.S. railroads is their mountain of fixed charges ( bond interest , equipment rentals , taxes , sinking fund requirements ) , a load greater than that of any other U.S. industry . Last week , the ICC released startling 1943 figures : for the first time in U.S. history , along with dividends and other income the railroads earned enough ( $596,228,149 ) in the first five months to pay fixed charges for the entire year . <P> This means that every dollar earned between June 1 and Dec. 31 , after payment of taxes and operating expenses , will be clear net profit . But railroad stockholders are still a long way from jingling the profits in their pockets . Still to be decided are wage demands of 1,350,000 operating and nonoperating rail employes . Possible cost : approximately $400,000,000 annually .
