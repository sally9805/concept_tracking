Since tight food rationing began last spring , the small Dixie Market in little Ypsilanti , Mich. ( 1940 pop . 12,000 ) , hard by the Willow Run bomber plant , has done a big city business . For 10 hours a day , seven clerks hustle to fill the grocery orders of the 4,000 customers who jam-pack the store every week . Yet the store has never collected a ration stamp from a customer . For the Dixie Market deals only in unrationed groceries . <P> The Dixie 's boss is bespectacled , pipe-smoking Raymond Erastus Hart , 47 . Smart Mr. Hart learned the grocery business while traveling about Michigan opening new stores for giant Kroger Grocery &; Baking Co . He also learned that the way of the small town independent grocer is hard , and decided to stay out until he had a saving trick up his sleeve . Last February , he cannily foresaw the strict rationing ahead , and guessed that coupon-confused housewives would give a rib-cracking welcome to an old-fashioned grocery store , where there was no such vexing thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ypsilanti and while studying the situation there ( 35 stores ) , he worked at Willow Run for two months . When rationing of canned goods and other foods turned many a small grocer into a coupon-counting insomniac , he launched his pointless store . He shrewdly stocked an 18-by-60-ft. store with hundreds of unrationed items , included " something almost as good " for all rationed foods . For butter and oleomargarine he had apple butter , honey and tomato preserves ; for meat , chicken and turkey a la king ( in glass jars ) , fish flakes , packaged spaghetti with cheese and tomato sauce ; dehydrated and powdered soups for canned . <P> The first week , the market grossed $800 , made a neat profit . Within a month coupon-weary housewives so jammed this pointless paradise that the gross zoomed to $1,500 . Now the market does a $2,000 weekly gross , has brought Hart many offers to expand . Last week , he turned them all down . He feels that more stores would keep him too busy , give him little time to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow grocers , sore-eyed , weary-fingered , thumbing over hundreds of stamps through the nights .
