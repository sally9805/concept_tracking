 | " Oh Sam ! " He stopped . He saw she had been crying . " Sam , wait ! " she said . " Please wait " She began to cry again while she was speaking . He waited , embarrassed and uncomfortable . He had never felt he knew Madge very well . She had always seemed to him completely grown up , and he thought of her now as approaching middle age  - -  almost through with life in fact . " I do n't suppose you 'll understand ? " She sat down , sighing wearily , in her mother 's chair beside the sewing basket . " But I have to talk to someone . I 'm so unhappy , Sam  --  so terribly unhappy . " And she told him in tired , disconnected phrases what he had long since suspected ? they were in love , she and Mister Price  --  the best and kindest man she 'd ever known , the only man she 'd ever cared for , or had ever cared for her . He had asked to marry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had told him that she could n't " I do n't see why , " Sam said . It was passing through his mind that love could n't be important to Madge and Mr. Price , could n't really matter as it would to someone younger  --  to himself and Eileen Wyatt , for example . " You do n't ? " She smiled wanly through her tears . " No , I do n't suppose you do , Sam . " She explained that Mr. Price was poor , almost as poor as they were . He had to teach a country school so that he could save the money to continue on at college . He had a brilliant mind and some day in the future he would be a famous man , a professor probably in some great university  --  if nothing interfered to hold him back from the goal he had in sight . She paused and Went on drearily . She had hoped to earn her living as a teacher , to help him and to go on at his side until the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible . " I do n't see why , " Sam said . " You do n't ! ? And who 'd keep house for you and Pa and Nelly ? " " Well , shucks ? " He scuffed his toe against the floor . " I guess we 'd get along . " " How , Sam ? - Just tell me how. ? The cooking , and the sewing- " She pointed to the basket . " That 's what we 've lived on all our lives the sewing that Mom did . " " Kelly- " he ventured doubtfully . " Oh , Sam ! " She shook her head reproachfully . " Nelly 's like a child , and she hates to cook or sew . She ca n't even stitch a hem and keep it straight . " " Well , she could learn- " But he knew this was silly when he said it . Nelly would blithely undertake anything on earth , but that would be  | the end of it . She 'd forget it in a moment in pursuit of something else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't even keep up with it myself  --  ca n't do the things Mom did . Every woman in the town wanted her to make their dresses , but I 'm not as good as she was and they know it . " " Aw , you 're all right , " he said . " Sam , dear ? " She hesitated . " I hate to burden you  --  to put things on your shoulders at your age , but I have to talk to someone and there 's just nobody else ? " " Well , what ? " he said . " Things ca n't go on like this . " " Like what ? " " I ca n't make both ends meet . I just ca n't do it , Sam . " " Oh ? " He stared at her , half comprehending . " We have n't got a penny in the house  --  have n't got the food we need . " " Oh ? " He was groping for an answer . " But we always get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , Pa gets paid for being Marshal . " " Not enough to keep us , Sam . " " Oh ? " He nodded dully ; " Mom worked and scrimped and saved  --  that 's how we got along . " She hurried on , explaining there were bills that had piled up while their mother had been ill for food , and for medicines and such things ? and Dr. Bentley 's bill , though he never mentioned it , and quite likely did n't care how long he had to wait  --  and for the funeral too , that was n't paid . No one was pressing them , and that was not the point . The bills were bad enough , but they could wait-though wait for what ? ? She spread her hands out helplessly . " But I ca n't make both ends meet ? right now , from day to day . " " I guess ? " He was thinking very hard . " I guess maybe Pa ought to get another job  --  one that would pay him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I do n't know ? " He could hear his ' father snoring in the bedroom , and he had no confidence in what he said . " Maybe if you talked to him about it ? " " I 've done that , Sam . " " And he could n't think of anything ? " She shook her head .  | " Oh ? " He was silent for a while , turning the problem in his mind . At last he said , " I guess I better quit going to school ? " " Oh , Sam ! " She began to cry again . " Mom would n't want you to do that . " " No  --  well ? " He was thinking suddenly that he would be glad to quit . He had had no heart in school since Eileen went away . " I guess Mom would n't mind . She 'd understand about it . " " What would you do ? " " I 'll go back to work for Clem . " " Oh , Sam ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've only started high school . " " I 'm fifteen , " he asserted . " And high school 's not so much . I can save a lot of time by quitting now . " Ile was thinking to himself : when old hh Neill was finished school he 'd be far ahead of him  --  maybe richer than the Wyatts . And he was calculating ? " Clem 's been paying me three dollars  --  that 's the way we figured it , but perhaps he 'd give me four ? or three-fifty anyway . I 'm more experienced now . " He looked up anxiously . " Would  --  would that make both ends meet ? " " I think so  --  yes ? " She nodded , struggling with a sense of guilt . " Well , I guess that fixes it . " " But  --  I do n't know if I ought to let you , Sam ? ? I do n't know what to say ? " " Shucks , I do n't mind . " He laughed . " I 'd sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Pa wo n't like it ? " " Pa ? " Ile turned the question in his mind . " Aw , he wo n't care . I 'll go see Clem tomorrow . " I le started toward the stairs and paused . " Say , Madge  --  " " Yes , Sam ? " " Will this fix it so you can ? " He hesitated , sculling with his toe . " So I can what ? " " You know  --  I mean , so you can marry Mr. Price ? " " Oh ! " She started , smiling wanly . " Sometime perhaps . " " But I mean  --  now , " he urged . " That 's what you want to do . " " We 'll see about it , dear . Do n't you worry about that . " " Well  --  good night , Madge . " " Good night , Sam . " And thus was a great decision made . He went to work for Clem , six days a week , from seven in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saturdays when the  | farmers were in town . And he started at four dollars  --  about six cents an hour  --  which was somewhat higher than the customary scale for young fellows starting out , but Clem said he was worth it . Jim made no objection . Nelly was disturbed and then rather pleased about it . She quickly saw his point , that getting started now would put him way ahead of Mike and Mitch and Grover  --  even of Neill Wyatt . Her imagination galloped . She saw him already as a rich , successful man living in a mansion in a fabulous city like Chicago or New York , with a red painted dogcart always waiting at the door , and a coachman in a livery ; and she saw herself arriving for a visit in a trailing purple dress and a hat with cherries on it , and possibly a muff of ermine or chinchilla , for by now of course she was rich and famous too , perhaps an opera singer  --  she had a pretty voice and was singing in the choir  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had read about , who could make you laugh and cry in the same breath . Her enthusiasm mounted ; she confided the idea " Shucks ! " Sam was shocked . " You 'd never go and do a thing like that ! " " Why not ? " " Well , you ought to know what actresses are like . " " I do n't . They 're no such thing . " " Mom would n't want you to . " " Well ? " She compromised . " ? an opera singer then . " " Aw , shucks ? " he said disgustedly . But he let it go at that . He was not quite sure of the opera 's moral status . Every Saturday night he gave four dollars to Madge , retaining nothing for himself . No other distribution of his earnings had occurred to him . He was working for the family ; it was his responsibility to see that both ends met . If he needed a few cents for a skate strap or a knife , he would ask apologetically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say . " I know ? " And he would scuff his toe , subscribing to this fiction . " But  --  you sure you do n't need it ? " At the store he was diligent and punctual , polite and competent . In no time at all he learned the stock  --  every item in its place on every shelf , no simple matter since Clem Wyatt 's merchandise ranged from groceries to dry goods . " Oh , Sam ? " Miss Murgatroyd would call , " where 's that new lot of ladies ' corsets ? " Or Mr. Stahl would shout across the store , " Say , Sam , did those hack saws come in yet ? " Even  | Clem appealed for help from time to time . And he was good with customers ; they liked him . " Where 's Sam ? " they would ask , looking around . He had very little time for social matters . Evenings he would read until he went to bed , prompt at nine o'clock ; he was up at half past five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . His mother had inspired and maintained his love for books , and his library card was rarely idle . On a shelf in his room were a few treasured volumes she had given him : Tong Sawyer , Huckleberry Finn , David Copperfield , Great Expectations  --  this last one was perhaps his favorite story . He saw less of Mike and more of Mitch , and Grover hardly ever . Mitch was fond of books and he was working , too  --  after school and Saturdays , setting type for the Wyattville Gazette . Sam saw him frequently running over to the office with the copy for Clem 's ad , or making changes in it ; and if Mitchell J. was out , as was usually the case , he sometimes paused to talk " What 're you working for ? " Mitch said to him one day . He was always very positive and abrupt . " Aw , I do n't know ? " " I do . I 'm saving up to go to college . " " You are ? " Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you would n't catch me dead in an old college . " " Why not ? " " I got no time to waste on stuff like that . " " Well ? " Mitch cocked his one god eye . " ? if you do n't know what you 're working for , I 'd say you 're wasting time . " " I 'm working to make money ? " Sam was annoyed . " ? and plenty of it , too . " " Clerking for Clem Wyatt ? " Mitch began to laugh . " N-no ? " Sam winced . He did have doubts about it . " I ai n't aiming to be clerking all my life . " " You wo n't get rich in Wyattville . " " Old Henry Wyatt did . " " Oh him ! " Mitch spat between his teeth . " Say , he ai n't really rich . Nobody 'd even notice him in Chicago or New York . " " He 's rich enough for me . " " Oh , well ? " Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel ! But if I was aiming to be rich , I 'd be like Rockefeller . " " Yeh ? " Sam was getting angry . " Well , what are you aiming at ? " " I 'm going to be a writer and an educated man . I 'm going to write books  --  like my father used to do . "  | " Shucks , you wo n't get rich that way . " " I do n't care if I do n't . I 'll be living in big cities  --  maybe London , maybe Paris . I 'll be traveling everywhere , all around the world , seeing everything and writing stuff about it . " " Well , I may be traveling , too , " Sam hinted loftily . " I 'll be a famous author . Everybody 'll read my books . " " Maybe so , " Sam sneered . " But you wo n't have any money . You 'll be walking in the mud when I go by in my carriage with a coachman in a livery . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch answered scornfully , " right here in Wyattville . " " I  --  I ? " Sam stuttered furiously , " I 'll just bet you a quarter on that , Mitch . " " I would n't take your money ? " Mitchell J. came in and banged the door  --  as drunk as usual but apparently no drunker . Sam hastily slid away . But the conversation and its varied implications rankled in his mind . He made an effort to discuss the thing with Mike , but no revealing light was shed upon the subject . Mike was lethargic and depressed . He said , out of the corner of his mouth , that he did not know why he was going to school  --  he saw no good of it , and he did not know what he would do when he got out and had not thought much about it . He had an uncle in Chicago , a policeman , who sometimes came to visit with the family . He had heard this uncle say , winking his eye , that good money could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes open . His uncle seemed well fixed , and the life of a policeman might not be a bad one . As for writing books ? well , look at Mitchell J. who was just a drunken sot and owed everybody money . There was nothing very tempting in the picture he presented . Anyway he did n't think he would ever want to write as he never read a book if he could help it . Of the higher education he spoke contemptuously  --  college was a place for dudes and sissies , and his uncle thought so , too . He even disapproved of Mike 's going to the high school and had said the previous summer in a very gloomy voice that if he kept on at school with a lot of dirty Protestants , he would certainly be damned . He was not so much concerned about the other children , but only about Mike who was his favorite nephew . He had written recently , offering Mike a home with him and promising to send him to a good parochial school where he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly be saved a long stay in purgatory . His father and mother were considering the suggestion " But I mean ? " Sam interrupted , " ? do n't you want to be rich , Mike ? " " Sure , " Mike agreed . " I 'd like to run a livery like Dave Birney . " " Shucks , I mean really rich  --  a millionaire . " " Aw , well ? " Mike shrugged . His imagination would not function in this realm . Sam dropped the subject . It was toward tke end of March that Clem raised him to five dollars . " Gee , thanks ? " he said , and hurried home in an ecstasy of joy . He felt that at last he was really getting started . He explained the thing to Madge , concluding awkwardly , " I think , if it 's all right , I 'll keep a dollar for myself . " " Of course , Sam , " she agreed . " A dollar every week ? " He watched her anxiously . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had been struggling with this problem : his Sunday suit was much too small and worn out  --  and he must have a new one by the time Eileen came back  --  something really stylish , like the Wyatt boys would wear . He had had his eye on such a suit and a pair of shoes to match , in Mr. Bergman 's window , right across the street from Clem 's . He had been afraid that somebody would buy it . It was yellowish with purple stripes , and the shoes were the color of ripe oranges . The cost of the outfit was exactly eighteen dollars " Yes , you should have a new suit , " Madge assented heartily . " Gee , thanks , Madge , ? thanks ? " In his lunch hour on Monday he tried on the suit and shoes which , Mr. Bergman said , fitted to perfection ? " like the paper on the wall . " Looking in the mirror at his resplendent image he felt a surge of pride and satisfaction  --  he was surely getting somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that  --  and this was true . There existed for many years a record of this suit , from a tintype taken in September at the fair . It was loud and cheap and ugly , and at least a size too large . And the shoes , whose sunset glow could not be reproduced , had long pointed toes and big brass buckles . In the picture he was wearing a straw hat  --  a flat one with a narrow brim . It was very funny afterwards ; it was funny even then . Mr. Bergman prepared to wrap it up . " Gee , no ? " Sam shook his head . " No , I do n't want it now . "  | " You better take it , Sam , " Mr. Bergman urged . " No , I have n't got the money . " " Your credit 's good . " " I 'd sooner pay a dollar every week , and you keep it till I want it . " " Just as you say , Sam . " " I 'll maybe want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All you got to do is ask . " " Well , thanks , Mr. Bergman ? " It was too late for dinner and he hurried back to Clem 's . The suit was off his mind . It would be there when he wanted it  --  when Eileen came back . She had written , when his mother died , a formal note of condolence ; and they had maintained a kind of correspondence : long letters which he wrote , and long-delayed replies , hasty and brief , ignoring everything that called for comment  --  like the tremendous fact that he had gone to work . But he read between the lines and detected hidden tenderness which , of course , existed only in his fancy . Ile assumed that a goddess could n't speak out frankly . The anemic heroines in the hooks that he had read , were the soul of modesty ; at the very thought of love they hid behind their fans or swooned away . This was ladylike and proper . He had asked her to let him know when she was coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoped she would . He had visions of himself , in his new suit and shoes , standing on the levee when the " Mary Queen " came in  --  if it should be a Sunday  --  strolling on the dock while the negroes nudged each other and made admiring comments . But he would pretend not to notice them , just nodding carelessly to the people that he knew . If Young Henry and his wife were there , he would smile and greet them pleasantly . He would have in his hand a big bouquet of lilacs  --  if the lilacs were still blooming . She would see him from the deck , and smile and wave her hand , and come tripping down the gangplank . And then  --  and then But it happened otherwise  --  as such things do . It was in June  --  a Saturday in fact , and the store was full of people . He was waiting on a fussy farmer woman , a Polack who was hard to understand , scooping sugar from a barrel with his eye upon the scale , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he really saw her . And he did n't hear her voice ; she did n't speak . He turned so quickly that he missed the paper sack , and the sugar in the scoop poured on the floor Yes , there she was  --  dressed all in white , with her golden hair like a  | halo  --  like a crown . There was another girl standing at her side , but he did n't see at first what she was like . " Gee  --  Eileen ? " She was smiling , nodding toward the other girl , introducing them , " This is Becky Adams , Sam . " " Oh , pleased to meet you ? " He started to shake hands but he had the sugar scoop . The Becky girl was laughing . She was pretty , too , but in a different way  --  small and dark and pert looking , in a very fancy dress . " Well  --  gee ? " The Polack woman was complaining , and Mr. Stahl was shouting something at him . Clem came along and took in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said , and then to Sam , " I 'll tend to this . You see what Eileen wants . " But she did n't want a thing . They were just passing by and had dropped in " Well , gee , I 'm glad you did ? " He wiped his sweating hands across his apron . The Becky girl explained : she was being shown the sights of Wyattville . She kept watching him and laughing  --  not out loud . " Well say , that 's great ? " But his eyes were on Eileen . " How 's old Neill and Wayne ? " She nodded , smiling . She was never one to waste her words . " I suppose they 'll be along soon ? " No , they were not coming to Wyattville this summer . Uncle Elliott had taken a house at Lake Geneva " Right next to ours , " the Becky girl cut in with the faintest hint of malice . " Gee , that 's too bad ? " But he was thrilled . Could he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening ? for supper about six ? ? If the weather was fine they might have it on the lawn  --  a kind of picnic supper " You bet. ? Well say , that 's fine ? " His heart leaped high  --  he would wear his new suit for this occasion And would he ask Nelly , too ? " I sure will , Eileen ? " They were standing in the doorway , and one of his good customers was fidgeting near by . He pretended not to see him . " Say , that 's mighty nice of you ? " The Becky girl was laughing as if there was a joke , though nothing the least funny had been said . They must n't keep him any longer from his work . She was edging through the open door  | " Well , so long , Eileen ? " And then he remembered and quickly found his manners . " And I 'm pleased to have met you , Miss  --  Miss ? " " Becky , " she said pertly . " Oh  --  oh yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street , and judging from the way her shoulders shook , Becky was still laughing . He did not think much of her ? she was the giggly kind . That afternoon he called on Mr. Bergman . Nelly said that he looked wonderful  --  that the suit was simply scrumptious . But her critical judgment was impaired by her excitement : she was going to a party  --  and a party at the Wyatts ' " Do I look all right , Sam ? " " You bet ? " But he did n't really notice . As a matter of fact Nelly was a pretty girl , with brown eyes and soft brown hair and a dainty little figure . Above all she had a cheerful , enthusiastic spirit which , how often crushed , took flight again . She was wearing a new dress which Madge had made  --  a simple organdie , but not one to be ashamed of . And Madge was on her knees , adjusting something , when she looked up at Sam " Land sakes ! " she gasped . " Yep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be construed as admiration . " Well , let 's get going , Nelly . " He was wriggling with impatience . " Please hurry , Madge . Do you want us to be late ? " " Just another minute , Sam . " Jim was sitting in his chair , rolling his thumbs . They did not ask him how they looked . They had reached a point where they rarely asked him anything . He was like the chair he sat on  --  just something in the house . They walked quickly by the Hogans ' . Mike was sitting on the porch . " Hah , sassiety ! " he hooted . They ignored this pleasantry , correctly ascribing it to envy . And they hurried through the swale , across the Square  --  arriving hot and out of breath  --  and early . Nobody else had come yet . Mrs. Henry gabbled at them across the vast expanse of dim and musty parlor with its square rosewood piano  --  with bad paintings on the walls in massive gilded frames  --  and crowded , heavy furniture : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curios and sea shells  --  and the statue of a naked boy standing on a pedestal , but he had a kind of apron spread across him  --  and thick , green curtains hanging at the windows , tied back on huge glass buttoms and festooned across the tops  --  antimacassared chairs and painted china vases  --  and the black clock on the mantel-  | piece which ticked like doom and struck the plodding hours like a dirge ? and the chandelier for the new electric light , dripping crystal doodads ? A rich man 's house ! But it was pretty gloomy and depressing . His heart sank . Mrs. Henry said that the girls were getting dressed  --  they had been to a tea party and had only just come back  --  so many things were planned to entertain them , and Becky Adams was such a lovely girl ? they would be down in a moment . But it had begun to sink when , through the cottonwoods , he had glimpsed the big brick house with its lofty cupola and iron fence . And this would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would never climb those steps without that wretched sled dragging at his heels ? never wait outside the door without half expecting it would suddenly fly open , that Old Henry would appear and shout furiously at him . And it would be no different when Old Henry was dead , no different when the house was falling into ruin  --  when the iron fence was red with rust and broken Young Henry looked in at the door and greeted them with cold politeness . He had no warmth . He was tall and spare and getting gray . His eyes were close together , and his lips were thin and tight . He wore a suit as colorless as he was , bought ready-made from Mr. Bergman . He was a small-town , Midwest banker  --  he was completely that . He said something to his wife relating to the party , and went away . Mrs. Henry gabbled on . Shc said they would have supper on the lawn  --  it was such a pleasant evening and would he a moonlight night ? there would be eight of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family would have supper in the house ; Mr. Henry , of course , as she called her husband 's father , never stepped outdoors at night Sam felt glad of that . His shirt was so tight that it was choking him , and the collar was frayed . Every time he turned his head it scratched his neck . Mrs. Henry went on to something else . She said Eileen was urging them to have a tennis court , like the one that Becky Adams had at Lake Geneva . There was a nice place for it at the side of the house where the croquet wickets were , but she thought Mr. Henry would object to the idea  --  he was always so conservative . Still , tennis was a nice game  --  did they know how to play it ? They said they did n't . The big , black clock made a groaning sound , and then struck six . ? Well , the old clock at home must have been wrong. ? The girls came  | down in swishing pink and white  --  calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky girl come into the room than she was overtaken with another giggling fit , and had to rush back into the hall . It was just too silly . She simply made him sick . The other guests arrived : Mitch Ballou and Grover Bentley , and Hub Baxter and his sister . There were the usual painful introductions followed by an awkward pause until the boys slid away into a group . Mitch and Grover stared at Sam and made cracks about his suit , but Hub merely grinned and kept his mouth shut . He was wearing white duck pants and feared reprisal . Mitch inquired if the party was to be a masquerade  --  he had n't known about it or he would have dressed accordingly . Grover felt the cloth and pointed out the purple stripes . He asked Sam how it felt to be a convict . They did not overlook the orange-colored shoes . Mitch pretended to believe they were on fire . Sam took it in good part . He was sure of the suit and of the shoes ? that young men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicago and New York . Mr. Bergman had assured him this was true , but anyway you could see it for yourself . He felt certain that the cracks had their origin in envy ; and he was partly right , for Mitch and Grover were not sure of themselves  --  not sufficiently informed to be certain he was wrong . They were presently united in attacking Hub 's white pants . Mrs. Henry , gabbling steadily , led the way out to the lawn . Two tables had been set on the croquet ground , and there were some paper lanterns strung between the trees . Young Henry was lighting them although it was n't dark yet , and Cora Lee was helping him . They stood around . They could n't romp or pull each other 's hair ; they had gotten beyond that , but as yet no other where . They had nothing to say ; they could n't talk . They were in that dreadful period between  --  too old for play , too young for love , not children and not adults . The girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ease . But the boys were wretched . " Each one must find his place , " Mrs. Henry was explaining , " by the place card with his name  --  little cards beside each plate . " Well , this was sure doing things in style ! ? They walked around the tables , making jocular remarks . Sam found his card , but he thought for a moment that it must be a mistake : he was not at the table with Eileen , but with Mitch and Susie Baxter , and that awful Becky girl " Do n't trip on the wickets , " Mrs. Henry warned . She paused beside him and shook a playful finger . " Sam , I 'm leaving it to you to entertain the guest of honor . "  | " Yes 'm ? " he mumbled weakly . " When she gets back to Chicago I want her to remember our boys in Wyattville . " She departed toward the house . He sat down . The Becky girl was giggling  --  glancing up at him and giggling , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a bottle . The Baxter girl was colorless and shy ; she had n't said a thing . He could hear Nelly 's voice , chattering and laughing , but not Eileen 's . Perhaps she wished she were sitting here with him  --  Cora Lee began to serve : salad and creamed chicken and hot biscuits . She smiled and nodded at him , and this made him uncomfortable . He gulped a little root beer . That Becky girl was saying something to him . He jerked his head around and scratched his neck . " I know you 're disappointed , Mr. Braden ? " " Shucks ? " He laughed . No one had ever called him that before , but it sounded kind of nice . " Sam 's good enough , " he said . " Well , Sam , then ?

Of course Eileen had to humor her request . " Well , why ? " he asked . " Oh , just because ? " Now she was being coy . " Because of what ? " " I 've heard so much about you ? " " You have ? " His heart began to thump . " A lot ? " She nodded , nibbling at a biscuit . " I hope it 's good ? " He was trying to sound careless . " Maybe ? " she admitted . " Who told you ?

" And she flounced around toward Mitch . " Gee ? " He was startled and confused . " I 'm sorry if ? " , " Never mind ? " She was giggling again . " I 'm only joking , Sam . You 've been very entertaining . " She turned to Mitch . " Now you entertain me for a while . " " Well say , " Mitch laughed , " I 've been waiting for a chance .

" " It ca n't hurt you ? " He pushed it with his fork . " I do n't want it looking at me . It 's horrible . It 's dreadful . " She was almost crying now . " Please put it back , " she begged . " Anything your little heart desires ? " Mitch picked up the eye and put it back . " I 'm just being entertaining ? " She watched this performance with horrified amazement . " Now just turn your head a moment , " he continued brightly , " and I 'll take off a leg . " " No ! " she said as if she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called . " Just Mitch and his old eye . " " Oh well ? " They were all laughing now . It broke the ice . But Miss Rebecca Adams was subdued for quite a while  --  not having any giggling spells , or being coy or smart . Good old Mitch had put her in her place  --  even if she did come from Chicago and her father had a house at Lake Geneva with tennis courts and stuff ? but of course he was equipped with a glass eye He began to eat his supper . The neckband of his shirt was choking him  --  every time he swallowed it was like being hanged ; he was terribly afraid the button would pop off and drop into his plate . Susie Baxter was trying in her shy and mousy way to make herself agreeable  | she was saying something to him , but his mind was somewhere else . He could see Eileen from the corner of his eye , sitting like a goddess  --  not talking much or giggling or making any effort , but just accepting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Becky about him ? Cora Lee removed the plates and brought ice cream and cake . It was beginning to be dark ; the paper lanterns glowed , swinging to and fro like monstrous fireflies . The mosquitoes came to life and buzzed around , nipping at ankles underneath the table . It was not polite to slap at them , he thought . He rubbed his ankles , twisting them together. ? Mitch and Becky seemed to hit it off all right . She was being smart again  --  tossing her head around and acting flirty . But Mitch could handle that . He gave her back just as good as she sent over , and she laughed as if she liked it . It appeared to work like that : if a fellow acted rough and snappy with them , they seemed to eat it up , as a cat would lap up cream . But of course that would n't work with a person like Eileen ? not where your interest was really deep and serious " Why do n't we have a picnic sometime , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , and Hub and Nelly  --  just the four of us sometime ? ? down at Beaton 's woods , or on the island ? " " Say , that would be fine , " he answered absently , " but I have to work , you know . " " Well , some Sunday ? " " Yep , you bet . " But his thought was somewhere else . What had Eileen said to Becky about him ? ? It was good , she had admitted . Yes , but how good ? Could she have confided that she was in love with him ? And , if it was n't something of this sort , why would Becky act that way ? ? being so secretive and teasing him about it ? ? promising to tell him , and then saying that she would n't ? ? Well , he 'd get her by herself later in the evening ; he 'd go at her good and rough  --  the way Mitch did ; he 'd find out exactly what she knew about it The rim of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to croak . The night was still and warm , and languorous and romantic " Say , Sam ? " Mitch leaned across the table . " ? remember the time you soaked old Neill with a hunk of lemon pie ? " I le grinned and nodded . " Remember , Eileen ? " Mitch called to her . " ? at a Sunday school picnic ? You were there . " " Yes , I remember , Mitch . " She was n't laughing . " We were just kids , " Sam said .  | " Naughty little boy ! " Becky frowned at him . " Whatever made you do such a horrid thing ? " " He had on sailor pants ? " No , " Mitch said , " that 's not the reason . " " Then why ? " she asked . " Sam was jealous of him . " " Shucks ? " Sam laughed , but he was embarrassed now . " We were just kids . " " Maybe so ? " Mitch chuckled . " But you 'll clo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sam Braden ! " Becky shook her finger at him . " I 'm ashamed of you . " " Aw , shucks ? " he mumbled . But he was n't sure that she did n't mean it  --  was n't altogether sure about anything she said . Eileen came to his rescue  --  strolling over like a goddess , leaning with her soft white arms on the back of Becky 's chair " Darling , " she said , " go and get your ukulele . " " Do you really think I should ? " Becky tipped her head back . She was being coy again . " Well , darling , I simply ca n't resist you . " She got up , shaking out her skirt . " Mr. Mitch , you come with me ? " Now she was making eyes and being cute . " I 'm afraid when it gets dark . " She slipped her arm through his and went , edging close against him , toward the house . " Mind the wickets , " Eileen said , and sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Becky giggled , " and you mind your p 's and q 's . " " Susie , " Grover called , " I can turn a glass of water upside down and never spill a drop . Come over here and look . " Susie slid away and went to see . They were alone . The moon was up  --  yellow and enormous , like an incandescent cheese ; the paper lanterns twinkled , dancing lightly up and down ; the frogs croaked in a chorus , and the mosquitoes sang like tautly trembling wires . It was too dark to see her face , and he was glad that she could not see his . He thought that he must look as foolish as he felt  --  all that silly stuff about the lemon pie ; and he was n't much to look at anyway , with that cowlick in his hair and all his freckles which , his mother had assured him , would disappear in time . But she had always laughed when he complained about them , insisting that she loved them  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mitch driving at with that last funny crack ? ? that he 'd do  | it again if he ever had a chance : soak old Neill with a hunk of lemon pie . Well , of course he 'd never do a thing like that again . But maybe Mitch meant something else entirely  --  that he and Neill would fight a battle to the death for the lady of their choice  --  not with lemon pieces but with weapons that could kill : guns and knives and poison . Well , maybe Mitch was right It sure had been slick  --  the way she changed the subject . She had done it like an empress  --  sending the Becky girl off about her business , and then sitting down beside him , just to show them that nobody could make funny cracks about him. ? What was an ukulele anyway ? Some new kind of game perhaps . But he was n't going to ask and give himself away Gee , here they were alone and the minutes ticking by , and he had n't said a thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was here . All he had to do was put the question  --  just plump it right out straight : " Do you love me , Eileen ? ? Do you really care about me , more than Neill or anyone ? ? Will you marry me some day ? ? Oh , I 'll have lots of money . Do n't you worry about that. ? Well say , do n't you see , I 've already got a start ; I 'm ahead of all those fellows wasting time with school . I 'm as good a clerk right now as the others in the store . Clem says so , himself . And I 'm only getting started . I 'll be rich before you know it. ? Just tell me if you love me ? " " Say , Eileen ? " he blurted . She turned her head . The moonlight made her blonde hair shine like gold . But already they were coming hack across the lawn  --  Mitch and the Becky girl ; and something was tinkling like a broken mandolin . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " Do n't trip on the wickets , " Eileen warned . " Or the wicked , " Becky said and set them laughing . So that was the ukulele ! ? that little tum-tum thing she was holding like a baby and strumming with her fingers . It sounded as silly as it looked They got cushions from the hammock and the swing , and sat in a circle on the grass beneath the paper lanterns . He was sharing a cushion with Eileen , but Grover was close by on her other side . The golden opportunity had vanished . The moon was climbing up the sky , getting white and smaller  --  no longer like a cheese . The frogs kept croaking , sounding very much like the ukulele ; you had to listen closely to be sure which was which . The mosquitoes hummed around ; you could slap at  | them now you were no longer at the table . Cora Lee was gathering up the dishes " Sing something , darling , " Eileen said . " Do you really think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I simply ca n't resist you ? " And she began to sing , cuddled on a cushion , kind of leaning against Mitch ? " My Old Kentucky Home . " He wished Eileen would lean against his shoulder , but of course she 'd never do a thing like that . And it was pretty brazen , the way that Becky acted with a boy she 'd only met an hour ago . It was funny Eileen liked her . Anyway she could n't sing much  --  could n't sing for sour apples ! " Come on , " she paused to call . " Come on in , the water 's fine . " Some of them joined in , but Nelly 's high , sweet voice rang clear above them all . She was sitting by herself , leaning back against a tree , and she sang right out as if she were in church . Pretty soon the others stopped ; she was singing all alone It was terribly embarrassing . He wished he were close enough to nudge her  --  to remind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was at a party at Eileen 's , and it was pretty raw to butt in and sing like that , drowning everybody out . Even Becky had quit now , but kept strumming on the thing just to be polite . His hands were sweating " Darling ! " Becky cried when the song came to an end . " Darling , what a voice ! " He winced . Was this a crack ? " Oh , I ca n't really sing ? " Nelly laughed excitedly . " Oh , but you can ! " It sounded like she meant it . " Sing something that you like and I 'll try to pick it out . " " Well , mostly I know hymns ? " " Hymns ! " Becky sniffed . " You should be singing opera . " That must be a crack , he thought . " Carmen or Traviata ? " " Do you really think so , Becky ? ? that I could sing in opera ? " Nelly , his own sister , lapping up that kind of stuff ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York ? " " You mean-I really could ? " " You sing divinely , darling. ? Does n't she , Eileen ? " He held his breath . Eileen would n't say anything she did n't mean . " Yes , " Eileen said , " divinely . " " Oh , Eileen ! " Nelly sounded almost tearful . " Now that 's settled , " Mitch said dryly , " go ahead , and sing , Nelly . " And Nelly sang  --  some hymns she knew , but they did n't go so well  | with the ukulele , and most of the time she had no accompaniment ; and then the songs they all knew : " Annie Laurie , " " Comin ' Thro ' the Rye , " " Good Night Ladies " IIe was impressed . Maybe Nelly could sing . They kept begging her for more every time she stopped . Maybe she could sing opera  --  Carmen and that other one they mentioned  --  if she had a little training in Paris or New York . It could n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money . Rich people went to see them  --  men in long tail coats with stovepipe hats , and ladies dressed in furs and decked with jewels . Maybe they would cheer when Nelly sang ? stand up and clap their hands . And maybe he would be there , sitting in a box  --  he and Eileen ; and perhaps they would have guests , and one of them would say , " Is n't she divine ! " And he would smile and nod . " My sister ? " he would answer , proud but modest. ? Well , maybe ? He wished he knew what Eileen had said to Becky ; he must try to pin her down before he left . He wished that Nelly would quit singing so he could explore that other matter . He wished Eileen would turn her head and not keep watching Nelly all the time . It was past his usual bedtime and he was getting sleepy . He wished that he could skip the next few years Mrs. Henry came snooping from the house  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Becky insisted that Nelly sing a final song for her . " Home Sweet Home , " she wanted ; and Nelly sang it . She really sang it , too . It made funny little feelings in your stomach and the tears come to your eyes " Lovely , " Mrs. Henry chirped . " Simply lovely , Nelly . " " Could n't she sing in opera , Mrs. Wyatt ? " Becky asked . " Why , I 'm sure she could . " Mrs. Henry spoke with confidence , never having been to the opera in her life . " You see , darling ! " " Oh , thank you ? " Nelly was in heaven , dancing on the clouds . I Ie got up . Now was the time and there might not be another . He would thank Mrs. Henry and get that over with , and then he 'd tackle Becky and find out what was what . She was standing beside Mitch , strumming on that thing . Well , he 'd get rid of Mitch ; he 'd be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briskly perhaps ; anyway his toe caught in a wicket and down he went , sprawling on his face , right at Mrs. I Icnry 's feet . He heard the button pop There were screams and laughter . " You can always count on Sam , " he heard Mitch say .  | " Why , Sam ? " Mrs. Henry drew back in alarm as he scrambled to his feet . " You did n't hurt yourself ? " " No 'm ? " He was clutching at his throat . His necktie was the kind that fastens on the button , and of course it had come off ; he was holding it in place . " I tripped on a wicket ? " From the corner of his eye he could see the Becky girl  --  giggling fit to bust , hanging onto Mitch 's arm . " You did n't hurt your neck ? " Mrs. Henry persisted . " No 'm . Just my necktie that came off ? " " Oh , well ? " Mrs. Henry smiled doubtfully . " I 've had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I hope you 'll come again , Sam . " " Yes 'm , I will ? " He turned his head . Eileen was watching him ; she was n't laughing . " Well , thanks , Eileen . So long ? " Ile included the others , waving carelessly with the necktie in his hand . " Well , so lonb ? " And he walked away across the lawn . " Wait for me , Sam , " Nelly called . But he went on. ? Dawgone it ! ? tripping on that wicket and falling on his face like a clown in a circus ! And the button and the necktie ! Ile shoved it in his pocket . And that giggling , smarty girl ! He 'd get square with her sometime ; he 'd get square with all of them . But Eileen had n't laughed He was at the iron gate when Nelly overtook him . " Sam , wait ! " She was out of breath from hurrying . " Whatever made you run away like that ? " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't even say good night to Becky . " " Why should I ? " " But the party was for her . " " I do n't care . I do n't like her . " " Why not ? I think she 's nice . " " Giggly smart aleck ? " " She 's so gay and full of life ? " " She makes me sick . " There was silence for a while . They went on across the Square ? through the moonlight and the shadows of the cottonwoods . " Sam ? " " What ? " " Do you think I could ever sing in opera ? " " How should I know ? "  | " You heard what Becky said ? " " Becky ! " he snorted . " I 'd sure be a sucker to believe that kind of stuff . " " Oh well ? " Nelly was hurt . " You 're just mad because she thought your suit was funny ? " " Funny ! My suit ! " He stopped and stared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You 're crazy , " he said scornfully , but his confidence was jarred . " It 's the latest style of suit . Anybody but a hick would know it . " " Well , maybe ? " Nelly was contrite . There was a pause . " I can sing , Sam ? " " Sure , you sing all right . " " If I could go to Paris or New York ? " " If cows could fly ? " he muttered . " Would it cost a lot of money ? " " What do you think ? " " Yes ? " she sighed . They came out of the Square and turned toward Shanty Town . " Maybe , " he said , " when I get really started  --  well , maybe I could help you . " " Yes , but when , Sam ? " " Oh , I do n't know ? " He shrugged ; it seemed terribly remote . " Maybe I 'll be too old then ? " No answer . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Clem Wyatt . " " I 'm not going to be clerking there forever . " " Well , what are you going to do ? " " I do n't know yet . " He did n't know and it had begun to worry him . " You ought to make your mind up pretty soon . " No answer . They were trudging through the swale , as they had trudged together , back and forth to school , so many , many times . " Sam ? " " What ? " " Why do you care so much about  --  Eileen ? " " Why ? " He was startled ; she had never said a thing like that before . " Because I do , that 's all . " He kept looking straight ahead . " Because she 's pretty ? " " No . " " Because she 's rich ? " " What difference does that make ? " " I 'm only asking you just wondering what you see in her ? "  | No answer . " She hardly ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , that 's something anyway . " " She 's never cared for anyone but Neill . " " That 's what you think , " he said angrily . " Everybody knows it . " " I do n't . " A pause . They were climbing up the slope . " She 's so hard and  --  cold . " " She 's not . You just do n't know her . " " Do you , Sam ? " " Aw shucks ? " he said . But he had a sneaking feeling that he did n't . They went past the Hogan house . " There are other pretty girls in Wyattville  --  nice ones , too . " " Well , who ? " " You know as well as I do ? " But she named some . " Oh them ! " he interrupted with a sneer . " They do n't interest me . " " They might , if you 'd give them half a chance ? " " No . " He laughed and shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well ? " Nelly sighed . " I do n't think she 'll ever really care about you , Sam . " " Yeh ? " He was sure getting things rubbed in . " A lot you know about it . " " I know what girls are like . " " All right . All right . You 're pretty smart . " They turned in at the gate ; the house was dark . " Oh dear ! " She sighed again . " I wish I could go to Paris or New York ? " " I wish , " he jeered . " I wish I had a million dollars . " " Well , if you did , then would you send me , Sam ? ? so I could sing in opera ? " " Yep . You bet , " he said . They went in quietly , so as not to wake their father .  | V T TOOK SAM NEARLY THIRTY YEARS TO ACQUIRE HIS FIRST MILLION . I There was nothing spectacular about it : hard work , eternal vigilance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Luck , who smiled at him at last , ultimately turned the trick . And the million , once acquired , quickly multiplied itself , for wealth breeds wealth , and even stupid people with a nest egg of this sort , are as likely as not to go on getting richer . At the height of his success he was worth somewhere around six million dollars . He never knew exactly , for values are shifting every time the clock ticks , and even static things are impossible of accurate appraisement . For example : who could put a proper value upon Glencoe ? ? what the place had cost in money ? ( if one could determine that  --  the cost of reproduction ? ( if it could be reproduced ) ? what it would fetch at a forced sale ? ( certainly no more than a fraction of its worth ) ? or what some other rich man might be inclined to pay for a Colonial mansion with stables , barns and silos set in a park of rolling , timbered land ( once known as Beaton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , green meadows , two thousand acres in extent , with horses , blooded cattle , and fields of golden corn stretching far along the bluff above the river  --  a rich man 's home or hobby . Who could say what it was worth to anyone but him ? However this may be , measured by the standards of the world in which he lived , Sam Braden did become a rich , successful man . But not any more than that ; not what the press would describe as a tycoon  --  not powerful , not rich enough for that ; capable at most of corrupting minor bureaucrats  --  far removed from the business of buying federal judges , subsidizing legislatures , and electing Presidents  --  from the realm of the tycoon . I le was practically unknown to the tycoons or the public ; at no time in his life was he famous or notorious . He was rarely interviewed or quoted by the press ; he took no part in politics . His commercial reputation was always of the highest ; he was known to keep his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  for example : Stanley Adams in Chicago , who was closely connected with the Morgans in  | New York ; and the Elliott Wyatt Company which had spread out everywhere across the country , doing general brokerage business and extensive underwriting in the field of high finance , really reaching tycoon class . But Sam , himself , was not of tycoon caliber . He had too many qualities of the sort that endow or afflict the average man . He was , in fact , too human . Mike said to him one day  --  it was in ' 28 ? sitting in the office , looking out across the lake " Jesus , Sam , " he said , " if only you 'd happened to get into oil or steel , instead of this penny-pushing business ! Say , you 'd be as rich as any of em . " Yeh ? " Sam grinned , but he knew better . " You 'd run circles round ' em , Sam . " Mike believed in him , believed in him completely . But Mike Hogan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sam leaned back in his chair and lit a cigarette . He had been telling Mike : on the Century , going to New York , he had run into Wayne Wyatt with some Oklahoma oilmen , big shots of the day . Someone had called his name as he was walking through the train from dinner , and there was Wayne , sitting in a drawing room with three big husky fellows  --  looking just the way he always did , as Neill had looked , slender and well dressed , with his hair brushed straight back , and that easy , careless , sure way about him . " Hi , Sam ! " He had paused in the doorway . They were finishing their dinner and the waiter was clearing off the table  --  the remnants of thick steaks and empty highball glasses . " Well , Sam , how are you ? " They shook hands across the table , and Wayne had introduced him to the others whose names were front-page news  --  two of them at least  --  tycoons , in fact . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , broad-shouldered men , strong and tough , and hard . They had made him roughly welcome as a friend of Wayne 's , had poured a drink for him , and one of them had said : " Braden , eh ? ? Never ran across the name but once before . Fellow used to work for me , trained some horses for me once  --  Tom Braden was his name . No relation , I suppose ? " " Yes , " Sam said , " my brother . " Though if Wayne had not been there he might have let it go . He had wondered afterwards whether he would or not . " Yeh ? That right ? " The man had paused to give an order to the  | porter who had come to the door in answer to the bell . " Fetch two decks of cards , George , and another round of setups . Step on it now . " And then he had come back to the subject . " Good trainer , knew his business ? trained some winners for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have n't heard of him in years . What 's become of him ? " " He 's dead , " Sam said . " Yeh ? Well , that 's too bad . Smart fellow with a horse . " But he did not mention this episode to Mike . They had asked him if he cared to play a little poker , to while away the time ; and he had said he would n't mind . He had wondered afterwards why he had accepted , why he had n't gone on to his compartment and to bed . He had a book to read and he was n't fond of cards and rarely played , and he was not a gambler  --  not with games . Perhaps he had wanted to be sociable ; he was a lonely man . Or perhaps he was flattered by the idea of being in such company  --  with men who were really rich and powerful . Perhaps he had been curious about them  --  to find out what they were like , what made them drive ahead to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marcher . Perhaps he had thought he might pick up some information  --  some tip that might come handy . He knew that Elliott Wyatt was involved with these fellows , marketing an issue of securities ; he had read that in the papers ; and that , of course , explained why Wayne was with them . Anyway he had accepted . They had moved into another drawing room  --  it seemed that they had two , and two compartments  --  and had started in to play . The game was stud . I le had not inquired anything about the stakes " Jesus ! " Mike exclaimed " You were stepping into something . " " Up to my neck , " Sam nodded . The man who was banking had handed him some chips  --  just an ordinary stack of red and blue and yellow , and had written down his name and after it had put ? " Well , how much would you guess ? " " Five hundred bucks ? " Mike ventured . " Double that . " " A thousand ? Holy Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he had felt pretty sick ; his hands had begun to sweat the way they used to do when he was a boy . " How much did they take you for ? " " I low much ? " Sam grinned . " I won nine hundred dollars . " " By God , now think of that ! " Mike beamed on his employer . " So you took those big shots for a ride ! "  | " Hell ! " Sam laughed . " They 're no different from anybody else . " But he knew this was n't true . They had quit at four o'clock ; he had won nine hundred dollars , playing close to his belly , but why not ? ? about what Wayne had lost . The heavy loser , the man for whom Tom Braden had trained horses , had finally called a halt ; he had lost six thousand dollars to the other two " Christ ! " he said , " I 've had enough . It 's time to go to bed . " And he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yawning while he did it . They had kept the porter up  --  running back and forth for setups , for cigars and cigarettes , emptying ash trays , waiting on them . They had done it without caring or even thinking of it . They were not accustomed to think of things like that  --  a nigger more or less . They tossed him fifty dollars at the end  --  but tossed it , crumpled up , so the fellow must stoop down to pick it up . In the course of the evening they consumed two quarts of Scotch ? most of it themselves , for he and Wayne drank little . But at that they were not drunk , not careless in their playing , and neither gay nor quarrelsome . They were friendly enough , but cold as ice ; there were walls behind their eyes which you could not penetrate . They had little to say , really nothing in the way of conversation but , between themselves , a kind of badinage , brusque and rough and second rate . They did not mention business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Mike inquired . " Only for a moment on the platform at Grand Central . " They had gone striding past him , with Wayne like a stripling among giants , with redcaps at their heels  --  two hundred million dollars worth of men  --  clean shaved , pink checked , clear eyed , while he felt dopey , half awake , with a thick taste in his mouth  --  wishing he had gone to bed at a reasonable hour , dreading the work he must get through that day . Yet no trace of dissipation lingered on them . Their minds were fresh and keen ; no one would trip them up . They had grinned and nodded to him , and Wayne had waved and called : " Come in and see us , Sam ? " The Elliott Wyatt company had long since removed headquarters from Chicago to New York ; and Elliott was playing with the crowd that ran the country , really going places now ? with a town house in New York and a big place on Long Island and another at Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll do that , Wayne . " He had walked on slowly , not wanting  | to catch up with them , or to seem to want to do so , thinking to himself : what was it that they had ? It was then that Mike had said , sputtering damply from the corner of his mouth : " Jesus , Sam , if only you 'd happened to get into oil or steel , instead of this penny-pushing business ! " But lie knew better . In oil or steel or motors he would have been a flop . In the days when men built railroads he would have gotten nowhere ; he could not have held his own with Gould and Hill and Harriman ; he did n't have the stuff . It was lucky for him , this pennypushing business which was fitted to his talents , not too big and not too small  --  not big enough to tempt the big-shot fellows . And lucky for him , too , that he knew his limitations . But what was it that they had ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's nothing else , I guess I 'll toddle home , Sam . " It was after six o'clock . " No , nothing else ? " " Well then , good night " Oh , Mike ! " His voice had changed . " Yes sir ? " Mike stood waiting at the door . " I want those raw stock contracts figured out tomorrow . " " Yes sir . " " I do n't want long commitments . It 's a runaway market , but it ca n't go up forever . " " Yes sir . " " Do n't forget  --  tomorrow . " " No sir , I wo n't . Good night ? " I Ie sat there for some time after Mike had gone . What was it that they had ? ? They were big , strong , healthy fellows ; they had physical machines that would stand a lot of wear , but of course that was n't all . They had very simple minds , focused clearly on one point , not deflected by any doubts or scruples ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , that was all . But with money came power ; that 's what they were making , though perhaps they never thought of it that way . And with power came contempt for the rights of other people less fortunate than themselves . They were ruthless ; they were hard . No doubt they loved their wives and children , and would grieve if they died  --  or went away . But it would n't get them down or turn them off their course . They would go on making money  --  making power ; every other thing in life was subordinate to that . Yes , they were  | hard . Perhaps that was the difference , the fundamental one : the quality of hardness  --  of hardness getting harder and harder with success . He would never be like them , and never rich like that . Nor would he ever be like Elliott or Wayne , as Neill had been . That was another formula , but one you must be born to , which could never be acquired . To appreciate money you must have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poverty . It was Mitch Ballou who had made that clear to him ? Mitch who hated what he called the " predatory rich , " who would have hated those fellows in the drawing room , would have turned his back on them " The Wyatts ! " he had sneered . " They 're not really dangerous . " It was several years ago when the penny-pushing business was still small but growing fast . " They 've had money all their lives . They d n't care enough about it to constitute a menace  --  no more than they do about a set of tennis or a horse race . There 's a sporting element about the things they do ; they can win or lose without getting off their balance . And they care for other things  --  not only money : their pride , their moral character , their souls perhaps ? " " So what ? " he had prompted . They were sitting in the bar of the old Stratford Hotel and Mitch was a little drunk . " Watch your step , Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass and thumped on the table for another . " I do n't care how much you make if you do n't corrupt yourself  --  if you do n't quit thinking straight . " He smiled now to himself remembering it  --  Well , it was n't likely he 'd corrupt himself or anybody else , not likely he 'd be dangerous and a menace to the country  --  a little businessman with a paltry million dollars , trying to make money like everybody else  --  trying to get along . Good thing he had n't gotten into oil or steel . This penny-pushing business was plenty big enough . It had made a million for him , and now that its stock was quoted on the curb  --  Elliott Wyatt had talked him into that  --  by shrewd manipulation it might make a couple more  --  or three or four Funny how he had got into it  --  how one thing led to another He scarcely saw Eileen again that summer , and did n't tell or ask her anything . In a week or two she went back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young Henry and his wife went on a vacation to Chicago . Old Henry had composed a deal with the Rock Island Railroad , selling them the site on which to build a depot , accepting annual passes for himself and family , as part consideration . And Young Henry had to travel , people said . However that might be , Eileen went  | back to school without coming home again . Their correspondence languished and then died . A letter that he wrote remained unanswered . Elliott came now and then to see his father , but the house across the Square remained unoccupied  --  for fifteen years in fact . The Elliott Wyatts came to Wyattville no more . It had been all right while the boys were children , though it could n't have been chosen by Elliott or Daphne as a place to spend the summer  --  a sweltering little town , with nothing to be done but driving in a dogcart or sitting on the porch , drinking lemonade . They had come very faithfully for six or seven years , and no doubt had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was patched were content to let it be . The boys were growing up and had interests of their own , and Daphne was involved with social undertakings , and Elliott was busy getting on with big affairs . The chance to rent a place adjoining the estate of Stanley Adams , whose acquaintance had been formed through Becky and Eileen , presented no alternative ; and the Lake Geneva summer was a prelude to the end . Probably Old Henry was content to have it so ; he was getting rather feeble and more crotchety than ever , and was less and less disposed to have his house upset , to have young people running in and out . He had not looked with favor on the tennis court idea . A year slid by . Mike vanished from the scene , departing for Chicago to reside with his uncle , the policeman , to complete his education in a good parochial school where he would be well protected from contaminating influence of Protestants and heretics . Other things remained unaltered . Nelly was in high school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercises , and Mitchell J. Ballou reported her performance in the Wyattville Gazette : . Ile said : " Pretty , graceful Nelly Braden rendered her selections in a voice that holds great promise . We are mighty proud of Nelly . We venture to predict that , with proper training , she will one day grace the concert platform in the great cities of this country . " Nelly was in raptures when Madge read it aloud " A concert singer ! " she exclaimed . " Yes , I guess that 's what I 'll be . It 's more dignified than opera  --  do n't you think so , Madge ? " " Why yes , perhaps ? " Madge sighed and smiled , picking up some sewing . She was busy all day long with the cooking and the house , and Mr. Daniel Price had not been back . Eileen did not come home that summer , not even for a day . Instead she went to Europe  --  with her mother , and Aunt Daphne and the boys ? a spectacular event at the turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side , almost no one in Wyattville had ever crossed the ocean . " Oh dear ? " Nelly groaned , when the fact was advertised in the Gazette , " ? if only I could have a chance like that ! " " Shucks ! " Sam was reading and he looked up from his book . " Just a lot of old churches and museums and things ! " " I do n't care , " Nelly said . " It is n't fair . She can do what she wants , and she has n't any voice  --  or anything to train . " " Oh , well , I 'd sooner go to California ? " He went on reading , but he was consumed with envy : Eileen and Neill gallivanting about Europe ! Yes , they were sure lucky . Some post cards came  --  picture post cards mailed in Paris , in Lucerne and Venice , depicting local monuments and fashionable hotels , with a few words scrawled in schoolgirl French in the space where you could write , but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His salary had been raised , and raised again  --  the last time to eight dollars . Ile was giving five to Madge and keeping three ; and he had saved almost thirty dollars which were in Old Henry 's bank , drawing interest at the rate of four per cent . But still he had misgivings : at this rate of progress , phenomenal though it was , it would take several lifetimes to get rich . He worked as hard as ever , was as punctual and polite , as diligent and careful ; but perhaps Clem detected something in his eyes . Anyway one Saturday when they were closing up , he began to talk about it . " Sam , " he said , " you 're a capable young fellow and I 'd sure hate to lose you , but I know you wo n't go on here all your life . " Sam was startled  --  not knowing what was coming . He went on sweeping out . " I 'm paying you eight dollars , " Clem continued . " In another year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty near the top . Miss 1Vlurgatroyd and Stahl are only getting twelve , and they been here for years . I could n't pay you what I 'm paying them  --  not for quite a while . It would n't seem quite fair . " " No sir ? " Sam agreed . " And twelve  --  well , that 's the top . " " Yes sir ? " He was taking up the sweepings in a dustpan . " I 've known you all your life , Sam , and I know you pretty well ; you 're smart and you 're ambitious . There is n't any future in what you 're doing now , and I think it 's only right to tell you so , though ? " He leaned  | against the counter watching Sam . " ? though I guess you 're smart enough to have got that figured out ? " " Yes sir , " Sam admitted , sweeping up the last of it . " But , Clem ? " Ile straightened with the dustpan in his hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know , " Clem said . " In a little town like this there is n't much of anything . " He scratched his head . " There 's the banking business , though Old Henry does n't pay as much as I do . Still , you might pick up from him some tricks of making money . Or  --  well , did you ever think you might want to study law ? ? something like that ? " " No , I never thought of that . " " Well , I tell you what you do ? " Clem was getting out the keys to lock the door . " ? you take a week 's vacation  --  with pay , you understand ? and kind of look things over , see what you can find . If you want to stay with me  --  well , you know I 'm glad to have you . But if you can locate something you think is any better , I 'll be just as glad as you are . " " Gee , thanks , Clem . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded cautiously , not rushing around like a chicken with its head off  --  and caution was a quality which would stand him in good stead . He took a day or two to think things over , going off to Beaton 's woods with a sandwich in his pocket , sitting on the bluff , looking out across the river to the shore of Illinois  --  to Chicago and New York , to the capitals of Europe  --  to the treasures of Cathay And he talked with Madge and Nelly , without practical result . Madge seemed to feel he ought to stay with Clem , but Nelly urged him on . She advised him to learn the banking business and then start one of his own . " Everybody hates Old Henry , " she affirmed , " and they 'll bring their money to you . And when you get things going you can move your bank away  --  move it anywhere you like . " She tore on with the idea and even mentioned something about a private yacht and a house at Lake Geneva " Aw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He did not discuss the matter with his father . But on Wednesday he put on the yellow suit and orange shoes , slicked back his hair the best he could , and paid a visit to the Wyatt bank . Young Henry , with an eyeshade on his forehead and black sleeve protectors from his elbows to his wrists , nodded coldly at him , looking through a wicket in the glass partition . There was only one wicket and Young Henry was the teller ; he was also the cashier , bookkeeper , and  | vice-president . The other employees were two sad-faced looking men of middle age : Wallie Coot and Arthur Bridgeman . They were standing at a desk , in eyeshades and sleeve protectors exactly like Young Henry 's , adding figures in the books . " Well ? " Young Henry asked . " I 'd like to see about a job ? " He had rehearsed the matter . " A job ? " Young Henry looked surprised and mildly shocked . " What kind of job ? " " A job here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which contained his thirty dollars . " Oh ? " Young Henry turned the matter in his mind . " You 'll have to see my father about that . " It was said in Wyattville that Young Henry would n't dare to obey the calls of nature  --  only they put in bluntly ? unless he asked his father . " Well , could I see him now ? " " Why yes , I guess so ? " He opened the gate in the partition and ushered Sam into a dingy little room in the corner of the bank . Old Henry was sitting at his desk  --  a wizened little man with a white beard like a goat 's , and his threadbare old blue coat a mass of spots . He would not submit to have it cleaned . " Well ? What ? " He looked up impatiently . Sam 's heart sank to his shoes and his hands began to sweat . " It 's the Braden boy , " Young Henry said . " He 's looking for a job . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . It was a simple question but difficult to answer . " What for ? Speak up ! " " I  --  I 'd like to learn the business ? " " Oh , you 'd like to learn the business ! " Old Henry scowled or grinned ; it was difficult to say . " Well , what for ? " " I 'd like to be a banker ? " " Oh , you 'd like to be a banker ! ? Well , why , I want to know ? " " I  --  I want to make some money ? " " Oh , you want to make some money ! ? Well , how much ? " " All I can get ? " " How much ? " " A lot , " Sam blurted desperately . " A million dollars maybe . " " A million , eh ? " Old Henry shook his head . " We have n't any jobs . " " I do n't mind starting cheap ? " " We have n't any jobs . " He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ledger on the desk . " I do n't employ young fellows that want to make a million . I ca n't afford such luxury . " He made a cackling sound  | that might have been a laugh , and motioned with his hand as if brushing them away . What were the proper answers to the questions that Old Henry had propounded and clung to like a leech ? ? " What for ? " " How much ? " He wondered about that , out in the street , aware that whatever they might be , he had not replied correctly. ? " Because I need the work . " " I have to make a living . " " I 'd like to learn to keep a set of books , and maybe sometime get as much as Wallie Coot . " Yes , answers such as these might have landed him a job . Instinctively he felt what in time he came to know : that rich men did n't want ambitious men around them  --  as witness in himself his choice of Mike  --  that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if they must be shared at all , had best be shared with unambitious men  --  loyal , mediocre men , content with crumbs . And in the years to come he wondered more than once what his life would have been like had he made a proper answer ? ? had he been engaged to work for Old Henry in the bank ? And he shuddered at the memory of the dingy , shabby place , and the grubby little men with eyeshades on their foreheads and alpaca sleeve protectors  --  adding up the ledgers , endless empty columns whose fruits , if fruits there were , they were certain not to taste . But he would not have stayed there , drifting into middle age  --  and yet , suppose he had The following day he called upon Judge Nicolls . The Judge was very old  --  older than Old Henry , getting close to eighty , and not small or shriveled up , but big and round , with white hair like a mane that came almost to his shoulders , and a large red bulbous nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office over Mr. Bascom 's undertaking shop  --  an office lined with faded leather law books , smelling of hot leather in the sun which streamed in the open window through which he was gazing at Clem Wyatt 's store across the street . He was sitting in his shirt with the sleeves rolled to his elbows , fanning himself with a big palmetto fan . His long black coat hung on the wall beside the stovepipe hat which he did not often wear now except to a funeral or something of the sort . " I lowly , Sam , " he said with a twinkle in his eye . " Have you come to start a lawsuit ? " " No sir ? " Sam smiled , waiting near the door . He had on the yellow suit and orange shoes . " Well , that indicates to me you 're a pretty smart young fellow ? " He  | reached out to swat a fly with the palmetto fan . " But you 're all dressed up for something , like a suppliant for justice . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Sam sat down . " I 've been thinking that perhaps I 'd like to study law ? " " To study law , " the Judge repeated solemnly . " What put that in your head ? " " I 've been thinking I 'd like to be a lawyer ? " " Yes ? ? Why , Sam ? " " Well  --  I ? " He was going to be cautious about this . Do you feel a burning passion for the lady with the bandage on her eyes , and the sword and scales of justice ? " " Why ? " " Now let 's be honest , Sam . " " I never thought of it like that ? " " How have you thought of it ? " " I  --  I ? " ' Why do you want to . be a lawyer ? " " I have to make my living ? " " Is that all you want to make ? " " Well ? " He was silent , not knowing what to say . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of yellow books . " Books about the law , the law itself  --  hundreds of ' em , dull and dry as dust . You 'll have to read ' em  --  read ' em all your life : red tape mostly , tying people up so justice ca n't be done . You 'll get pretty sick of that : watching the innocent get punished and the guilty get away . And you 'll never make much money  --  not if you 're a lawyer . " " But ? " Sam wet his lips . " ? some lawyers get rich , do n't they ? " " No sir , they do n't . " The old man struck the desk with the palmetto fan . " Smart businessmen get rich , and a few of them are lawyers  --  or so they call themselves : corporation lawyers who can show their wealthy clients how to cheat the law . But real lawyers do n't get rich . " He paused and fanned himself . " Why do you want to be a lawyer , Sam ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath , " ? perhaps I do n't . " " Now we 're getting somewhere ? " The Judge was smiling at him , leaning back in his big chair . " What do you really want ? " " I want to make some money , " Sam confessed . " How much ? " " A lot . A million dollars . " " A million dollars , eh ? " But the Judge did n't bark at him the way Old Henry had . " I see . You want to be a millionaire ? "  | " Yes sir  --  if I can . " " Why ? " " Why ? " Sam stared . " No matter , Sam . Do n't try to answer that . " He was smiling  --  kind of sadly : " It does n't matter why . Anyway you could n't tell me . " He paused and sighed . " It 's the spirit of the age  --  the spirit of America . I 'm getting so old that I forget . " And then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : you want to make your fortune , and what you want to know is how to get a start ? " " Yes sir , I guess that 's it . " ' ' Like the boys in Babylon ? ? in Greece and Rome ? " Sam was discreetly silent . " Well , first , do n't waste your time , for time , they say , is money . " " Yes sir , I know ? " " Do n't study law . " " No sir ? " Sam nodded with a feeling of relief . " And second  --  hum ? " The old man seemed to drift away , to be dozing in his chair ; then suddenly he roused and turned his shaggy head . " Telegraphy , " he said . " Telegraphy ? " Sam stammered . " Yes , telegraphy . Why not ? " " But could anyone get rich  --  just doing that ? " " Railroads ! " the Judge exclaimed , and slowly winked his eye . " Railroads everywhere  --  snaking through the grass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam . Learn to build ' cm , buy ' em , sell ' em . But first you learn telegraphy . Railroads need telegraphers  --  hundreds of ' em , Sam . " " Yes sir ? " " Wires strung around like spiderwebs ! People talking through the air , a thousand miles apart , in the twinkling of an eye ! ? Anything can happen ? " He seemed to drift away again , staring through the open window at the lazy summer street . " Well , thanks , Judge  --  thanks a lot ? " Sam was edging toward the door ; his hand was on the knob . " Oh , Sam ? " The old man did not turn his head . " Yes sir ? " " Your mother used to mend my shirts for me  --  sew buttons on and such . I knew her from the day she came to Wyattville  --  the very night she got here on the ' Mary Queen , ' down at the Wyatt House , with your father and the children. , Madge and Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No sir , " Sam said . " Your mother did n't have an easy life ? " He kept on looking through the window . " ? but I never heard her whimper or complain . She was proud and she was plucky . " " Yes sir ? " Sam bit his lip ; the tears were welling in his eyes . " You stop and think , all your way through life , when you 're in doubt  --  what your mother would have said . " " Yes sir , I 'll try . " " All right . " The old man waved his fan but he did n't turn his head : " Now go and learn telegraphy as quickly as you can , and when you get it learned  --  come back and see me , Sam . " " Yes sir , I sure will . " " The railroad 's coming here , to Wyattville . They 're going to build a depot , and they 'll need a bright young fellow to sell the railroad tickets and run the telegraph . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was thumping . " I 'm their lawyer , Sam , and  --  maybe I could fix it for you to get the job . " Gee , thanks , Judge ? " " But learn telegraphy . " " Yes sir , you bet I will . " He went clattering down the stairs in a fever of excitement . He did n't ask : " How am I to learn ? " or " Who will teach me ? " ? did n't hesitate or question : " Would they pay me as much as I 'm getting from Clem Wyatt ? " ? " Yes sir , you bet I will , " was what he said . A decision had been made . He would go on making them , not thoughtlessly nor hastily , but quickly when the need was ; and he would unmake them , too , when their purpose had been served . He was never one to follow a false scent , once its falseness had been recognized , nor to fight for a lost cause , once the odds had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships ; he never threw good money after bad . He had qualities of generalship : initiative , mobility ; he could always change his plan to conform to the actions of the enemy ; he could decide and act . He was a realist , and yet he was not completely that There were times when he looked back , as who does not , to the crossroads that checkered his career . Suppose , for example , that Judge Nicolls had n't been a wise old man , or had n't cared enough to cross-examine him ? ? that he had settled down to study law in that sun-drenched little room with the smell of leather books ? ? with farmers coming in with  | petty lawsuits  --  suits against the railroad which had killed a cow or pig , disputes among themselves over boundaries and fences  --  leases , contracts , and bad debts  --  the dreary , tedious trivia of rural legal practice. ? It was of course unthinkable that this could have been his life  --  any more than going on working for the railroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for anyone in fact except himself , or for anything at all except for money . He would have stayed a while , reading those leather books , and then he would have known that he was wasting time ; and one day he would have quit and gone on to something else ? He learned telegraphy . He bought an instrument and big glass jars for batteries . Clem sent and got them from Chicago at a discount . He went on working at the store , but at night he learned telegraphy . He taught Nelly how to send so that he could learn to take . He would sit with his eyes shut , reading out the letters , and finally the words , which she painfully and inaccurately clicked . " Oh dear ! " she would protest at last . " It makes my fingers ache , and I 'm sick and tired of it . " " Aw shucks ! " And he would demand or plead , " Just a few minutes more . " " But you 'll never get rich doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it all my life . " " Well then , what good is it ? " " You 'll see ? " he would grin , " ? when I get to be the president of a railroad . " " Yes , well when ? " " Come on , Nelly , please  --  just five minutes more . " " I wo n't . It is n't any fun . " " If you want to go to Paris ? " " Oh well ? " She would make a little face and go on tapping at the key . It had come to be a formula . But he learned telegraphy  --  learned it in five months  --  to send and take Morse code with decent speed and accuracy . Early in November he went back to see Judge Nicolls . His birthday had just passed ; he was seventeen years old . 1 le got the job . The pay was sixty dollars  --  almost fifteen a week ; not many men in Wyattville were making more than that . The hours were from seven in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off for dinner and  | another one for supper when he simply closed up shop and locked the door . On Sunday he was free and the depot was not opened . The work was easy . There was nothing much to do but to keep the place swept out and sell occasional tickets or check a drummer 's trunk . Commercial telegrams were rare events in Wyattville in those days . There were records and reports , bills of lading to be made ; but no grave responsibility rested on his shoulders . The line which began at Muscatine , ended at Wyattville ; it was twelve miles in length , with a single train that shuttled back and forth  --  thus reducing to a minimum the danger of collision . The train , which was jocularly called the Plug , arrived at ten-fifteen if it was on time which seldom happened , and returned to Muscatine at four o'clock . It was a " combination " with a coach and several freight cars , carrying passengers and livestock , milk and freight . In between were two small stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Plug lived in Muscatine . The engineer was Mr. Rooney . He was quite old and religious . I Ic seldom left the depot while the train was anchored there , but would putter with his engine , climbing all around it with an enormous oilcan ; or if it was stormy , he would sometimes come inside and talk to Sam . He had spent his life with railroads  --  very pleasantly , it seemed , but with nothing much to show for it . Mr. Bullock , the conductor , was austere and elderly . He had friends in Wyattville with whom he passed the time . Mr. Jones , the fireman , was a grouchy , silent man . He stayed mostly in the engine , reading the Police Gazette or dozing in the cab . The brakeman 's name was Nick . He was young and less substantial , and a frequenter of poolrooms in his leisure . He had nothing much to do  --  no switching cars around , since the train departed backwards with the engine on the rear . At the far end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , twelve miles away in Muscatine , was a young man named O'Gara with whom he was at once on friendly terms . This O'Gara , one might judge , was a gay and blithesome spirit , cracking jokes along the wire , even telling smutty stories , and recounting his adventures with young ladies of the town and lurid anecdotes of blind pigs and poker games . He was generous , too , with questions of more serious import , answering patiently at length any query he received , and repeating endlessly if Sam was still in doubt . It began the very morning that he started . Mr. Butts , the division superintendent who resided in Rock Island , had come over on the Plug to instruct him in his duties , and had left him for a moment to speak to  | Mr. Bullock who was standing on the platform . Sam was in the cubbyhole in the center of the depot , checking bills of lading , when the silent wire spoke for the first time " Hello , sucker . What 's your name ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure that this method of address was unofficial . " Mine 's O'Gara . " " O'Gara , " Sam repeated , adding dutifully , " OK . " " Is old Frizzletop around ? " Sam was stumped . It was explained that Frizzletop was Mr. Butts whose naked dome had been reclaimed with a curly black toupee . " On the platform , " Sam replied in some alarm . " So long . I 'll see you later . " " OK . " The key was silent , and he went back to his bills . But it was n't as simple as it has been presented . O'Gara had a quick and flighty fancy to which the telegraph was not adapted . In defense he had evolved an abbreviated style better suited to his temperamental nature , and which , incidentally , greatly puzzled or defeated casual listeners . Even Mr. Butts whose ear was pretty keen , had been known to listen blandly to a painful description of himself . For example , in the morning , some minutes after nine , something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plgd 9 3 ry brdg admrl bul corn shd ar wyvil abt 2 wks " which reduced to language would have read something like this : " Train 28 departed 9.03 with Rooney on the bridge and Admiral Bullock in command . Should arrive at Wyattville in about two weeks . " This latter prediction was not of course official . " OK , " Sam would reply . Or something of this kind : " o b wht hd the am bg pty 1st nite drk qt crn " which translated : " Oh boy , what a head I 've got this morning ! Was out last night on a big party and drank a quart of liquor . " It took some time and effort to master this technique , but his tutor was patient and indulgent . Whenever he was free he would wire-chat away in his breezy , friendly fashion ; and when he was n't chatting he would leave the key cut open so that everything that he received would come on through to Sam . It was splendid training for him ; with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freight or baggage , he 'd be reading from the wire . O'Gara was frank about himself : he was twenty-five years old and  | had come from Omaha where his father was a house painter . He 'd been working for the railroad for five years , and as far as he could see it was a rotten business  --  no future in the thing and too much red tape about it . Like being in the Army you never got a boost until somebody died , and the guys that held the good jobs would live to be a hundred ; they were too damn tight to die . He had started as a freight clerk and then learned telegraphy , but now he wondered why . The pay was n't bad ? he was getting seventy-five . " How much they paying you ? " he asked abruptly . " Sixty , " Sam replied . " Dirty robbers ! " tapped O'Gara . He said the only chance was to be a train dispatcher at a hundred and a quarter or maybe even more , but then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk for the balance of your life , switching trains around , and if there was a wreck you 'd lose your job . Anyway he knew he 'd never make the grade  --  he liked to take a drink and have a little fun , and it was n't any secret . I le was poison to old Frizzletop who was waiting for a chance to can him out entirely . " And a good thing , too , " he said . " Say , what about yourself ? " Sam told him  --  something . But he lied about his age : he said he was nineteen . He did n't want O'Gara to think he was a kid . Their acquaintance ripened rapidly . Early in December his unseen friend was urging him to come to Muscatine " Come over and we 'll make a night of it . " " Ca n't now . " " Hop the Plug . " " Got to stick around till nine . " " Close up the dump . Nobody 'll know you 're gone . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key snapped shut . But a week or two later he reverted to the subject : " Party framed for Sunday  --  swell girl picked for you  --  come over . " " How ? " " Hire rig . " " Ca n't afford it . " This was n't true ; he was keeping thirty-five out of his sixty . And he would have liked to go , but he did n't want to risk it ? risk a lot of things . He had been in Muscatine  --  once long ago with the Baxters to a circus  --  and though it was no more than a modest country town , he had been much impressed by the shops and busy streets . In fact he was afraid  --  afraid he would n't look or act as city people did . And , too , he had formed a mental picture of O'Gara : a sporty looking  | fellow with a derby hat cocked over his eye and a big cigar gripped in his teeth . And how would he appear in such company as that ? He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made him deathly sick ; and though he occasionally drank a glass of beer , he had not been really drunk and had only tasted whisky " I 'll loan you the price , " the wire clicked . " No thanks . " " Swell girl picked for you  --  real juicy peach . " " I 'd like to . " Even this was but half true . There was only one girl he really cared about . The others might be fun but it would n't be quite fair " Come on . Do n't be a sap . " " Sorry . " He was sorry in a way ; he would have liked to go  --  to wear a derby hat and swagger down the street , and lean against a bar and drink a glass of whisky  --  to meet this juicy peach and take her out ? and see what happened " Well , by God ! " The wire fairly snapped with irritation . " Sorry , really ca n't . " And there was another reason  --  perhaps the most decisive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that he and O'Gara were running round together  --  O'Gara who by his own admission , was already in disgrace and slated to be canned . It was n't any use to take a chance like that " Are you man or mouse ? " " Some other time , " he hedged , but he felt that it was settled . " Oh , go to hell ! " the wire cracked and stopped . But O'Gara was not one to cherish injury , and a few days later he was on another tack : " What kind of girls you got in Wyattvillc ? " " All kinds . " " Pretty ? " " You bet . " " Liberal minded ? " " Maybe . " " Guess I 'll drop over there some day . " " Why do n't you ? " " 1 ' 11 step off the Plug some morning . I 'll wear a red carnation so you 'll know me . " " OK , " Sam answered quickly , but he hoped it would n't happen ? hoped it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be seeing you some day . "  | But O'Gara never came . Jim Braden changed his schedule to fit the changing times and included the depot on his beat . It was rather out of things  --  on the edge of the town west of the Square , not far distant from the school  --  but a lunchroom and some stores grew up around it . Jim would be there on the platform when the train came in , and usually turned up again at four  --  sitting on a baggage truck , whittling a stick , or chatting with old Hogan on the box of Birney 's hack , or if it was cold , he would come inside the waiting room and loaf around the stove . Ile seldom spoke to Sam . Sometimes Mitch dropped in going home from school , and would lean on the counter looking through the wicket " How 's the railroad business , Sam ? " " Getting better every day . " " What 's that thing saying now ? " pointing to the telegraph . " Right now ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liar . I can read it . " " All right . Then what ? " " It says ? " Mitch cocked his ear . " ' Turn again , Whittington , Lord Mayor of London . ' " And he would laugh and maybe kid a while , and wander off . " You wo n't get rich , " he would call back , " not listening to that stuff . " " Oh yeh ? " Sam would shout after him . But he wondered about it all the same . Sometimes Nelly came . At first she was impressed , but then her interest lagged . She did n't see , she said , that the depot or the railroad were combining to assist her to embark on a career , and Paris and New York seemed as far away as ever . She lamented the delay . " Shucks ! " Sam would exclaim . " Ca n't you give a guy a chance ? " She knew about O'Gara and would get around to that , urging Sam to go and take her with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming over there tonight . No , wait , do n't tell him , Sam . We 'll just get off the train and take him by surprise . " " What for ? " " For fun . " She clapped her hands . " We 'll have supper in a restaurant , and maybe there 'll be something at the Opera House  --  a concert or a play . " She had been in Muscatine , with Jane Wyatt several times , and had visited a girl there . " Maybe I 'd meet someone connected with the theater  --  a manager or actor , and he would hear me sing , and then ? Let 's go , Sam , please ? "  | " You 're crazy , Nelly . " " You never want to do anything that 's fun . " " Aw , shucks ! " " You do n't  --  not just because it 's fun. ? Sam , please ? " He shook his head . " All right ? " And she would threaten , " I 'll go alone sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by myself . I 'll tell your friend , O'Gara , that I 've come to have a party and I want to see the sights . " " Go on , get out , I 'm busy . " " Oh well ? " And she would toss her head and slam the depot door when she went out . But she was n't really angry , and not really serious . She was restless , that was all ; she wanted to do something  --  something gay and fabulous , and there was n't anything . Boys liked her , but there was n't anyone she cared about . Once she had imagined that she was in love with Neill , but actually she was n't . He had been a kind of symbol for someone gay and dashing  --  for something that was fun . Drummers , waiting for the train , sometimes chatted with him . They were mostly stodgy men of middle age , red nosed and bibulous , who sold their merchandise over anecdotal bottles . But the age of friendly salesmanship was waning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had crept out upon the road . There were still a few who traveled in black coats and stovepipe hats , but most of them wore shabby suits and fancy checkered vests , with Elk pins on their coat lapels or dangling from their watch chains . There was one , a youngish , enterprising sort of fellow , who seemed to take an interest in Sam . his name was Mr. Brush and he traveled for a general paper jobber located in Chicago . Ile said one time , leaning on the counter , waiting for the Plug to get up steam : " There 's good money to be made selling on the road  --  if you 've got the stuff and price , and no monkey business , see ? " Sam nodded . " No hanging over bars telling smutty stories ; no going home to dinner with your customers and playing with the children ; no jumping home on Sunday half across the state . But tending to your business ? writing orders , see ? " Sam nodded . " No glad-hand stuff ; that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting wise to it . Cut out the social stuff , ' I 've heard ' em say , and let 's get down to business : what 's the price and what 's the terms ? ' " Sam nodded .  | " These old buzzards with their Elk pins and their Masonic badges , they 're on the scrap heap now and they do n't know it . This country 's on the march and it 's got no time for play . Efficiency  --  you got me ? " Sam nodded . " You 're too bright a looking kid to waste your life in this dump . " He shoved a business card beneath the wicket . " If you ever take a notion you might want to make a change  --  well , let me know . " " Gee , thank you , Mr. Brush ? " " All aboard for Muscatine , " Mr. Bullock interrupted from the door . But Sam was thinking hard when the Plug had chugged away : good money to be made selling on the road  --  no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's on the march and it 's got no time for play. ? These were things to think about . Ile put the card away . " Ned G. Brush , " it said . " Acme Paper Company  --  Ilome Insurance Bldg. ? Chicago  --  Illinois . " A few days before Christmas a commercial wire came  --  for Mrs. Henry Wyatt . " Look out ! " O'Gara warned , " This one 's ( cntgs ) contagious . " And started on the message . " Eileen ? " he clicked and stopped , called away to something else . Sam 's heart stood still . He called back wildly . O'Gara finally answered with a note of irritation , " hld yr hrses  --  r u crzy " and he relayed the message : Eileen has mild case of German measles and is quarantined at school . No occasion for concern . Will see that she is comfortable and has happy Christmas . Love to all from all . Daphne German measles  --  that was all ! He breathed again . " Do u knw the doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So Eileen would not be home ! Well , that was that . He had hoped she would come home on the train ; and she would be surprised to find him on the platform  --  not in a grubby apron , weighing sugar , but in charge of things  --  representing the great Rock Island Railroad  --  getting on , in fact. ? He sighed ? Well , it would be next summer ? But he was wrong : it would not be next summer  --  or the next ; it would be a long , long time . He delivered the message on his way to dinner . Mrs. Henry , herself , came to the door " Oh dear ! " she gasped when she saw the yellow envelope .  | " It 's nothing , " Sam assured her . " Just measles that she 's got . " " Oh dear ? " She read the message , and then she stared at him . " But , Sam , how did you know ? " He grinned . " I have to read ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , of course ? " She smiled a little vaguely . Telegrams were not too common even then , in Wyattville . He wrote a letter to Eileen , telling how he 'd known about her measles sooner than her mother , about what he was doing and how he was getting on  --  warmly sympathetic and carefully composed . And he got a scrawly , hasty note in answer : it was certainly amusing that he 'd got the telegram  --  nobody could keep secrets from him now  --  she was n't really sick and it was rather fun  --  that sort of thing . He did not write again . It was better just remembering The day before Christmas Tom came home . Sam was standing on the platform when he swung down from the car  --  the only passenger . Jim was there , leaning with his back against the depot wall , whittling a stick . It was a dreary , frosty morning , thick with mist , and the steam from the engine blowing white along the train ? At first he was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped whittling now and was looking toward the coach  --  at the man who had got off and was slowly coming nearer , dragging his feet as if he had been sick , and not carrying a valise or anything at all , and without an overcoat " Hello ? " Tom said with a kind of sickly grin . His face was thin and white , and his clothes were almost ragged . " Hello ? " Sam answered , and not knowing what to do , called back to his father . " Pa , it 's Tom . " Jim waited , watching them . " Hello ? " Tom said again . " Hello ? " There was no change in Jim 's face ; he was just waiting . " I been sick , Pa ? " " Yeh ? " Jim closed his knife and put it in his pocket . " I 'm down to my last cent ? " " Yeh ? " " Would you mind if I came home ? ? just till I get my strength back . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pa . " " All right , " Jim said without any trace of feeling . But Sam 's eyes were moist with tears , looking at them and remembering They walked away together down the street .  | Tom 's health recovered quickly . For a week he loafed around the house , having breakfast in his bed at nine or ten o'clock . His contrition was skin deep , and he was rough and boastful  --  bragging of the winners he had trained and of the easy money that had sifted through his pockets . He had been around a bit and seen the country , and he spoke of Wyattville as a " stinking little burg . " The girls were silent in his presence ; the household was upset ; everybody was uncomfortable . He treated Sam with some respect and got ten dollars from him  --  to buy some clothes , he said . But his clothes remained unchanged ; the money went for whisky , and he came home late at night , stumbling on the stairs . He had resumed relations with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In time he got around to make another touch . Ile said there was a job waiting for him in Chicago , as soon as he was strong enough to take it  --  with a stable that was wintering at the Hawthorne track . There would be good money in it ; he would send Sam 's ten to him and the price of the bike which he still owed Sam nodded ; he was reading . It was in the evening and there was no one in the room at the moment but themselves . " Say , Sam ? " " What ? " " Could you let me have another ten spot ? " " What for ? " " Well , I 'm feeling pretty good and I think it 's time I was getting back to work . I 'm figuring to pull out most any day now , and I 'll need a little cash to get me back to Chi . " Sam did n't answer ; he was thinking . " A ten spot ought to do it . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Chi without a cent . " " No . " Sam shook his head . " Well , make it five . Maybe I could manage . " " No . " " You do n't want me camping here forever . " Sam was silent . " You wo n't lose your money . Say , I 'll pay you interest on it . " " No . " He kept on looking at the page that he was reading . " But I 'll tell you what I 'll do ? " " Yeh ? What ? " " I 'll buy your railroad ticket to Chicago . "  | " You 're pretty smart , " Tom said . But in a week or two he closed the deal and left . Jim was on the platform when the train pulled out . The days and weeks and months slid by . Sam was diligent and punctual , polite and competent ; the Rock Island Railroad 's interests in the town of Wyattville were scrupulously cared for . Mr. Butts came rarely and when he did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plug chugged back and forth with Rooney on the bridge and Bullock in command ; and O'Gara wire-chatted contemporary comment on railroad life in general and his personal affairs , growing steadily more caustic as the time passed . He was bloody sick of Muscatine , he said ? of camping in the sticks in one-horse towns ; it was very dull and boring ; the peaches he had nourished had developed into lemons , and left him with no solace but the bottle ; old Frizzletop was dogging him and watching like a hawk , waiting for a chance to set the skids . He kept hinting ominously that the end was not far off But the months fled away . It was one day in June when the wire , announcing the departure of the Plug without the customary humorous comment , added briefly and tersely : " Am canned . " " Repeat , " demanded Sam , startled and confused . " Have got the skids . Am fired . " " When ? " " Right now " ' What for ? " " Slight misunderstanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garbled a message concerning disposition of a private car containing the vice-president in charge of operations , and the car had stood all night on a siding near Rock Island . It was possible , he added , he had been a little drunk as he could n't remember much about it . " Are you kidding ? " Sam was horrified . But the wire hurried on , ignoring this : there had been hell to pay ; old Frizzletop , himself , had almost lost his job . He had come in pale and trembling and given him the gate  --  to take effect at once , this very day ; and then had jumped the Plug as it was pulling out . " Maybe break for you , " O'Gara clicked . " What will you do ? " Sam queried , but his heart was beating fast : Mr. Butts was on the way to Wyattville " Hopping 21 for Chi this afternoon . " " Awfully sorry . "  | " What the hell ! " There was a pause . " Be seeing you sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . Sam was waiting on the platform when the Plug pulled in . His hair was neatly combed ; his shoes were shined ; but his hands were moist with sweat . Mr. Butts swung down from the engine cab where he had been riding , and motioned him to come into the office . He did look kind of pale and shaken up " Sam , " he said abruptly , " how soon could you get ready to go to Mus-catine ? " " To Muscatine , sir ? " He went through the motion of reflecting ; his heart was stepping up . " When the Plug goes back this afternoon . " " No , no , " Mr. Butts frowned irritably . " I mean , to stay there  --  to fill O'Gara 's job . " " Oh ? " Sam nodded , remembering to look decently surprised . " Well , I could go this afternoon . " " To take the job and stay there , " Mr. Butts insisted . " Yes sir , I understand . " " All right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " Go on home and pack your things . You 've got the job . " VI LIFE PROCEEDS AT AN UNEVEN PACE , IN JERKS AND SPURTS , LIKE GROWING plants and children . It rushes headlong for a while and then it seems to stop . It is not unlike a river , tearing through a narrow channel over shoals and treacherous rocks , and then abruptly spreading out into a placid stream , ripples slowly on its way  --  or , trapped in an eddy near the shore , may actually flow backwards for a time . It is good that there are eddies  --  periods in which there is nothing to remember , when the picture is blurred by the softness of the colors , when the sunshine is not bright and the shadows are not black  --  when nothing happens . But of course something is happening all the same , but so gently and persuasively that one is unaware of it . Life does not really stop , though now and again it rests upon its oars  --  preparing perhaps for fresh acceleration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later years scarcely any memory of his life in Muscatine , except for those events which came close upon the end of it and were , in fact , not part of it at all . The town became confused with all the other towns in and out of which he subsequently hurried , selling paper on the road . And the people that he met , with two or three exceptions , had a nebulous identity ; he would get them mixed with others that came later , and remember them as being somewhere else  --  in Peoria or Moline or Davenport . He had come into an eddy and drifted to a pause , circling round and round ; and unconsciously he must have been aware of it  --  that progress was arrested , that he was n't getting on . Perhaps his faulty memory was a recognition of it ? an intuitive rejection of people and events unworthy of retention . But consciously he could not have suspected such a thing . He had been promoted to a better job  --  or so , on the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he had moved from a small town to a relatively big one . The illusion of succession was a convincing one . Yet he was in an eddy , and one that could be fatal if he stayed in it too long , or if he failed to understand its purpose  --  as a breathing spell to think and look around , to carefully weigh the values and come to a conclusion  --  to change his course or hold it , but not hurriedly or rashly That first night in Muscatine he would remember  --  the first night in his life he had spent away from home . Mr. Butts had seen to that , had gotten him a room in a hotel and paid for it , himself , saying that tomorrow he could take an hour off and find a place to live , and then had left him there in what seemed to him luxurious magnificence , though in truth it was a cheap and shabby place . And he had gone to bed , afraid to venture forth into the street , afraid to go downstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desk , afraid of making some mistake . He had been so excited and elated  --  and then suddenly so homesick and so wretched He would not forget that night  --  not the pattern of the paper on the wall , nor the washbowl on the stand , nor the gaslight he extinguished and then went back to sniff , in terror lest he had not turned it off , nor the poolroom which his open window faced  --  the clicking of the balls and drunken voices , and the stifling muggy heat rising wetly from the river But he did not remember the second night at all  --  not the name of the woman who rented him a room and agreed to do his laundry at no additional cost , nor much about the room except the price and the fact that it opened on the kitchen and was warm , the deciding factor in his  | choice . He remembered what it cost to live in Muscatine and was likely to mention it when speaking of the past : about ten a week if he was very careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to the theater  --  there was a third-rate stock company in town , playing in the Opera House ; he would have good reason to remember that  --  well , even though a ticket cost only fifty cents , it would upset his budget . But he did go to the theater now and then ? " Sappho , " " Trilby , " " A Texas Steer " ? they did a different play each week  --  tragedy and comedy , incredibly performed , but new to him and wonderful . Every month he sent Madge fifteen dollars  --  a sum they had discussed and determined to be fair , and every month there would be something left to deposit in Old Henry Wyatt 's bank  --  until toward the end when Nelly got to coming and staying over Sunday , and then some months he did n't save a cent . He ate in a lunchroom opposite the depot where the train crews took their meals . There was a girl who worked there as a waitress  --  a girl called Jo , for Josephine perhaps . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was older than he was  --  almost everybody thought so , including Mr. Butts . He had reason to remember her , but he never could recall her face  --  what she had looked like , beyond that she was small and dark and pretty . But the people at the depot left no imprint on his mind , possibly because they were jealous and unfriendly , envious of his youth and his pull with Mr. Butts . Still , they had not liked O'Gara who had always spoken of them with humorous contempt . There was a station agent and a freight clerk , and a night operator who came on at six o'clock and who really hated Sam because he thought he should have had the job  --  a lazy , shiftless fellow . None of them were young ; they were sour , disappointed little men  --  drifting in an eddy whence there would be no escape until they died . And it may be that unconsciously he sensed that and forgot them , as one who has no time to take note of futile things . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking the variety of Wyattville where whatever was to do , he had had to do , himself . Here in Muscatine he sat all day in the stuffy cubbyhole in the center of the depot , with an eyeshade on his forehead , facing the window which looked out across the platform  --  listening to the wire , sending and receiving , writing endless messages , official and commercial , on sheets of yellow paper . To be sure there were periods of leisure , like the ones in which O'Gara had found time to wire-chat , but he had no one to chat with and was not the chatting sort .  | Trains came and went , but they were only numbers ; they had no personalities  --  not like the Plug whose wheezy chug and flattened wheels were friendly and familiar . Mr. Rooney hurried home when he got down from his engine , and the drummers did not linger in the depot . Folks from Wyattville would sometimes pause to greet him and exchange a word or two ; and about once a month Mr. Brush would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How they coming , son ? " or something of that kind . And he would answer cheerfully , " Just fine ? " " Still like the railroad business ? " " You bet . " He was sure that he did , but he was n't very happy , though he could n't have said why  --  not then , not yet . " Well , when you get a bellyful  --  remember what I told you . " " Yes sir , I sure will . " The first few weeks he kept watching for Eileen  --  every train arriving from the East . She 'd be coming home from school any moment now , he thought . But one day a message came from Wyattville , addressed to Neill Wyatt in Chicago : Are you coming for a visit as you promised ? Love . Eileen . So that was it ! She must have gone home on the boat  --  as , indeed , she had ; she always took the " Mary Queen , " as long as it kept running . A lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentiment perhaps . He clicked the message on , pressing , hard upon the key . Old Neill Wyatt ? always butting into things ! ? Late in the afternoon an answer came : Awfully sorry . Must go Boston for college entrance exams . Love . Neill . And that was that . Old Neill was n't coming for a visit after all , but was going to Boston with all the other dudes , to gallivant around and waste his time . Likely enough he had never meant to come  --  just stalling her along . She 'd get sick of that sometime  --  of being such a sucker . He even felt a little sorry for her . He thought he would invite her to come over  --  to the theater , but she 'd have to stay all night in a hotel and he did n't know just how to manage that , and it would be expensive . And then he thought he 'd rent a rig and drive over there some Sunday , and take her for a drive  --  maybe out to Beaton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best price he could get was two dollars and a half , and he kept postponing it until it was too late .  | Mitch turned up one day on some business for his father , and stood outside the window , tapping on the glass  --  pretended dots and dashes . Sam pushed the window up . " Hello ? " he said . " I was telegraphing to you . Did you get it ? " " Do n't make me laugh . " " Shall I tell you what it said ? " " Yeh , go ahead ? " But he looked around to see there was no one within earshot . " It said ? " Mitch grinned maliciously . " ? Sam Braden 's getting on ? like a monkey in the zoo . Next time they promote him they 'll put bars outside his cage . " " You go to hell ! " Sam said good-naturedly , and added quickly , " You 're not going back till morning , are you , Mitch ? " " Not unless I walk . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? you can spend the night with me . I 'll be off at six o'clock . We can have supper , Mitch , and take in the theater , eh ? " " Can I do it for a dollar ? " " Yep , you bet . " " All right . I got to see a creditor , but I 'll be back at six . " Sam had a beer or two and Mitch had several , in the blind pig next the lunchroom , before they went to supper . Mitch was a little drunk ; he kept singing the song about " working on the railroad " with words which he made up and which were not complimentary to that kind of occupation . In the lunchroom he took out his eye and made the waitress laugh , and even some trainmen who were eating at the counter . He was really very funny , but Sam was almost sorry he 'd got into it . The girl named Jo  --  he had hardly spoken to her except to give his order , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was leaning on the counter , kidding back and forth with Mitch , as if she had known him all her life . " Say , cutie , " Mitch was saying , " what time do you get loose ? " " What 's that to you ? " " Well , I 'm going to a show and I 'll let you keep my eye till I get back . " " Oh yeh ? " she giggled , leaning closer . The edge of the counter pulled her dress down tight across her breasts  --  small , round breasts with the outline of the nipples in the cloth . " If you leave your eye around I 'm going to pickle it . "  | " It 's pickled now , " Mitch said . She threw her head way back and laughed . " Say , you 're a funny guy . " " What time do you get loose ? " " Suppose I did n't tell you ? " " I can wait until you do . " A lot of stuff like that while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering what he 'd do if Mr. Butts walked in . But finally she told him she was through at eight o'clock . " Let 's take a walk , " Mitch said . " Where to ? " " Out in the woods . " " Say , what do you think I am ? " But she was laughing . It was really pretty raw  --  saying things like that to a girl you had never seen before . " Well ? " Mitch considered , " I 'll tell you what we 'll do : we 'll take old Sam along . " " Shucks ? " Sam mumbled in his plate . " What for ? " she asked . " I 'll tell you , " Mitch explained , " it wo n't be any fun , but it 's sure to be safe . " " How come ? " She was laughing , watching Sam . " Sam 's got no time for fooling . He 's a business fellow , see ? " " I 've seen plenty of those guys ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't call ' cm safe . " " Well , you and Sam go walking , and find out for yourself . " " Aw , cut it out , " lie muttered , beginning to he angry . And then she said , half serious , but laughing , " Go on , quit picking on him . " " Quit picking on him ? ? Why ? " " Because I like him , see ? " He looked up with a start and met her eye , and then she looked away and back at Mitch . " I see ? " said Mitch , affecting to be crushed . " The silent , steady man gets the gravy every time . You mean , you do n't like me ? " " Sure , I do , " she said . " You 're funny  --  you 're a scream . " " A funny guy ! " He groaned . " That 's all I get . " He reached and grabbed her wrist . " You take a walk with me and I 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She jerked away . " You 're pretty fresh . " She was n't laughing now , and she was watching Sam from the corner of her eye .  | " All right ? " Mitch grinned . " Some do ; some do n't . And you ca n't be hung for trying . " They took her to the theater  --  or anyway Mitch did , though Sam paid for her ticket ; and then they took her home . That was the beginning . You could n't go back to " veal stew and apple pie , please , " to " good morning " and " good night " ? not after that . And he was really glad that Mitch had cracked the ice He said next day , making conversation lamely , " Old Mitch is quite a fellow ? " " Sure , he 's all right . " She shrugged , leaning on the counter , her dress pulling tight across her breasts . " But you never get nowhere with them guys . They ai n't ? " She hesitated for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yeh ? " Sam nodded . " I mean they 're always kidding  --  or , if they ai n't , you never know . " " I guess that 's right , " he said . He kept watching as she moved behind the counter , kind of switching with her hips . Her ankles made him think of Cassie He came in late that evening and contrived to finish supper a few moments before eight . " Do you mind if I walk home with you ? " he asked . " Okay by me , " she answered carelessly . They strolled along the darkening empty street in the hot summer night . He took her arm . Her hip kept brushing his , and presently he ventured to slip his arm around her , but she slid away and put it back through hers . He let it go at that ; he thought she meant it . She did n't act like Cassie  --  teasing him along . They strolled on slowly , conversing in strained , half-finished sentences  --  not kidding , very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mind . She told him of herself : she was the daughter of a section foreman ; her mother was dead and her father had remarried ; her home life was n't happy  --  she wished she could get out of it " I 'm sick of being poor , " she said . " Yeh , I know , " he nodded earnestly . " I would n't want a lot , " she added quickly . " I 'm not such a sucker to think I could be rich . But just something of my own ? " " Yeh , sure , " he agreed . He left her at the door of the shabby little house , unpainted and rundown . He did n't try to kiss her . But after that , every other night or so , he would wait till eight o'clock ? sitting at the far end of the counter , reading the paper or some book  | he was carrying in his pocket . And they 'd go out together  --  or , if there was someone from the depot in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the corner till she came . There was nothing much to do . Usually they simply walked around . Two or three times he took her to the theater , but she did n't ask or urge it . He had told her that he had to be careful of his money , that he had to send some home , and to save a little , too , for he meant to get along ? to get somewhere in the world " Sure , that 's okay , " she said . " That 's only being smart . " She clung closer to his arm , laughing softly in the dark . " We can have fun  --  for nothing . " She never asked for anything , not even for a soda or a bag of candy . A few times on rainy evenings they dropped in at a church  --  at some prayer meeting or something . It was a place to sit under cover of a roof , and they sat close together , holding hands . He kept saying that they 'd get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thinking about Cassie , and snugly hidden shelters , and the rows between the corn ; but he never quite got to the point . And she always said she did n't care . She was content to stroll  --  or just to sit . Sometimes they strolled through a vacant piece of ground known as the Park , with sycamores and unkept yellow grass , and a few murky light bulbs obscured by swarms of gnats  --  dark , and deserted save for occasional couples like themselves . They would sit on a bench making imitation love , holding hands and kissing  --  and going somewhat further as the summer waned , but never to the end he sought . She was compliant to a point , but then she would abruptly disengage his hands and slide away , good-humoredly but firmly . They never argued or discussed it . But one night  --  it was toward the end of summer , hot and sticky , with the moon swimming in and out behind a gathering storm  --  she slapped his hands aside and jerked away with unconcealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're all alike , I guess . " He did n't answer , still breathless from his effort and aching with frustration  --  his shirt soaked through with sweat . " You only want one thing out of a girl . You ai n't satisfied to have a little fun . " He leaned back , staring at the moon . " Well , if that 's what you want , you 're wasting time . " And still he did n't answer .  | " Come on . " She got up , shaking out her rumpled skirt , holding out her hand in a placative gesture . " Come on , Sam , let 's go home ? " They walked in silence . Once she took his hand , but there was no response and after a moment she released it . She was crying when they reached the house  --  but softly to herself . He would not have known it except for the teardrops in her eyes which the moonlight fleetingly revealed . " I 'm sorry , dear , " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had suddenly gone cold and deadly tired . " It would n't get us nowhere . You 'd get sick of it  --  and me , in a little while . " He nodded , hardly listening  --  wondering what he could have seen in her  --  why he was there ? " I 'm too fond of you , I guess ? " She sighed and shivered . The storm was coming and a cool , clean wind swept through the street . " It 's going to rain , " he said . But she clung to his arm with her eyes upon his face . " Are you mad at me , Sam ? " " No , I 'm not mad . " " Well ? " But still she held his arm which was quivering with impatience . " Will you be around tomorrow ? " " Yeh , I guess so . " Lightning cut the sky and thunder rumbled . " I better beat it home , " he said . " Sam ! ? Ai n't you going to kiss me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So long ? " he called , almost running down the street . And it was over . He went out with her again , but it was over . Now and then he waited for her , as he had , but more often he left early , inventing casual pretexts ? matters at the depot , and some nights he ate his supper in another lunchroom . She did not reproach him or ask him where he 'd been ; if he came and waited for her , she was glad . And he came and waited for her because he was alone  --  because habits are difficult to break . They strolled about the streets , arms linked or holding hands , but they never went out to the Park again Their relationship had changed , was awkward and constrained  --  no longer anything . He had wanted something which had been denied ; and she had been asked for something which she would n't give. ? Why ? ? She had very likely given it before  --  would have given it again to  | someone else  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not in love with her . When two people reach a situation of this kind , there is no answer  --  no middle ground on which it is possible to meet . Whatever may have been is over . The fact that , in later years , he could not recall her face  --  what she had looked like , testifies perhaps how completely it was finished , and rejected as unworthy of retention . At all events he came and waited for her less frequently , then rarely . And when Nelly started coming in October  --  coming over on the Plug on Saturday and going back on Monday  --  after that he only saw her once or twice . All summer long Nelly had been threatening to come to Muscatine . She had graduated from the high school , and had been writing to him ever since , saying she was bored with Wyattville , wasting her life , doing nothing with her voice , and soon she 'd be too old ( she was nineteen ) . She wanted to come and live with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the laundry , everything in fact . An arrangement of this kind would be a great economy and better for his health : he would have no board to pay and no greasy lunchroom food , and a cozy home to live in . She said that in a place like Muscatine she could certainly find someone to begin her vocal training , for the present anyway  --  a sort of preparation for Paris or New York . Her tuition would cost nothing ; she could find some work to do to pay for that . She wanted to come and talk it over ? " or you come home , " she wrote . " You could come any Sunday , just drive over in a rig . " It was one of the reasons he had not gone home  --  had kept postponing it . He had no notion what to do with Nelly , and well-grounded apprehension of her economic reasoning . It was lx ) und to be expensive ; and , too , what would she do in Muscatine ? As for keeping house and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , the girl with whom he was going out  --  not a girl he 'd want to introduce to Nelly . She was all right , of course , he told himself ; but the nature of his interest ? well , it simply would n't do . He would have to break it off if Nelly came , and he did n't want to break it off  --  not then . He kept writing her to wait , evading things , promising to come and then finding an excuse . " You are acting like a pig , " she wrote him in September . " But I 'm coming anyway . I 'll come over on the Plug and take you by surprise. ? Your loving sister  --  Nelly . " He let this slide . He did n't think she 'd do it , but she did .  | One Saturday , early in October , when the Plug came in at five o'clock , he looked up in response to a tapping on the glass , and there she was  --  very pretty and excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window up and kissed her " You need n't look so cross , " she said . " I did n't come to stay . " " Well , shucks ? " He tried to smile . " I came to talk things over . I 'm going back on Monday . " " Yeh , well ? " He felt relieved . " I 'll be through at six o'clock . " She waited for him in the empty waiting room , flushed and happy and excited , with a battered old valise she had borrowed from Jane Wyatt . He got a room for her in the house in which he lived , explaining their relationship with elaborate casualness , and then they went to supper in a lunchroom  --  a Greek place where he had been going lately . The food was cheap and bad , but Nelly was in raptures about everything ? conclusive evidence , if evidence be needed , of the truth of relativity . " I love it here , " she said , finishing a fragment of soggy apple pie . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure ? " he agreed , but he was pretty sick of it  --  of the town and of the food , of a kind of lonely emptiness  --  really of his job , of the eddy he was in , though he had n't reached the point of knowing that . And he thought : it was pleasant sitting here with Nelly , listening to her gay and eager voice , watching shifting fancies sparkle in her eyes , forgetting for a moment life was real He asked about Eileen . Nelly shrugged an answer : Eileen had come and gone ; she had seen her once or twice  --  nothing to remember . Yes , she had asked about him  --  like everybody else . Old Henry had been ill ; he had had a minor stroke , but was up and out again . Elliott had been there , but not Daphne or the boys . Jim was just the same and Madge was well ; they had had no word from Tom . She finished Wyattville in one long breath ; there were more important matters  - -  She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle what to do about herself . She could n't just go on the way poor Madge had done , giving up her life for nothing ; and she would n't be a schoolteacher  --  no , not for anything . She had a voice , and dramatic talent , too  --  everybody said so ; and it would be a crime to let it go to waste He nodded , balancing a spoon across his coffee cup . She hurried on : she had put off a decision as long as she could stand it  --  even coming on the Plug , she had not made up her mind . But now  | that she was here she felt sure of herself  --  was certain she was right . She was not going back to Wyattville He moved uncomfortably . " I mean , " she added hastily , " not to settle down and stay  --  the way it has been , Sam . " And she went on to explain that , coming on the train , she had had an inspiration  --  such a simple solution to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never thought of it before , and about which there could not be any question of expense " Yeh , what ? " he asked suspiciously . " Just this , " she said . " I can find someone to teach me , who could give me one lesson every week  --  on Sunday , do n't you see ? " On Sunday ? Why ? " " Well , then I 'd come on Saturday and go home Monday morning . " " Oh ? " " It would n't cost a thing except the railroad fare , and the lesson and my room and what I 'd eat . And I 'd have all week to practice . " " I see ? " He nodded doubtfully , adding figures in his mind . " Sam ! " " What ? " " You could help me that much , could n't you ? " " Well , maybe , Nelly ? " " I can look for a teacher . I can look all day tomorrow . " " Yeh , but where ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her about it . " " Well , well see ? " he said , and changed the subject . " Say , how would you like to take in a theater , eh ? " " A theater ? " She caught her breath . You mean , go to a play ? " " At the Opera I house ? " he nodded . " But  --  wo n't it cost a lot ? " " I guess I could stand it  --  for a kind of celebration . " " Oh , Sam ? " was all that she could say , almost in tears . The play was " Camille . " The leading man whose horselike face adorned a poster in the lobby , bore the romantic name of Wilfred Ashby . He was not young and beginning to be bald ; such hair as he retained was dyed jet black and hung down in the back across his collar . He played Armand ; he played the leading man in every play  --  from " Hamlet " to " The Count of Monte Cristo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad acting . Sam had seen him many times and had begun to doubt his mugging and his ranting . He had asked Mitch what  | he thought and Mitch had held his nose , but Mitch was being funny . As a matter of fact Wilfred Ashby was a ham of the first magnitude . His wife was in the company  --  a faded blonde , billed on the program as Miss Margaret Liscomb . She appeared in minor roles  --  maids and things like that . And they had a child , an anemic looking boy of five or six , named for his father but called Willie , and occasionally presented to the public when a child was indicated in the script . Otherwise he could usually be found in the Ashby dressing room , next to that of Miss Cynthia Cavendish , the leading lady , playing on the floor or curled up in a corner fast asleep . Miss Cavendish , in her own way , was as bad as Wilfred Ashby , but she lacked the vocal strength to be as noisy . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they played was a battle to the death . The curtain rose Nelly clutched his arm . She had never seen a play before  --  just barnstorming troupes that paused in Wyattville , presenting " ' Ihc Two Orphans " or " Uncle Tom 's Cabin " in the Masonic I tall where you sat on folding chairs and had to lean to see around the big stoves on the floor  --  nothing resembling this : an opera house with scenery and real actors . She hardly spoke . They sat through the intermissions , munching chocolates from a paper bag . He mentioned the other plays he 'd seen ? he had been going almost every week " Just think of that ? " she breathed , " ? being able to do that . " He went on talking , acting like a host , explaining that Miss Liscomb was really Mrs. Ashby and about their little boy , and he ventured to express a fleeting doubt of Wilfred 's acting . " Do n't you think , " he suggested , " that he hits it pretty hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had been dreaming . " I mean , " Sam said , " he keeps worrying at the thing  --  like a dog that 's got a bone . " " Oh , Sam ! How can you say a thing like that ? " " I only meant ? " " Please do n't ? " She pinched his hand . " I think he 's simply wonderful . " " Well , maybe ? " he conceded . " But if I had to choose between them , I 'd sooner take Miss Cavendish . " " Sam , do n't ! " She drew away . " I would n't say that even in a joke . Why , just look at the way he holds you in his hand ! " " Yeh ? " Sam admitted , " that 's what I thought at first . But ? "  | " Hush ! " She clutched his arm . " It 's starting ? " The curtain rose and fell , and rose and fell " Oh dear , " she sighed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears . Camille was dead  --  dead in her lover 's arms . But behind the curtain she was very much alive , confronting him with passionate fury " You clumsy brute , " she hissed . " You poked me in the stomach with your elbow . " " Mr. Ginsberg ! " Wilfred Ashby recoiled a step , calling to a dirty looking man who was crossing through the set . " Mr. Ginsberg , if you please ? " He spoke with elaborate restraint . He was a little drunk . " What 's the matter , Mr. Ashby ? " the dirty man asked wearily . But Miss Cavendish resumed in a high-pitched , shaky voice : " He poked me in the stomach . It 's the second time this week . He wants to hog the scene so he knocks the breath out of me ? " " Now , Now , Miss Cavendish ? " the dirty man said soothingly . " Mr. Ginsberg ? " Wilfred Ashby crossed his arms . " ? I have played with Modjeska , with Olga Nethersole , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been subjected to such insult . There is nothing in my contract to oblige me to submit ? " " Now , now , Mr. Ashby ? " Miss Cavendish took the stage again . " I 'm accustomed , " she said , " to appear with gentlemen . " You hear that , Mr. Ginsberg ? " demanded Wilfred Ashby . " Now , Mr. Ashby , Miss Cavendish do n't mean ? " " Yes , I do , " she stormed . " And the next time it happens I shall cancel this engagement . I shall return to Broadway . " " To where ? " inquired Wilfred , as if he thought he must have misunderstood her words . " To Broadway , " shrieked Miss Cavendish . Wilfred shrugged and spread his hands in a gesture of indulgence , and he looked up at the fly loft , murmuring sadly to himself , " What could she do on Broadway ? " " You dirty cad ! " Miss Cavendish replied , and fled weeping to her dressing room where she found her colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some beer . " I guess she 's tired ? " Mr. Ginsberg ventured . " Tired , Mr. Ginsberg ? " Wilfred smiled with lofty condescension . " I would say she was exhausted  --  I would say , completely spent  --  as limp  | as a rag , without a spark of life . She was born that way in fact . Why , I have to carry her through every scene . " " Yeh ? " Mr. Ginsberg nodded wearily . " But you better try not to poke her in the stomach . " And he hurried away into the wings . It was just then , to be exact , that Nelly spoke . They had been walking slowly and in silence . It was a fine , crisp , moonlit night " Sam ? " " What ? " " Perhaps I 'll be an actress after all ? " " An actress ? " He was startled , though being an actress no longer seemed immoral  --  or at least not as immoral as it had in Wyattville . " But I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , of course I do , " she said . " But you have to be an actress if you want to sing in opera . " " Oh yeh ? " he nodded , yawning . " It 's just a question which comes first . If I learn to act , I 'll be that far ahead . Then I could act in plays until my voice was trained . " " Well , I do n't know , " he said , not quite sure what he might be getting into . " But do n't you see ? " Her nimble fancy was accelerating . " ? I 'll be getting paid for that , for acting on the stage  --  earning money for myself . How much do they get paid ? " He shook his head . " An actress like Miss Cavendish ? " " I do n't know , Nelly . " " Well , anyway , I 'd get as much as she does . And I 'd only act in the theater in New York , so that all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You wo n't need to help me , Sam . I 'll have money enough to pay everything myself . " " Uh-huh  --  - " He nodded , beginning to be sleepy . " Perhaps I could help you . I 'll be meeting lots of people  --  influential ones . You could give up this stupid railroad business and come on to New York . We 'd rent a little flat ? " " Say , wait a minute , Nelly . " He shook himself awake . " Somebody 's got to teach you how to act . " " Well , yes ? " she admitted with a sigh . " But it ca n't be very hard if a person has the talent . " She was silent for a moment . " Sam ! " " What ? " " No , never mind . " She shook her head , smiling to herself . " I was just thinking about something ? "  | They had late breakfast in the lunchroom , a habit he had formed to reduce the Sunday meals . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelly was as gay as ever but she did n't eat much breakfast . She said she was n't hungry . After breakfast he suggested they might stroll around awhile and drop in at a church . But she said she must go and see her friend  --  the girl she knew , and inquire about teachers , and maybe call on some . It would probably take most of the day " All right , " he agreed , secretly relieved . He 'd been wondering what to do to entertain her . He said she need n't hurry , he 'd be waiting at home when she got back . She left him in the lunchroom , waving gaily from the door " I 'll have something to report ? " " Good luck , " he called , but he really was n't thinking much about it . It was almost suppertime when she burst into his room where he was sitting , reading . She was flushed and so excited she could hardly speak " Sam ! " " What ? " He looked up from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what 's the matter with you ? " " The most wonderful thing ? " " Wonderful ? ? Well , what ? " " Guess where I 've been . " " Shucks , I do n't know . " " Who I 've been talking to . " " Well , who ? " I le was accustomed to her wild enthusiasms which usually turned out not to amount to much . " No , guess ! " she urged . " Just sitting talking to , the way I would to you  --  or anyone . " Admiral Dewey , " he suggested . " Please do n't make fun . It 's serious  --  the most serious thing that ever happened to me . " " All right , " he said . " Then who ? " " Wilfred Ashby , Sam . " " What ? " He got up from his chair . " Yes , Wilfred Ashby  --  in the Opera House . " " You 're joking . " " No , I 'm not . " " I lave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait ! You do n't understand . He 's going to teach me , Sam . " " Teach you ? ? Teach you what ? "  | " Teach me to be an actress . " " Well , shucks ? " " I thought of it last night when we were coming home . It just popped into my mind , but I did n't dare to dream ? " " You mean you went to see him  --  in the theater ? " " Right in his dressing room . " " Nelly ! " " Oh , you need n't look so shocked . I did n't go alone , and anyway his wife and little boy were there . And what difference would it make ? with a perfect gentleman like Mr. Ashby ? " " Go on , " he said . She explained in eager , breathless words : she had taken Rita with her ? Rita was her friend . They had gone to the matinee , sitting in the gallery ; it was pretty far away but it did n't matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they had gone to a back door in the alley , to which they had been directed , walking twice around the block before they mustered courage Sam groaned and shook his head . They had knocked but no one answered and so they had walked in ? right onto the stage , with scenery and everything just the way it had been when Camille had passed away , but very dimly lighted  --  almost dark . Rita had been frightened and had wanted to run back , but a dirty-looking man had suddenly appeared and asked them what they wanted . And when they told him , he had showed them where to go ? down a dingy , narrow hall with several doors , to Mr. Ashby 's dressing room . And they had knocked again , shaking in their shoes , and Mr. Ashby 's voice had told them to come in . But Rita had lost her nerve and run back to the alley , and she had gone in alone " Oh , Sam , " she breathed , " he 's wonderful . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mirror , rubbing something on his face , but had gotten up to greet her just as friendly as could be but so courtly in his manner  --  like Armand in the play . He had introduced his wife who was doing up her hair and had not had much to say  --  a sour-looking woman , not young and even plainer than she seemed upon the stage ? not at all the kind of person you would think he would have fancied . The little boy was playing with some bottles on the floor , building them like blocks " Yeh , " Sam said , " go on . " " Well , everything is settled . " " Settled ? ? How ? "  | " I mean ? " She plunged into it again : she had told him her ambition ? why she had dared to come and intrude upon his kindness ; and at first he had laughed lightly , but not making fun of her . He explained he did n't teach  --  really could n't spare the time , unless , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded cultivation , which could not be ignored . Then he asked her to go on  --  just to keep on talking to him , about anything at all . And all the time she could see that he was watching her  --  watching in the minor from the corner of his eye ? making up his mind ? She paused dramatically . " Go on , " Sam prompted . " I met the test , " she cried with a gesture that Wilfred might have envied . " He 's taken me to be his pupil . " It had worked out perfectly : Mr. Ashby was busy with rehearsals every day  --  every day but Sunday . He would give her lesson before the matinee  --  in the theater , on the stage . They would have it to themselves , there would be no one around . And he would give her parts which she could learn at home . And on Saturday nights she could come and see the play , and again two times on Sunday , both matinee and evening , to study his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this would cost her nothing  --  she would be there as his guest , with her brother or anyone she chose as a companion . He would see that seats were waiting in her name . If there was any question she must ask for Mr. Ginsberg to whom he would give instructions " Say , wait a minute , " Sam contrived to interrupt . " What about the lessons ? " " The lessons ? " " What 'll they cost ? " " Oh ! ? Well , we did n't settle that . " " You mean  --  you did n't ask him ? " " Of course I did , " she said . But Mr. Ashby had jokingly replied that he could not discuss business with so charming a young lady , and had quickly changed the subject . He was picking out a part for her to study and wanted her to call again tonight after the play when he would give it to her . He had suggested she might bring her brother with her " Well , shucks ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunchroom he kept looking at Nelly and seeing someone else  --  an actress like Miss Cavendish , acting on the stage . And Nelly , herself , was abetting this illusion  --  holding out her little finger when she used the salt and pepper , and talking to the waitress in a voice he hardly knew  --  like an actress in a play ?  | And he was still impressed , sitting in the theater in seats which had cost nothing , watching the unfoldment of Camille 's disastrous life  --  not so exciting now that you knew what would take place but intriguing all the same , watching Wilfred Ashby rant about and tear his hair , with the knowledge that your sister , sitting here beside you , had been walking on that stage a little while ago , conversing with that man . The whole thing was amazing and incredible And going through the alley , through the back door to the stage , across whose dark and littered breadth Nelly led him by the hand , and down the dingy hall  --  well , it was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had started sweating when Wilfred Ashby 's booming voice bade them cheerfully to come in He did not like Wilfred Ashby at the start , but still he was impressed ; his instinctive mistrust was neutralized . And Wilfred was most gracious . He introduced his wife who was sitting at a shelf across the way , removing the makeup from her face which was plain and tired-looking . She had been polite enough , but then she had gone on with what she had to do , not taking any part in what was said . The child was asleep on a sofa in the corner . Some empty beer bottles with which it had been playing , were scattered on the floor . The room was small and crowded with two big costume trunks , and messy and disordered . But still it was impressive , no matter how cheap and fraudulent and tawdry  --  because it was the theater . To one who loves the theater the illusion of the play pervades the empty auditorium , still exists upon a dark and naked stage , is everywhere within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even the smell of it is potent and like no other smell  --  that odor , indescribable and not easily classified , of paint and yet not paint , of canvas yet not canvas , nor of painted canvas either , which comes drifting from beneath the rising curtain Wilfred Ashby talked into the mirror . It was indeed a pleasure to make the acquaintance of Miss Nelly Braden 's brother . The young lady had great talent ; there was no doubt of that . With proper tutelage she should go very far  --  yes , very far ? He smiled convincingly . In the mirror on the other side Sam caught an expression on Miss Liscomb 's face  --  an expression of annoyance , of something more than that . She stood up , almost roughly pushing back her chair , and went to change her dress behind a screen , and then she woke the child who cried out fretfully , rubbing his sleepy eyes against the light . She would go on , she said , to the hotel and get Willie into bed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but shortly . Sam felt that she was irritated with her husband , with something he had said , and disdainful of him , too . But still he was impressed Wilfred went on talking through the mirror , removing specks of impressed makeup , rubbing with his thumbs at wrinkles in his chin . He had glanced through some scripts and had selected one  --  the role of Trilby which would serve to give notion of her range  --  whether her forte would be comedy or drama ; he rather thought the latter . It would simplify the lessons since he knew the play by heart , having played Svengali more than a hundred times Sam ventured to remark he had seen him in the part . " Indeed ? May I inquire where ? " " Right here in Muscatine . " " Ah well ? " The Ashby shoulders shrugged . " I wish you might have seen me with adequate support . " " I enjoyed it very much , " Sam hastened to assure him . Wilfred smiled and changed the subject . He said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were some discordant factors in the company ? He shrugged again . He had taken the engagement to oblige a manager to whom he felt under obligation , intending to remain for a few weeks until the company should be established . But the matter had dragged on and the manager kept urging him to stay a little longer . Ile was not accustomed to playing in the summer , or indeed it to playing stock at any time ? I le shrugged again . Still , much might be accomplished with a pupil of such talent in a narrow space of time . It was possible , he thought , that almost before they knew it , Miss Nelly might he ready to essay a minor role on the commercial stage  --  providing , of course , that nothing interfered with the program of instruction which he had in mind . But he must inform them  --  it was only fair to do so ? that there were urgent calls coming to him from New York  --  almost daily telegrams Sam nodded . He could not recall any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed any message addressed to Mr. Ashby . " Oh , Mr. Ashby , " Nelly groaned , " I hope " you wo n't go for a long time . " I begin to hope so , too , my dear young lady . " Wilfred smiled into the mirror . " For now I foresee a purpose in my presence , and a duty I shall cherish . " He handed her the script , a dog-eared volume . " The role of Trilby , Nelly . I shall count on you to have the first act letter-perfect a week from today  --  at noon exactly . You will find me waiting for you  | on the stage . And then we will see what we will see ? " He rose as if to terminate the interview . " Yes , but ? " Sam stood up , fumbling with his hat . " But what , sir ? " " I mean  --  about the price ? " " The price ? " Wilfred looked blank . " We did n't settle that . " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Wilfred laughed softly . " Dear me , I had forgotten it entirely . Well now , let 's see ? " He appeared to be reflecting , communing with himself . " I have been offered as much as fifty dollars for one lesson . But , " he added quickly , noting the expression on Sam 's face , " by a person whom I would not instruct at any price . " He smiled disarmingly . " How much ? ? I low much ? ? I 'm so stupid about business. ? What would you suggest ? " " I  --  I would n't know , " Sam stammered . " No  --  well ? " There was a shifty look in Wilfred 's eyes . " Shall we say ten dollars then ? " " Ten dollars ? ? for each lesson ? " Wilfred nodded carelessly . " Well , shucks ? " Sam shook his head . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Ashby , but we 'll have to give it up . " " Oh Sam ? " moaned Nelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very jovial air but a hint of disappointment in his face , " I wo n't hear to such a thing . I was offering a suggestion . Let 's be frank with one another : how much can you afford to pay ? " " I could pay ? " Sam gulped  --  he had long since set a figure as the limit he would go , and had hoped it might be less . " ? well , I could pay two dollars . " " Two dollars , did you say ? " " Yeh , two dollars , " Sam repeated , feeling terribly embarrassed . " Then two dollars it shall be , " boomed Wilfred Ashby , albeit he did not look very happy . " Miss Braden 's career will not be sacrificed on a mercenary altar . " He strode to the door and put his hand upon the knob . " And now , my young friends , I must ask to be excused ? " " Oh , Mr. Ashby , " Nelly breathed , " how can I ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ privilege , dear young lady , " Wilfred murmured , and held her hand a moment before he bowed them out .  | As they stepped into the hall a woman hurried by , swishing her skirt aside with a disdainful air and avoiding looking at them . Nelly nudged his arm . " Miss Cavendish , " she whispered . " Oh ? " Sam said , impressed . " Mr. Ashby says she 's very difficult . " " Yeh ? " He watched her disappear around a corner . " Well , she does look kind of touchy . " The dirty-looking man was doing something on the stage , tinkering with a light stuck on an iron pipe . He glanced at them and glanced away . " Mr. Ginsberg , " Nelly whispered . " He 's the business manager . " " Oh ? " Sam said . " I better let him know . " She stopped and spoke  --  triumphantly ; her head was in the clouds . " I 'll be coming every week , " she said . " That right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Ashby is going to give me lessons ? " " Lessons , eh ? " He did n't laugh exactly . He looked at her and then he looked at Sam , a funny kind of look  --  as if he were sorry for them . " My brother ? " she explained . " Oh , your brother ! " he said in a funny kind of way . " Well , good night , Mr. Ginsberg . " " Good night , " he answered . They walked in silence . Sam was thinking of Miss Liscomb , the expression on her face he had noticed in the mirror  --  an expression of annoyance , ( ) I ' something more than that , of injury perhaps and contemptuous irritation ; thinking of Miss Cavendish swishing through the hall with her chin stuck up and face averted ; of the dirty-looking man and of something in his voice ; of Wilfred Ashby whom he did n't really like ? But still he was impressed . " Sam , dear ? " Nelly squeezed his arm , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good to me . It 's all so wonderful . " " Aw , shucks ? " he mumbled , fumbling with the key . " You 'll be proud of me some day . You wo n't regret it , Sam . " " Yeh , sure , " he agreed . But he was n't sure of it . The weeks slid by . Nelly came and went . He did n't see much of her : Saturdays at supper and afterwards the theater , but it got to be a bore to go again on Sunday , and so she went alone . He let her take his door key . Sometimes he did n't see her after Sunday breakfast until the Plug pulled out on Monday morning . She would get to the depot just in time to wave good-by . The woman of the house complained to him one day that his sister had come in very late the night before  --  at two o'clock , she  | said , looking pretty grim ; she had no use for theaters or for actors . He smoothed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She shrugged impatiently ; she said Wilfred often kept her after the performance to go over certain things  --  she called him Wilfred now . " Well , you should n't be out so late , " he grumbled . " Why not ? " " It does n't look good , Nelly . " " Nonsense ! " she snapped . " I do n't care how it looks to stupid , poky people . Nobody in the theater ever thinks about such things . " She was irritable with him several times , and she did a lot of acting ? in the lunchroom , anywhere . Sometimes he was embarrassed . And things were always happening to upset her . One day Miss Cavendish was rude . She had met her in the alley and had started to speak , but Miss Cavendish had turned her head and looked the other way . She was hurt and furious . " Perhaps she did n't see you , " Sam suggested . " Oh yes , she did ! " " Then why ? " " Because she does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " She went on to tear Miss Cavendish to shreds : the woman could n't act and she was not a lady . She did n't see how Wilfred could put up with her . Another day she was in tears . Miss Liscomb had done something ; he could not discover what " She 's mean because she 's jealous , " Nelly stormed . " Jealous ? " Sam was startled . " Jealous  --  why ? " " Of me , of course . " " Of you , Nelly ? " " Oh , I do n't mean what you think , " she cried confusedly . " She 's jealous of my talent  --  because I 'm a better actress  --  and because I 'm young and pretty . " " Well , shucks ? " he said . He did not know what to make out of these tantrums . It was hardly ever pleasant being with her any more . She was always picking up something he said and being hurt or angry . And she was rude to other people , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table and complaining of the service . And if he breathed a word of criticism , as likely as not she would burst into tears " Oh , Sam , " she sobbed one day , " I 'm so unhappy . " " Unhappy ? ? Why ? " " Because  --  because ? " She shook her head .  | " You 're getting what you wanted ? " She did n't answer . " Maybe you 're working too hard , " he suggested . " Maybe you ought to quit ? " " Quit ? " She looked up quickly . " You mean  --  to stop my lessons ? " " Just for a while ? " " Do n't be absurd ! " Her eyes were angry , and a little frightened . " But , Nelly ? " " No , do n't . Do n't say another word . I would n't stop my lessons for anything on earth . " And she flung out of the room . He did not know what to do . He thought of consulting Wilfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lesson , but she would n't hear to it . She said Wilfred would n't like it  --  no one was permitted to be present at a lesson , not even Mr. Ginsberg . Maybe later on , when she was more advanced " I would n't bother you , " he said . " No . " She stamped her foot . " You ca n't , you ca n't . " " All right ? " He let it go . In November Madge wrote to him : she was worried about Nelly who seemed nervous and depressed  --  not a bit like her sunny , happy self . She was cross and irritable and uncommunicative . All week she stayed around the house , studying different parts and practicing her acting , never going anywhere in Wyattville , though she was often asked , and turning up her nose at the boys and girls she knew , as if she thought she was too good for them . When Madge spoke to her about it , she flared up in a rage . She would n't lift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter came from Mr. Ashby , and if she did n't get ! one she was more upset than ever . Madge assumed that these letters had to do with Nelly 's lessons , but lately she had wondered . Nelly had no appetite and was looking pale and thin . Did he think that everything was going as it should ? Did he feel that Mr. Ashby was completely trustworthy ? He put off answering . He did not know what to say . The end came with electrifying suddenness . Late one Sunday night Nelly burst into his room in a condition 1 verging on hysteria . She was laughing and crying all at once , strung up to such a pitch that it was hard to follow what she said . And he had been asleep and was only half awake . It appeared there had been a dreadful row between Miss Cavendish and Mr. Ashby . It had happened on the stage after the performance .  | Nelly had been present at the moment , crossing through the set to go to Wilfred 's dressing room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had called him awful names , vulgar and insulting ; and then had snatched a vase from a table on the stage and shattered it to fragments on Mr. Ashby 's head which had been cut and bleeding . Mr. Ginsberg had rushed up but had not been in time . Wilfred had fallen back into a chair and she had run to him to see what she could do , but Miss Liscomb had screamed at her and given her a shove which almost knocked her down Dear Wilfred ! Whatever he had done had of course been meant in kindness and Miss Cavendish had acted like a vicious , jealous snake . He had leaned back in his chair with a towel wrapped round his head to staunch the blood which was trickling down his face . And he had said with simple , gentle dignity : " This is the end  --  the end ? " " Oh Sam ! " She clasped her hands . " The end  --  you understand ? " She had tried to speak to him but Miss Liscomb had snarled at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ginsberg had spoken to her roughly : he had told her to get out  --  to go on home . " What can I do ? " she wailed . " What can I do to help him ? " " I expect , " Sam ventured mildly , " he can take care of himself . " " Oh , you do n't understand , " she moaned distractedly . " You do n't ; you never could . " " Well , maybe not ? " he said . He was not much concerned . There had been too many excursions and alarms . She stopped crying after while . " You 've been awfully kind , " she said . " I 'll never forget it  --  not ever in my life . " " Aw , that 's all right ? " he mumbled . " You 're my brother and I love you ? " She leaned down and kissed his forehead . " I 'll always love you , Sam  --  no matter what ? " " Yeh , well ? " He moved uncomfortably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the blanket tight around his neck . " You better go to bed , Nelly ? " " Yes ? " she nodded and went slowly to the door  --  as if there was something else she had n't said . " Good night , Sam dear ? " " Good night , " he answered , and dropped off to sleep reflecting that the end of Mr. Ashby would be a great relief . That was Sunday . Monday morning she did not come hurrying down the platform , waving to him through the window . The Plug pulled out without her  | at least he did n't see her , though she might have hopped aboard at the last moment . He was not concerned about it . Several times she had almost missed the train . It was likely , he thought , that she had overslept after the excitement of last night , and it would n't do her any harm to have a good long rest and wait over until Tuesday . Later in the day she would probably drop in and be apologetic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was busy with his work and presently the matter slipped out of his mind . And then It was after three o'clock when he glanced up from a message he was writing in response to a tapping on the glass He had seen the girl , called Jo , only once or twice since Nelly had been coming . He had stopped eating there . One day a month ago Mr. Butts had been in town and had taken him to lunch in the place across the street . Her face had lighted up when he came in but she did n't say a word , seeing him with Mr. Butts  --  just nodding and smiling as she would to anyone , waiting for his order . But while he was eating he could see that she was watching him , going up and down the counter ? watching all the time . It made him feel uncomfortable . Finally Mr. Butts excused himself to go and speak to someone , and then she came and leaned across the counter " Why do n't you never come in no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy . " " Yell ? " She filled his coffee cup . " You got to eat some place . " " I been eating up the street . " " I know , " she said a little wistfully , adding with a smile , " I do n't get paid for driving trade away . " " Aw shucks ? " he grinned , explaining lamely , " My sister 's been here with me . " " Yeh ? " she nodded . " I seen you on the street a couple of times . I thought at first ? " She leaned a little closer . " ? maybe you had another girl . " He laughed , looking back over his shoulder to see that Mr. Butts was not returning or observing . " But a fellow at the depot said it was your sister . " " That 's right , " he said . " Why do n't you bring her in here sometime , Sam ? " " Sure , " he agreed , " I been meaning to do that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped away the crumbs and went on along the counter .  | That was a month ago , and he had not gone back there , nor seen the girl again until , looking up now from the message he was writing , he saw her on the platform , in her gingham dress and apron , though it was cold and snowing , tapping on the glass He was startled and annoyed . She had never done a thing like that before , not even when they were going out together . It was pretty raw and nervy  --  coming over to the depot . He glanced around : there was no one in the office at the moment . He motioned her to wait until he finished with the message he was taking from the wire , and then he went over and pushed the window up . " I hate to bother you , " she said . She was shivering with the cold and her face looked very serious . " I know you 're busy , Sam , but I thought I ought to tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come out on the platform for a minute ? " " I ca n't leave the key , " he said with a vague sense of alarm . " Well , I 'll have to tell you here . " " All right . Go on . " " Maybe I 'm butting in , but I thought you ought to know ? " She hesitated , shivering . " Gee , it 's sure cold . I should 've wore my coat , but I run across the street as soon as they went out ? " " Who ? " " Your sister and- " " Nelly ? " He caught his breath ; he felt it coming now . " Yes , that 's what he called her  --  the fellow she was with . " " What fellow ? " " That actor from the theater . " " Wilfred Ashby ? " " Yes , that 's the one . " " Well , what ? " ' They came in for some lunch a while ago . They were sitting in a booth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help hearing something that she said , and then  --  well , I listened to them , Sam . And I thought you ought to know ? " " Yeh ? What ? " His heart was thumping . " Go on and tell me  --  what ? " " They were planning something , Sam  --  to run away together . " " To run away , " he echoed . " That 's what they said . And I know he 's got a wife ? " " Sure . Yeh , of course . " He felt confused and sick . " But run ? ? run where ? ? and how ? "  | " Right now  --  this afternoon . " " But where ? " " To Chicago first and then New York ? " She had n't heard it all , just snatches of their talk . They meant to get a rig and drive to another town where they could catch a train  --  not coming to the depot here in Muscatine where they might be recognized " What town ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Yeh , well ? " His head was whirling . There were half a dozen towns to suit their purpose . The wire at his back was calling him . He half pushed down the window and then he shoved it up . " Thanks , Jo , " he said . " Oh , that 's all right . I thought you ought to know ? " " Yeh , sure . " " If there 's anything that I could do ? " " Well , I do n't know . I got to think about it . " The wire kept on calling . " You better run along . You 'll catch cold standing there . " " Yeh , I guess I better , Sam . " She backed away , clinging to him with her eyes , and then she turned and ran . He pushed the window shut and went back to his table and began to write mechanically , not thinking of the words that he put down. ? His little sister , Nelly , whom his mother , on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose in his throat . Ile should have seen it coming ; it was plain enough , what had been going on . And he had n't been completely blind about it  --  just unwilling to believe that such a thing could happen . If only he had answered Madge 's letter ! If only he 'd done something ! And now what ? ? Perhaps they had n't gone yet . Perhaps she was at home packing up her things . But he could n't leave the office ; there was no one to relieve him . And if he could , what then ? The way she had been acting , she would n't listen to him . Likely enough she would fly into a tantrum , and if he tried to stop her there might be a public scandal . And they 'd know in Wyattville , and Eileen would hear about it . No , that was n't any use . Anyway he could n't go , not till six o'clock . He was chained here to the wire like a prisoner in a jail  --  like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And suddenly he hated the thing that he was doing  --  the long , dull , tedious hours , the wire and the railroad , the implacable machine in which he had been caught His thoughts went racing on . Did Miss Liscomb know about it ? He remembered again the expression on her face he had noted in the mirror .  | Perhaps she had expected something of this sort . If he went to the hotel and told her what he 'd learned  --  well then , what could she do ? Could she prevent her husband from taking such a step ? He did n't think she could . And there might be a scene , and publicity and scandal And probably they had already gone  --  were driving through the country at this moment to some small neighboring town . Yes , but what town ? He spread a railroad folder on the table , circling with his pencil the ones that seemed most likely , and checking the departures of trains bound for Chicago . They were at his finger tips ; he could query @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Have you seen a man and girl ? " and then he must describe them ? " buying tickets for Chicago ? " And if they had , what then ? ? No , no , that would n't do ; and they would n't be there yet , wherever they were going . He phrased the thing again : " Notify immediately when man and girl ? " followed by descriptions " ? buy tickets for Chicago . " But there was no good of that , for it would then be too late . There was no use knowing where they were unless you had authority to stop them But he went on struggling with it . The livery stable where they got the rig  --  well , they would know of course . But there were several liveries in the town ; you 'd have to make the rounds and question them . " Did Mr. Wilfred Ashby rent a rig this afternoon ? " ? And would they tell ? Likely as not they had been paid to keep their mouths shut and would lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he did not possess The wire woke and cut across his thoughts . Wyattville was calling . " Plug ? " it began . He glanced up at the clock : the Plug was pulling out . He caught his breath and jerked around , reaching for the key . " Hold Plug , " he said . The wire was silent . He waited with his eyes upon the clock  --  one minute after four . There was just a chance , he thought . An interminable minute ticked away , and then " OK , " said Wyattville , " I got her stopped but I had to wave to Rooney down the track . " He leaned back in his chair and wiped his hands upon his knees , " What 's up ? " the boy at Wyattville was asking . He pressed the key again . " Is my father on the platform ? " " Wait till I look . " Again he waited , drawing little squares on a scrap of yellow paper and lacing them with bars .  | " I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plug . " " He wants to know what for . " " Tell him important . " " All right he says . " A pause . " What about the train ? " " Let her go , " he tapped and added , " Thanks . " The snow had turned to rain and it was almost dark when , watching through the window , he saw his father 's figure coming down the platform  --  a tall , gaunt figure with signs of age upon it , but a figure of authority . He pushed the window up and called to him . " Hello ? " Jim said . His hands were in the pockets of his shabby overcoat . He did n't take them out . Sam told him what had happened in as few words as he could . There was no time to waste . He had made a list of liveries and he held it out to Jim . " We 've got to find out where they went , " he said . " The first one 's just a block @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Jim nodded . There was nothing in his face , and had not been , beyond a little tightening of the lips . His coat rolled back when he pocketed the list , disclosing for a moment the nickel-plated star . " I guess they 'll tell you , Pa . " " I guess they will . " " You better hurry now . " " All right . " I le turned and strode away . I Ic was hack in a few minutes . ' 1'lie first one on the list had yielded information . ' they had rented a surrey with a driver and a team , and had left at five o'clock for Miller Junction " Miller , eh ? " Saul said . " I thought it might be that . " He had some railroad folders and lie opened one and scanned it . " It 's about six miles , " Jim said . " On the Burlington , " Sam nodded . " There 's a train for Chicago leaving there at 7.05 . " He glanced at the clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rig ? " " I might , " Jim said , " if I did n't have no trouble . " He considered for a moment . " I could telegraph ' em over there to hold her . " " No . " Sam shook his head . " You ca n't do that . It might get in the papers . We 've got to keep it quiet . " " Well , I do n't know ? " His eyes were grim and stubborn . " You ca n't use force or anything like that . You 've got to make her see what a crazy thing she 's doing  --  or maybe she wo n't come . " " She 'll come all right , " Jim said . " There wo n't be nothing else for her  | to do . " He looked down at his hands  --  big , bony hands they were  --  with the flicker of a smile . " That fellow that she 's with wo n't be traveling for a while . " " Yeh , well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue ; they were too far apart . And the wire was calling him and time was running on . " You better hurry , Pa . " And then he called him back . " You got some money ? " " No , I have n't , Sam . " " Well , here 's ten dollars . " He put the bill into Jim 's hand . " Send me a telegram . I 'll be around here waiting . " " All right , I will . " He pushed the window shut and went back to the table , writing down the words that came clicking from the wire , heedless of their import . ? Suddenly he had no hope about it . He was half sorry he had stopped the Plug , that his father had been there on the platform , that he had done anything or known about it ; for what was there to do that would n't make things worse ? Authority was not the answer . It had n't worked with Tom ; it would n't work with Nelly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a boy , but the world had changed since then . You could n't knock things down and make them right . if his mother were alive she would know what to do . But if she had been alive the thing would not have happened . She would have seen it coming before it was too late He finished with the message he was taking and wired one to Wyattville , to Madge . " Pa here on business . Nelly staying over . Everything OK . " There was no use worrying her about it yet . He almost wished that Jim would be too late to catch them . He got through to Miller Junction and asked about the train . It was on time. ? Jim would be started now , driving through the darkness and the rain with a strong and sure hand . It would be nip and tuck . But he knew deep in his heart that his father would come back empty-handed  --  as he had come back that time when he went to get the bicycle , as he had come back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came in to relieve him , and he got his hat and coat and hurried home , almost running through the street . Ile thought she might have left a message for him , and she had  --  a note pinned to his pillow : Dear Sam , it said we love each other . That 's really all there is to say about it . We 're going away together so we can be happy . I know it will be an awful shock to you and Madge but there 's nothing else to  | do , and it is n't wrong or sinful . Wilfred will arrange for a divorce as quickly as he can and then we will be married . We are going to New York , and I shall train my voice and also act , but only in the company with him . I 'm crying so I ca n't write any more . I 'll send you our address . My dearest love Nelly It was terrible enough , but he was spared the fullness of its measure . He did not know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Muscatine he had been at the zenith of his professional life , that he had no money and no character , that he had done this sort of thing before , that he was in fact a rascal . He thought , sitting wearily on the bed in his dingy little room : perhaps it would all be for the best ; perhaps no one would ever know about it . They would say , when people asked , that Nelly had gone East to train her voice , that she was studying music in New York . And then when they were married everything would be all right . He tried to think that this would be the case . He thought he would go out and get his supper . It would help to kill the time until he could expect a message from his father . The woman of the house came out into the hall , as if she had been watching for him . She was curious and snippy . She remarked that his sister had missed the train that morning . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overslept , coming in so late at night . " " Uh-huh , " he nodded . " Will she be back tonight ? " " Why yes ? " he mumbled , fumbling with the door latch . " She packed her things and took ' em when she went . " " Oh , did she ? " He was outside on the step . " I 'd like to know what to do about her room . " " I 'll pay for it , " he said and hurried on . He went into a lunchroom , not the one he had been going to with Nelly . There was an evening paper on the counter and , glancing through it , he came on an announcement : there would be no performance at the Opera House tonight . Mr. Wilfred Ashby had been taken ill . That was all it said about it . He ate his supper with his eyes upon the clock . At a quarter after seven he went back to the depot . The night man was sitting at the table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in.  | " Did you get a message for me ? " Sam inquired stiffly . They were on barely more than speaking terms . The fellow shoved a yellow paper at him . " Missed train , " it said . A wave of relief flooded through his tired body . Thank God for that . He had had a vision of his father pounding Wilfred Ashby with his fists , flinging him across the depot platform while Nelly stood by screaming and the people of the town came running to the scene , and stories in the papers  --  scandal and disgrace He turned back to the door ; his hand was on the knob when he became aware of the words the operator was clicking on the key . He had been hearing them ever since he had come in  --  just words he had not bothered to interpret . But suddenly they registered and he was listening to them with riveted attention " ? Margaret Liscomb , actress wife of Ashby , found unconscious in hotel suite late this afternoon . Hotel employees , alarmed by crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room with mother , summoned L. M. Ginsberg , manager of company and guest in same hotel , who called in the police ? " He went back toward the table . " ? Woman , suffering from poison thought self-administered , removed to hospital where doctors say recovery probable ? " He found his voice . " What 's that ? What are you sending ? " The fellow looked up at him with a half-embarrassed air . " AP dispatch , " he said and pressed the key again . Sam sat down in a chair across the table from him . His legs were trembling ? AP dispatch  --  Associated Press , spreading out across the country like the ripples in a pond  --  to Wyattville  --  Chicago The man was speaking to him through the clicking of the key . " The police were in a while ago , " he said . " They were looking for you , but I told ' em you 'd gone home . " He nodded dully . They 'd be looking for him there , talking to the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough to tell the little that she knew The fellow was saying something else , not looking up this time . " Too bad your sister got into this mess . " He did n't answer . He was n't listening to the wire now . He was thinking of the papers pouring from the presses to be read at breakfast tables in the morning . Mr. Butts would read about it in Rock Island , and the Wyatts in Chicago , and Neill Wyatt at his college , or wherever he might be , and Eileen would read it , too. ? his sister , Nelly Braden  | He was thinking that his father could sleep in Nelly 's room which he had said he 'd pay for  --  that he had better wait at the depot till Jim came since he might not remember the address where he lived  --  that he could n't have needed to use much of the ten dollars . He did not want to go back to the house . The police might still be there , and the woman would be waiting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exultant of the fact that she had known how such goings on must end He was thinking of the faces he must meet tomorrow , people at the depot , in the lunchroom , on the street  --  thinking that he hated Muscatine , and the wire and the railroad , and his job which was really nothing more than a cog in a machine , and a very little cog buried in immensity  --  a cog that would keep turning until it was worn out , and would then be cast aside and a new one fitted in . O'Gara had been right . Even Mr. Butts who had seemed like God to him , shrank to a puny figure  --  a futile little man beneath a comic wig . It was all a waste of time  --  not getting anywhere . And suddenly he knew that it was finished . It was still raining , beating on the dirty windowpanes like fingers lightly tapping on the glass  --  calling him to come , to get it over with . He took out his leather wallet , and out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ACME PAPER COMPANY  --  HOME INSURANCE BLDG. ? CHICAGOILLINOIS . At the top was printed , " If it 's paper , come to us . " He reached across the table for a sheet of yellow paper and dipped a pen into the ink " Dear Mr. Brush , " he wrote , " I guess I 'm finished with the railroad business ? " The first year of a new century was drawing to a close . Some important things had happened . In May a group of daring speculators caused a panic in the stock market . Northern Pacific , cornered , shot to a thousand dollars . A lot of people lost their shirts . Old Henry was n't hurt ; he did n't gamble , except on sure things . And Elliott was rumored to have made a million dollars . In September the President of the United States , William McKinley , was assassinated by an anarchist whose name nobody could pronounce , a foreigner of course . Many people thought that William Randolph Hearst had been more or less responsible , stirring tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to persuade them that the President took his orders from Wall Street and the trusts , and inciting ignorant men to violent deeds . Theodore Roosevelt had succeeded to the office , and conservative ele-  | ments were rather doubtful of him . He talked pretty noisily and had mentioned a " big stick . " Presidents had not talked that way before . But the country was all right , marching straight ahead , getting bigger and richer every time the clock ticked . There were some other things that did n't seem important at the time . An Italian , named Marconi , telegraphed the letter S across the ocean , without wires , through the air . Few people understood how it had been done or foresaw any purpose in the thing . But " horseless carriages " were attracting some attention ? " automobile " was the name given to them by the French . They were clumsy looking things and always breaking down . It was generally believed they would not amount to much , and a good many people were afraid to ride in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river road toward Beaton 's woods , but had not gone very far . Dave Birney had been summoned with a team to tow it back . In some vaudeville theaters , at the end of the performance , they were showing on a screen photographs which seemed to move , an invention of the French called the " cinematograph " ? regiments of soldiers , galloping hussars , and things like that . They were pretty hard to look at , blurred and much too fast ; and they flickered in a way that hurt your eyes . All in all it had been quite a year . V I I CHICAGO , PROUD CITY WHOSE MOTTO IS " I WILL . " Sam loved it from the start , in common with countless other boys who came flocking from the farms and country towns throughout the Middle West . And it opened wide its arms and took them in . It was made for them and they for it  --  like Mecca of the Moslems , a holy city and their own , the heart of their America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cynical about it . One night , sitting at a table in some bar , they had an argument which Sam afterwards remembered . Mitch was working for the Tribune , a police reporter then . Sometimes when he was drunk he would take out his glass eye and lay it on the bar , and announce to anyone who happened to be listening : " I 'm the best police reporter in Chicago , and the best goddamn one-eyed one in the world . "  | He was a funny fellow . He had worked his way through Chicago University , coming down at night and setting type for the morning papers . Every night he would come down to the Loop and make the rounds , and if they were short of help he would get on , and would pick up several dollars . This night he said abruptly , apropos of nothing : " What do you like about Chicago ? " " Like about it ? " Sam reflected . " Well , it 's beautiful for one thing . " " Beautiful ! " Mitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How can you say that ? Look at the parks , the boulevards , the lake front ? " Mitch curled his lip . " Like a fringe of lace , " he said , " on a pair of dirty drawers . " Sam laughed indulgently . " It 's dirty and it 's ugly . " " That depends on where you sit . " " I 'm sitting in Chicago . " He paused to take a drink . " What do you like about it ? " " Everything , " Sam said . " The smell of it , the sound of it , the people in the street ? " " Which street ? " Mitch asked . " You mean the Lake Shore Drive where Stanley Adams lives ? " Sam did n't answer . Mitch went on talking , painting pictures of the city that he knew , the hinterland behind the Cold Coast : the open red light district , spreading like a fan from the south edge of the Loop , and the dives that flourished in it and around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were always on the move , flying from the Jews who kept close upon their heels no matter where they went ; the stockyards and the hunkies in their clapboard tenements ( a million of them came to America that year ) , and the reek of the slaughterhouse descending on the city when the wind was right for it ; West Side hoodlum gangs , the beginning of the gangster ; rotten politics ; poverty and viciousness nicely screened from view by boulevards and parks ; maggots in a cheese with a ribbon tied around it . He came back to his question at the end : " What do you really like about it , Sam ? " " It 's been good to me , " Sam said . " Good ? How ? " " It 's given me a chance to get along . " " Yeh ? " Mitch rolled the liquor in his glass . " Get where ? "  | " Oh well ? " Sam shrugged impatiently , beginning to be angry . " That 's it , " Mitch nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both  --  you and Chicago . " " What ? " " You have n't any answer. ? I Will , ' but I will what ? " He put down his empty glass . " It all adds up to nothing . " Sam paid the check . He got on a car on Randolph Street , standing on the platform to finish his cigar . It was a warm spring night . The lights were bright on Randolph  --  marquees of theaters , the Garrick , the Colonial , Powers ; Henrici 's restaurant , and the Sherman House ; people on the street ; strolling up and down ; automobiles threading through the traffic ; an air of gaiety . Chicago was all right. ? " I Will , " but I will u ' 1rut ? ? 1Ic was still irritated . Old Mitch was always saying things like that , figuring out some way to make you feel uncomfortable , showing off his college education which had not done much for him  --  maybe twenty five a week , and he was always broke . People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pretend that money did n't count , but of course it was a gesture , a resentment of success . Still , he wished Mitch had n't said it . And on a day like this  --  the day that he was leaving Acme Paper , going into business for himself , taking another chance , but not hurriedly or rashly He glanced down Dearborn Street , dark and deserted . The Tribune was down there , and Stanley Adams ' bank . He had six thousand dollars on deposit in that bank . He had never asked for credit , not a cent , but he would need it now , and he would get it , too . They thought pretty well of him ; they knew that he was steady . One of the vice-presidents had given him a hint , had practically said to go ahead. ? Six thousand dollars saved out of his salary . That was n't bad , considering the fifty he sent each month to Madge , and helping Nelly out , and the time that Tom was sick and on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Of course there were people who did n't get along , but the blame was on themselves . They were lazy , ineffectual , good-for-nothing Clark Street. ? Hub Baxter was with a firm of lawyers on that street and doing very well . He had been in Hub 's office half that day , drawing up the partnership with Jules . The old man had been as fussy as a setting hen , reading the agreement twenty times and disputing every comma . The French were like that , annoyingly suspicious , penny-wise . But finally they had got it signed and sealed . A partnership . You had to get along like man and wife , had to agree . It would n't have helped to incorporate the thing , for Jules would not have parted with a fraction  | more than half . Well , they would see . If Jules would be content to run the factory and keep his nose out of the business end The City Hall. ? Mike Hogan was working in the tax assessor 's office . You could find him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his forehead , whispering confidentially from the corner of his mouth , intimating he could " fix it " for a friend . His uncle , the policeman , now a captain , had gotten him the job . Mike had married recently an Irish Catholic girl , the daughter of a bailiff , and they lived in a flat in Ravenswood . He rarely saw Mike any more . Once he had gone out for Sunday dinner , but had dodged a second invitation ; it had been pretty dull. ? The boys from Wyattville . There had been five of them . But Grover had gone home to practice medicine , and had married Susie Baxter . La Salle Street. ? The Elliott Wyatt office was down there , with its board room , leather chairs , mahogany and brass , and eager speculators . He dropped in now and then to see how things were going and occasionally would catch a glimpse of Wayne . But old Neill was n't there . You would n't catch him sitting at a desk . It was hard to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another , squandering money that his father gave him , running automobile races , playing tennis in England or Long Island , or in Switzerland climbing mountains , or mixed up with some actress in New York . Now and then when he went home he heard stories about Neill which always sifted back to Wyattville . People said that lie was like his father , and they said it with a smile , seeming rather pleased and proud . It was funny , the credit that you got for things like that The car turned north and dove into the tunnel . They said that Eileen Wyatt was still in love with Neill , waiting patiently for him to settle down . Perhaps she was  --  if she had ever been . He had never quite admitted that . But the years were slipping by and the rolling stone showed no signs of slowing up . She must be pretty sick of it by now . He had n't seen Eileen since the summer she came home with Becky Adams , the time she gave the party on Old Henry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long time ago . Old Henry had passed on , and Judge Nicolls , and King Cole . But the town had not changed much . Clem Wyatt had retired and not a day too soon . The " five-and-ten " had all the business now . There was a new hotel halfway up Main Street . People wondered how the Wyatt House hung on . The " Mary Queen " had quit some time ago , and the levee was deserted . Madge was n't getting any younger ; she had an expression in her eyes  | a kind of resignation . Mr. Daniel Price had not come back . The house in Shanty Town , he wished they could move out of it . Of course the rent was free , partial compensation for his father 's job as Marshal , and it would be silly , paying rent for something else . But he did n't like the idea of the family living there , on the wrong side of the tracks . It made him feel uncomfortable . Madge never mentioned it but he knew how she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recently he had thought a lot about it , of something he might do a little later on , if things went right : the Elliott Wyatt house on the north side of the Square , empty all these years  --  perhaps it could be bought at a bargaincounter price . It would be a proper place for his father and his sister. ? Some day he would drop in at the bank and sound Young I lenry out The car emerged from the damp and musty tunnel . Eileen. ? He had not seen her since that summer . She had never been at home when he was there . But he had not been there often  --  two or three times a year to spend a Sunday . he might have seen her when he first came to Chicago , at that school out in Lake Forest , but then he was embarrassed about Nelly and avoiding everybody . And then she had gone to college in the East , and then she was in Europe studying something  --  or maybe only chasing after Neill , and then in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know . She must have been in Chicago many times , but he had n't known about it . It was hard to say offhand how he felt about Eileen  --  not the way he had when they were kids , but sometimes even now on lonely Sundays ? He really had n't thought about her much in recent years  --  like a fellow on a ladder , feeling for the rungs , with his feet firm on the last one and his eyes fixed on the next one . No time for idle dreaming Illinois Street. ? That 's where he began , almost ten years ago , in the Acme Paper warehouse . And he saw himself again , standing in the lobby of the Home Insurance Building on a cold and blustery January evening , feeling frightened and bewildered . He had come straight from the station , carrying his suitcase , a cheap one made of cardboard . He had never seen a building more than five stories high , never ridden in an elevator . The Acme Paper office was an imposing room filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to the point . Mr. Brush had recommended his employment and no further reference would be needed . The first thing on the program was for him to learn the stock , a sort of an apprenticeship before he could expect to sell paper on the road .  | " Yes sir , " he said . Mr. Brush had written him that this would be the case . Mr. Meyer hurried on . He would start in the warehouse and be there for several months , depending on how fast he got along . The hours in the warehouse were from seven to five-thirty , and the pay would be eight dollars . " Yes sir , " he said . He had guessed that it would not be much . But it had taken guts  --  like beginning life all over when you did n't have to do it . And Mr. Butts had offered him a raise , had pleaded with him to remain , hinting at a train dispatcher 's salary in a little while . But he had not wavered even then . Mr. Meyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warehouse was on Illinois Street , just across the river . " I will notify the shipping clerk , " he said , " to expect you in the morning . Good evening Mr. Braden . " He had gone down in a crowded elevator ; offices were closing and people going home , streaming from the building onto Adams or La Salle Street . He could n't think which way he had come in and he had no notion where to go . He was standing in the lobby with his back to the cigar stand in an eddy of the traffic , clinging to his suitcase , debating what to do , when he heard the voice behind him  --  a pleasant , friendly voice with quite a German accent " Can I help you ? " He turned and saw a smiling , round-faced man behind the counter ? a man with a mustache and thick-lensed spectacles , but not waiting on the customers ; a clerk was doing that . His name was Otto Kranz and he owned half a dozen of these stands in different office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , had been watching him perhaps , sensing his bewilderment. ? What had he looked like then ? ? A comic figure really , with a derby hat perched on his head , the first one he had owned , and the worn-out , old ulster that came almost to his ankles . But the freckles had nearly disappeared , and the cowlick was yielding to inexorable brushing . And the suitcase made of cardboard , and the mittens on his hands " Can I help you ? " " Why , yes sir ? " He had liked Mr. Kranz from the moment that he saw him . There was something warm and comfortable and safe  --  the way you 'd like to feel about your father . " Could you tell me where to go to get a room ? " " A room ? ? in a hotel ? "  | " Well , not expensive . " He explained that he had just arrived , his first trip to Chicago , and the Acme Paper job " Oh yes , I know them well  --  Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendid firm . Then you are looking for a permanent place to live ? " He nodded earnestly . " I see ? " Mr. Kranz had reflected , taking time to look him over , and then he had said with a twinkle in his eye , " It is difficult to settle such a matter in a moment . But perhaps you will come home with me and be my guest tonight ? We have an extra room and tomorrow we will see . Possibly my wife will have something to suggest . " " Oh , thank you very much ? " And so he had gone home with Otto Kranz , wedged into a Clark Street cable car , hanging to a strap , around the Loop and through the tunnel , on and on  --  to the comfortable house in Deming Court , with its reddish sandstone front , and stoop and steps down which , on summer nights , Otto Kranz would spread a carpet , and the family would sit out beneath the stars . The family then were four : Papa Kranz and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who did not speak any English and had passed away a year or so ago . It was pleasant sitting out there in the evening  --  the quiet street , the yellow gas lamps not too bright , and people strolling by , going to and from the park which was just a block away , and neighbors coming over to sit and chat a while , and children playing on the sidewalk . Little Emilie would come and cuddle in his lap when it got along toward bedtime . She always hoped that he could put it off , getting started with a story Mama Kranz would let him finish . She called him uncle Sam ; she still did that . She was quite grown up now  --  very lovely looking , with auburn colored hair and soft brown eyes. ? Yes , those had been pleasant evenings But that night he had gone home with Otto Kranz ? Funny how it happened , all of it . The dinner was delicious , good German cooking and such coffee . They kept a hired girl but Mama Kranz looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slept , so immaculate and comfortable ? the same he slept in now , in the same room at the back on the second floor , next to Emilie 's . Papa Kranz had done the talking after dinner but no mention had been made about where he was to live , and then he was so sleepy he forgot it . He was up at half-past five , and tiptoed down the stairs , and took a Clark Street car , and found an open lunchroom down near Illinois Street , and was at the warehouse door a quarter before seven . And then the day was gone and there was no place to go except back to Deming Court . And the next day and the next  | They did n't need a lodger , had n't dreamed of such a thing . Papa Kranz used to laugh about it afterwards : " I bring him home for dinner and he stays here all his life . " North Clark Street. ? Honky-tonks , penny arcades , nickel picture shows , streetwalkers lurking in the shadows . Pretty shabby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not when he first saw it . Saloons and cheap hotels where you could take a girl , and workmen 's lodging houses . There was the Greek place where he 'd eaten his first breakfast ? almost ten years ago . And there was a saloon where he used to get his lunch  --  off the free lunch counter . A nickel for a beer was all it cost . You could do it in those days if you wore a decent suit and did n't look as if you might be hungry . The Star and Garter Burlesque with lurid colored posters of half-naked chorus girls . He never passed that place without stirring up a memory He had n't recognized her at the start . The makeup on her face was like a mask , and the way her hair was done , in a way she 'd never done it , and the color of it , too , for it was dyed . But he had kept looking at her more than halfway through the show , not suspecting in the least , but attracted for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the right-hand side , third from the end , when he first noticed her , and then he 'd pick her out in some other spot , running with his eye until he found her . When they pranced along the runway he could have reached and touched her . It was in Omaha , five or six years ago , but the memory was still vivid . He had walked out in the lobby during the intermission , to smoke a cigarette with the fellow he was with , a customer with sporty inclinations . He had written his order and taken him to dinner , and the man had suggested going to the burlesque show , and so of course he went , though he would have preferred to go hack to the hotel and go to bed . They were standing in the lobby waiting for the buzzer when the fellow said to him , cracking jokes about the girls who were mostly big and beefy like the kind they have in burlesque , " Sam , you sure got an eye . You picked the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeh ? " He laughed uncomfortably . " She makes me think of someone . " And suddenly his words put the idea in his head . She did make him think of someone ; she reminded him of Nclly . His hands began to sweat and he felt sick at his stomach . The fellow he was with was looking at him . " You all right , Sam ? " he asked .  | " Sure , I 'm all right , " he said . " Maybe something that I ate for din-ner ? " " If you want to go back to the hotel ? " The man kept looking at him . " Hell , no . " He laughed about it . And he would n't have gone back if he had been really ill . He could hardly wait to get back into his seat , to look at her again , for this time he would know . Not the makeup on her face , nor straw-bleached hair , nor legs in cotton tights would fool him now . But of course it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the men , making dates across the footlights , sleeping with them maybe ? " Let 's go back in , " he said . He read the program , the names of chorus girls lumped together at the bottom  --  silly , fancy names , but no Nellys and no Bradens . But she would n't use her name ; that was n't likely . And of course it was n't Nelly . He had had a letter from her not so long ago  --  like all her other letters , optimistic and excited , always on the verge of something big . Things were looking up , she said . She had promise of a job which might really lead somewhere ; she would n't say just what but would keep it to surprise him . Could he spare another loan of fifty dollars ? She always put it that way . And he had sent it to her . He had very little notion of her life . She was always vague about things , even at the start . It was months before they knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reached New York . She had written him for money but had not disclosed the truth . When they found out what had happened both he and Madge had written , urging her to come back home , but she never answered that . And it would n't have been easy to go back to Wyattville , not after all the stuff that had come out in the papers . He did n't blame her much for refusing to do that . Once he had suggested her coming to Chicago , but he had n't urged it then or afterwards repeated it . He had n't felt sure it would work . The theater was her metier , so she said . She loved it , she adored it , and would never be content with any other life . And success was always just around the corner . She had had some minor parts which were " bound to lead to something , " but none of them ever did . The plays had failed or never gotten on ; she was very vague about it . And she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars in one evening , " she had written jubilantly , but she did n't mention where . A manager had heard her and had sent for her to come and see him in his office . She  | was certain that this was the turning point . But when another letter came it would be something else The curtain rose . It was Nelly . He knew her instantly . He could n't understand why he had n't known before , except that it was something rejected as impossible until he partly put it into words . But there she was , cavorting , ogling the bald heads in the front , giggling at the smutty jokes that the comedians cracked , flinging up her legs  --  slender , graceful legs , different from the others . There were little metal shields tied on her breasts " She 's sure got your goat , " the fellow said . " Yeh ? " He rubbed his hands dry on his knees . He could n't look away . They went and came , prancing up and down the runway which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side , spreading the smell of makeup and cheap perfume . At the end , in the finale , they came out dressed like birds , with headdresses and girdles made of feathers , singing a song about getting in their nests and hatching out their eggs  --  a song with smutty implications . And they spread out on the runway . They had bags tied at their waists , filled with little cotton balls that looked like eggs , and they tossed these out among the audience . She was standing at the row in which he sat . A fellow close beside her pulled a feather from her girdle and stroked it on her leg , kidding in an undertone ; and she was laughing at him , pretending that it tickled and kicking at his hand . And then she threw a cotton ball and her eyes went with it straight to his . She recognized him . I Ie saw her catch her breath and cringe They went prancing hack again and lined up across the stage . She did n't look in his direction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl beside her glanced at her and made some laughing comment . The curtain fell . Nelly , his own sister , the daughter of their mother , confided to his care with her last breath. ? Well , what could he do about it ? What could he have done at any time ? ? in Muscatine , in Omaha , or later ? ? He had gotten rid of the fellow he was with on the plea that he was tired and did n't feel too good . You had to be careful how you dodged things with a customer , but it had worked all right . And then he had gone back to the theater , dark and deserted now except for a pair of drunks arguing on the sidewalk about picking up some girls out of the show . He found the stage door in the alley . Already they were coming out ;  | he could see their faces as the door swung to and fro. ? There were the comedians who cracked the dirty jokes , sour looking men with puckered faces ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very natty on the stage but pretty sloppy now ; the chorus girls in groups of two or three , with their makeup half washed off , calling out to one another in hard , flat voices , " Hey , Judy , wait for me , " or things like that  --  not girls that you would notice on the street . None of them were laughing or having any fun ; they had left their smiling faces on the stage . They hurried past him  --  not to waiting gentlemen with boxes full of flowers , not to parties and cafes , champagne and lobster suppers , not to anything like that ; but to all-night lunchrooms where coffee and sinkers cost a dime , and then to shabby rooms in cheap hotels Fewer of them came and then not any . Was it possible lie could have missed her ? ? or perhaps she was waiting for him to come inside ? ? When he opened the door he was conscious of the smell , the odor of the theater  --  not canvas and not paint , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It made him feel a little sick . Ile paused in the narrow vestibule with its dingy yellow light bulb , and the call board on the wall with notices and things , and the rack with unclaimed letters  --  the shoddy , mucky entrance to a shoddy , mucky life . He could see the darkened stage which had been so gay and glittering , but it was n't glittering now  --  the dirty backdrop with the paint cracked off , the floor cloth full of holes , the tangled maze of ropes and flats and lights. ? He did not know what to do , and he had no slightest notion of what he meant to say ; he was still shocked and confused , almost incredulous. ? A surly looking man came across the stage and asked him what he wanted . He said embarrassedly , he was looking for someone " Yeh ? Who ? " " A girl that 's in the chorus . " He had the program in his hand . " I do n't know her name  --  not the name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone home by now . " " No , I do n't think she has . I 've been waiting in the alley and I would have seen her pass . " " They 've all gone home , I tell you . " " Well , I 'd like to know for sure , " he persisted . " You see  --  well , it 's my sister . " " Your sister , eh ? " The fellow changed his tone . " What 's your name ? " " Braden . Sam Braden . " " She left a note for you . " He took it from the rack and held it out .  | " She scooted outa here before anybody else . I guess that 's how you missed her . " " Yeh ? " he said , but he was reading  --  a few scrawled lines on a mussy scrap of paper with spots of rouge or lipstick . " Sam dear , " it said , " I know the way you 'll feel and I just ca n't talk about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable experience and I know it will pay out in the end . I 'll write you all about it . We 're leaving in the morning and I have to be up early . Do n't worry . I 'm all right . Love . Nelly . " " Yeh ? " he said again , and turned back to the man who was waiting by the door . " Could you tell me what hotel she 's stopping at ? " " I would n't know . " " Is there anyone that would ? " " They 've all gone home by now . " " Could you tell me her name  --  I mean the one she uses ? " " I never know their names . " " Oh ? " The man was waiting for him , rattling a bunch of keys . " Well , thanks , " he said and went out into the alley Division Street. ? Down there three or four blocks , around the corner of the Drive , was the Stanley Adams house . On the rubberneck wagons the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Residence of Stanley Adams , financier and banker . This palatial home , built of Indiana limestone , contains twenty-seven rooms and fourteen baths , cost half a million dollars . " ? He remembered the first time he had heard it , that summer he was working in the warehouse and riding round on Sundays in rubbernecks and streetcars , finding out about the city . Sometimes he would take little Emilie along she was five or six years old then , and she loved to go on trips with Uncle Sam . He had turned his head and watched until the house was hidden by the trees along the Drive , and he had told the child that he knew someone who lived there . Emilie was impressed " Why do they have so many bathrooms , Uncle Sam ? ? Do they have a lot of children ? " He laughed  --  just the father and the mother and the girl he knew , named Becky . " Is she pretty ? ? Is she nice ? " " Oh , she 's all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without resentment . It was she who first put the bug in Nelly 's head , that night of the party on Old Henry 's croquet ground , passing out bouquets that did n't mean a thing , suggesting in her airy , casual way that she could sing in opera if she had a little training in Paris or New York  --  like  | suggesting to a blind man he could see if he had eyes . Rich people butting in when they ought to keep their mouths shut  --  pampered brats like Becky Adams and Neill Wyatt The Elliott Wyatt house was off the route of the rubbernecking wagons . But he had looked it up in the telephone directory and had strolled by one day . It was on Astor Street , a pretty snooty neighborhood , not a big , imposing place , but impressive all the same  --  with the brass grille at the door polished up like gold , and a kind of jaunty look , like Elliott , himself , but with a lot of dignity behind it  --  classy was the word. ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the windows were boarded up ; they were away of course  --  maybe up at Lake Geneva , maybe Europe . He walked on around the corner to the Drive , feeling disappointed and relieved . The house was through the block from the Stanley Adams mansion , almost behind it . From the windows at the back Becky Adams and Neill Wyatt could have waved to one another , but it was n't likely that they did . Being neighbors in Chicago did n't mean much . Still , that time he had run into them It was two or three years after he came  --  the second or third summer . He was traveling on the road then , tank towns in Illinois , and some weeks he would get home to spend a Sunday . He had taken Emilie to the zoo in Lincoln Park and they were walking back along the outer drive " Hi , Sam ! " He looked around . There was an automobile stopped against the curb and a fellow standing in it , beckoning to him , and a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting in the seat beside him . He had thought for an instant that it might be Eileen " Hi , Neill ? " He crossed the parking , holding Emilie 's hand . The automobile was a sporty looking one , with glossy yellow paint and big brass lamps and horn  --  the kind that Neill Wyatt would be driving . It had another seat and a door in the back to get into the tonneau , but it had no top or windshield . And Neill , himself , looked as sporty as the auto , with thick glass goggles pushed up on his forehead , waving a leather cap , and his brown hair brushed straight back " Old Sam , " he grinned , and reached to grip his hand . " I was sure it was you . Say , you have n't changed a bit . " And then he remembered and introduced the girl . " You remember Becky Adams ? " " Oh yes ? " he said politely . She was being coy and giggling  --  just as pert and smart as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cooed . " Do n't tell me that she 's yours , Sam . " Kidding of course , trying to embarrass him . He explained who Emilie was . The child was clinging tightly to his hand , fascinated by the auto " Will it go fast , Uncle Sam ? " " What ? " Becky leaned across the door . " What did she call you ? " " Uncle Sam , " he said . " That 's her name for me . " " Uncle Sam ? ? Not really ? " She was giggling again , as if it were a joke . " Did you hear that , Neill ? ? It 's simply priceless . " He disliked her more than ever . He asked about Eileen , but it was Neill who answered ; Becky did n't say a word . Apparently they were n't such close friends any more . Eileen , Neill said , was somewhere , traveling with her mother " But say , " he changed the subject , " I hear you 're getting on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess ? " " Traveling on the road and selling stuff ? " He nodded . " That 's swell , Sam . " And he added almost wistfully , " You 're way ahead of me . " Ahead ! That had struck him funny  --  the idea of Neill Wyatt selling paper in tank towns in Illinois ; getting up at five o'clock to catch a milk train ; sleeping in hotels , in beds with hugs sometimes , where you had to break the ice in the pitcher in the morning before you washed yourself , or lie naked in the stifling , muggy heat of summer nights ; eating greasy food off thick white plates , where the waitress did n't ask you what you wanted for dessert , but only if you were ready for your pie ; waiting endless hours for the chance to show your wares ; spreading out your samples by lamplight on the counters of messy little stores whose owners were determined not to buy . But there were many ways to get an order  --  if you never got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tissue paper , butcher paper , stationery , wrapper , newsprint , catalogues and samples spread out on the counters Ahead ! Yes , it was funny , thinking of Neill Wyatt doing anything like that . But he had merely smiled and said , perhaps a little grimly , " Well , I had a long head start . " And a long head start he 'd had . And then the Becky girl had butted in . Perhaps she had n't heard or had forgotten " Your darling sister with the lovely voice  --  what 's she doing , Sam ? " But old Neill had interrupted  --  intentionally , he thought .  | " How do you like her , Sam ? ( He meant the auto ) Is n't she a beauty ? " He pointed out the features : the big brass generator which produced acetylene to light the lamps , and the coil box on the dash  --  a new kind of ignition . The engine underneath the floor kept chugging while he talked . He explained the dials and buttons on the dash . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went , though it was hard to read on account of the vibration . She was geared for speed , he said , could scoot along at thirty  --  do forty if you pushed her and she was in the mood . " S-s-say , Sam ? " He was stammering with excitement . " ? why do n't you come along and take a ride ? " He had n't wanted to . He felt uncomfortable  --  the way he 'd always felt when Neill Wyatt was around , anxious to get away . And he did n't want to talk to Becky Adams , or to listen to her either ; and he did n't think that she was pleased with the idea , though she was polite enough . But of course she 'd sooner be alone with Neill . He mumbled some excuse about having to get home , but then he caught a glimpse of Emilie 's face  --  the breathless longing in her eyes fixed so eagerly on his ? " C-c-come on , get in , " Neill urged . " Well ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his arm around the child who was in the seventh heaven of delight . It was exciting , his first ride in an auto  --  racing along the Drive through the crowded Sunday traffic ; and Neill Wyatt sitting up there , as unconcerned as could be , with the goggles on his eyes and his leather cap pulled down , dodging in and out and tooting the big horn " We 're doing thirty , Sam , " he called over his shoulder . " When I get a chance I 'll let her out . " But thirty had been plenty fast enough . The horses that they passed seemed to be standing still ; the monument of General Grant tore by . At this rate they 'd be through the park in no time . The wind was like a hurricane . He hugged the child close to him , clinging to his hat " Now ? " Neil shouted . There was a fairly open space ahead . " I 'm going to let her out . " The engine speeded up ; the auto was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept tooting , and the people in the rigs pulled in against the curb as quickly as they could , looking pretty mad , and some of the horses reared . A policeman shouted at them , but Neill did not slow down " Thirty-five , " he called , " and she 's still picking up . " They were com-  | ing to the end of the Drive where the road curves to the left and down a little grade to the intersection of Diversey Boulevard " Yeh , " he shouted back , " but you better slow her up now . " And the Becky girl had turned and looked at him with a kind of taunting smile ? And then it happened A phaeton with a man and woman in it and the woman driving , coming down Diversey , not turning on the Drive as everybody did , but across the intersection toward the beach " Look out ! " he yelled . Neill slammed the brakes , the tires screaming on the asphalt . One of them exploded and the auto lurched and swayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ missing the phaeton by a hair , and crashing broadside on into the curb . The wooden wheels collapsed , and the front end struck a lamp post which snapped off at the base and fell across the hood in a rain of broken glass For a moment there was silence , and then the Becky girl had turned around , blood streaming from her face " Is the little girl all right ? " He had n't answered her , but had climbed out on the side because the door was jammed and would n't open , carrying the child who seemed to be unharmed . And people had come running , crowding round , but not offering any help . And Neill had gotten out with his right arm limp and dangling , but seeming unaware that he was hurt . And he had helped Becky out , and tried to persuade her to sit down on the curb . And she had laughed and said that that was nonsense . Her face was bleeding terribly , and Neill had tried to stanch it with his handkerchief , discovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking so incredulous about it . And he had tried to help and had seen the jagged cut from the corner of her eye almost to her chin  --  a wound that bared the bone . But she had kept insisting that she was n't hurt at all  --  only a scratch , and wanting to be sure that the little girl was cared for and that someone got a doctor for Neill 's arm Whatever she might be  --  pert and smart and giggling , she certainly had guts . It was funny  --  those people that you 'd think would be so soft . You could wham them around but you could n't make them yell or get them down . There was something that they had that kept them on their feet When the ambulance got there one of the interns looked at Neill and said , " You better sit down , mister . "  | Neill smiled and shook his head . His face was white and dripping sweat , but he did not sit down . " I 'm awfully sorry , Becky , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could hear people whispering in the crowd : " It 's one of the Wyatt boys and Stanley Adams ' daughter . " But both of them acted as if no one was there , as if they did n't see the clustered faces , joking with the interns about the ambulance . Neill tried to take her arm to help her in , and paused at the step , holding out his hand " Excuse the left , " he said . " I 'm awfully glad you both came out all right . Let 's get together , Sam , and we 'll really have a ride . " And he smiled and waved to Emilie , " So long ? " And Becky had leaned back through the door while the intern held some gauze against her face . " Sam , be a darling please and telephone my family , and be sure you explain that I 'm not the least bit hurt  --  just a tiny little scratch that needs a stitch or two . And call me up some-time ? " The ambulance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , shook his head and said , " She 'll wear the scar of that cut to her grave . " he had walked up Diversey , holding Emilie 's hand , till he came to the Rienzi where there was a telephone . Someone , the butler maybe , said that Mr. Adams was at home . He gave his name , explaining that he had a message from Miss Adams for her father . And then he waited , feeling pretty nervous at the bare idea of talking to a man like Stanley Adams , even on the telephone . The voice that answered was a grave and quiet one , not in the least excited by his information " St. Joseph 's hospital , I believe you said ? " " St. Joseph 's . Yes sir . " " Thank you very much . It was kind of you to call . " " Oh , that 's all right ? " " Good-by . " And that was that . He would still feel nervous  --  a little anyway ? talking to a man like Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago . A lot of water had gone down the stream since then . Today he was in business for himself North Avenue. ? Something had happened on that street a week ago which he would not soon forget  --  an unpleasantly disturbing scene to which he had been witness . He had gone out with Jules on West North Avenue , bargain hunting for a lathe which was needed in the factory  | to turn down the pattern rollers , but the man had wanted more than he felt they ought to pay . They had come back to Clark Street where their paths diverged , Jules going south to Woodlawn where he lived , out near the university . But before they parted they had stopped to have a drink in a decent German place familiar to him , where sometimes going home he would drop off the car and then walk on through the park . There was no one in the place except the moonfaced , pig-eyed bartender and the owner , Mr. Schneider , a big , sleepy-looking German who was sitting at a table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordered sherry and he had a highball , and they were standing there talking about the lathe which Jules felt they should have bought , when two men came through the swinging door  --  young fellows in high spirits . He could see them in the mirror as they came up to the bar , and then suddenly he saw that they were black  --  negroes far away from Cottage Grove , from the South Side section they belonged in . He had never seen a negro in that place before  --  not in any place he went . It made him feel uncomfortable , anxious to get away and yet curious to see what , if anything , would happen The bartender went back and spoke to Schneider and then returned and stood waiting for their order with his fat fists on the bar . In the mirror he could see the colored men who were laughing and kidding with each other , talking loudly but not noisily  --  young bucks , flashily dressed , having a good time , not thinking of whether they were wanted in the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar about the smaller one who was as black as ink , and , looking closely in the mirror , he recognized the boy as Peewee Cole. ? Yes , it was Peewee , Cassie 's little brother , a playmate of his childhood , in whose home he had been welcome . His impulse was to turn and say hello ? " Old Peewee , well , how are you ? " ? to invite them to have a drink with him , to ask about his mother and how he was getting on and what he was doing in Chicago . Perhaps if he had been alone he would have . He went on sipping the liquor in his glass with his back half turned away but still watching in the mirror , scarcely listening to what Jules was saying to him . They ordered two Manhattans and the bartender mixed them , not making any comment or changing his expression but rattling the ice behind the bar and putting down the glasses so that they slopped a little . But the colored men , intent upon their banter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding with each other , drinking slowly , leaning with their elbows on the bar . And the bartender stood near  | them , waiting for them to get done . They finished up at last and ate the cherries , and Peewee , who was treating , put a quarter on the bar , the price of two Manhattans anywhere " Half a dollar , " the bartender said gruffly . " How much ? " The boy looked startled . " You heard me . Half a dollar . " " But ? " And then he stopped . He dug another quarter from his pocket and laid it on the bar , knowing better than to argue with a white man . But he was n't laughing now , nor the fellow that was with him ; their lightheartedness was gone , all their gaiety and kidding vanished in a moment . They knew they were not wanted , and were suddenly selfconscious , furtive and ashamed , looking round to see if they were noticed , edging away . The bartender did n't touch the coins , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empty glasses and threw them with a crash on the floor behind the bar . A pretty dirty trick ! ? He had winced and felt the sweat start in his hands. ? The negroes had gone out , slinking through the swinging doors like dogs with their tails between their legs . And then the fellow took the coins and rang them on the cash register , and turned with a smug grin on his fat , German face ? " Them niggers wo n't come here again , " he said . Jules had been furious . He had said things to the bartender , calling him a pig , saying that he ought to be arrested , and refusing to finish the sherry in his glass , to refresh himself in such a place . Schneider had come hurrying from the table in the back , misinterpreting the matter , thinking they were angry at the negroes being served " Please , gentlemen , " he pleaded . " I can not refuse to serve them . That 's the law . " " Bah ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English as he did when he was angry . " It 's not enough to rob them , " he shouted at the end , " but then you must insult them . " The bartender had stared with his fat jowls hanging loose , and Schneider had finally turned his back and walked away , shrugging his shoulders and muttering to himself . On the sidewalk he had tried to make Jules understand : Schneider could n't help it , if he let the negroes in his customers would quit and he 'd soon be out of business But Jules refused to listen . Ten years , he said , he had been here in this country but he did not understand it any better now than the day  | he had got off the boat . Such a thing could not take place in France . " Figure to yourself , " he said , " two Germans and a Frenchman , and three Americans in the country that they own , and two of them are robbed and insulted by the Germans because their skins are dark . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You can not explain such matters . " It did seem pretty raw , putting it like that . " As for me , " he had concluded , " I would sooner drink with black men than with Germans , but I do n't insult and rob them because I do not like them . " And he ran into the street to catch his car . Of course Jules had been right  --  right but not practical , the way he was in business : a good designer , good production man but not realistic about things . And they were partners now  --  since five o'clock this afternoon . Funny how the thing had come around Jules had been his customer . He had started the account about two years ago , passing on the street and noticing the sign outside an upstairs loft : TRONCHET WALLPAPER COMPANY . ( Not Incorporated ) And he had called and sold the man a car of hanger stock , showing him how to save a little money , figuring 500 to the ream instead of 48o , the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little lighter but nobody 'd ever notice it . He had been afraid about the credit but Mr. Lubin had okayed it finally , and it had been promptly paid . And he had sold another and another , and bit by bit they got acquainted . Jules was n't young , probably near fifty . He had been a designer in a factory in France , and some outfit in the East had brought him over here to design and color wallpaper . And he had worked for them for several years , saving his money the way a Frenchman would ; and then one day he 'd had a row and quit . And he 'd come out to Chicago and started up this plant , a very modest one  --  two eight-color print machines was all , and they were secondhand  --  in a long , narrow loft in a tumbledown old building on Canal Street . And there he had been for the past five years or so , making a decent living but not growing or expanding ? not getting anywhere One day some months ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " what about this fellow , Tronchet ? " " What 's the trouble , Mr. Lubin ? " " He 's into us about five thousand dollars , most of it past due . " " I did n't know he was that far behind . " " That 's the way it stands . Where do we go from here ? " " Well ? " He thought about it . " ? if we quit selling him , he 'll fold . " " If we quit , can we collect ? "  | " I 'm afraid not , Mr. Lubin . " " What would you suggest ? " " I 'm sure that he 's honest . I 'd like to have a talk with him and kind of look things over . " " All right . But you better make it snappy . I 'm no hand to throw good money after bad . " He had found Jules in the boxed off cubbyhole in the corner of the loft , known as the office , poring over badly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packed full of wallpaper , stacked up to the ceiling in the office , in the aisles between the drying racks , even in the hall outside the door . " My God , Jules , " he remarked , wedging through a narrow passage between the piled-up bundles , " why do n't you sell this stuff ? " " Sell it ? " The Frenchman wiped his dripping face . It was sweltering in the loft from the steampipes underneath the drying racks . ' ' l have no salesmen , Sam . And how can I go out and run the factory , too ? " " But the stuff 'll push you out into the street . You 've hardly got room now to turn around . " " I know , I know , but I wo n't shut down my plant . " " What 's happened to your salesmen ? " " Ah , bah ! " They were no-account , he said . He had had one that was fair but the fellow had quit to take a better job , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wasting money on expense and getting drunk , but not writing any orders . The last one he had fired just a day or two before " What 're you going to do ? " " I do n't know , Sam . " He sat down at his littered desk , the picture of despair . " Lubin 's on his ear about the size of your account . " Jules groaned . He was n't broke , he said . There was merchandise on hand to cover all he owed and more than that , but he had no cash to pay his bills  --  just enough to meet his pay rolls for another week or two . " You ca n't go on like that , Jules . " " I 'll get out of it some way . " But it was plain enough that the man was up against it . " Can I see the stuff you 're making ? " he suggested , thinking to himself it was probably no good or priced too high . He knew nothing about wallpaper and had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , sure , Sam . " The Frenchman got some books and spread them on the desk . " The best cheap line on the market , " he insisted . " And the  | lowest prices , too . A wooden man could sell it . Look at that ? " He turned the sheets . " ? and that , and that ? " It looked all right  --  nice patterns , tastefully colored . " How much for that ? " he asked . " Two dollars and ten cents a hundred rolls . " " My God , that 's cheap enough . " " That 's what I tell you , Sam . It 's cheap , it 's good . " He had gone on looking at the stuff with growing interest , with an idea germinating in his head  --  three slim books of samples , nothing fancy or expensive , bread-and-butter merchandise , the kind you 'd find in every house in Wyattville  --  and a line you could carry underneath your arm . " It looks all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Say , Sam ? " Jules looked up hopefully . " ? maybe you could find a salesman ? " " I 'll look around , " he said . Ile went back to Mr. Lubin and explained the situation , adding that he thought he could sell the stuff , himself , in odd times now and then , without interfering with his work for Acme Paper . He was conscious while he spoke of Mr. Lubin 's eyes , shrewd and penetrating , and was careful not to make an issue of the matter . " It 's the only way I know to get us out , " he said . " Okay , Sam , go ahead , " Mr. Lubin smiled . And the stuff had sold like hot cakes , as he had thought it would . In three months he had Jules Tronchet out of debt and there was room to walk around the loft , and he had learned a lot about wallpaper  --  enough to be certain there was money in the stuff And then one day he said to Jules , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all square with Acme Paper . " " Thanks to you , Sam . " " Oh well , " he laughed , " I saved a customer . " He 'd been getting a commission on his sales and had offered to turn it in to Acme but Mr. Lubin had smilingly refused . He had the sample books under his arm and he dropped them on the desk , aware that Jules was watching him . " There you are , " he said , trying to sound careless . " You need some fresh ones , Sam ? " But the Frenchman suspected what was coming . " No thanks . " He laughed again . " I 'm bowing out , resigning . " " Sam , no ! " Jules clutched his arm .  | " But I 've got to , Jules , " he said . " It was only temporary , till you got back on your feet . Acme is n't paying me to sell a line of wallpaper . " " I know ? " Jules caught his breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sure you can . I 'll find a salesman for you . " " He wo n't be any good . " " I 'll look around until I find a good one . " " Sam , please ? " Jules was trembling with anxiety and thrift . " Well ? " " Sam , would you consider to come to work for me ? " He smiled and shook his head . " How much ? ? Just tell me , Sam . " " I would n't take another salary job . " " Commission then ? " " Nor that . " " Well , what ? " " If I ever quit with Acme , I 'll never go to work for anybody but myself . " " Oh ? " The Frenchman wet his lips , sitting in the creaky chair behind his littered desk  --  a pudgy little man with a bristling mustache but already getting bald . His small slate-colored eyes were thrifty and suspicious , but worried , too , and eager . " Perhaps we could ? " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make some arrangement , Sam ? " That 's how it had started . But it had taken months to bring it to an end  --  months of pretending that he was n't interested , endless fencing contests , in the office on Canal Street , in saloons , in restaurants , always winding up , " Oh , you 'll get along all right , " or something of that kind ; but not looking for a salesman , though he had his eye on several that he thought would be okay under his direction ; letting Jules do all the talking , not having much to say , but dropping in ideas to egg him on : painting pictures of a factory on the outskirts of Chicago where labor would be cheap and there 'd be room to grow , and up-to-date machinery , and a sales force on the road , maybe twenty men or more , traveling through the land from coast to coast . The Frenchman 's eyes would sparkle and he would begin to sputter and gesture with his hands . He spoke English well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get mixed up , using words that did n't fit , and sometimes talking French . One night in a bar " Combien ? " he fairly shouted . " Say now , what do you want ? "  | And he had calculated that the moment had arrived , that it was now or never . " All right , " he said , " I 'll tell you : not a penny less than half . " Jules gulped . His face flushed red and there were beads of sweat on it . He had thought for a moment that perhaps the jig was up . And then " Tres Bien , " he said with his shoulders drawn tight against his neck " Tres biers . " He nodded slowly . " It is a bargain , Sam . " And they had shaken hands across the table . " I Will , " but I will what ? ? A hell of a remark for anyone to make ; it had no sense in it . But Mitch was always saying things like that. ? His cigar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the platform , watching the sparks spring from the pavement. ? There was plenty to be done , to exercise your will on  --  to convert that loft of junk into a thriving factory , maybe into something big  --  oh , not measured in the scale of oil or steel , but big enough to satisfy an ordinary man , a boy from Wyattville . There were possibilities , a future that the Frenchman had n't dreamed of . No fancy , arty stuff for a handful of rich people . Bread-and-butter merchandise , the kind they 'd use in every farmhouse in the country , the kind the other factories did n't want to make or sell  --  the suckers did n't know that there was money in it ; and they 'd all be plugging for you , saying to their customers , " Buy your cheap stuff from Sam Braden . " I le had found that out already . And if they did get wise to what they were passing up  --  well , he 'd have a long head start ; he 'd be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in it ; not big money maybe , but plenty big enough . If Jules would go along and do what he was told , if he knew which side his bread was buttered on Deming Court. ? He swung off the car and walked briskly down the street  --  a quiet , pleasant street of modest houses with reddish sandstone fronts and a few apartment buildings . A neighbor called out to him . He knew most of the families in the block  --  friendly , German people who had brought their way of living to the country . They were clustered in that section of the city and they had made it seem a little like their homeland , clinging to the customs that they loved : their food and ordered neatness , their close-knit family life , their clubs and Turnvereins and beer gardens where , in the summer , they gathered out of doors at tables under spreading trees , and ate good German food and drank good German beer . And for the winter there were indoor places with frescoes on the walls depicting German legends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was music , orchestras and singing  --  music of the homeland . They had brought so many things when they came across  | the ocean : their German Christmas with the candlelighted tree , their birthday celebrations . They had not been here long enough to change or to forget . In almost every family there would be one quite old person who did not speak any English . The children who were born here did n't like that very much ; it embarrassed them with their companions . Chicago was all right. ? He was thinking of the evenings he had spent at the Rienzi or the Bismarck Garden , with Papa Kranz and Mama Kranz and Emilie , and the old grandmother , too , until she got too feeble to go outdoors at night  --  drinking beer out of a stein and listening to the music , like a member of the family ; of evenings when the carpet was rolled down the sandstone steps and they would sit till bedtime , chatting about things that were happening in the world , maybe strolling to the drugstore for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emilie ; of Sunday family picnics in the park , and the good things Mama Kranz would unpack from the basket . It was something to get back to after traveling on the road . He had really learned from them what a family could be like . He went up the steps and let himself into the house . It was after ten o'clock but they had not gone to bed . They were waiting up perhaps for news of what had happened . Emilie was in the parlor , playing the piano . When she heard the door she stopped and looked out into the hall . " It 's Uncle Sam , " she called . Otto Kranz came out from the back parlor where he and Mama Kranz were playing dominoes . " Well , Sam ? " he asked . " It 's settled , Papa Kranz . " He always called him that when he was with the family ; he had started it in mimicry of Emilie . " I 'm in business for myself . " " Ah , good ! " beamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door , buxom and placid as she had always been but getting older now . " I bet you , " he said , " Mr. Lubin was surprised ? " " I have n't told him yet . " " Ah , so ? " " Tomorrow 's soon enough . " He was like that : not burning any bridges until his feet were set upon the other side . " Well , we must celebrate this great occasion , Sam . A bottle of good Rhine wine , one I have been saving . The best we have , eh , Mama ? " " Of course , " she nodded . And Papa Kranz went hurrying to fetch it from the cellar . Mama  | Kranz sat down , hands folded in her lap . She said , half-humorously , that she felt a little sad , for some day now he would go away and leave them . And Emilie looked up startled " Why , Mama ? " Her big brown eyes reflected her concern . He had been like a brother and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl although she was sixteen . She shook her head impatiently and her auburn colored hair which hung down to her shoulders , shimmered warmly in the light of the piano lamp . " Why should he go away ? " " Nonsense ! " He laughed . " I 'll be here all the time instead of once a week . " " Well , maybe ? " Mama Kranz seemed unconvinced . " But in business for yourself , you will want to settle down . " " I 'm settled down , " he said . " You 'll want your own home , Sam , and you will want  --  a wife . " " A wife ! " He laughed again . " I 'm going to wait till Emilie is old enough to marry me . " " Oh , Uncle Sam ! " She was confused and blushing . " I bet you wo n't , " she said . " And I 'm almost old enough ? " And then she changed the subject . " Oh yes , I meant to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A friend of yours is going to be married . " " A friend of mine ? " " I read it in the paper . That girl in the auto , the time we had the wreck . " Not Becky Adams ? " " Yes . " " To whom ? " " It 's in the evening paper , and both their pictures , too . " She brought the paper , open at the place . " Neill Wyatt ! " And he stared ; his heart was thumping . Of all things that he had n't thought would happen . And yet , why not ? He had not seen Neill Wyatt since that day in Lincoln Park ; he had seen Becky only once since then and that was long ago . What did he know about them ? Why should he be surprised ? ? Perhaps deep down he had actually believed what everybody said : that Eileen would get Neill Wyatt if anybody did . But he never had admitted it. ? He read the opening lines : " Mr. and Mrs. Stanley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And pictures of them : a little one of Neill , smiling at you carelessly , shirt open at the neck , as if he might be playing tennis ; and a big one of Becky , looking pert and rich and classy , but  | in profile so you could n't see the left side of her face . " Well , well ! " he said . " Are you glad about it , Sam ? " Mama Kranz inquired . " Glad ? " he shrugged . But he was glad , though he did n't yet quite know the reason why  --  as if a thing that he had willed and planned , had come to pass when he had abandoned hope that it ever would , when , indeed , he had almost forgotten it . " Oh , I do n't care , " he said , " one way or another . " " You act kind of funny though , " Emilie was watching him . " Do I ? " He grinned . " Maybe , " she teased , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Maybe , " he agreed , laughing overloudly to cover his elation which was mounting like the feeling from a highball. ? No , he had not wanted Becky for himself , never in a moment of his life  --  not with all her money , all the money in the world . " Anyway you would n't tell us ? " Emilie was looking at the paper , studying the pictures . " Why yes , of course , " she said . " Is n't he the man who owned the auto ? ? the one that caused the wreck ? " " That 's right , " he nodded . " Ah so ! " Mama Kranz sat straighter in her chair . " And the scar on her face  --  did it ever go away ? " " Well , I do n't know , " he said . " I 've only seen her once ; she had it then . " " Was it a bad scar , Sam ? " " Yes , bad . " He drew a line across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Like that , " he said . He had seen it through the dotted veil she wore , that time he had met her on the street . He would not have recognized her through the veil but she had called his name . And he had seen the scar , trying not to look at it  --  a white , disfiguring welt across her face . " Was she a pretty girl ? ? I mean , before it happened ? " " Cute looking , " he admitted . " Perhaps , " said Emilie cheerfully , " perhaps he felt he had to . " " Had to ? Had to what ? " " To marry her , I mean . " " Nonsense ! " He laughed , but the idea was unstartling , as if it had already cross his mind . Mama Kranz corrected her for expressing such a notion . " But , Mama , " she protested , " why else would they wait until they 're both so old ? "  | " Am I so old ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no , I did n't mean ? " She was terribly confused , blushing prettily in the lamplight . " But if people love each other  --  well then , why should they wait ? " " Perhaps they did n't know it , " Mama Kranz suggested . " Love comes quickly sometimes , sometimes very slowly . " " I would know it , " Emilie said . " I would know it right away . " But he was n't listening to them , and the thought that had been started , went galloping along . Could it be that ? ? the sporting thing to do , " cricket " as they called it ? But it was n't likely Neill would marry anyone unless he wanted to ; nor likely that Becky had lacked suitors . A scar across her face would n't keep the boys away , nor a pair of wooden legs  --  not from Stanley Adams ' daughter . And yet it could have been a means to gain her end , if she had had an end , waiting for Neill Wyatt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident perhaps that he would never marry anybody else while she remained unmarried . But it would n't be like Becky to play that sort of game . Still , what else was she to do ? If she was in love with him , she could n't marry someone to ease his conscience for him Papa Kranz returned with a bottle of good Rhine wine and the subject blew away in a gust of merriment as they drank to his success , clinking glasses all around . But his thought kept straying from them , from their kindness and good wishes , straying backward and then forward into nebulous elation . Ile was glad to get away to the shelter of his room where , stretched out in his bed , he could think about it calmly . He had only seen her once , that one time on the street , four or five years ago . At Mama Kranz ' suggestion he had sent some flowers to her after the accident , and had received a breezy note of thanks , adding in a postscript , " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after some time , he had had another note inviting him to come to a party at her house- " a supper dance , informal . " But of course he had n't gone . He was n't mixing up with a lot of rah-rah boys and snooty , giggling girls from around the Lake Shore Drive , not if he could help it . If it was to do again  --  well , he might go , hoping for the chance to meet her father . It might come very handy , knowing Stanley Adams socially . He had written his regrets , making some excuse about being on the road . And then one day , after a year or more , he had met her on the street ? on Washington , by Field 's . He had n't noticed her until she called his  | name , and at first he was n't sure who she was . He stopped and tipped his hat . " Do n't you know me , Uncle Sam ? ? Remember little Becky ? " Pert as ever , kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could hardly see her face but you could n't miss the scar . " So you wo n't come to my house ? " She had started out like that , and he had mumbled something . " You think you 're too good for us , do n't you , Sam ? " He had never in the least known how to talk to her . " You 're an awful snob , " she said , " the worst I 've ever met . " Calling him a snob  --  well , that was funny . He laughed and changed the subject , asking about Neill , not knowing what to say . " Oh , Neill 's all right , " she answered petulantly . " He 's eternally all right ; that 's the trouble with him . He 's in Africa or somewhere . " And she added with a shrug , " Must we talk about our friends ? " " Well , I just wondered ? " He wished to God she had n't seen him . " Neill 's all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't go to work when he was twelve , or whatever age you started . " " Why sure , Neill 's all right . " " But you do n't think so . " " Of course I do . " " You 're a liar , Sam . You hit him in the face once with a piece of lemon pie . " " Oh well ? " he laughed . " And you 'd do it again if you ever got a chance . Neill would n't . He likes you  --  if he ever thinks about you. ? Why ? ? I mean , why would you ? " " I would n't , " he protested . " Oh , come along , " she said and took his arm . " I 'm going into Field 's to tea . I 'm late . Why are you such a liar ? " You could n't get sore because of how she said it : a kind of careless kidding , though she might mean some of it , but he was never sure which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be saying something . " Eileen ! " She shrugged impatiently . " There you go again . Really , Uncle Sam , you should cultivate a light touch . " She paused at the entrance to the store . " Who cares about Eileen ? Oh yes , you do , of course . Well now , let 's see ? " She cocked her head mischievously . " I seem to see her sitting in the musty family mansion , looking at the family album . " " I thought you two were friends , " he said uncomfortably .  | " Did you ? How naive ! " She studied him a moment quizzically . " Why do n't you ask her , Sam ? " " Ask her ? " he repeated . " To marry you , or how she is , or something ? " He stood there grinning foolishly . " She 's not getting any younger and blondes do n't last forever . " He tried to laugh it off . " I 've simply got to run now ? " She turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice to have a chat ? " And he had not seen or heard from her since then . What was she driving at ? ? those cracks about himself and Neill , and the catty way she talked about Eileen ? At the time he had thought it was just her usual line : to embarrass a person and make a sucker out of him . But perhaps it had been something more than that . Maybe she had been in love with Neill for years , and maybe she had got him in payment for that scar . Well , it did n't matter much ; all that mattered was the fact . And elation swelled within him as the source of it grew plainer : Neill Wyatt was removed from his affairs ; a shadow on his path had been finally dissipated  - -  He could like Neill Wyatt now  --  like him well enough. ? It had been a long hard day and he was getting sleepy . He put out the bedside lamp and lay back upon his pillow , seeing in the dark a boy in sailor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red cap cupped around her flaxen curls . Nostalgia crept out of his childhood and he remembered things long since forgotten : the time that she had kissed him in a game of post office  --  the only time he 'd ever felt the softness of her lips , but she had sent for him ; the time he 'd walked with her along the levee when his bicycle was coming on the boat , picking a path for her around the mudholes , holding his elbow tight to conceal his torn shirt ; the time he sat beside her at the party on Old Henry 's croquet ground , and the colored paper lanterns and the songs that Nelly sang ; the way her hair had looked in school with the sunlight shining on it ; this thing and that . There was n't much and for ten years had been nothing , but he made the most of it , adding warmth out of himself . I le tried to picture how she would look now  --  older of course , and her hair would be done another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious and calm without any worry lines , and the same expression on it , not indifferent but detached  --  enigmatic was the word . It would be hard to tell what she was thinking . She would n't seem to hurry but that  | was n't indolence , and when she was sitting down she would n't lounge around or cross her legs . She would have a lot of poise and dignity . In an evening gown she would be stunning  --  going to the theater or into a cafe ; people would look around and inquire who she was  --  or at her table at a dinner party , she would be a gracious hostess , sought after and admired . You 'd be awfully proud of her . Her voice would be the same , soft and rather low  --  not wasting words , half saying things and leaving you to guess . He fancied her head on the pillow at his side in a tangle of spun gold , cheek cupped in her hand and blue eyes smiling at him . Ile had always loved Eileen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry . He had buried it away , forgotten it sometimes , but it had n't ever changed . " I Will , " but I will what ? ? Old Mitch and his ideas ! He smiled indul-gently- The first decade of the century had drawn to a close . Everything was going fine . William Howard Taft was President and substantial people felt he could be trusted . The country had been muckraked from one end to the other . Baker , Tarbell , Sinclair , Steffens , and that renegade , Tom Lawson , had turned it inside out , exposing everything that they could lay their hands on , from sausage to finance . Even Mitch Ballou had written a book about Chicago politics , but nobody would publish it . The game was up ; it was too late . The public had lost interest in the subject ; the country had survived the hysteria of reform . The train was rushing on a mile a minute and it was n't going to stop while a lot of long-haired bums poked around the engine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe in the summer ; the boats were packed . They did not pay much attention to anything they saw , loafing around with a patronizing air and their pockets full of money which they carelessly disbursed , making cracks about the natives and complaining about things . Mitch Ballou had gone one summer  --  on a cattle boat. ? Chicago was all right , right on its toes . Labor was plentiful and cheap  --  fifteen cents an hour for a pick and shovel man , sixty hours in the week , or sometimes longer . But other things were cheap : a nickel for a beer , two cocktails for a quarter , a classy suit of clothes for eighteen dollars , and two fifty for a pair of Frazin 's shoes . For thirty cents you could get a hearty meal , not in an A r restaurant , but plenty good enough ; for a dollar you could eat almost anywhere in town . " Ten , twenty , thirty " was the price of vaudeville  --  best seats a little higher ; " legit " attractions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . A haircut was a quarter and a shave was fifteen cents , even in the Palmer House where the barbershop was tiled with silver dollars . On a hundred a month a man could raise a family and do a decent job ; a three thousand dollar salary was considered affluent. ? Yes , Chicago was all right  --  if you did n't snoop around like Mitch Ballou . A group of worthy citizens had decided on a plan to make the city beautiful ? " The Chicago Plan " they called it . They figured that there was n't much to do about what was already done , but they had the lake to work on ; they would put their beauty there . It was a clever notion : the urban excrement , like oriental night soil , would serve as a foundation for architects and artists  --  for a city which would rise from the bosom of the lake . Mitch was unimpressed . He remarked that , from the windows of the el , the town would look the same. ? Everything was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were making buttons in the warehouse on the levee . Young Henry had some stock which he had accepted in part payment for the property . He had bought a little house in Long Beach , California , and went out there in the winter with his wife . He was stepping out , folks said , since his father died . An interurban line was coming into town , and the Rock Island Railroad was trying hard to stop it , threatening , if it did , to pull up its track and quit . The Elliott Wyatt Company , so everybody said , was financing the interurban line . VIII SAM MARRIED EILEEN WYATT-BUT NOT HURRIEDLY OR RASHLY . THEY were married in Chicago in the spring of 1912 . Quite likely Fate had tired , and Eileen too perhaps , of trying to avert it . They lived together for five years , though not the last two years as man and wife , not after Neill and Becky separated  --  or , to be exact , not after Becky 's suit for a divorce  --  a brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Court and published in the papers . But this could have been coincidence . At all events it did not at the time occur to Sam that the end of his marriage  --  the real end of it  --  might have been related to the ending of the other ; and then it was impossible  | to say , nor a thing he would admit without contributory evidence , and the evidence was lacking . It was he who had got through , or so he thought , and so it would appear to an observer  --  through with a relationship which from its inception , had been destined to this end . It was he who took the step , who said what had been said  --  cruel and brutal things , long gathering in his heart , goaded into utterance by a cankering frustration , by a voice that would not answer , by eyes that told him nothing , by a wall he could not scale or penetrate  --  things which could not be unsaid no matter how you tried ; and he had tried . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were unconvincing lies . There was no chance after thatght , and indeed had never been one , though he did not know that then . o , no matter how or when , there was no other end to it . But it had no connection with anybody else Hub Baxter put the notion in his mind , or brought it to the surface . It was in 1918 , in the spring , the last year of the war . She was in France and she had written him , after many months of silence , asking his consent to a divorce which could be had in Paris with his co-operation  --  a brief and formal note , not adding anything to her request beyond that there would be no question of expense or alimony since she had ample means in her own right . " Dear Sam , " it began , and ended at the page rtl end with " Sincerely . . . . " He had not been much surprised , not emotionally upset . The pang of her had long since passed away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her for a year . He had dropped in to talk to Hub about it , in a mind to give consent and let her have her way , only making sure that it would be in order , with no loose ends about it . But Hub had hemmed and hawed as lawyers do  --  he knew of course that they were separated . He did n't like the idea of a French divorce , he said ; some of the states looked askance at them , and complications might result ; it was safer to proceed in the constituted channels . Let it wait till she came back , was his advice . There was n't any hurry after all this time . And then he asked a question : " How long is it , Sam ? " " About a year . " " I mean , since you separated ? " " Oh ! " He thought a moment . " We did n't really separate until she went away . I gave up the apartment when she left . " " No . " Hub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've lived as man and wife ? "  | " Oh . . . " He winced and looked away . " Three years ago , " he said . " The twenty-third of June , 1915 . " " That 's definite anyway . " Hub smiled , drawing figures on a scratch pad . " Well , after waiting that long , it can wait a little longer . " He was looking at the pad . " That was about the time the Neill Wyatts were divorced . " " Yes , " Sam nodded . " It came out in the papers on that day , the twenty-third of June . " " Oh ! " Hub kept on drawing . " Kind of a coincidence , things breaking up like that  --  Eileen and you and Neill . " " Coincidence ? " Sam said . " What do you mean by that ? " " Why nothing , Sam . " He laughed . " It just struck me as funny . " " Funny ? Why ? " " Oh , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , look . . . " Sam got up from his chair ; his hands were dripping wet . " My breakup with Eileen was our affair . It had nothing to do with anybody else . It happened at that time , but that 's all there is to that . " " Sure , Sam , I know . " " Just to keep the record straight . " " Of course . . . " Hub shrugged and changed the subject . " You were asking my advice about a legal matter . " " That 's all I want to know , " Sam answered drily . ' Well . . . " Hub leaned back in his chair with his eyes upon the ceiling . He was doing very well for a young man  --  a junior partner in a big , aggressive firm whose practice was confined to corporation law . He had married a girl whom he had known in college , and already had two children . They lived in Hinsdale in a modest stucco house which Hub had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated , as if he were considering a question of importance , " . . . I 'd say to let it go till she gets back . The war wo n't last forever . " Sam made no reply . He was standing at the window , looking down Monroe Street . " If you like , " Hub suggested , " I 'll write to her myself , advising her to wait . " " No , " Sam said at last . " If she wants it , she can have it . " " All right . " Flub laughed . " You 're paying for advice , but you do n't have to take it . That 's what keeps us busy . " " But you can write her , Hub . " Sam came back to the desk . " Tell her it 's okay so far as I 'm concerned . You can help her , I suppose ? "  | " Probably . . . " Hub nodded . " I 'll get it off tomorrow . Leave her letter with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Red Cross , " Hub noted , " Base Hospital 19 , Soissons  --  that 's rather close behind the front , " he said . " Is it ? " Sam shrugged , and added with a smile , " That 's where she 'd want to be . " Hub got up to go with him to the door  --  got up heavily ; he had taken on a lot of weight , notwithstanding golf on Sunday at the Hinsdale Country Club . " How 's business ? " he inquired , to be saying something . " Fine , " Sam said , and smiled wryly to himself as the door was closed behind him . It was very far from fine . The big , new factory out in Clearing , where labor had been cheap , was fighting for its life . It was n't paid for , but that was not the problem ; the Stanley Adams bank could worry about that . The problem was how to keep it running . The war was playing hell with it : prices were sky high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; labor was scarce and beginning to be cocky . They ran an open shop , a twelve-hour shift at times , and not paying any more than the ordinary scale . But it looked as though the end of that was coming : organizers were around , holding meetings in the lunch hour ; there had been a lot of grumbling and some talk about a strike He wedged into a crowded elevator . It was half-past five and people going home  --  a bad hour of the day for a man who lived alone in a room in a hotel . The stenographers and clerks pushed back to make room for him ; the elevator man did not click the latch to hurry him . He was obviously a person of importance  --  a high-priced man , an executive perhaps . He was thirty-four years old ; his body had filled out and the pinched look in his face had disappeared ; the freckles were all gone and the cowlick reduced to a becoming riffle . His gray , conventional suit was custom made ; his shoes were shined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eileen had taught him how to dress , had taught him many things , not by criticism or suggestion , but by rare and casual comment of her eyes ; and he had been quick to learn . The sales end was all right , he told himself . He could take care of that , distribute every roll the factory made . Production was the problem , and that was up to Jules , and Jules was cracking up  --  acting like a Frenchman , crazy and hysterical . He did n't like the French , had no patience with them . He had hoped in the beginning that they would lose the war to the sturdy , honest Germans  --  men like Papa Kranz  | He crossed the lobby toward Monroe Street , passing a cigar stand which had once belonged to Otto , but there was another name above it now . And Papa Kranz was dead , but that was not the reason that the stand had changed its name , for the changing of the name had happened first . Papa Kranz had lost it ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , and he had lost them all , one after another . His customers had quit him because he was a German  --  some had even threatened to move out of the building unless his lease was canceled . They had acted like a lot of goddam fools . No doubt Papa Kranz had talked too much , anyway in the beginning ; he was not a man to pussyfoot around . And he had paid for it : his business kept on shrinking and leases that expired could not be renewed . Papa Kranz had grieved about it  --  grieved himself to death He came out onto Monroe Street and his thoughts went back to Jules . The man was getting old and he had some heart disease . He acted like a nut : he would sit down at his desk and cry about things  --  tears trickling down his cheeks . The boys around the factory knew they had his goat and they would n't be afraid to put the screws on . He was always talking of the old days on Canal Street and wishing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely he 'd be glad to sell out his half and quit ? at a bargain-counter price . Yes , this would be the time to buy him out . But buy him out with what ? He was stubborn as a mule ; if he thought you wanted something he would quickly change his price . Elliott Wyatt would know how to make a deal , how to juggle things around without changing any money ; but he 'd want his pound of flesh The current of his thoughts was diverted to the Wyatts. ? What was Hub intimating about Eileen and Neill ? ? Well , that was nonsense ! Neill Wyatt was n't even in Chicago at the time ; no one knew where he was . He and Becky had been living in New York , if they could be said to live anywhere at all . And then he had gone over and joined the British Air Force , not even waiting until the divorce was granted . It had all been in the papers . And he 'd been there ever since  --  almost three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great fuss made ' about it . He was pretty old to be flying airplanes , but of course that 's what he 'd like  --  grandstand stunts and cricket There was nothing in that stuff . Neill had never given a tinker 's dam about her , and , whatever she had felt , she had gotten over it when he married Becky Adams . She had hardly seen him since then , and never talked about him , never wrote or heard from him  --  not as far as he knew . Suppose she was in France ? That did n't mean a thing . She  | had wanted to do something , like a lot of other women . And he had said she could  --  but she would have done it anyway ; it was just a pleasant gesture , asking his consent . So what the hell ! The whole thing had been over two years before that . If there had been a reason , would she have stuck around ? It was n't likely . Anyhow , it was he who ended it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He walked along Monroe Street , aimlessly but briskly . There was no place to go  --  a bad hour of the day since Eileen went away , but it had never been a very good one . He wished he had an office in the Loop . If the business ever got back on its feet , that was one thing he 'd do . It was too early for dinner . Should he stop and have a drink ? ? should he eat downtown ? ? and where ? ? And after that , then what ? He could take in a show but he was n't in the mood . He 'd like someone to talk to  --  not to be alone . The hotel where he lived was out by Lincoln Park , an apartment hotel , sedate and gloomy . He had thought of going back to live with Mama Kranz , but you could n't pick things up where you had put them down : and now that Papa Kranz was gone , it would n't be the same . And Emilie grown up  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if that had happened . He had hardly seen them since the funeral . It might be they were having tough sledding by themselves . He ought to call them up or drop around sometime. ? Sometime but not tonight He wished there was someone that he felt like telephoning , and he checked in his mind the few he knew outside of business hours . Their friends had been her friends , married couples like themselves , and not many of them either . In a way he had been disappointed about that ; she was not a social person . After she went away he had avoided them : he did n't really care about them anyhow . They suspected of course that something had gone wrong ; it was embarrassing for him and for them , too . " Where 's Eileen ? " they 'd ask , and " What 's she doing now ? " And he could n't answer them with any certainty . It was likely enough that they knew more than he did , and were fishing around to see what they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could sit down and talk to Mitch  --  or listen to him . But Mitch was overseas , a foreign correspondent , writing stuff about the war . He had been up to the front and had nearly gotten shot , according to his story  --  an exciting kind of job but no future to the thing . When the war came to an end he would be back where he started . Still , Mitch would n't care . He would have enlisted but for his sightless eye . He said he 'd never missed it until then . He 'd been writing pretty  | well , with his name signed to his stuff , a good war correspondent ? probably the best one-eyed one in the world He even wished that he could talk to Mike . But Mike was in the Army , had enlisted at the start , no doubt glad to get away from the tax assessor 's office , and to interrupt the sequence of Mrs. Hogan 's pregnancies  --  they already had five children . Being in a war would be a break for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hub  --  had given him a party at the College Inn the night he left for camp . They had been a little drunk and sentimental He turned north on Dearborn Street , resolving to walk home . It would serve to kill an hour. ? Mike and Mitch and Hub , the old friends of his childhood . Grover had gone as a doctor to the war  --  as an officer of course . Hub was safe enough , with his family out in Hinsdale . But what about himself ? ? There was n't any use to kid yourself about it : if the thing went on a while , he could be drafted . What was there to prevent it ? He was in the age group , the next one that they 'd call ; he was physically okay , without children or dependents ; he would n't have a wife much longer now ; his business did n't matter to anyone but him . Sure they could get him  --  if the thing went on a while No , this was not the time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at bargain-counter price " Sam ! " He stopped and stared , for there was Mitch Ballou coming through the swinging doors , out of the Tribune Building  --  old Mitch in mussy , unpressed clothes , a coat that did n't match his pants , a necktie like a piece of string , a weather-beaten hat stained black around the sweat-band " My God , " he said . " I thought you were in France . " " That 's right . " Mitch pumped his hand . " I just got in . I 'm busting up with this gang ? " He motioned toward the Tribune . " The bastards think it 's their war ; they cut my stuff to ribbons . I just resigned  --  or else they fired me ; I 'm not quite sure which . " " That 's tough , " Sam said . " It 's swell . " Mitch laughed . " I got a better job , on a paper in New York . I 'm going back tomorrow . They 're sending me to Moscow . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess you wo n't like that . " " It 's the one place on the globe I want to go . " " You do ? But why ? " " My God ! " Mitch stared at him . " Do n't you read the papers ? There 's something going on in Russia , Sam , ? something different , something  | new . Maybe it 's a racket , like all the rest of them . But I want to see , myself . I want to have a look . " " Well , yes ? " Sam nodded vaguely . " But starvation and disease and those crazy Bolsheviki ? " " Sure , " Mitch agreed and changed the subject . " How 's everything with you ? " " Fine , " he said and smiled , " Well , pretty good . " " Still grinding out the stuff to beautify the home ? " " You bet . " " Well , do n't get smothered with it . " " No ? " He shook his head . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Swell , " Mitch grinned . " It 's lucky that we met . I was going to call you up , but I 'm running on a schedule ? " " Well , say ? " His voice was eager . " ? ca n't we have dinner , Mitch , and spend the evening ? " " I 'd like to , Sam , but I 've got to see a gal I used to play around with . " " Oh yeh ? " His heart sank . " But look ? " Mitch grabbed his arm . " ? we can dash across the street and have a quick one . " They scuttled through the traffic across Dearborn to the bar where the Tribune gang held out  --  a crowded , noisy place . Half a dozen fellows hailed Mitch , slapping him on the back , wanting to buy a drink  --  careless , seedy looking fellows like himself . They elbowed to the bar and had two scotch and sodas pretty fast . Mitch kept talking like a whirlwind , interrupting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was popular , it seemed  --  and picking up his story at the point where he left off : the Germans would be whipped , the skids were under them , the French had done the trick of holding them in check until we could make a start ; when the might of America really hit the line , it would crumple like an empty paper bag " Yes ? When ? " Sam asked . " Before the year is out . " " You really think so , Mitch ? " " I 'm betting money on it . " He put down his empty glass . " Say , Sam , I 've got to run . " " One more ? " Mitch shook his head . " A quick one , eh ? " " I ca n't . " He stepped back from the bar . " Oh yes , by God , I almost forgot to tell you ? "  | " What ? " " I saw Eileen in Paris . " " You did ? " His heart stepped up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " How was she ? " He kept looking at his glass , moving his hand to stir the ice around . " Swell , " Mitch said . " And stunning , too , in her Red Cross cape and cap . She was on a holiday , from some hospital somewhere . " " Soissons ? " " Yes , that 's the place . " " Is she  --  all right ? " He was going to say happy , but changed the word half spoken . " I 'd say , " Mitch answered drily , " that she was in the pink . " " Oh ? " He nodded slowly . " Where did you run into her ? " " In a restaurant , " Mitch said , " a ritzy place , not the kind I go to unless somebody takes me , but I was with a fellow from the Embassy . When we were coming out somebody called my name , and I looked around and there was Neill ? " " Yeh ? " Sam said , watching his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyatt , " Mitch went on , " natty as hell in his Air Corps uniform with a row of colored ribbons spread across his chest . He was waving me to come , and then I saw Eileen sitting at the table ? " " Yeh ? " Sam said again . " Just the two of them , " Mitch said . " A platter full of oysters worth about a franc apiece , champagne in a cooler . Neill wanted me to stop and have a drink , but the fellow I was with was waiting for me . " " Yeh ? " Sam nodded , counting out some money on the bar . " Did she say  --  anything ? " " No , " Mitch said , " I do n't remember that she did . " He shrugged . " Well , hell , you know Eileen . " Yeh ? " He pocketed his change . " When did you say it was ? " " About two weeks ago , just before I left . Say , Sam , I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Okay , " he said . " So long ? " Mitch knew about them , knew that they had parted long ago . He had confided it to Mitch not long after it happened , but not saying much about it . And Mitch had been as brief . " A lucky break , " he said , " for both of you . " He had not pursued the subject ; there were things you could n't talk about to anyone on earth . And Mitch would n't understand :  | he was n't lonely . Women dropped into his lap and he played with them a while and then slid out from under . They expected him to do that and did n't seem to care . And he would find another and enjoy her just as much He walked along the crowded pavement , his hands clenched so tightly that the nails dug in his palms . It was July and the sun still slanting hotly in the canyon of the street . The highballs made him hotter ; sweat trickled through his hair where his straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the corner , glancing at the headlines : " Huns Retreat Across the Marne , " but the words made no impression on his thought Just the two of them  --  a cozy little party  --  ritzy and expensive ? oysters on a platter , champagne in a cooler  --  a natty uniform with ribbons on his chest . God damn him anyway ! ? Not them but him ? , he thought. ? Pretty soft to be in Paris with a pocket full of money that someone else had made , acting like a hero , swaggering in the night spots with another fellow 's wife . But he knew this was a lie : Neill Wyatt would n't swagger , would n't care enough about it , would be a lot too busy doing what he pleased . And he would n't be a hero , or act like one at least . And Eileen was his cousin ; they had grown up together . What would be more natural than to take her out to dinner ? If it was on the sly , would he call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anyway ! The two of them  --  out having fun . And he was going home to a room in a hotel . But it had n't been a home , in the apartment . All the furniture and stuff , and the dining table set with sparkling glass and silver , and the maid in cap and apron , and fresh flowers in the vases  --  oh , Eileen knew how to do things , and she did them to the end , to the day she went away . She had spent her money , too , buying things for the apartment , though he had n't liked the idea . Old Henry had left her a hundred thousand dollars  --  the income from a trust , and she had been generous with it : the oriental rugs , the Steinway grand piano , the cuff links that he wore , a stickpin for his tie , his evening studs But it had n't been a home , not even at the start  --  not the living room , nor dining room , nor the one he called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not their pleasant bedroom which looked out across the lake , with its twin beds side by side in their silken counterpanes , and the night stand set between them  --  just a yard apart they were ; you could reach across to her . And then one day you could n't . But it never had been easy , not the way it should be . How many , many times he had  | wakened in the night , listening for her breathing , to be certain she was there , and then certain that she was n't  --  and turning on the light , and getting up to find her . It might be two or three or four o'clock . And she would be sitting somewhere in to dark , but she would hear him coming and quickly turn a light on . She would say that it was nothing , she had been awake and restless  --  just sitting there and smiling , never adding anything , any reason or complaint . But sometimes her eyes were rimmed , as if she had been crying . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closely , an element of timing in these matters . He had refused to take it seriously , and he did not wish to think about it now . Perhaps all wives did things like that Would it have been different if she had had a child ? But she had n't wanted children , though she never put it that way , never really put it any way  --  evading with her eyes , if he hinted at the subject . Perhaps she was afraid ? But no , that was n't likely ; she seemed to have no nerves ; he had never seen her frightened . Maybe there was something lacking from her nature , that she simply did n't have , was incapable of giving , or of wanting to receive ? Could it be that she was cold , as Nelly always said  --  a frigid woman ? ? He shook his head , as if to shake it clear . He had been all over this so many times ? Regardless of the reason , it had n't been a home . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , it did not concern Neill Wyatt He had never had a home , not since his mother died. ? He welcomed the intrusion of this thought , a diversion of his bitterness onto safer ground. ? No , he 'd never had a home , not since he had been old enough to understand his father  --  to be ashamed of him , of the nickel-plated star , of Shanty Town , of poverty . He could put his finger on the day when it began  --  sitting on the ground beside his broken sled , with Madge standing in the doorway ? " Because we 're poor , " she said .
