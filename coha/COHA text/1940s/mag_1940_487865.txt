ALTHOUGH THE WAR IN THE AIR GOES ON with unabated savagery , it is on the diplomatic front that the major strategic moves are being made . Unofficial but probably inspired reports from Berlin suggest an early effort to complete the Gleichschaltung of Vichy and to bring France into the war as a junior Axis partner . Von Ribbentrop , it is rumored , may shortly go to Vichy , and Laval is said to be in Paris now consulting with the German authorities there . Berlin sources also hint at important developments concerning Spain in the next few days . Certainly Franco could become an open belligerent with greater safety if France were induced to turn on its old ally , for Vichy still commands sufficient naval forces to add to the British problem of defending Gibraltar and blockading Spain . But however willing Marshal Petain and his reactionary friends may be to prostitute themselves to Berlin , it seems incredible that they could actually join the war against Britain without a revolt occurring in unoccupied France and the colonies . The timing of Winston Churchill 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had news of the Axis plans and hoped to rally France against its unrepresentative government . Meanwhile the diplomatic struggle continues in the Balkans . Yugoslavia has all but surrendered to the Axis , following a large-scale Italian military demonstration on its borders , and Bulgaria appears ready to be " protected " in return for a strip of Greece . TRAFFIC IS MOVING AGAIN ON THE BURMA road after a disastrous experiment with appeasement . Unfortunately the work China has put in on the road in the interval may be largely offset by Japan 's ability to bomb it from recently acquired Indo-China bases . It is hardly likely that the Japanese aviators will be able to stop traffic altogether over the road , but the Chinese must be prepared to suffer heavy losses of material . To make matters worse , Great Britain retreated at the last moment from its intention to open Hongkong as well as the Burma road . Despite the Japanese blockade of the South China coast , it is probable that a larger volume of supplies would have reached China via Hongkong than by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smuggled , they would have been safer from aerial bombardment . Meanwhile , Japan is also encountering difficulty in maintaining a flow of essential war supplies . Although it has been reported that the Japanese mission in the Dutch East Indies was about to conclude an agreement providing Japan with 40 per cent of its oil requirements over the next six months , London dispatches insist that the British government has contracted for the East Indies ' entire output of high-octane aviation gasoline . If this contract can be maintained against Japanese pressure , Japan may yet be obliged to cut down its terroristic bombing of defenseless Chinese cities . THERE IS TALK OF AN AMERICAN WHEAT loan to Franco . The idea is supposed to have originated in the mind of the unreconstructible Lord Halifax , who apparently has learned nothing from the catastrophic failure of his other attempts at appeasement . The effort to win Spain from the Axis was doomed from the day Barcelona fell to Franco and his fascist backers . To make the attempt today would be worse than idiotic ; it would be a criminal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may be argued that just a little American wheat , carefully rationed , might prolong Spain 's non-belligerency by a few useful weeks . But this is a dangerous and mistaken argument . The appointment of a solid pro-Axis Cabinet in Spain , with Sulzer as Foreign Minister , is an open announcement that Franco 's last independent card has been played . Himmler is now in Madrid to gather up the chips . No loan to Spain could produce results important enough to offset the wave of suspicion and anger such an act would set in motion in democratic circles of every country . President Roosevelt has said : " The people of the United States . . . reject the doctrine of appeasement . They recognize it for what it is , a major weapon of the aggressor nations . " We believe the President meant what he said ; and we can not believe that he will sanction a loan to General Franco . 378 BUT HEINRICH HIMMLER DID NOT HAVE TO go to Spain to collaborate with Franco . The execution of Luis Companys is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its Spanish colleagues . The president of the former Catalan Republic was seized either in France or Belgium by Hitler 's police and shipped to his executioners . According to reports from the Spanish border , he was tortured to death by the " garrote ml . " His death dramatizes the terror that parades as government in Franco 's Spain . Companys was a liberal republican , known and loved throughout the country as a lawyer and writer who risked his high position to defend the Anarchists and other political opponents of the repressive regime in Barcelona prior to the rebellion of 1934 . The execution of so moderate and so popular a leader confirms the charge that the terror in Spain has not been lessened during the nineteen months since the fall of the republic but on the contrary has grown more brutal and indiscriminate . It is known that many other famous anti-fascist Spaniards have been shipped to Franco by the Gestapo . The horrible death of Companys will not have been wholly in vain if it stirs the conscience of those who have the power to admit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow-tyrants . Thousands of men and women will meet the fate of Luis Companys if the United States is unwilling to offer them asylum . The visit of Himmler to Madrid is notice that the time for saving them is short . * MARTIN DIES IS HAVING A QUARREL WITH the State and Justice departments . His committee has turned up information about the activities of German consular agents in this country so incriminating that to spread it on the record in public official hearings would , it is said , make a final break with Germany inevitable . Some of the hush-hush officials in the State Department have apparently been arguing that such a break would be inadvisable because it would mean the withdrawal from Germany of our few remaining representatives , thereby cutting off our only sources of information there . On the basis of that part of the Dies data which appeared unofficially in the New York Post last week , we are paying a fantastic price for the service of a few representatives in Germany . The head devil of the Nazis in America is Friedhelm Draeger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the German consulates / and a network of organizations disguised as non-political business organizations which spend a great deal more than they ostensibly take in . Surely it should be obvious by this time that the only way to handle Nazi agents is to kick them out , and on this score Dies is right . But there is more than a hint that , as usual , Dies 's larger objective is a rousing red-hunt . He now says that there are 5,000 potential saboteurs in Detroit alone , and among The NATION the subversive organizations he wants outlawed are the I. W. W. , the Maritime Union , and the Transport Workers ' Union . Stalin 's paid agents deserve no better fate than Hitler 's , but if Dies is following his characteristic technique of using the Nazi menace as a stick with which to attack the labor movement , we hope the Department of Justice will scan his evidence against workers with the utmost care and skepticism. * WE ARE CERTAIN THAT IT CAN ALL BE explained , but just the same we feel a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Shift to Willkie of Five States Seen " was a head in the New York Times of October 18 . On the nineteenth came a story under the head " Few Voters Seen Shifting Choices . " Subheads on the two successive days announced : " Gallup Survey Shows Swing of Illinois , Wisconsin , Iowa , Indiana , and Michigan " and " Gallup Survey Indicates That the Majority Have Not Been Swayed by Campaign . " It seems that 10 per cent of the voters interviewed in one poll were Roosevelt supporters who had once been for Willkie , while 8 per cent were Willkie supporters who had once been for Roosevelt . This should leave Roosevelt 2 per cent up on the challenger , but another subhead on the eighteenth reported : " One Per Cent Increase in Popular Vote for Republican Nominee Also Is Indicated . " Which appears to mean either that a good many hitherto uncommitted voters have just made up their minds in favor of Willkie or that the Gallup poll is chasing its tail . Campaign developments of the week hardly clarify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hustings is interpreted by the Republicans as a sign of alarm , and the press is filled with reports of Willkie inroads into the vast Germanic vote of the Middle West . No incumbent nominee , however , has yet been known to sit silent through the last two weeks of a campaign ; and if the Middle West shows a trend toward Willkie , that trend has been sadly misread by one of its leading organs of public opinion . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch , which opposed Roosevelt in 1936 and for three months plumped for Wendell Willkie , now finds the latter 's candidacy " singularly unconvincing , singularly empty of content . " * DESPITE URGING FROM NEGRO LEADERS , the Administration has as yet done nothing to assure Negroes who enter the army of the equality of treatment specified in the Selective Service Act . On the contrary , the President has announced that the army will continue its policy of separating white and Negro troops , which means discrimination of the most flagrant kind . It virtually precludes Negro officers , except as chaplains and doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiments . It apparently bars Negroes from October 26 , 1940 aviation , since the Adjutant General of the War Department recently declared that " applications from colored persons for flying-cadet appointment or enlistment in the Air Corps are not being accepted . " The problem is certainly a ticklish one . A policy of full race equality would bring cries of anguish from many Southern Congressmen . Yet the fact remains that racial equality is one of the foundation stones of American democracy . And if the very army we summon to defend that democracy denies it in practice , we shall be getting off to a very bad start . * THE SECRECY SURROUNDING THE RIOM trials has been broken to the extent of revealing that grave criminal as well as political charges have been brought against Leon Blum , Paul Reynaud , and George Mandel . Blum has been accused of " betrayal of the duties of his charge , Mandel of " corruption and speculation , " and Reynaud of " embezzlement of public funds . " Among Blum 's other shortcomings , it is said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Auriol , was diverting funds earmarked for the national defense . While it is not unusual for the citizens of a defeated country to seek revenge on convenient scapegoats who can be loaded with full responsibility for the defeat , it is doubtful whether any trial has so offended normal human sensibilities as the farce at Riom . Even the Reichstag-fire trial , although patently a frame-up , did not attempt to vilify the names of the country 's great patriotic leaders . A further indication of the depths to which the France of Laval and Petain has fallen may be found in the new decrees barring Jews from high public office and from working with the press , radio , or movies . But it is obvious that the men who rule today at Vichy are not Frenchmen in any real sense of the word . * THE FIRST ARREST IN GANDHI 'S NEW passive-resistance campaign occurred early this week when Vinoba Bhane was imprisoned for making pacifist speeches in defiance of the British government . Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru , second only to Gandhi in popular following , has announced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is believed that Gandhi 's failure to offer himself for arrest results from his desire to prevent the movement from developing into a mass civil-disobedience campaign . Despite the provocation offered by the British government 's rejection of the Congress demands for independence , Gandhi appears determined that nothing shall be done to weaken Britain in its hour of danger . Italy must have completely misinterpreted India 's attitude if it supposed that its attack on Bahrein Island in the Persian Gulf would terrorize the Indian people into an uprising against Britain . The effect is likely to be exactly the reverse . 379 HUMAN LIVES ARE CHEAPER THAN SAFETY devices in the eyes of some American mine owners . No doubt they will continue to fight federal inspection and safety regulations despite the shocking report brought in by the United States Bureau of Mines on the Bates , Arkansas , disaster . An explosion in a Bates Coal Corporation mine last August , the third in eight years , took ten lives . The Bureau of Mines , investigating , found that all three explosions were due to the lack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kind of cutting machine long listed as unsafe by the bureau . The Department of the Interior , in releasing the report , declares that it demonstrates the need for federal administration of mine-safety regulations . But even enactment of the mild Neely-Keller bill seems improbable . The bill provides only for federal inspection of mines and gives the Bureau of Mines no power other than that of publishing its findings . It passed the Senate unanimously but is still buried in the House Mines and Mining Committee . The head of this committee , long known as a friend of the mine owner , is Congressman Joe Smith of West Virginia . Smith 's excuse has been that the Bituminous Coal Act already grants authority to make mine inspections . Secretary Ickes wrote a letter emphatically denying this The subcommittee in charge of the hearings on the bill suppressed the letter . Fortunately it can not suppress the report on the Bates disaster . * THREE CONTINENTS ARE AFLAME , AND WE are told every day by our isolationists how dangerous F. D. R. 's policy is . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unemployed by electing Wilde . The fascist deluge may devastate the earth , but the United States , under the direction of prosperous business men , will keep afloat like Noah 's Ark until the rainbow heralding peace appears on the horizon . Such miracles happened in days of yore , though it is uncertain whether the majority of the Ark 's passengers were New Dealers or Republicans . As for the conjurers of " splendid isolation , " they remind us of a miracle worked by a rabbi who started on a journey on foot with his disciples one Friday evening . His pupils warned him that Saturday was near and that a pious Jew was not supposed to travel on the Sabbath . " Do n't worry , " they were told by the rabbi , " I trust that a wonder will help us . " So they walked on , for they believed in the wisdom of their leader . " It is midnight , " one of the disciples finally exclaimed . " Be composed , " the rabbi answered . And then the miracle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and to the right and the left of him was Sabbath ; but where the rabbi and his pupils walked it was still Friday ! Willkie 's disciples seem to be counting on a similar miracle of isolation , complete with jobs for the unemployed and profits for needy millionaires .
