BY DECEMBER , 3,500,000 American families will have no homes of their own . Two thirds of them probably will be veterans . For all , home will be a bedroom in someone else 's house . More families will be doubled up than there are in New York , Chicago , and Philadelphia put together . That 's why we need stopgap housing . The Federal Public Housing Authority is struggling to provide it . Former Navy men are going back into Quonset huts ? and liking it . Ex-GIs are moving back into Army barracks ? this time with their families . New , strange-looking communities are springing up all over the United States . The program now promises a home to only one family out of 31 . But it 's a start . A high wartime marriage rate , mass migration from country to city , the wartime halt in normal residential construction and repair ? all these factors have combined with the sudden demobilization of millions of men to create an unprecedented housing shortage . Even if 1,200,000 permanent homes are now built @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even 1,000,000 in a single year ? it will be 10 years before the whole nation is properly housed . Hence , temporary housing is imperative to stop that gap . So far there are seven different kinds of temporary housing available . All are wartime varieties that have been declared surplus and are being distributed by the Federal Public Housing Authority for the use of veterans . FPHA pays for dismantling the buildings , shipping them to new locations , and re-erecting them . The applicant ? a college , municipality , or other nonprofit body ? must provide the site , streets , and basic utility installations , as well as the management and maintenance expenses . The applicant also agrees to remove the temporary buildings after the emergency has passed . No profit is permitted on the rental of the houses ; any surplus remaining after operating expenses must be turned over to the United States Treasury via FPHA . The Navy 's contribution to the stopgap program is the familiar Quonset hut , used by the services from the tropics to the Arctic . The armed forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 85 percent went overseas and only 5,000 of the remainder have been released as surplus . The veteran ho moves his family into one of them will and it very different from his rough quarters overseas . The surplus units are all the 20-by 48-foot type used by the Navy itself to house 6,000 families of men on temporary duty at home bases . Each Homoja hut ( compounded of the names of Admirals Horne , Moreell and Jacobs ) is completely lined , insulated and floored , and divided into two apartments . Each apartment has two 12- by 8-foot bedrooms , a living room , small kitchen area , and shower bath . Such homes , including household equipment and utilities , cost the Navy between $3,000 and $3,300 a family and rent for $1 a day . Army men will also find familiar buildings in the stopgap program . Surplus barracks , many of the one-story type , are being called back to active duty for veterans ' housing . A 30-man barracks can be divided into three apartments , each with two bedrooms , kitchen , living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these buildings are not de- mountable . They must be ripped apart by power saws and then nailed together again at the new site , but an outside sheathing of shingles or clapboards makes them attractive . Five other types of stopgap housing were developed by the Federal Public Housing Authority for war workers in congested production centers . Congress has provided $191,000,000 to pay for moving 100,000 of these units , no longer needed for war workers , to new sites . Temporary family dwelling units , which come in one-story and two-story sizes , are of light frame construction , covered with such materials as wallboard , plywood , and gypsum board . Already divided into family units , they require no interior conversion . They must be cut into panels for shipment to new sites . Portable shelter units look like overgrown tourist cabins . Each shelter , holding a single family , has either one or two bedrooms . War dormitories , either single- or doublestoried , were planned for workers without families , each man being allotted a single room . Some buildings , especially those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way for single veterans . Many , particularly the one-storied type , will be converted for family use , a two-bedroom apartment taking the place of six individual rooms . Each building must be panelized for shipment . FPHA built 321,000 of these three types of building , of which more than 35,000 have now been put into use again for veterans . Two types of trailers are also available . The standard variety is a conventional auto trailer , measuring 8 by 22 feet and housing three people . The expansible trailer is about the same size when folded up but blossoms out into a small house holding four or more persons . Both types are mounted on wheels for transportation , then hoisted on wooden horses at the new site . Thirty-five thousand trailers were used by FPHA in its warhousing program : more than 11,000 of theshave been redistributed for stopgap homeAll are out on loan only and must eventually be returned to the agency . The only other FPHA type that does nc have to be cut up for shipment is the demountable house . This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart and re-erected wherever desired . Seventy-four thousand were built for war housing , but since the communities where they now are have first call on then= houses it is uncertain how many will b. - available for stopgap housing . These demountable homes must be pa : for by the communities that acquire then since , unlike all other emergency types , the ; . are considered permanent residential unit : The other varieties have a short life span they were skimpily built to conserve scare ? materials during the war . Only one tent : the framing lumber of normal buildings was used in them . Many units have no gutters or downspouts . Some have no bathtubs , only showers . Heating is mostly by small oil stoves . The number of cubic feet per occupant is frequently below modern standards But it is still better housing than many so-called permanent homes . Despite our much-vaunted American standard of living . a third of our nonfarm homes have no bathroom and 28 percent lack even a private flush toilet . Nearly four million need major repairs and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In contrast , stopgap housing seems homelike . FPHA believes that much of its temporary housing will have a useful life even after it is scrapped as homes . From panels ripped from temporary buildings the agency has built full-size demonstration models of tourist cabins , roadside stands , chicken houses , ranch bunkhouses , garages , lightplane hangars , and other such structures . Some city planners fear that stopgap- housing units will create more slums in the future . Many real estate interests contend that they will compete with private housing projects . Since the law requires that all governmental temporary housing be scrapped within two years of the end of the emergency , neither of these fears seems justified . This period may be extended wherever there is a continued shortage of places to live ? but sooner or later every unit must be torn down . What worries housing experts is how to expand the program . Few additional Navy Quonsets are likely to be declared surplus ? the 85 percent shipped overseas can not be returned , by law . Only a limited expansion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temporary . demountable , and trailer units in existence and most of them are still occupied . As for what the individual may do on his  | own hook , except for trailers the Quonset hut is the only kind of temporary housing a man may buy for himself . The skin and framing of the 20- by 48-foot hut are sold by the Stran-Steel Division of the Great Lakes Steel Corp . for 5873 at the factory in Indiana . The buyer must erect the hut himself and provide his own insulation , lining , floors , partitions , and foundation . This permits any interior arrangement desired , including the use of the whole 20- by 48-foot area for one family instead of two . StranSteel , which turned out 9,000 Quonset huts a month for the armed forces , originally planned its postwar models for nonresidential use and provides only two windows in each end : the purchaser can either buy flat side windows , such as are used in the Navy units , or build regular dormers . Erection of the units should not prove too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stow , is designed so that the exterior sheets can be nailed directly to the supports . To permit this , each rib is made of two strips of steel with a " nailing groove , " an irregular channel , between . Ordinary nails can be driven directly into this groove and are clinched automatically by the irregularities . A similar groove on the lower side of each rib permits the interior lining to be nailed on with equal ease . Anyone planning to set up his personal stopgap-housing program with a Quonset hut or trailer on his own lot probably faces a lot of trouble , however . If he 's in or near a big city he may have a cop with a summons as his first visitor . Many communities have strict zoning laws , which forbid the erection of any house costing less than a fixed minimum ? usually far more than the cost of a Quonset . The building inspectors may prove another headache ? lots of places rigidly limit building design to the conventional types and the arch-rib and steel skin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurdles are surmounted the would-be house owner may find a picket line across his front walk , for some labor unions refuse to work on unconventional types of construction . The obstacles that face both governmental and private stopgap housing are very real ones . But to a nation that has just completed the job of housing 4,000,000 migrating war workers and their families ? 9,000,000 people ? they are not insurmountable . Zoning acts , building regulations , union rules ? are all man-made and can be suspended . In normal times many of these regulations are useful . These are not normal times . The existing programs of re-using war housing must be expanded with additional funds . States and localities must be encouraged to erect their own temporary housing and not wait for Uncle Sam to do the whole job . And the individual must be given every opportunity to put up a temporary shelter for himself even if it means trampling on long-cherished rules of communities , builders , and workers . It will be a hard job . The millions of veterans who are now flocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one : winning the greatest war in history . Will we admit that we lack the will or the energy to find them a place to live ?  |
