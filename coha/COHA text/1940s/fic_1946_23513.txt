CHRISTMAS APPLES A Story DAVID GOLDKNOPF U P AT Air Force , the high-ranking officers were in conference : the Air Force generals and the Fighter Command generals and generals of the army group and of the armies , air support officers and liaison officers and G-3 and A-3 and G-2 and A-2 officers . The Operations Room was crowded . They were all seated before a large wall map , backed by plywood and covered with plexiglas on which were drawn red and blue and green and black and brown lines , broken and unbroken . The map said that the salient was being contained on the flanks , and that the enemy 's forward motion was blunted and slowing . The army in the north was applying pressure on its flank , and the army on the south was forming for the decisive attack at the base of the salient . But the southern army would want more air support , and that was the reason for the conference . The Fighter Commands were being shuffled , augmented , reduced . The Fighter Groups were being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That was the plan . Few of the men in the room were great men , but almost all of them were competent and hard-working . For it was a characteristic of this vast organization that the men at the top , where the war was being planned , and the men at-the bottom , where the war was being fought , were good . And it was only in the middle of the line that mediocrity lodged , collated data , made inspections , read reports , threw its rank around , passed the word down , and did very little harm to anyone . Ten or five years ago , some of the men in the room had been lieutenants at Langley Field , or instructors at Fort Benning , or wheat brokers , mechanical engineers , and advertising executives . Here , as elsewhere and as always , personalities clashed , and the elements of power and prestige , often subordinated , were never quite forgotten . Command generals who were losing groups were reluctant to lose their best ones , and Command generals who were gaining groups wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they knew that this was not the moment to jockey for position . They were no fools ; they could read the map . A three-star general said , " Well , I guess that 's it " And a two-star general , making a final effort , said how about moving X group , which was one hundred miles closer , anyhow , rather than Y group ; the X group field was going to be nonoperational soon for at least five days ; it was all torn to hell , and they could hardly get five-hundred pounders off it now , and it was getting worse all the time ; they had lost a pilot and four planes off the end of the runway in a week ; they would have to take the matting up , there was no way out of it ; and if X group was moved they would n't lose any operational time . And the three-star general said wearily , X group field would have to stay operational  --  for a while , anyhow , until this show was over with ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , God knows there had been plenty of them with the fog ; and they would have to move Y group because Y group had done a lot more work with armor and ground support , good work , and ground support was what the southern army needed . The three-star general got up , and the men filed out after him with one last look at the map . Five days ago , the map had been all bad , but now , two days before Christmas , it was a lot better . It might not be such a bad Christmas after all . LL over the face of two countries field-phones rang , and men shouted , for the lines were often weak . " Hello , Pinebox ? Pinebox , give me Colonel Johnson . Colonel  --  Johnson  --  the ? C-0 . That 's  --  right . Johnson ? This is Shipley . I hope you 're mobile , Jimmy . " " Oh Christ no ! " " I know , Jim . but what can you do ? The Old Man was bucking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh Christ no ! Ship , you ought to see this place . It was the damnedest mess when we got here . We worked like dogs . . " " I know , I know . It 's the same all over . This is big . " " Is it far ? " " Far enough . Look , Jimmy , the order will be coming down in a couple of hours . Just thought I 'd call , so you could get started early . "  - -  -  " Thanks a lot , Shipley . Thanks . Oh God ! " Teletype motors whirred , bells rang , and men put down their copies of rank or Collier 's , and turned to the machines . In soft , clicking rhythms they spelled the message . . SECRET SEND IN CLEAR OVER LAND LINES AUTHORITY . . And the advance echelons of fighter groups and service teams , and of all the little satellite units , the flying-control detachments , the fire-fighting platoons , the MP companies , the bomb-disposal squads , dismantled and packed and loaded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh my mamselle , my sweet little mamselle , is going to take this mighty hard . Murray , go see my mamselle and tell her , oh revwah . Her soldat is hitting the road . . . . Oh , I do n't care . If you can . It 's no skin off my back . . . . " The armorers packed the spare guns , the cooks packed the stoves . The telephone men packed the switchboards . They packed their duffel-bags , and rolled their blankets , and folded their cots . N RHEIMS , a small convoy stopped near a I PW enclosure . Men got out of trucks and jeeps , and stamped their numbed feet . Sergeant Feliciano , crew-thief , and Corporal Heiser , medic , pulled off their blankets and eased themselves to the ground . " Hey , Felix ? You cold , Felix ? " " Christ , I 'm cold , Heis , my feet dropped off in Charleroi . They 're gone . " " Stop your bitching , Felix . You ought to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bulge . " " Look , I 'm cold . The fact somebody is colder than me does n't make me no warmer . Right this minute , somebody is getting their head knocked off . I 'm not . I 'm still cold . " They walked over to the PW camp . " Freeze , you bastards ! If not for them , Heis , would we be here ? Look . Look at the one over there , slapping his hands . He 's laughing at us ! You sec that second button on his Luftwaffe blouse ? I would like to take this carbine and push that button right through his backbone . Come over here , you Jerry bastard ! " A guard came over and glared at them through the wire fence . " All right , Bub . Do n't get your pants in an uproar . " " Look at him . He'k laughing at us . He heard about the Bulge , ' he thinks Rundstedt is coming to liberate him . " " Do n't bother them . We do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Come out of your cage . " " You -- heard  --  me . Go  --  away ! " " Come on , Felix , " Heiser said , " they got coffee down the street . There 's a Red Cross . " " All right , I 'm coming . Do n't run . I got no feet . " B ESIDE a bleak , bare airstrip the convoy stopped again . A C-47 floated to earth and churned through muddy water as it taxied around the perimeter . A fine snow sifted through the thick air . " It 's a transport field . It 's not even a fighter field ! " " Oh my back . Home ! " A lieutenant came over . He held his head between his hands for a moment , warming his ears . " Now do n't ask me any questions . I do n't know if we 're going to be here for a week or a month . But we 're going to be here tonight . So let 's get some tents up . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're going to Metz tomorrow . " " I do n't know . Nobody knows . " " Lieutenant , they say this field has got no hard-stands . Is that right ? " The lieutenant pointed to his overshoes . They were covered with a brown crust of half-frozen mud . " I stepped off the mesh going to the tower . Where it is n't frozen , it 's mud . " " Oh , God . No hard-stands , no sod . Where we going to park the planes ? We 'll park the planes in the mud , and the mud 'll freeze overnight , and we 'll never get the goddamn planes out . " gg . Felix wo n't sleep tonight . " " That 's right , Felix . We 'll leave the planes here , and we 'll go home . " The lieutenant went into his tent . His friend , the captain , was unstrapping his bedroll . He unfolded a blanket and pulled out a fifth of Scotch . " Where in hell did you scrounge that ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snort . " " Let 's kill it tonight . It 's Christmas Eve , is n't it ? " " Sure . We 've got to stay alive , somehow . " A staff sergeant pulled back the tent flap and peered into the darkness . " Captain ? " " Here . Say , come on in . " " Captain , what about the pot-bellies ? " " What about them ? I do n't care . What are you going to burn in them ? Why does n't everybody just crawl into the sack . That 's what I 'm going to do . " " We 're trying to find some heavy wood . If anybody wants one they can have it ? Is that right ? " " That 's right . Wait a minute . Do n't go . " " Sir ? " " Here , sample this . " " Thanks . Do n't mind if I do . Here 's to you . Jesus , that 's good ! It warms you up , it really warms you up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your throat . " " No . No thanks . " " Say , how about taking the bottle with you and passing it around ? " " Well , we picked up some stuff in Rheims ? " " You did n't waste any time , did you ? I hope that none of you picked up anything else in Rheims . " " Oh no . It was too cold . " L rER. in the day the men started fires . They burned C-ration cartons in five-gallon tin cans . Or they dug up a little frozen earth and put the earth into a can and poured gasoline over it and burned the gasoline . All over the bivouac there were fires . And groups of men , their overcoats salted with snow , huddled around the fires and held their hands to the flames . Snow hissed on the hot tin . " Felix , where 'd you get the apple ? " ? " I picked it . Look . All around you . Apple trees . " " Do n't be smart . Where 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , you get on that line , and they give you an apple . The Service Team brought two crates of Christmas apples . " Some of the men detached themselves from the fires . But they came back in a few minutes . " We 've had it ! " " What 's a matter ? " " Some jerk looey says he 's sorry , they just got enough apples to go around for the Service Team , and why did n't the Group bring its own apples ? " " Well , why did n't we ? " " Do n't cry , Heis . Here 's half of mine . " Feliciano broke the apple in his hands . " Hey , Heis , just give me a small piece of it . . " " Felix , let me taste of it . I want to taste of an apple . . . " " All right . Oh you pig ! You ? " " You know that 's Iow , that 's mean . Not to give us an apple Christmas Eve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can buy yourself a bushel of apples -- - " " Next Christmas , my foot ! You know where you going to be next Christmas ? Right here ! Or some other mudhole . War was over in October . Now the sonsabitches are pretty near back to Namur . I believe they going to keep fighting till we kill every mother 's son of them . " F ELICIANO threw the apple core into the fire . They watched it scorch and steam . He raised his hands as if in benediction . " Merry Christmas ! " he shouted . It was a blessed thing . They laughed , they all laughed . " Merry Christmas ! " they shouted . Like a train of fire itself , it leaped to the other huddled groups . It caught and kindled . " Merry Christmas ! " It circled and linked the bivouac . It became a chant , a song . " Merry Christmas ! " They laughed . They clapped their cold hands and stamped their numbed feet . " Merrychristmas ! " " Merrychristmas ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
