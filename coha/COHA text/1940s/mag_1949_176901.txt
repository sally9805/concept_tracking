For months Juan Pern 's secretary , Spanish-born Jos Figuerola , had toiled in secret over the President 's proposals for revising the battered Argentine constitution of 1853 . Even the staunchest Peronistas had no inkling of the changes due . <P> Last week Strongman Pern unveiled his secretary 's handiwork . At a caucus of Peronista delegates in suburban Olivos , he explained his proposals for a solid 2 hours .
