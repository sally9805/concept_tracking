One duty of the British nursery governess is to wake the children from their naps . Last week , with Economic Dictator Sir Stafford Cripps bending sternly yet benignly over it , Britain was awake . It was resentful , expectant and confused , but , undeniably , it stirred . <P> Gone was the midsummer 's nightmare in which it had somnambled into the convertibility crisis . Gone was the comatose paralysis of a Government which had collected unprecedented powers , but which could not collect its wits for leadership . The tempo of life and work has quickened . Factory managers reported that their employees were " really getting down to it . " Even the Tory party , which since its crushing defeat of 1945 had been the most torpid segment of the British scene , suddenly came sufficiently alive to win an election . Just 24 hours before the votes were counted , a TIME correspondent in London had reported : " The Tories are less certain of not winning . " <P> If that cautious attitude was a measure of past apathy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awakening . An unusually heavy vote in elections to municipal councils throughout England and Wales showed that the Conservatives had made a net gain of 621 council seats . Labor suffered a net loss of 652 seats . Labor 's loss in industrial areas was particularly notable . Grim and grimy Birmingham , which the Chamberlain family had accustomed to Tory rule , put 65 Tories in its council of 136 . Manchester , Reading and Rugby went Conservative . It was the first major political shift in Britain in more than two years . <P> Did the shift mean that the British voters loved the Tories more ? Hardly , since even the Tory leaders themselves were so unconfident of their party 's principles that they had clutched socialism in a tepid , awkward embrace . Certainly , however , the British voter loved Labor less . A month ago , before the awakening , a TIME correspondent touring England by car ran into evidences of leaden disgust and shamed resignation . Said a Coventry bricklayer : <P> " Last autumn my dad was mortal sick , and the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him warm . The coal came five weeks after we buried him . Mum was sick too . The doctor gave us another priority order . She died in March ; her coal came three weeks later . What do you do ? You ca n't refuse coal , even if the reason for it is gone . At least Dad 's coal helped Mum . " <P> " The Bloody Boss . " A coal miner got more terrifyingly close to the heart of Britain 's problem , which is that her people wo n't get more of the things they want until they produce more , and wo n't produce more until they get more of the things they want . He was one of the absentees whom the Government eloquently exhorts to stay on the job . Asked why Britain 's prewar coal production of 230 million tons had fallen below 200 million , the miner said : <P> " It 's absenteeism . This warm weather decided me to take another holiday and get a bit of sun while I can . " <P> " What about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Any bloke who complains can dig it himself , " he answered . " Those Government bastards talk a lot-but I notice they do n't come near the bloody pit face . Scared maybe .
