Roger ( " Terrible " ) Touhy knew all the rackets : liquor , bank stickups , kidnapping . So did his pal , Basil ( " The Owl " ) Banghart , whose skill with a machine gun was a Chicago gangland legend . Both were tough and smart as horsewhips , and proud of being redhots . When a prison official asked Banghart his occupation The Owl boasted : " I 'm a thief , pal . " <P> When they escaped from the Illinois Stateville Prison ( TIME , Oct. 19 ) , they hid out the smart way . With five other desperadoes who made the prison break they headed for Touhy 's old bumping-off grounds on Chicago 's North Side . Here was the ideal hangout : cheap hotels , row on row of furnished apartments , a floating population of clerks , barkeeps , nightclub entertainers , girls with no visible means of support . And Touhy and Banghart were smart enough to avoid the mistakes of other public enemies before them : they stayed out of the nightspots , kept away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not smart enough to whip the eternal dilemma of the man-hunted . All they gained was liquor and women : as they moved from apartment to apartment they left a trail of bobby pins and empty bottles . Otherwise life was just like prison - except that it was riskier . <P> Life on the Lam . Every time one of them went to a grocery another trailed a half block behind , with a sawed-off shot gun under his coat . This was double protection : against the cops or a double cross . <P> They needed money , so they knocked off an armored car and snatched a $20,000 payroll . In these times they needed draft cards , so they carefully engineered pickpocket jobs and fifth-rate stickups to get cards that matched their descriptions . But above all they needed 24-hour-a-day caution , and discipline that surpassed anything they had ever known in prison . <P> One night two of them , William Stewart and Matthew Nelson , forgot themselves and went out on the town . At 10 o'clock Stewart dragged Nelson home drunk . The others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sat Nelson up on a sofa , beat his head with butt and barrel . Stewart , sick at his stomach with fear , slipped to the bathroom , jumped out the window , ran away . <P> The gang quickly cleared out of that apartment . Behind , as evidence of what had happened to Nelson , they left a blood-soaked pillowcase , two blood-soaked , handkerchiefs , stains on sofa and floor . After that , nerves were nearly as raw as Nelson 's tortured head and face . The gang split up , took two new apartments . They never saw Stewart again . Somehow Nelson got away , too , and fled to Minneapolis . And somehow the Federal Bureau of Investigation got the clue it needed . <P> End of the Trail . First the FBI picked up Nelson and Stewart . Then , with FBI Chief J. Edgar Hoover directing , it laid careful traps around the two North Side apartments . One night last week the traps were sprung . <P> At one apartment Gangsters James O'Connor and St. Clair Mclnerney elected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crossfire from FBI shotguns . At the other apartment their pals woke up at 5 o'clock in the morning to find the street brilliant with searchlights , to hear a loudspeaker blare : " Basil Banghart , Roger Touhy , Edward Darlak . We know that you are in there . . . . Come out with your hands up . One at a time . "
