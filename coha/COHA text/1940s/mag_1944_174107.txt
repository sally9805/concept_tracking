Once there , he fell in love with the country , took the job . <P> He had an unusual background for an educator . One of the first college men ( Ohio State ' 13 ) to be hired by the Scripps-Howard newspaper chain , he rose to be managing editor of the Cleveland Press , left it in 1919 , returned to his alma mater as alumni secretary . He became Ohio State 's vice president in 1932 . <P> The president of a State university , must be primarily a politician , only secondarily an educator . At Wyoming , polished , personable President Morrill proved his mettle by cleaning up a political mess which had brought university morale to an alltime low . He also persuaded Wyoming 's politically potent ranchers that cultural subjects at Laramie were not just academic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the past year he has been offered ten other university presidencies . Last week he accepted the eleventh offer : from big University of Minnesota ( peacetime enrollment : 17,000 ) .
