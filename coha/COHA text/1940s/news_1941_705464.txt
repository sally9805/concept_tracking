txt Import priorities are now in effect for all practical purposes . As a result , imports of consumer goods already have been delayed and ships have been rerouted at , the suggestion of the Maritime Commission . The commission bases its requests to shippers on a list of essential imports handed it by the Office of Production Management . This list , originally made up of six commodities , now includes 43 , and it grows longer each week as the Defense Commission , the Army or the Navy uncovers some new shortage , actual or potential . Now on the list are : sodium nitrate , coffee , sugar , copper , rubber , tin , silk , sisal. beryl , zircon , bauxite , newsprint , wood pulp , hemp , lead , mica , zinc concentrates , magnesium , chrome , antimony , and other essential products . List Likely to Be Graded Soon Somi the list will probably have to be graded to show which commodities take first place , which second , and so on , to avoid confusion . Similarly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' by rating them Al . A2 , etc . To tighten its control over ' - hipping rates , the Maritime Commission may ask Congress to pass legislation permitting it to regulate ocean freight rates and charter rates . Under existing law , the commission can disapprove conference rate agreements but can not control the rates of individual shipping companies . Also , the commission has requested shipowners to consult with it before signing charter agreements , but it has no legal authority to prevent a shipper from chartering his vessel to carry any cargo he sees fit and at any rate he can demand . This means that , without additional legislation , the commission 's ability to keen frelatit rates from increasing depends chiefly on the threat that ships may be requisitioned if shipowners do n't cooperate . Requisitioning of ships would complicate the commission 's job , and some officials believe they should have the legal authority to pass directly upon rates " just in case . " This legislation has not yet been drafted . Some Examples of Procedure Meanwhile , the Maritime Commission , importers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are some examples of how consumer imports are delayed and ships rerouted to keep the defense materials flowing : The OPM list showed that about 900,000 tons of chrome and manganese would have to be brought from Africa this year . The Seas Shipping co. , States Marine , and American-South African Lines were already in the trade , but their ships would not be able to carry this amount of ore without seriously disrupting " normal " imports from that area . At the suggestion of the division of emergency shipping , the Lykes Bros . Steamship Co. agreed to send two ships a month from Gulf ports and will eventually have about six sailing between the United States and Africa . The commission also allotted four ships from its laid-up fleet to be chartered on these routes bringing at least 5,000 tons of ore each trip . A number of " tramp " steamers are also helping out . These ships bring from 3,000 to 5,000 tons of chrome and manganese and the rest of the cargo , perhaps 2,000 or 3,000 tons , is made up of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a vessel in port at Durban on the east coast of South Africa . This shipper had an offer from the British to charter his boat to carry cocoa beans from the West African coast to the United States . Following the commission 's request for charter information , the shipowner asked the commission to approve this arrangement . The commission replied that there was chrome and manganese ore waiting to be shipped from Durban and that he should load with that rather than allow his vessel to be used for cocoa . Cocoa was reported on the OPM list several weeks ago , but is off at this time . Chrome and manganese are defense materials on the list . Last week , the Navy sent the commission a request to move a large quantity of teakwood , used for decks , from Burma . A quick survey showed that ships in that area were already loaded with other cargoes . The commission arranged for some of these cargoes to be unloaded and replaced with teakwood . Commission officials say that shipping is " tightest " from India to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goatskins and some rubber are waiting to be shipped , and although several vessels have been diverted to the Indian service , shipping conditions there will not be eased until about May 1 , these officials estimate . On most other important routes priority orders and rerouting have already had the desired effect . A report from Manila indicates that almost all of the Philippine sugar quota is already booked for shipment to the U. S. On South American routes , ships have sailed south empty to insure an adequate amount of tonnage for northbound cargo . Shipments of wool from Australia are moving on schedule , and provision has been made for importing at least 75.000 tons of rubber a month from the Far East . Naturally , someonsumer imports have been slighted to keep Ustic defense materials moving , but officials believe that many of the less bulky products  --  cocoa , spices and oils , for example ? will be squeezed in with the defense cargoes of rubber , hemp and ores and will not be seriously curtailed .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
