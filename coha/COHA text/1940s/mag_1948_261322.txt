Deep in a spectacularly beautiful gorge of the River Jhelum last week a 25-pounder boomed . From the distance came an answering roar , and an Indian commander pointed to the top of a hill . " Our men are up there , " he said . " Pakistan 's army holds the hills beyond . " <P> Thus last week the soldiers of Britain 's youngest dominions shot it out with each other for the favors of the beautiful , fabled State of Kashmir lying between them . Neither side was willing to admit that it was war . To a U.N . commission on hand seeking for a way to peace , the Indian government explained over &; over again that Kashmir had voluntarily acceded to India , that India 's soldiers were there only to clear Kashmir 's soil of all enemies so that her 3,000,000 independent citizens could vote peaceably on their own future . <P> Officially , Pakistan was as altruistic as India . Its troops were there , said Jinnah 's government , to prevent refugees from crossing the borders . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's biggest state , the fighting raged in one of the strangest wars of modern times . <P> Azad Kashmir . In mountain passes of the north and east the Indian army engaged fierce Waziris , Afridis and Kashmiri tribesmen from areas where Kashmir blends with the North West Frontier Province in rugged mountain wasteland . There , in remote Gilgit , where the Indian subcontinent touches Soviet Russia , is quartered a government called Azad Kashmir ( Free Kashmir ) headed by an ambitious onetime petty civil servant named Sirdar Ibrahim . <P> To engage Ibrahim 's men , Indian soldiers seasoned in the steaming jungles of Burma slogged up snowy mountainsides . Bombers took their missiles over Nanga Parbat , fifth highest mountain in the world . At the extreme east end of the front , at Ladak , a strange land where the people are Buddhists and feel more affinity to Tibet than Kashmir , an Indian division was flown in by planes that climbed 20,000 feet over the Himalayas . <P> " They Drop Over . " In the Jhelum valley , to the west , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map on which numbers of regular Pakistan units were labeled in . Lubar asked what was the source of his information . " Partly from prisoners , " he answered . " Also they drop over and see us sometimes . The Pakistan battalion commander here and the Indian battalion commander here are both former platoon commanders of mine . " <P> The Jhelum front is a succession of giant hills which must be taken in turn . There are men on these hilltops who have been without baths and hot meals for three months , supplied by coolies who have to crawl up the mountain . On one 11,000-foot peak it takes a coolie 24 hours to carry up three mortar shells , and the wounded must be carried down on a man 's back . <P> " Who Gives the Most ? " " I feel about Kashmir as one feels about a woman , " says India 's Premier Nehru , who comes often to sip the cold spring water in a Kashmir garden or to spin down the Jhelum River with Kashmir 's Premier Sheik Abdullah ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view , but last week the tourist flood that might have rushed to enjoy the coolness and romance of Kashmir 's capital city Srinagar was dammed off by Nehru 's government .
