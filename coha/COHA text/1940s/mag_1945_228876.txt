Biright Half Sirs : <P> CAPSULIZED COST OF LIVING PARAGRAPH IN <P> TIME AUG. 13 IS BLACK HALF OF STORY . HERE IS BRIGHT HALF : FROM DECLARATION OF VAR IN 1914 TO ARMISTICE IN 1918 U.S. COST OF LIVING INDEX ROSE OVER 60% . BUT FROM DECLARATION OF WAR IN 1939 TO V-J DAY PRICE CONTROLS HELD RISING COST OF LIVING INDEX TO 30% . SO FAR WE 'VE DONE TWICE AS WELL THIS TIME AGAINST INFLATIONARY PRESSURES MANY TIMES GREATER . BIG CHALLENGE TO AMERICA NOW IS FOR BUSINESS AND CONSUMERS AND GOVERNMENT TO HOLD THE LINE THROUGH TRANSITION PERIOD TO SUSTAINED PROSPERITY . AFTER END OF WORLD WAR ONE COST OF LIVING INDEX ROSE ANOTHER 40% , CAUSED MISERY AND HARDSHIP . WE ARE DETERMINED THAT SHALL NOT HAPPEN AGAIN . <P> <P> CHESTER BOWLES <P> OPA Administrator <P> Washington <P> Army Doctors &; the A.M.A. rs : <P> In the current Journal of the American Medical Association is an announcement saying in Dart : " A statement in TIME magazine July 30 to the effect that ' Army doctors with iittle or no prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area ( especially men in some much-needed specialty like psychiatry ) ' is said by the Office of the Surgeon General to be absolutely without any foundation in fact . " . . . <P> C. H. WHITTAKER <P> Westminster , Md . <P> Sirs : <P> . . I do n't believe the medical profession will take as too infallible the denial that A.M.A. claims the Office of the Surgeon General made regarding the mustering-out of Army doctors . Dr. Fishbein editor of the Journal is too anxious to deny any statement concerning the medical profession ... if any publication other than the A.M.A. Journal made it . ... <P> <P> J.W. LANE , M.D. <P> West Chicago , ILL . . <P> Far from being " without any foundation in fact , " TIME 'S story , which was published before Japan capitulated , echoed an official War Department release . The prospect of an early mustering-out for Pacific-based Army doctors is brighter now , but it will still be a slow process. - ED . <P> <P> World-Shaking Prophecy <P> Sirs : <P> On Monday , August 6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official Jap surrender inaugurated world peace . All this was almost exactly foretold last April 7 ( see cut ) when my cartoon " Private Breger Abroad " was published in some 120 newspapers . <P> For further world-shaking prophecies do not look to me . <P> DAVE BREGER <P> Great Neck , N.Y . <P> The Maligned Sex <P> Sirs : <P> Grace Moore 's recent spleen on faithless wives of overseas servicemen TiME , Aug. 6 just barely deserves the dignity of a reply . Nothing is so pitiful as a woman maligning her own sex , and at a time when womanhood should stand together for protection from those who think in little clichs . <P> Who is this paragon of virtue that she should set herself up as judge and jury ? And what does she know of ... the life of a serviceman 's wife ? <P> Has she ever been a camp follower whose husband has implored her to follow him from camp to camp and who , to make it financially possible , has knocked herself out working in laundries and hash houses ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's eyes when something a little more glamorous comes along and all he can see is " the tired little woman ? " . . .
