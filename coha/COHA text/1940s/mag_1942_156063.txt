SCIENCE <P> So startling was the news that many another scientist was politely incredulous . Antibodies , the disease-fighting substances in the blood , have been made artificially in laboratory flasks for the first time . This achievement was announced last week by Chemists Linus Pauling , Dan Campbell and David Pressman of California Institute of Technology . The three researchers made it clear that their work is still in the realm of biochemistry and that flask-prepared solutions are not yet ready to replace the serums for clinical use now developed from horses and other animals . <P> The Caltech biochemists think their discovery proves that immunization is a molecular phenomenon . In the blood stream of animals are large protein molecules called serum blobulin . If a bacterium , virus , venom molecule or other " antigen " is near the point where these molecules are formed , the adaptable molecules change their shape and assume structures complementary to those of the antigen , so that they can combine with them and neutralize them . After the infection has been overcome , these changed protein molecules remain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reappearing enemies . Hence immunity . <P> In their experiments , the researchers induced serum blobulin molecules 1 ) to " unfold " their structures by treatment with heat or alkalis in the presence of antigens , 2 ) then to fold up again . The researchers believe that the antigen influences the molecule to assume a modified structure in the flask , just as it would in the blood stream . <P> Solutions thus treated acquire the various characteristics of a natural blood serum which would be obtained from an animal immunized with the same antigen . The Caltech researchers have already prepared antibodies against a few simple chemical antigens ( e.g. , methyl blue ) , and are working toward more complex antigens such as snake venoms and viruses .
