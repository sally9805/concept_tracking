The meat-packing industry brags that it uses all of a pig but the squeal . The lumber industry is different . It is so wasteful that a conservationist once growled : " They use the squeal and throw away the pig . " No more than a third of a felled tree becomes lumber . The rest is left in the forest or is wasted at the sawmills . <P> One of those who has worried over this waste is the Weyerhaeuser ( pronounced " Warehouser " ) Timber Co. , which owns 5% ( about two million acres ) of the timberland in Oregon and Washington . The world 's biggest lumber firm , it devised a simple way to use sawdust , by pressing it into fireplace logs ( Prestologs ) at its Longview ( Wash. ) plant . <P> This week Weyerhaeuser proudly announced that it has developed products to use tree bark , thus utilize the 12% of a Douglas fir log that was formerly thrown away or burned as sawmill boiler fuel . <P> New Products . Weyerhaeuser is turning out five bark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used as a soil mulch , in the manufacture of phenolic resin and fiber paints , and as a plywood adhesive . <P> A new $1,000,000 plant will soon be opened at Longview . Then bark processing and plywood making will be on an assembly-line basis . Mechanical peelers will strip the logs , send the bark to the processing section , the logs to the saws ; they will meet again as Silvacon glue and plywood . <P> New President . The modern forester behind all this is John Philip Weyerhaeuser Jr. , 48 , greying grandson of the company 's founder . Last week Phil Weyerhaeuser was elected president of Weyerhaeuser Timber Co. , top company of the sprawling family interests which include sawmills , pulp mills and ocean-going steamers ( President H. H. Irvine died last winter ) . A Yale graduate and a member of the Yale battery during World War I , he went to work for the company in 1920 , concentrated on conservation measures . He started the firm on selective cutting of trees , later got it to branch out into research to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Publicity-shy and restrained since the kidnaping of his son George in 1935 ( TIME , June 3 , 1935 et seq . ) , Phil opens up only in the privacy of his Tacoma home , where he enjoys martinis and practical jokes . In the basement he has a complete woodworking shop where he makes and repairs furniture . Not all his carpentering is successful . One winter Phil built a 15-foot sailboat with his two sons , George and John Philip III ( Flip ) , now students of forestry at Yale . ( There are also two daughters . ) When launched , the boat promptly sank ; it was badly caulked . <P> Last year , with Phil as executive vice president , the company 's gross sales from forest products were $66,271,996 , its net income $12,995,478 . This year , earnings are " slightly ahead " of last year . Eventually , Phil expects that his new bark byproducts will add $10,000,000 a year to his gross business .                 @ @ @ @
