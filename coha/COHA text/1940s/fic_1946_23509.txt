ROCK OF AGES A Story JOHN D. WEAVER I T TOOK three strapping men to get Mark Quill to the county poor farm . " I seen ' em go by , " Maud Loeffler told her husband that night , " and he fit ' em ever inch of the way . " Saul Loeffler said it was a wonder she did n't follow them right on down to the poor farm , so she would n't miss anything . Maud huffed up . " No law ' gainst lookin ' , " she said . Mark Quill ran away twice the first day , once the second . Tall Tompkins had to send a couple of hands out to fetch him back . " Mark Quill 's give me more trouble in two days , " Tall said , " than all the resta my people give me in twenty years . The county might 's well give me an eel to hold . " Maud Loeffler was cleaning a roasting hen when Saul came home that evening . He sat on the porch steps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irritably at the pinfeathers . " I know what I 'd do , " she said . Saul did n't ask her what she 'd do . " I 'd chain ' im , " she said . Saul shook his head . " They ai n't made the chains could hold Mark Quill . " Mark Quill ran off again on Sunday , and they did n't find him till Tuesday night . Nevil Kearns found him up in Laurel Hollow , lying in a wild plum grove . Nevil thought the old stonemason was dead at first , but as soon as he touched him , Mark Quill set to kicking and hollering . " I knowed then he war n't daid , " Nevil said . When Nevil brought Mark back to the poor farm , Tall Tompkins called the old man into the little office room off from his parlor . " Mark , " Tall Tompkins said , " I 'm a-runnin ' this place and the county 's put you here for me to look after . Less'n you take a oath to stay put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you wo n't git out of it till they carry you out . " Mark did n't say anything for a long time , just stood there , a tall , white-headed man , with big hands as rough as the hill rocks he 'd worked with all his life . Even at seventy-five or eighty ( nobody , not even Mark himself , knew exactly how old he was ) , he was straight and hard as a rifle barrel . " Tall Tompkins , " Mark finally said , " I give you my oath on it . " Then Mark turned around and marched out of the house . Nobody saw him till dinner time ; he came back quietly , ate his dinner without saying a word , and left again . After supper he went to bed . Most of the other old people at the poor farm were afraid of Mark , he had a name for being mean , especially when he was drinking . Once he 'd killed a man with a rock . At least people said he had ; nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , " Maud Loeffler said one evening when she came home from berry-picking . " He walked clean to Limeton and back , said he wanted to see the stone wall he built for old Mr Carlton . " " Mark 's got a right to be proud of that wall , " Saul Loeffler said . " Hit 's a long way to walk . " " Hit 's a mighty fine wall . " N - Exr day Mark did n't come down to his breakfast . Tall Tompkins thought he 'd run off again , but Mark had n't run off , he was sitting in his room staring out the window when Tall Tompkins went up to look for him . " T ca n't eat county meat and county greens , " Mark said . " Hit 's good eatin ' , " Tall Tompkins said , " as good as you 've ever et and you know it . " " Hit 's good , " Mark said , " but I ai n't a-gonna tech it . I 've allus made my own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gat . I ai n't a-gonna start in now livin ' off other people 's bounty . " Tall Tompkins drew up a chair , sat down and offered Mark a sack of tobacco and a pack of cigarette papers . Mark shook his head . Tall Tompkins shrugged , rolled himself a smoke . " Mark , " he said , " you 've did your work . There ai n't hardly a farm in this county do n't have some of your stone work on it , a wall or a well or a fireplace . And hit was good work , Mark . Hit 's time now you set back and took it easy . " " I never took charity , " Mark said . " I ai n't takin ' it now . " " Some are glad to git it . " " I ai n't . " Mark did n't come down " Wall do n't need fixin ' , " Maud said . " There 's a hole in it big enough for a cow to walk through , " Saul said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure enough there was a hole . " I 'd of swore it war n't there last night , " Maud said . " I d'clare I . . " " Git the trowel , " Saul said , and while Mark sized up the hole , Saul went for the cement . " A good two days ' work , " Mark said when he finished studying the break in the retaining wall . " Can you handle it by yoursef ? " Saul asked . " I built it , " Mark said . " I reckon I can plug it . " Mark took Saul up back of the spring-house and pointed out the rocks he wanted , then Saul hitched up his horse and dragged them down to the wall . Saul helped Iift the heavy rocks , but when it came to fitting them in place , Mark would n't let him help . Saul watched the rocks go together , snug and tight , with only thin ragged fines between them , like the pieces of a broken china dish . Mark worked all morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul went up to the house together , washed their hands at the pump , scraped the mud off their shoes , then went in the kitchen to eat . " How you reckon the wall come to give way like that ? " Maud said . " You hep Mark to more of them snap beans , " Saul said , and Maud did n't ask about the wall again . Mark Quill ate enough for four men . He ate ham and fried eggs and sweet potatoes and green beans , he ate roasting ears and fresh peas and stewed tomatoes , and all the time he kept slapping apple butter on thick slices of bakery bread . Then he ate three pieces of apple pie and drank his fourth cup of coffee . Maud Loeffler was sure he 'd bust wide open like a sack of feed . " Tastes good , " Mark said , wiping the back of his hand across his mouth . " Hit 'll maybe hold us till supper , " Saul said . FTER they left , Maud sat down and ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she heard Saul out at the pump getting a drink of water . " Saul Loeffler , " she said , " that man 's gon na eat us clean out of house'n home . " " He 's working on my place , " Saul said , " and I 'm gon na see to it he gits fed . " " Who 's gon na feed us when we git hongry ? " " We ai n't never gone hongry yet . " " We ai n't never tried to feed the county paupers before . " " A man that works on my place , he 's gon na git his meals here . " " We pay our taxes , " Maud said , " and our taxes feed the paupers . Saul 's hand choked the yellow gourd he was drinking from . " You git back to the kitchen , " Saul said . Maud got . Saul paid Mark Quill six dollars for the two days ' work . Mark kept one dollar out , gave the rest to Tall Tompkins . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mark said , and all that week he came to the table every day , ate with the others . But Monday morning he did n't show up for breakfast . He told Tall Tompkins he was going out and look for work . Tall did n't try to argue with him . " A fine lotta good the cash money did him , " Maud Loeffler said that night when Saul came in for supper . " He 's been up at Old Man Henry 's store all day drinkin ' whisky and singin ' his fool head off . When I went to git my bluin ' he called me names and almost fell con the counter , he was that drunk . " " I 'm ready for my supper , " Saul said . " The old goat , " Maud said , " he 's always been no-count , he 's always been a drinker and a hell-raiser , never set foot in a church , never even come to the tent-meetin 's . " Saul sat down to the table , and Maud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to do a thing with him and nobody ever will , " Maud said . That was the last Saul heard of Mark Quill for nearly a week . Then one afternoon Saul was standing by the pump , getting himself a drink of water , when Maud came home from the post office . The minute Saul saw her face , he knew she 'd heard something . " Lor ' , " Maud said , " you know what he 's up to now ? He 's buildin ' a wall down at the poor farm . " " He 's been buildin " em for sixty years , " Saul said . " Not like this un , " Maud said . " This here 's just a wall set out in the middle of a field . Hit do n't go nowhere , do n't mark nothing . Hit just sets . " Saul went on drinking . Maud looked at him , frowned . " You hear me ? " she said . " Hit just sets . " " I hear you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't watching him , he headed down the road toward the poor farm , He wanted to take a look at that wall . W 1-TEN he passed the Gurley house , old Mrs. Gurley called to him from her rocker , a gray , crow-faced woman , smoking a yellow pipe . " Want'r see somepun ? " she said , rocking and cackling , pointing at the parched field down below . " Man 's crazy as a coot . " Saul wriggled through the rail fence , cut across the field , without looking back at Mrs. Gurley . He could see Mark grubbing in a wide scattering of rocks , rolling them over , picking and choosing until he found the one he wanted , then adding it to the twelve-foot length of dry wall which started from nowhere , like a hill creek in the spring . " Evenin ' , Mark , " Saul said , and the old man nodded , kicking at a loose pile of rocks , then working them over with the toe of his shoe , until he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down under the black walnut tree and lit his pipe , watching the wall take shape from the rocks scattered at Mark Quill 's feet . The base of the wall was broad and firm , the lines straight as a taut string , the sides tapering in gradually , so the wall would settle slowly and solidly with the years . " Nice wall , Mark , " Saul said . " Good lines to it , " " I seen worse , " Mark said . A dry wall was nothing strange or new in the county . Saul had seen dozens of Mark 's walls , but there was something about this one that held Saul the way a snake can hold a bird . It came time for him to go home , he had things to do before supper , but he did n't stir , just sat there , watching . S UNDAY morning , after services , Tall Tompkins drew Saul off to one side . " Poor Mark , " Tall said , " looks like he 's give way for sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mark nor keep out , but yesterday evenin ' I found ' im tearin ' out the whole middle part of it , and now this mornin ' he 's down there put tin ' it back together . " " Maybe he did n't git it right the first time , " Saul said . Tall Tompkins laughed . " A wall thas no good to nobody , what 's it matter whether it 's put up right or wrong ? " " I reckon it matters to Mark , " Saul said . Mark was closing the ragged edges of the gap , when Saul came up behind him , sat down quietly , the old man grunting , going on with his work . He smoothed off the top and sides , then stopped , drawing back from the wall , squinting at it . He turned to Saul . " How 's it look from the road ? " " Looks good , " Saul said , and Mark nodded , pleased . " People goin ' by , " Mark said , " I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to their-selves , ' There 's the last wall old Mark put up . ' " " Looks good from the road , " Saul said . Mark sat down in the thin shade of the walnut , pushed his hat back on his head , smearing the sweat off his forehead with a slow swipe of his hand . He picked up a big gray egg of a rock , cupping it in his hand . " These rocks was scattered all over hell'n gone , " Mark said , " and they 'd be there yet , iffen I had n't went after ' em , drug ' em down here , and put ' cm together . Rocks in the ground , they 're common as pig tracks , but when they 're all of a piece , well , thas somepun for a man to stop'n look at , and the man that found ' em and fitted ' em , he 's got a right to take some pride in what he done . " Hit 's a good wall , Mark , " Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years from now , " Mark said , " hit 'll still be standin ' here . And you know what people 'll say ? They 'll say , A man named Mark Quill put up that wall . ' And some 'll say , ' He must of been crazy , makin ' a wall in the middle of nothin ' . ' But they 'll never forget this wall , nor the man that made it . " Saul finished his pipe , then got up and started for home , walking slowly , his shoes stirring little clouds of gray dust along the side of the county road . He came up to his house by way of his cornfield , stopping at the springhouse for a drink of water . He was proud of that springhouse , he 'd put it up with his own hands . The calico cat crept up to him timidly , followed by her four kittens . Saul picked up the smallest of the litter , the mother cat eyeing him suspiciously . He walked up the footpath , stroking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready , " Maud called from the back door , and Saul nodded . He put the kitten down , smiling as it bounced away like a rubber ball , then he started toward the kitchen . It had been a Iong time since he 'd wondered what would hap. pen to the farm after he died . Sold for taxes , he reckoned . Whoever got it would be lucky , he 'd put a lot of work into the place , forty years , and nothing much to show for it , no children to hand it on to . " Where you been ? " Maud asked , when Saul sat down at the table . He told her . " Well , " she said , " it does seem to me you could find somepun better to do than set all day watchin ' a crazy man build a crazy wall . " " Maud , " Saul said , " a hundred years from now , if anybody remembered us , what 'd it be for ? " She looked at him as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maud snorted . " Ideas .
