 | I N PEACE and war alike , modern civilization rests upon iron and steel . It is the master substance by which man conquers both Nature and his fellows . As Kipling 's verse has it : " Gold is for the mistress ? silver for the maid ? Copper for the craftsman cunning at his trade . " " Good ! " cried the Baron , sitting in his hall , " But Iron ? Cold Iron ? is master of them all . " Today man has learned once again , in the awful tragedy of a global war , that military mastery and world supremacy rest upon steel , the modern form of iron. * Any beach on earth can be taken , at a price , provided trained men are prepared to spend enough steel .

" But , almost beyond measure , steel makes the products of peace as well as the weapons of war . Every Tool a " New Hand " Everything man creates is made by his hand , directed by his brain , or by a tool which is merely an attachable and detachable hand . Each time a man lays down one tool and picks up another he gets a new hand . As Thomas Carlyle said , " Man is a toolusing animal . . . Without tools he is nothing , with tools he is all . " Machines in turn are nothing but complex tools , and man 's progress can be measured largely by his ability to build such tools . Once his tools were made of bone or wood or stone . Today tools and machines alike are made overwhelmingly of steel , and with their coming civilization swept forward like a mighty flood . Steel , of course , is not the only metal of preeminent value to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless steel comes into play at one or more stages in their mining , transportation , refining , and machining . But steel is not only the tool of modern civilization ; it is also largely the material which has built our way of life . It provides the structural basis , the backbone , and , to a vast extent , the actual sinews as well . When the defense program was getting under way late in 1941 , William S. Knudsen said that steel was the " material to start practically everything going . " It is so common , useful , and essential that we take it for granted . It is so intimately a part of our daily lives that we pass it by unnoticed . But there is hardly a human need , even for water , food , and clothing , in the supplying of which steel does not play a vital part .

It is estimated that more than 40 percent of all the factory workers in the country earn their living by making steel into various products . For all practical purposes , steel is everywhere and is used by everybody . We are rarely more than a few feet away from it . A Versatile Metal I mail my letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ C.

But these are only trifling and superfici evidences that steel is everywhere . It is homes , kitchens , farm buildings , garages , o fices , stores , hotels , and factories .

Even the average small house has 4,000 pounds , and , if iron be included , 8,000 pounds . This does not include the family automobile , which is found in front or in back of almost every house . Automobiles contain 125 different kinds of steel , the average passenger car requiring 3,400 pounds , or more . We do n't see steel as such in a house .

A steam railroad locomotive has about one mile of boiler tubing ( page 432 ) . Pipe in the Home But it is in the ordinary home that pipe is peculiarly necessary , for it forms the basis of cleanliness , sanitation , convenience , comfort , and health . Even the small house has 1,000 feet of iron or steel pipe , the larger modern dwelling as much as two miles , and a big office structure like the Empire State Building as much as 150 miles .

Today we spend at least a third of our lives on steel wire , for not only bed mattresses but some pieces of stuffed furniture contain 1,203 springs made from wire ( page 452 ) . From the same material come the ordinary nail , watch springs , piano wire , coat hangers . picture wire , bird cages , bobby pins , hairpins. paper clips , and knitting needles ( pages 419 and 434 and Plates IV and VIII ) . In fact , one estimate is that 150,000 different uses have been recorded for steel wire . There are almost 500 possible combinations that go into hairpins and bobby pins alone , 2 Steel , Sharp , Durable , but Cheap , Serves Our Food These knives and forks began as blanks cut from metal strips .

Besides the barbed-wire fence and poultry netting , there are milk pails , cans , and strainers , and , to the city dweller , a bewildering variety of tools and so-called farm machinery , all the way from a sickle , prototypes of which were made several thousand years before Christ , to the most complicated modern combine . Much of the food grown on farms reaches the housewife in " tin " cans , which are not made of tin at all but of sheets of steel , with a tin coating to prevent rust and other kinds of corrosion .

Enormous Wartime Production Dramatized Steel World War II dramatized steel and drove home the fact that it is everywhere and that it is used by everybody . During the war this country produced twice as much as the three Axis powers combined . In 1940 and 1941 we increased our capacity by an amount almost equal to Japan 's entire production in 1940 . The armed forces had to have steel for istand Attack by Fluids and Flames o an annual production of more than 300,000 tons . fusion of heat over the flame , these pots have copper ps the trademark of Revere Copper and Brass , Inc. barrack units , portable bridges and landing fields , docks , helmets , bayonets , trucks , jeeps , tanks , LSTs , bombs , shells , guns , and ships .

A number of new steel alloys were developed during the war for use in gas-turbine engines for aircraft . Some can withstand great extremes of heat and cold , ranging from temperatures of approximately 1,200 ? F. down to an arctic 65 ? below zero at 35,000 feet . Jet propulsion presented new problems , because of the high temperatures at which the * See " Tin , the Cinderella Metal , " by Alicia O'Reardon Overbeck , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , November , 1940.  | engines operate . But research on steel alloys and nonsteel alloys made it possible to go approximately 500 degrees higher than had been possible in the past ( page 451 ) . A four-engine bomber has 1,000 steel springs in its fuselage , engines , and armament , the nose guns being almost literally chains of steel springs . In fact , almost no weapon , from mammoth projectile to small pistol , can operate without springs , which do not generate energy but control it by absorbing , storing , and releasing it . All over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made of steel sections . Tens of thousands of steel huts became the inevitable landmark wherever American fighting men were quartered . They were flown to places inaccessible by rail or ship . One of the largest orders for steel ever placed with a single company was for tubing for the 1,340-mile-long wartime " Big Inch . " Fortunately , our country had a large reserve steel capacity when war came . Moreover , steel-mill products are much the same whether the final use is for war or peace . But even with these advantages the industry 's capacity was nothing like enough for the rapacious appetite of war , and to increase it meant overcoming a peculiar , an extraordinary difficulty . Increasing Steel Mills ' Capacity The difficulty was that new steel mills themselves require enormous amounts of steel . Early in 1941 it was estimated that to increase steel capacity 10,000,000 tons in the following two or three years would " abstract " from the supply of steel more than 4,000,000 tons . In other words , the tools and buildings to make the steel to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . This problem was solved , as Secretary of the Navy James V. Forrestal expressed it , " by the resourcefulness and adaptability of American industry and the will of a free people . " It was done by what is known as the " scrambled " rather than by the " grass root " method ; that is , instead of building entirely new plants from the ground up , increased steel capacity was obtained mainly by adding to , rounding out , and balancing existing plants . This saved both time and critical materials , 10,000,000 ingot tons ' capacity being added at the cost of only 800,000 tons of steel instead of more than 4,000,000 . This method had the advantage of using existing experienced management and all the @# collateral service facilities , such as water . steam , gas , and electricity in a going plant . Some secondhand equipment was moved from place to place to round out productive capacity . In one instance , a whole abandoned plate mill was moved from Youngstown , Ohio . to Houston , Texas . Except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built of used materials , assembled from different places . The largest single war need for steel was for plate plate for the two-ocean Navy , merchant marine , tanks , heavy trucks , locomotives . machinery , and endless other war uses . Since there was no time or materials to build additional plate mills , more than 5,000,000 additional tons of plate had to be made each year in the continuous-strip mills . which had been built at an average cost of $15,000,000 to $30,000,000 each to roll out light , ribbonlike sheets for automobile bodies . refrigerators , and tin cans . Sheet and strip steel is thin , and the mills were equipped to coil up 1,000-foot lengths on big spindles as they came off the rollers But plates for shipbuilding are too thick to be coiled ; they have to lie flat . In no way stumped , the steel industry fastened to the ends of continuous-strip mills the frames of old , unused buildings to provide more space in which to lay the plates flat Heavier shears to cut it , and heavier cranes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ added . More than 3,000 separate projects to enlarge steel capacity in the interest of national defense and war were undertaken . They ranged in cost from a few thousand dollars to many millions . An addition to the famous Homestead , Pennsylvania , works required the removal of 1,500 buildings and 2,700 families . But mechanical ingenuity , typical as it is of our American way of life , does not explain the miracle , the wonder of steel . Why is steel found practically everywhere How can it be produced in such prodigio quantities ? Why is it the raw material f " fabrication , " or conversion into an alm infinite variety of durable goods ? The answer is that steel is not a sing commodity but a wide variety of disti materials and commodities , collectively kno as " steel . " There is no concise , satisfactory , or co prehensive definition of steel . The word merely a general term ; the name is not u : to denote a definite product . It is a cl name , not a specific one . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several new additions , there were 92 rded chemical elements that constituted known physical matter of the universe . these no fewer than 26 are used in various ortions and combinations to make steel . The steel industry is no assembly-line propion where parts are put together into finished product , as in an automobile plant . ther , it creates from the very elements the physical universe material that did t exist before . There are two indispensable steps in steelking . First , iron ore is turned into iron ; nd , iron is turned into steel . Earth 's Surface Abounds in Iron Fortunately , one-twentieth of the earth 's ace consists of iron , and workable deposits iron ore are found in many places . By far the largest part used in this country es from the Lake Superior district , where is found mainly in six long , narrow ranges . ief of these is the Mesabi , 90 miles long d 2 to 10 miles wide , the word " Mesabi " ing Chippewa Indian for " giant . " The accessibility of this ore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of steel America , particularly in wartime . Being close to the surface , most of the esabi ore is dug from open pits by power eels and removed by trucks or trains of s . As many as 15 terraces are dug into sides of a pit so that shovels , trucks , and ins can operate . Some ore is mined underound ( Plates IX , X , and page 437 ) . Specialized railroad equipment carries the ore downgrade the short distance to Lake Superior , where it is transported in huge ore boats to the lower ports on Lakes Michigan and Erie , from Chicago on the west to Buffalo on the east ( Plate XIV ) . These ore boats make a practically continuous shuttle or endless chain of voyages during the navigation season from about May 1 to December 1 , each boat covering some 40,000 miles during the period and staying in port only a few hours . During the five winter months ice and storms make shipping hazardous . In addition , the ore freezes like concrete and will not flow from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loading docks and thence into the holds of the ships . Lake Superior ore proved to be a gigantic stock pile for war purposes . This was because one ton of ore is normally " developed " for each ton mined . This means that the overburden is removed and the ore got ready for mining , even though it is not taken out . Thus production can be stepped up very @# quickly , or slowed down , with low maintenance costs and little adverse effect . In the single year 1942 more than 92,000,000 tons came down the Lakes from U. S. and Canadian ports , or nearly eight and a half times what Germany produced in prewar years . Iron exists in the sun , stars , nearly all hard rocks , the sea , mineral waters , plants , animals . and in practically all soils . But , unlike some of the other common metals , it is not found in Nature in a free , or metallic , state except in meteorites which have fallen from the sky and in some unusual lavas in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is really a form of rust , soft , rich , powdery , and commonly brick red in color . By putting it through the blast furnace , this rustlike material is restored , or smelted back into metallic form . To turn out iron , blast furnaces must be fed huge quantities of coke and limestone , as well as ore. * Ordinarily , more than a fifth of all railroad freight consists of materials going to and from steel mills . In 1943 the railroads moved to steel plants about six and a quarter million carloads of such materials as ore , coal , limestone , scrap . manganese , chromite , and other special ores . Two million cars were provided to haul the finished steel away . Thus the cost of handling and transporting raw materials is of major importance to the steel industry . Naturally , most blast furnaces and steel mills are located where the costs of assembling these materials and of shipping finished products to large markets are economical . They are usually located on the shores of lakes or rivers , not only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when working at capacity , uses four to five times daily as much water as all five boroughs of New York City , or more than 3,000,000 gallons a minute . A single plant , that of the Bethlehem Steel Company , at Sparrows Point , Baltimore , averages daily more water than the city of Baltimore . The Lackawanna plant of the same company at Buffalo uses daily more water than the city of Buffalo . As a rule , ore moves to coal rather than the other way around . Coal is bulkier and deteriorates more rapidly . Extra handling breaks the lumps of coke and makes them unsuitable from the viewpoint of size . As a result of these and other natural forces , * See " Coal , Prodigious Worker for Man , " by Albert W. Atwood , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , May , 1944.  | Lrated in such Lia ; Gary , In:he Lake Erie ke Erie and na ; and eastd , with such arrows Point . hile 's Ore the Appalarne ore from Df steel plants latest tonnage he Pittsburgh a number of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 2 the CarnegieLddock , Pennear-by mounoming winter . flies were the mnd his army , Washington , y the French Ind where we ldock 's troops ngahela River Baltimore &; ugh the Edgar ylvania skirts . 2 had hung ) ut 1,975 tons s of the couni 1,000 early ller they were the fact that r were enough . h iron during ge brick-lined ) f a 10-story limestone are mrtions of 12 , ? e , 1 of coke , I and VIII ) . in continuous , r even years ; me necessary . to 1,000 ?

In early times England was threatened with denudation of her forests to obtain enough charcoal to make : oe limited amount of iron required in those days . To get enough charcoal to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converts the nonmetallic materials in the ore into slag , or cinder , which rises to the top of the metal bath and is released every few hours from the higher of two tapping holes , while the molten iron pours out of the lower hole . I noticed that a 1,000-watt floodlight in the wall paled into utter insignificance as the molten iron and slag , in all their fiery splendor , came roaring from the furnace . Although slag has many uses , such as railroad ballast , cement ingredient , and highway and roofing material , so much is produced that only a small part of it can be utilized . A modern blast furnace is a very costly , mechanized , largely automatic chemist 's shop , highly efficient , and gigantic beyond the layman 's mind to grasp , a gargantuan Buck Rogers ' dream . In the bowels of the earth far below the furnace itself I watched materials continuously come and go , with no workmen in sight . While I turned my head for a few seconds . an automatic train had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few feet of me , and had gone without my even seeing it . True , on one train that slid past sat a workman , and reassuringly on the seat beside him was a newspaper opened to the sports page . How Pig Iron Got Its Name The iron which comes from the blast furnace is known as pig iron , because in earlier days it was cast in sand molds , from a main runway to smaller runways or depressions on one or both sides , and these runways had a fancied resemblance to a sow with a litter of suckling pigs . Invention of a casting machine changed all this . In any case , most of the metal is no longer cast and cooled into pigs , but goes on in a continuous process in molten condition until it ends up as steel rails , structural shapes , bars , tubes , and sheets . Although steel can no more be made with-  | out iron than bread can be made without flour , the blast furnace is only the kindergarten stage . To become steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three other types of furnaces ? Bessemer , open hearth , or electric . The continuous process , or " preserving the heat , " not only saves fuel to reheat but permits the use of gravity to move vast masses of material . Every source of heat is used , principally coal and coke , but also gas , oil , tar , pitch , and electricity . In 1943 the steel industry used enough coal to heat 12,896,000 houses , enough natural gas to heat 14,470,000 houses , and enough electricity to supply 17,178,000 families . One of the strangest compensations in industry is that the surplus gas produced in the blast furnace should . when enriched , furnish both heat and power to convert pig iron into steel . High temperatures are so essential to steelmaking that the glow of hot metal has become the symbol of the industry in the public mind . Steel begins to glow at a temperature of 1,000 - F. In the open hearth 3,000 ? is the rule , and as high as 6,100 ? may be reached in the arc of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it must be controlled or it will destroy the furnace . Thus steel men change the layman ... " It is not the heat but the humidity " to read . " It is not the heat by:t the refractory , " the refractory being firebrk and other heat-resisting lining material . The economy of conserving heat and power . of " preserving the heat , " naturally involves a continuous process , and this in turn makes for " integration , " or great size . It is not unusual for a steel plant to cost $100,000,000 . More than 300 electric overhead travel cranes are used in operating a single large plant . In a normal year one company spends $1,250,000 merely to maintain telephone and telegraph contact between its plants and offices . From Iron Age to Steel Age It was not until an Englishman , Sir Henry Bessemer , in 1856 announced his discovery of a way to " manufacture iron without fuel " in a " converter , " following experiments to improve the quality of cannon for the Crimean War , that enough steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An American , William Kelly , discovered Vibrant Steel , Strung in Harps , Hums Musically Harps antedate written records . The first one may have been suggested by a bow 's taut string . The Bible mentions harps ; David played one . Others are painted on Egyptian tombs . This craftsman at Lyon &; Healy , Inc. , Chicago , attaches steel strings to steel tuning pins . Eleven heavy bass strings are covered with silk thread and spirals of fine wire .  | same method of making steel at pracally the same time , when he tried to oduce malleable iron by blowing air through a bath of molten blast furnace iron . Kelly 's family thought him insane and forced him to go to the local doctor , who fortunately was so well educated in science that he realized that the oxygen in the air was in itself all the fuel that was needed . Steel had been made in small quantities and by laborious processes for many centuries , for use as cutlery , edged tools , and weapons , such as the swords and daggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and for medieval armor . But the Bessemer converter , coming at the same time that coal and coke replaced charcoal as an industrial fuel , first made steel available in the commercial quantities needed in modern life . The Bessemer process , together with the even more productive open-hearth process , which came after the Civil War , ended the Iron Age and ushered in the Steel Age , thus making possible the internal development of America . A Bessemer converter is a pear-shaped , tilting vessel , holding from 15 to 35 tons of molten pig iron , into which 20,000 cubic feet of air are blown per minute . It takes only 15 to 20 minutes to make Bessemer steel , whereas the open-hearth furnace , although molding a much larger charge , takes 10 to 12 hours . A Bessemer converter puts on one of the greatest shows on earth . It is sometimes called the " flame thrower of the steel front . " Millions of railroad passengers en route to Pittsburgh , Cleveland , Detroit , and Chicago have been thrilled , especially at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The flames reach high in the heavens and range from ruddy red through burnt orange and pale yellow to blinding white ( Plates XV and XVII ) . As the Pittsburgh district mills are nearly all on river banks , the scene at night is doubled by reflection in the dark waters . Open-hearth furnaces normally produce more than 90 percent of all steel made in the United States . They are large brick rooms with basin-shaped floors ; the name " open hearth " comes from the fact that the floor is exposed to the sweep of the flames . The open-hearth furnace has come to have a peculiar significance and value in our modern economy because it uses about 50 percent or even more of scrap ? that is , of used steel . Thus it saves an enormous quantity of ore , as well as fuel and limestone , which would otherwise be used to make pig iron . In this way steel can serve man indefinitely and can be used over and over again . It is lost only by rust , to a slight extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by being lost at sea . It is not yet determined whether ships lost at sea in World War II and steel scrap left on the battlefield can be economically salvaged , but the amount of course is considerable . No doubt many surplus ships will be broken up for scrap . The ill-fated Normandie is estimated to contain about 53,000 tons of usable steel scrap . Unfortunately , for some time before the war we sold a considerable proportion of our scrap to Japan . In the five or six years before Pearl Harbor we sent that country more than 7,000,000 tons . The Uses of Scrap Steel mills buy huge quantities of scrap , sometimes 50,000 carloads a month , or more . One Ohio mill bought 80 carloads of unused military landing mats a few months after T-J Day ( Plate XI and page 451 ) . But half or more of the scrap used is produced by the mills themselves . This is possible because , in the course of producing steel products , there are constant discards from trimming or cropping , boring , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military airplane engine , which is only 10 percent as large as the original block of steel from which it is made . This kind of scrap is known as " home " or " run-around " scrap , and naturally it is in continuous circulation . The open-hearth furnace is charged with molten pig iron , scrap , ferroalloys containing manganese , limestone , and various so-called alloys , as required . Only the alloys are put in by hand ( page 451 ) . Practically the only food which the electric furnace consumes is scrap , although some molten iron may be used . On the other hand , steel may be " duplexed " by being put through the open hearth after it has been made in the Bessemer , or even " triplexed " through all three furnaces . In the electric arc furnace , large sticks of carbon , called electrodes , extend down through the roof to within a few inches of the metal bath , with electric arcs to furnish the heat . High temperatures are reached very rapidly in this way and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive than the Bessemer and open-hearth , and production much smaller than either , some of the finestgrade steels are frequently made in the electric  | furnace , especially high-alloy , stainless , and tool steels . From each of the three types of furnace the liquid steel is poured by machinery first into ladles and then into ingot molds ( Plate XVII ) . When the molds are lifted , there stands a row of ingots , the first solid form which steel takes . Ingot Is Measure of Production All processes of steelmaking converge in the ingot , and it in turn is the common denominator of the industry , the standard by which production is measured . Once the molten metal is poured into the ingot molds , the basic business of steelmaking is ended , but the ingot itself is the beginning of everything made from steel , from a pin to the Golden Gate Bridge . Ingots can be of many sizes and shapes , but generally they are large , tapering , rectangular blocks , or chunks , weighing about 5 tons for the open-hearth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machinery , as it would take 150 men to move a single ingot . When an ingot has been stripped of its mold , some 45 to 60 minutes after the liquid steel has been poured , it stands glowing on its car , a hot dullred block of steel with a smooth cherry-red surface . Brought to uniform white heat again in a soaking pit ( Plate XX ) , the ingot goes to a rolling mill , which is like a giant washing-machine wringer , where the process of shaping into useful form begins . There the ingot is rolled much as piecrust or cookie dough , both to improve its quality and to give it shape . The grain structure of the steel is improved by rolling , and the ingot is usually made narrower and flatter . From this process emerge s m a 11 e r and " semifinished " pieces of steel , known variously as blooms , slabs , and billets ( Plate XVI ) . To Make New ' I Loading an ore car , t at Wakefield , Michigan main belts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 438 The National Gec  | These in turn go through further rolling , and finally we have the " finished " products ? rails , tubes , plates or sheets , bars , and structural shapes . It is a fascinating sight to stand by the roller , who controls the operation from his platform , or " pulpit , " and watch an ingot , or bloom , or slab , lumber steadily and sedately along toward its destiny . Somehow , steel seems to be making itself . But of course it does not make itself . For a product which is so common and which costs about 3 cents a pound for the ordinary grades , an amazing amount of care is taken in its production . Samples are tested constantly , all the way from the carloads of ore leaving the Mesabi to the finished product . Some 37 analyses are made of an 180-ton open-hearth " heat . " During a few minutes in which I watched an open-hearth furnace , several samples were taken out and sent to the laboratory . One company alone has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,500 metallurgists , chemists , and laboratory assistants , not only in its laboratories but in its mines and mills . Yet much discretion must be left to the workmen themselves . Steelmaking is highly mechanized , but since many of the operations are not routine or repetitive , they require decision and judgment on the job . The Human Touch in Steelmaking Steelmaking is an art as well as a science . Despite all the assistance which the technical men can give , despite all the chemistry and physics at their disposal , only the melter or assistant melter in charge of the furnace can decide whether the time has come to tap or not to tap . He must look at the fiery mass , through his colored glasses , and he must draw out a sample to see if it has become steel , just as the housewife must draw out a little quantity of chocolate syrup to see if it has become fudge . The steel industry is nearly devoid of trade secrets . Small technical improvements are made by individual melters or other men in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be of benefit . But major developments , such as the electrolytic tin-plating process , are usually patentable and are licensed to other companies . As soon as something new comes along , competing companies either take out a license or develop a similar process or product , possibly by a different route . It is a common saying among the metallurgists that as soon as a sample can be had , one company has a lead @# of only six weeks over its competitors . In the complicated industrial world of today steel must be made to do a particular job . The automobile , airplane , petroleum , electrical , and chemical industries , to name only a few , demand that special steels be made for special purposes . This can be done because steel is not a single thing ; it is almost anything , and it can be given almost any mechanical property . A single practical illustration is the fact that the maximum depth of many producing oil wells has been increased from 3,000 to more than 13,500 feet by providing steel adapted to oil-well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wells have been drilled to more than 16,000 feet . A more bizarre illustration is the fact that a - inch steel plate can be pierced by a spike made from the same plate , if the spike is properly heat-treated . True , we usually think of steel as strong . Comparing it with other materials we say . " This is stronger or weaker , harder or softer than steel . " Chaucer and Shakespeare used the phrase as " true as steel , " and Milton said that a woman who has chastity " is clad in complete steel . " The word itself apparently comes from the Teutonic stahal or stag , meaning " firm " or " rigid . " But sensible men do not use stronger materials than are needed for their purpose . It is an incredibly foolish waste to use the same kind of steel in an awning fixture or barn-door hinge that is used in an airplane engine . The steel that goes into a soldier 's helmet must have enough give not to crack when stamped out . But it must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A block-buster bomb requires glasslike hardness on the outside plus toughness on the inside . A plowshare should be soft inside to prevent breakage and hard outside to prevent abrasion . Razor blades must be strong , but they can be made cheaper if brittle , because it is easier to grind and hone brittle steel . Exhaust valves must not warp or burn . A bridge must withstand stresses and strains . An oil-well drill that goes through thousands of feet of earth and rock must keep its keen cutting edge . An airplane crankshaft must have strength , plus ability to withstand vibrations . An automobile fender requires ductility and smooth finish ; above all , it must bend . In the offices of the American Iron and Steel Institute in the Empire State Building  | New York I held in my hand four small eces of steel , all cut from the same sheet it each hardened by a different treatment . The first could not be bent at all without eaking ; the second took a right-angle bend felt ' ; the third could be bent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only back on itself but also lengthwise . A Strip Thinner than Paper I also held , carefully so as not to cut y fingers , a piece of strip steel thinner an the paper on which I made my notes ; was .0015 inch thick . It would have been structive to place this tiny ribbon beside e of the main girders that support the mpire State Building ! Let us bear in mind that in America the ore modern aspects of the science of metalloeraphy , which has to do with the internal structure of metals , go back only to about the beginning of the 20th century . Today an entirely new grain structure can be created by controlling and manipulating the heating and cooling cycles in steelmaking . What this has meant in the manufacture of bayonets and helmets , to mention only two out of scores of thousands of products , needs no elaboration . But just as fundamental is the fact that steel can be given a wide range of physical properties by adding to the molten mass certain regulated proportions of one or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elements . All steel is alloy steel in the sense that it is composed of two or more elements . But , as commonly used , the phrase applies to steel in which such elements as manganese , nickel , chromium , molybdenum , cobalt , tungsten , and vanadium ? the seven principal alloying elements are added . Some alloy steels may be two or three times as strong as simple carbon steel for equivalent sections . In some cases they are made to resist rust and in general to meet the demands of industry for high-strength products , notably in the ever-increasing speeds and stresses of modern transportation . Jet propulsion made further demands ( page 421 ) . While the uses of alloy steel run up in the thousands , the first great demand came from the automobile industry . In fact , if the automobile had come into use much earlier its development would have been very slow , because alloy steel was not yet available . Of the many families of alloy steels the public is most familiar with the stainless varieties , because they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad trains and for kitchen equipment . Weight reduction has been a popular slogan , especially since the war . We hear much of lighter-weight trains and automobiles . " Lighter " materials are all the rage . But there is no such thing as " light " or " heavy " steel . All steel weighs practically the same , except for insignificant differences due to different alloys used . What is meant by lightweight steel is usually some form of alloy steel which , because of its superior strength or toughness or hardness or rust resistance , does the same work with the use of less material . In other words , more work is done by a section of the same size , or the same work is done by a section of smaller size . Most of the elements used in steel alloys normally come from strange and remote parts of the earth made better known to us in the recent swirling fortunes of war . Nickel came mostly from Canada , but also from Norway and New Caledonia . Manganese came from Russia , the Gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rhodesia , Union of South Africa , Greece , Cuba , New Caledonia , Turkey , and the Philippines. * Alloy Steels in the War The war was largely a war of alloy steels . Not only the weapons but the tools and machines that made the weapons had to have alloy steel . In wartime the greater costs of the electric furnace did not so much matter ( page 435 ) , although alloy steels were and are made in the open hearth as well . Despite the shutdown in importation of many alloys because of submarine warfare , it was possible to get by . One reason lay in the recovery of alloys from scrap piles . Many thousands of tons of nickel , chrome , and molybdenum were obtained each year through the use of scrap material . In fact , as much as 95 percent of the nickel used to toughen certain steels was obtained from scrap . The best-known way in which the critical supply of alloy elements was stretched was by creating the National Emergency , or NE steels . These were " lean " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich " ones . * See , in the NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE , " Treasure Islands of Australasia , " by Douglas L. Oliver , June , 1942 ; " War Awakened New Caledonia , " by Enzo de Chetelat , July , 1942 ; " Brazil 's Potent Weapons , " by W. Robert Moore , January , 1944 ; " The Society 's New Map of Soviet Russia , " December , 1944 ; and " India 's Treasures Helped the Allies . " by John Fischer , April , 1946.  | Hard Steel Makes Soft Beds ; a Third of Our Lives Is Spent on Wire Springs Steel , a synonym for inflexibility , acquires springiness from the addition of carbon , heat treatment , and coiling . In wire springs the bounce is intensified by cold working . These Simmons Company employees sew felt borders to an inner-spring mattress at Kenosha , Wisconsin ( page 418 ) . It required no laboratory work to project the NE steels merely a few days around a conference table of the American Iron and Steel Institute on the part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ several years before propounded a multiple-alloy theory ? namely , that small amounts of a larger number of different alloying elements would prove just as effective as larger amounts of fewer alloys . It was fortunate that the theory worked out in practice . First , there was n't enough alloy material to provide the rich mixtures . Second , the Russians in their long and costly but successful defense of Stalingrad needed certain types of steel . Their demand on the I : SA was immediate and urgent ; it could not wait for years of laboratory development . They needed our superior alloy steel at once , and they got it. * In peacetime steel will naturally feel competition from other materials from the " light " metals , such as aluminum and magnesium ; and from plastics and plywood . In fact , the competition among different substances never ceases , whether in peace or war . But competition works both ways ; the light metals may feel the competition of stainless steel . Of great importance is the fact that most materials supplement or coordinate with steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a union of two groups of materials , such as steel and aluminum , steel and magnesium , etc . This is likely to be the case in the construction of airplanes , automobiles , trucks , and buses , as well as in the interior and exterior of modern trains . The union does not necessarily consist ot metals alone . There are products where steel and plastics are used together to great advantage . Even under the forced stimulus war , such materials as copper , lead , zinc. aluminum , magnesium , and plastics , vitally important as they are , have never been produced in quantities sufficient to provide for more than a fraction of the needs of this modern world . Steel accounts for more than 90 percent of the production of all metals combined . No wonder it is the master of them all ! * See " Lend-Lease and the Russian Victory , " by Harvey Klemmer , NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE ,
