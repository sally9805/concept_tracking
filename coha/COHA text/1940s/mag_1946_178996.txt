The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service patted itself on the back . It had saved from extinction North America 's biggest wild bird , the trumpeter swan . Once the trumpeters ranged over much of the U.S. , flying in grand formations like long-necked B-295 . But their brilliant white plumage and 8-ft. wingspread made them barndoor targets . Their flesh was tasty , their feathers salable . <P> In intelligence the trumpeters were fair , but at reproduction they were sluggish . They grew scarcer &; scarcer until , in 1935 , there were only 73 . They no longer wintered in southern feeding grounds , but huddled , half-starving , on spring-warmed patches of open water in Rocky Mountain lakes . <P> Then the U.S. Government swung into action . Guards protected the swans at their refuges , in Yellowstone Park and Red Rock Lakes , Mont. , shoveled out hundreds of bushels of grain in winter ; built towers from which in spring they tom-peeped at the nesting areas . <P> The swans gobbled up the grain , ignored the peeping toms . Old swans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer the guards kept tabs on 17 happy couples , watched 50 cygnets hatched . <P> The Wildlife Service did not relax , but it felt the tide had turned . By this year 's count , the trumpeter population was up to 301 , most of them young and ambitious .
