When a Nigerian says " fine pass " he means very good quality . When he says " fine pass kerosene " he means the very best . The British Labor government 's high-minded intentions toward its African empire were certainly " fine pass kerosene " ; but its performance was " soso talk " ( ineffectual messing around ) . <P> Last week the House of Commons took stock of the government 's African policy . Before it lay a scathing report of an all-party Estimates Committee which had examined on the spot a $220 million plan for Nigerian development . The committee found ( and the Commons debate tended to confirm ) : " The plan does not propound a complete strategy of development . It is merely an aggregate of proposals for spending the money . If the ten-year plan were carried out overnight . . . improvement . . . would be barely perceptible . " <P> What the report said about Nigeria applied , in greater or less degree , to all colonial British Africa . The verdict was especially devastating in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ development . Was this what had become of " the Third Empire , " the one that was to replace India and Burma as a base of Britain 's prosperity and power ? Only last year , Sir Stafford Cripps had said : " The whole future of the sterling group and its ability to survive depend on a quick and extensive development of our African resources . " <P> " I 'm Not Having Any . " The reason why African development had been neither quick nor extensive was the split political personality of the Labor Party . As sincere anti-imperialists , the British Laborites wanted to give the natives more self-government and to raise native living standards ; but as the responsible trustees of Britain 's property , the Laborites could not risk inexperienced native mismanagement of vast enterprises . Result : Labor 's slogans encouraged native nationalist demands which Labor 's policy could not fully satisfy . <P> As anti-imperialists , the Laborites were against colonial exploitation by private enterprise . Last week Colonial Under Secretary David Rees-Williams banged his fist on a table and growled : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developments . " On the other hand , the government had neither the money nor the experience to go through with its developments unless it had the help of private enterprise . <P> As Socialists , the Laborites were committed to planning for Africa . Commented a Tory M.P. , Arthur Douglas Dodds Parker , in last week 's debate : " With all their talk , Socialist plans are very scanty . " Sample : the planners expected that by now they would be getting greatly increased production of Nigerian coal , peanuts and palm kernels . They neglected to provide increased transportation to move in these products . An order for 20 locomotives for Nigeria was given priority rating three years ago , but it had slipped behind 50 non-priority locomotives which the manufacturer wanted to deliver first for Britain 's own railroads . Nigeria 's locomotives were shipped only two months ago . As a result , nearly 175,000 tons of peanuts ( enough to make an ounce of margarine for every Briton ) have piled up at railheads .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
