The last Japanese was captured on Guadalcanal last week . He had been captured twice before , had twice escaped . This time he was ambushed by native constabulary after having been 18 months in the jungle . Though his uniform was in shreds , his feet wrapped in filthy rags , he had not forgotten his manners . He submitted with a reverent bow to the British commandant .
