SOME years ago , four men on horseback came riding out of Winston-Salem , North Carolina , to confound the rough-anti-tumble performers on the polo fields of the East . Each of the invaders was good individually , but their play as a foursome was simply uncanny . If one was in any danger , the three others appeared to rescue him , : 15 though by magic . Each seemed to enjoy a sixth sense which enabled him to foretell the movements of the others . They played so perfectly together that their opponents had the feeling they were playing against one big man with four mallets and one big horse with sixteen legs . One of the four polo players now is Under Secretary of the Treasury John Wesley Hanes . Another is Robert Hanes , president of the American Bankers Association . Still another is Fred Hanes , head of the school of medicine of Duke University . The fourth is James Hanes. president of the Hanes Hosiery Mills , the largest full-fashioned silk-hosiery mills in 1 he world . Actually , there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ile is Thurmond Chatham , president of the Chatham Blanket Mills , and he belonged because he married Lucy Hanes . There could have been two polo teams , because there are eight Haneses of this generation and they all play and work together . Really to understand the Hanes family , you have to go hack to your McOuffey Reader and the picture of the man who demonstrated that a bundle of sticks could not he broken until sep arated . And you have to go into a little family history too . The first American ! lanes was Marcus Hiihns , who came to this country from Zweibriicken , in The Palatinate , in l TM . He stopped in York , Pennsylvania , long enough to raise a family , and then moved along to North Carolina . He believed that the secret of success and prosperity and happiness was family solidarity . He saw the family as a sort of hoard of directors , in which the father , as chairman , listened to what his children , as directors , had to say , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a family decision . The mother of the family acted as vice chairman . A Family Corporation T TIE name " HOhes " changed during the years , but the family code did not . It was still being very actively enforced when the father of the current generation of Haneses died nearly forty years ago . He left a sizable estate to his six sons and two daughters . During the forty years , that estate never has been divided . No Hanes takes something for himself that deprives another Hanes . Throughout all the forty years , it was understood that if one wanted to use anything out of the estate , he could go and help himself . Today , as a result , the family fortune is one of the country 's greatest . Whenever any decision is to he made  --  enlarging a factory , buying another bank , or decorating a dining room  --  the six brothers and two sisters , with the sisters ' husbands , gather around in the manner of a board of directors . They gather around eighty-twoyear-old Anna Hodgin Hanes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family hoard of ( Erectors , and she has been over since her husband died forty years ago . She advises , scolds a little sometimes . The sans and daughters listen and discuss . Then the majority reaches a decision , and it 's a decision for the whole family . When word came from Seattle last year that Robert Hanes had been elected president of the American Bankers Association , the people of Winston-Salem decided that a civic tribute was in order for their leading home-town banker . The Chamber of Commerce , Rotary , Lions and Kiwanis got together to do Robert Hanes honor at the Robert E. Lee Hotel . But by far the biggest ovation of the evening , as it turned out , was for Matriarch Anna Ilodgin Hanes . For hundreds of years there has been one  --  and only one  --  redhead in each generation of Haneses . In this story we 're going to be chiefly concerned with this generation 's redhead . Redheaded Johnny Hanes opposed the nomination and election of Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932 . By 1936 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be re-elected ; he fought him vigorously and contributed money to beat him . As senior partner of the great Wall Street house of C'has . D. Burney &; C'o. , now Smith , Barney &; Co. , he was expected to continue his fight uu the Administration , naturally . But when a London banker friend cabled him condolences after the 1936 landslide , redheaded Jolumy Hanes replied : When I awoke Wednesday morning and found the extent of the avalanche which had struck lire nation , 1 was more than amazed . I I owever , instead of feeling sick , heartbroken , crestfallen and blue over the resell . I seemed to see the situation in an entirely different light . The fact that the nation had spoken so conclusively brought use up with a start , and my first reaction was " I nal the one who seems to he out of step . " The success or failure of any democracy rests upon the premise that the will of the majority must always govern , and when the minority has been defeated , good citizenship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers . pull oars and not rock the boat . I am therefore hack in the ranks as a common ordinary private , with the determination to boost i nidead of knock and to try to pull a strong oar in the aid of my country . At that time the Government was committed to giving the whole machinery of Wall Street a thorough going over . llaues ' friend , William Orville Douglas , now of the United States Supreme Court , was head of the SEC at the time . Bill Douglas thought it would he a good idea to have an experienced financier and a man the Street trusted on the eommission . What is equally important , Hanes appealed to the New Dealers because he had the reputation of being a " reformer " in Wall Street . He had energetically Fought the Street 's Old Guard . as represented by Richard Whitney , now in Sing Sing , and others . President Rosisevelt was impressed by this as well as by Bill Douglas ' recommendation , and Douglas hail little trouble getting him appointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring business and Government together . Not long afterward Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthim asked Douglas to come over and talk about foreign security holdings in the United States . Douglas said he would like to bring John Ilanes along . because Hanes knew more about the subject than anybody else in the country . Hanes and . Morgenthau got along famously , as they still do  --  something that still surprises many who know both men well . The day after the conference , Morgen Ilia a invited /lanes to lunch . Ji Recruit for the Treasury D ITHING the luncheon . Mergenthau said : " Mr. Ilanes , I make up my mind very quickly about people  --  whether I have confidence in and can enjoy association with them , Are you capable of the same kind of action ? " " I venture to say that my decisions are as fast as yours , Mr. Secretary , " Hanes replied . " In that ease , the question I am going to ask you eau he answered very quickly . am asking you to come over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Without a moment 's hesitation , Ilanes said : " I will come gladly on two conditions . First , that Bill Douglas is agreeable to have me leave the SEC , Second , I am to work directly with you and not through any intermediate . " When Wall Streeter Hanes reported for work at the Treasury , he brought with him a portfolio of his security holdings . lie asked Morgeuthau to mark any which , in the opinion of the Secretary , an official of I he Treasury should not hold . Morgenthau took him at his word and marked off some on the list . Hanes promptly put all the marked holdings on the market . His friends estimate the loss he took at a half million When he ltd  --  f ? t1 ( . ' h 1zirists .. D. Barney &; Co. to go to work in Washington , redheaded Johnny Hanes moved everything along with him . He did n't leave an employee , a single file , or a piece of furniture belonging to him in Wail Street . In spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign WOUld be directed at Wall St reeler Hanes by the White ! louse palace politicians . The New Deal leftists said that : equally Hanes was n't doing anything except " protecting and representing business , " From the vantage point of the United States Treasury . The time l'a1110 when Hanes thought the whispering campaign called for an answer . He delivered it at a downtown luncheon meeting in these words : " I stand before you today in my official capacity as ! ruder Secretary of the Treasury , iccused . I am aeeused of spending my entire official time in the proteetion of business in the United States , and necessary that I make an answer . I wish to do the simple language , so this t it can not be misunderstood by anyone . I enter to the accusation the plea of guilty , without reservation , and I make answer that not only is my official time devoted to the protection of hininieSS but every waking hour of my life as well . I eau ronerive of ne greater duly falling upon me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this feentJoued on Page 59t capacity or any other , wrought from China 's raw materials ? Lying deep in the original contradiction , wherein the race hath both iniquity and grandeur in it by mixture , there are too many reasons for war  --  revenge , fear , honor , lust for power , delusions of racial and national aggrandizement , ideas of freedom and justice  --  but now and for the first time the economic-profit motive is not among them , having deserted to the other side . It is as if in the blind magnificence of his material achievements man had created a defense against himself , better founded upon self-interest than upon generosity , without knowing what he did or how , or that it would ever happen . For now it is to he perceived that your enemy is also your customer , and indispensable as such . That was the problem that presented itself at the end of the World War . A strong Gerin the official life of Washington , I will be constantly so engaged . " That ended the whispering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he stood , all was fair , since he had always known where they stood . Hanes can he equally direct with great financiers . A few months ago he was invited to speak at a large gathering in the East . He was to discuss Government finance . Present wits a hanker who , he suspected , might prove difficult when the time for questions came . ( Hanes has the habit of making his speeches very short and then inviting questions , because , he says , that is the only way he can be sure that . his audience will be interested in what . he is talking about . ) Sure enough , when Hanes invited questions , the first man on his feet was the banker . " I want to ask you , Mr. Secretary , why is it that all business has to be regulated and advised by a lot of crackpots in Washington instead of by able and patriotic people who understand business ? " Hanes looked at the banker and said : " T am mighty glad you asked me such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gratified that you use the words ' able ' and ' patriotic ' in describing the kind of person we need in Government work . I know you arc able , because you are the president of the largest bank in this city , you own and manage more real estate than anyone else in this section of the country and you are a director in seventy per cent of the corporations in this city . I know you are patriotic , because of the fervor with which you asked your question . These qualifications I know you possess in great measure , and I am glad , because it so happens that there are two vacancies in the Treasury Department at this moment either of which I can recommend to the President be filled with a man whom I suggest , and I am happy to offer you either one of them . One of them pays eighty-five hundred dollars per year and the other pays nine thousand dollars a year . I get ten thousand dollars per year , and whichever one you accept , I will make up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The banker discovered that he did not have the time to go to Washington . Hanes observed later that patriotism with most people stops at about $30,000 a year . many , restored by the aid of her trade rivals , would probably fight again ; on the other hand , a weak Germany would be a poor customer . The ancients , as Woodloek says in the Walt Street Journal , did it much better . Whom they did not kill on the battlefield , they enslaved , and the surviving people were left to be governed and to pay tribute for the blessings of law and order . But war is no longer battle . It is a total thing . Once it Starts , it can not stop until one people has its foot on the other 's neck . Then what . will you do ? The cost of this victory is greater than any sum of tribute that can be collected . You cannot. kill a people , neither could you afford to do it . if you would . Therefore , all you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , straighten his tie and put money in his pocket in order to begin trading with him again . Hanes ' sense of hemer is the kind that permits hint nut le take himself or the people around him too seriously , When Katharine Hepburn was a house guest of Mrs. ! lanes last winter , she complained that the Washington theater audiences were not responsive to her comedy lines . Hanes said it was n't a question of their nut ' wing responsive , it was that her lines were n't nearly so funny as the things all of Washington was accustomed to seeing and hearing in official eirties every day . One night about ten o'clock , after a hard day , the Under Secretary was sitting in the Washington Hotel , across the street from his office , waiting for his car to take him home . A tourist , who was sitting in the chair beside him , turned to Hanes and asked , " Mister , do you know how to get those cards that take you into the Senate Gallery ? " " Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you work for the Government , mister ? ' ' " Yes , I do . " " Where do you work ? " " I work over in the Treasury , " " Gosh , it must be fine to be around with all that money . " " I have n't seen as much as a. thin dime since I went to work over there , except when I got my pay check cashed . " " Well , when you get further along , maybe they 'll let you handle the money . " " Yes , maybe they will . " " Are you a New Dealer ? " " No , I 'm not . " " How did you get your job ? " " 1 do n't know ; it just happened . " " Civil Service ? " " No . " " A friend of . Jim Farley 's ? " " Well , I 've met him. - " Did he get the job for you ? " " No . " " Does Morgenthan know much ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What kind of a guy is this fellow John Hanes ? " " Well , I 'll tell you , he 's a pretty tired guy , " " Do you know him ? " " Yes , I know him . " " Like him ? " " Not very well , but I get along with him . " " Well , if I get over around the Treasury , I 'll look you up . What 's your name ? " 1 John Hanes . " " Gosh , I 'm sorry , mister , I mean all right . " " Sure , I know . We both do . That 's why we 're both in Washington tonight . Good night . " " Good night . " The redheaded Carolinian 's sense of humor survives even severe personal criticism , When a discussion threatens to become too rough , he hands his critic a piece of white paper upon which is reprinted this little poem ; BROAD  --  MINDLD In controversial moments M y perception 's rather fine . I always see both points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The poem , by Mabel Kelley , first-appeared on the Post Scripts page of The Saturday Evening Post of June 13 , 1936 . It has brought . the tone of many a Washington argument down to a reasonable level . Jerome Frank , of the Securities and Exchange Commission , has a habit of pacing up and down the room while he is discussing a subject . His pace increases with his interest , and his mental processes run ahead of both . Sometimes he gets bogged down in expression . Then he shouts louder and walks faster . Hanes had watched this performance many times . One day when Frank , in his enthusiasm , became incoherent. , Hanes rapped on the to-hie and said : " Now listen , Jerry ; you sit down and be quiet . I am going to get- up and do your walking for a while , and George Mathews is going to do the talking . " Hanes got up and walked up and down the room as Mathews talked . Frank stopped for a moment , and finally put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asset in Washington is his mastery of the art of conversation . In the old home of the matriarch in Winston-Salem conversation takes the place of card games , gossip , the radio , and so on . There the redhead of this generation of llaneses learned the subtle art , and he has been perfecting himself at it ever since . Speeding Up Government The gift of conversation helped him last year in his first big job at . Washington . He was intrusted with taking the important Administration tax bill to the Congress . From the first , he proved to congressmen that he wanted to converse with them in the manner of the Hanes family round table , rather than tell them . Whenever a committeeman disagreed with him at the hearings , Hanes waited until after the session , sought out the man , and gave him a detailed explanation . Congress passed the bill in eleven days , the first time in a hundred years a major revenue measure passed in less than ninety days . One hundred and twenty-five senators and congressmen sat down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them . That set some kind of a Washington record , Hanes ' willingness to give a man holding views violently opposed to his own complete credit for sincerity is probably the big reason for his ability to get along with people . Throughout , the hearings on the tax bill , he never failed to make it clear to congressmen that ho wanted them to be convinced rather than persuaded or influenced . In spite of his ability to get along with people , Hanes naturally has his enemies at Washington , and some bitter ones . The New Dealers know he is not one of them , and he does not try to conceal his dislike for some of their program . He scorns the childishness of those palace politicians who spend more time trying to punish their political enemies than in working for their Government . These tread softly around him , because they know he is capable of giving as good as they send , and perhaps a little better . About the time that they decide he is Johnny Hanes , easy conversationalist , good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he also is John Wesley Hanes , a hard-boded Wall Street bond salesman , a tough polo player , and a fierce fighter . Hanes ' most formidable opponent in the Administration probably is Marriner S. Eccles , the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board , whom he has fought frequently  --  and probably will fight again . Hanes came to the Treasury with high hopes of a balanced budget . But his hopes were dashed when the President turned to the spending theories championed by Eccles and others . Hanes sincerely believes in a balanced budget . He says that if business were let alone the recovery curve would rise . tax revenues would increase naturally , and the budget would balance itself . Budget-balancing is part of Hanes ' general business-confidence program . He is for taxation for revenue only , as opposed to the New Dealers , who want to tax for social reform . Business , he believes , prospers only if both the small and large businessman have the confidence to take risks , place orders , and plan for the future . Businessmen can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's course , and if Government does not impose too many deterrents such as punishing taxes and abstruse regulations . If the country is to prosper , the Government must temper its taxes and regulations so that they do not impair confidence , as Hanes sees it . He believes that business already is being taxed to the point of diminishing returns , and he questions whether any additional levies can be voted without killing the goose that lays the golden egg . Roughly , as Hanes views our present economy , the Government is about a 20 per cent partner in all of the nation 's business , because of the profits the Government takes down from business in the form of taxes while it shares in none of the losses . Following this through , if the Government insists on a larger share of the profits , then the Government would play the role of a profligate partner who milks the business in which be is interested by taking down profits which should be put back into the business , for reconstruction and expansion . These views are flatly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the White House at the moment , Eccles ' exact position is difficult to define because he is wordy in exposition , and has been accused of shifting about . He objects to being called a spender , but it is an objection based on words . He stresses the putting of purchasing power into the hands of consumers . He argues that the Government must stop in and spend , to supply purchasing power . When the spending begins to produce prosperity , Eccles feels that the Government ought to begin to tax . He is a stanch believer in the theory of " stagnated savings . " As he puts it , he is in favor of diseour aging " overaccumulation of so-called rainy-day reserves which are being set aside in excessively large amounts , particularly by the larger corporations . " In other words , he favors undistributed-surplus taxes . Eccles pays relatively little attention to business confidence and the danger of hurting business by taxation , and great attention to the need of consumer purchasing power , arrived at through spending . It was inevitable that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , collisions of considerable impact . Another of Hanes ' enemies in Washington is Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes . Ickes has never spoken to him . The two have been present often at the same meetings , but the Secretary of the Interior never has recognized the existence of the Under Secretary of the Treasury . Hanes is as amused as his chief , Morgenthau , at the passion of the snub . At the University of North Carolina and at Yale , where he graduated in 1915 , he was a tough infielder with a marked ability at . giving the hip to a careless base runner rounding third . At Yale he won his baseball Y. After a European tour , he planned to go into business independently of his family . He was peddling cigarettes from store to store in New England when he entered the war . Enlisting at once in the Navy , he was sent to Pelham Bay and left the training school an ensign . He came out of the Navy just as determined on his independence , and went into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sold it readily , until the collapse of cotton and rubber prices in 1920 caught him with a heavy inventory and wiped him out . Liquidating the business , he went to Nee , York , a man without a job and willing to take anything reasonable . Meeting a Crisis What he got was eighty-five dollars a month from the Wall Street house of Chas . D. Barney &; Co. , selling bonds , The postwar bond salesman usually was a socially elect young man who sold securities to his socially elect friends . Johnny had been at Yale , in the Navy and in business , and he was a Hanes of North Carolina , but selling securities to his friends was not his conception of a man-sized job , There may have been two thousand people in New York whom he knew . There were six millions he did n't know , He chose the six million , and before long was selling the larger part of Chas . D. Barney 's turnover and being called in to discuss the underwriting . Such a young man soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wall Street crash came . He sat in the driver 's seat throughout all those dark days when he saw hundreds of thousands of shares of stocks dumped so rapidly that the names of buyers and sellers could not be recorded . He is proud of the courage some of his associates in Wall Street showed , and he says that if experiences like that snake an economic royalist , he is proud to be one . He had his own crisis to face . One night the senior partner discovered that Chas . D. Barney Sc Co. would , by morning , need more cash to complete transactions contracted for than the firm had on hand . Though the firm owned sufficient collateral , it could not get it in hand overnight to secure a loan of the amount needed . Hanes went straight to the clearinghouse and said : " Gentlemen , because genthau , by making Morgenthau , in absence , a bigger Secretary of the Treasury than he had been before . Whether Hanes leaves Washington very soon or remains through this session of Congress probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taxation legislation at this session . He is likely to stay on if he believes that there is a job to do , and that he can do it to the satisfaction of both Government and business , At this writing the New Dealers have had the President 's favorable consideration of a new forty-six-point tax program . which might be offered Congress in the form of a Little Tax Bill . It has been sent , to the Treasury for study , and a report to the White House . One of this program 's advantages , from the point of view of the New Dealers who prepared it . is that it can he offered under the felicitous label of a tax on excess profits . It is also said to provide for larger levies on incomes ranging between 510,000 and 550,000 a year . Pandora 's Box 11 alt Streeter Johnny Hanes has not yet spoken out on this tentative proposal . But he does not favor new tax legislation . Some time ago he considered offering a Little Tax Bill to simplify existing legislation , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His goal always has been tax legislation which can not he misinterpreted either by businesses or Government tax bureau . He has seen businesses seriously damaged because of confusing legislation , with managemeets misinterpreting laws , and underestimating tax requirements . To eliminate hugs which might cause trouble in existing legislation , Hanes thought . a little clarification might be legislated in a Little Tax Bill . But , after inquiry , he concluded that , once the question was opened up , politicians might , in the interests of votes for themselves , decide to bellow for whacking taxes on " war profits , " one of those useful political battle cries which do n't mean what they say , but sound good to the public . In the ensuing scramble , a tax seriously crippling to business might be legislated . Tax legislation at this time appeared to be a potential Pandora 's box . Even if lanes does not like the present tax proposal of the New Dealers , he may think be should stay on the job . On the other hand , he may decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring business and Government together , and step out  --  as many another businessman has done . When John Wesley Hanes leaves Washington , it definitely will not be for Wall Street . The urge to be independent and produce , always keen , has grown on him during his Washington sojourn with figures on paper . So , at the age of forty-eight he is thinking of some sort . of manufacturing enterprise . John and his socially popular wife , the former Hope Yandell , like Washington and their associations there . But they are about ready to begin a new chapter in what has been a lively and interesting hook . Where they will go eventually is doubtful , but their first stop can be predicted with certainty . It will be a friendly old house on West End Boulevard , Winston-Salem , where an eightytwo-year-old lady waits to give people hungry for conversation a postgraduate course in it .
