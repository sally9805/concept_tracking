In the craggy Yugoslav villages , where for three years the sound of aircraft had been a sign as dread as the shadow of a hawk 's wing across a henyard , villagers looked up at first in fear . Then they rushed out and cheered : the big formations of heavy bombers drumming overhead in stately alignment were U.S. planes outward bound from their bases in Italy . <P> Tough Partisan soldiers could well toss their red-starred caps into the air and cheer for the white-starred bombers of Major General Nathan F. ( " Nate " ) Twining 's Fifteenth U.S. Air Force . The far-ranging Fortresses and Liberators were hitting within a wide arc all the way from Vienna down to Bucharest , and Nazi targets in occupied Yugoslavia were catching their share . <P> Bombs for Everybody . Twice within a week the Fifteenth attacked the important railway center of Zagreb ; other attacks centered on the port of Spalato ( Split ) and the inland town of Brod , headquarters of a Nazi tank corps . But these jobs were only part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> As a contribution to the massive and continuing assault upon Germany 's air power , the Fifteenth sent more than 500 bombers to hit three Messerschmitt aircraft plants near Vienna . Three days later it launched another fleet of nearly 1,000 bombers and fighters , this time to throw a double punch at Nazi communications in Bucharest and Ploesti . This week the heavy bombers carried on with a smash at airdromes and railyards in Belgrade and Sofia , and struck at the Rumanian industrial city of Brasov , barely 100 miles from the Red Army front in Rumania . The Fifteenth was actually fighting in support of the Russian advance . <P> As boss of these operations , handsome , silvery-haired , 46-year-old Nate Twining runs his show from a regular Mussolini of a desk-a huge arc of walnut originally built to the specifications of an Italian general . Under its glass top are maps ; above the maps Twining allows nothing but a pen and inkwell to linger . <P> Men on a Raft . A West Pointer , and an Air Corpsman since 1924 , Twining headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1943 to support the drive up the Solomon Islands . A few days later , Twining was flying in a Fortress from Henderson Field on Guadalcanal to Espiritu Santo . A violent tropical storm forced the plane down at sea , and General Twining and his men were adrift in rubber rafts for six days , living on fish and seagulls , before patrol bombers rescued them . <P> When Twining arrived in Washington last December , due for 30 days ' rest , he dropped in to see General H. H. Arnold . " How do you feel ? " asked Hap . Twining admitted he was a bit tired . Said Arnold : " You do n't look a damn bit tired to me . Report in Italy Jan. 1 and take over the Fifteenth Air Force . " Twining moved on . Between Dec. 14 and Jan. 1 he traveled 17,000 miles . But it was worth it . In power his new Fifteenth is second only to the Eighth Air Force in England . <P> Still setting up new operational records , Allied air power based in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occupied Europe . The air strikes pounded French airfields , reached out as far as Posen and Gdynia in Poland , and Marienburg in East Prussia .
