THE PRESIDENT MAKERS-Matthew Josephson-Harcourt , Brace ( $3.75 ) . <P> With the implacable serenity of a man with a thesis who does not at all mind being a bore , Matthew Josephson continues to tell Americans that their administrators and respectable citizens are a bunch of crooks . He does not always use epithet . In a really crushing mood he just calls them politicians and businessmen . In The Politicos ( 1938 ) he exposed the politicians ; the capitalists caught it in The Robber Barons ( 1934 ) . This being election year , Historian Josephson explores the devious ways by which the electorate is hoodwinked while Presidents are made in smoke-filled rooms . <P> Historian Josephson is a former editor of The New Republic . In 1932 he strove in company with the League of Professional Groups to elect Communist William Z. Foster President . Outside of this , his firsthand experience of President-making is small . But what he lacks in experience he makes up in learning and distrust . <P> His distrust begins with Republicans . Heywood Broun had a story about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floods were sweeping New England , snapped : " Democrats ! " While never entirely absolving the Democrats when anything goes wrong , Josephson is more inclined to snap : Republicans ! First Republican President maker in this book , which covers the period from 1896 to 1919 , is Marcus Alonzo Hanna , the Ohio boss credited with electing McKinley and coming the expression : Stand pat ! Second Republican President maker is Roosevelt I , who in so far as McKinley 's assassin did not make him President , made himself President . He also made Taft , who occupies quite a section of the book . <P> Democratic President makers are Colonels House and Harvey . Publisher George Brinton McClellan Harvey , president of Harper &; Bros. , charmed by Wilson 's phrasemaking , promoted the president of Princeton from wrangling with the college trustees to the Governorship of New Jersey . For this , Wilson , afraid Harvey 's Wall Street connections might injure his role of reformer in the eyes of the masses , soon kicked his backer downstairs . President Maker House was a soft-footed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ White House . Later Wilson broke with him too . <P> Historian Josephson doles out a few drops of carefully measured praise for Wilson 's New Freedom , partly incorporated in the New Deal . It is for Roosevelt I , the subject of the first half of the book , that Josephson reserves his more withering disapproval . Irked by T. R. 's nationalism and strong foreign policy , unable to call him either politico or robber baron , Josephson calls him an aristocratic bureaucrat , backs it up by statements of aristocrats at the Habsburg court . <P> Only politicians for whom Josephson has a kind word are onetime Governor Altgeld of Illinois , onetime Senator Dolliver of Iowa , Senator La Follette of Wisconsin . He also utters qualified praise for Brooks Adams ( T. R. 's political mentor ) , and his brother Henry Adams , who wrote prophetically in 1905 : " We have got to . . . fortify an Atlantic system beyond attack ; for if Germany breaks down England or France , she becomes the centre of a military world , and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
