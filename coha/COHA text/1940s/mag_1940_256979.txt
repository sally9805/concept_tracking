Ample , illustrious old War Correspondent Wythe Williams took over the country editorship of Greenwich Time in Connecticut in 1937 . He announced then that he would let Europe have its next war " without assistance from me . " But Wythe Williams still had his pipe lines to Europe , has run many an inside yarn from abroad . One that caught the public fancy , and hit U. S. front pages everywhere , was the racy tale in December 1938 of the supposed horsewhipping of amorous little Nazi Paul Joseph Goebbels for love-poaching . Editor Williams missed the opening date of war by only three days , has enjoyed many an I-told-you-so on international developments . <P> Last week Editor Williams began airing his stuff Mondays , Wednesdays and Fridays over Manhattan 's WOR for New York Philco dealers . First time up , Inside Stuffer Williams aired the " plan Gamelin , " under which " the major amphitheatre of war is to be far removed from the Western Front . " He masterminded a possible Italian tie-up with the Allies , with a thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French , British and possibly Turkish Army , from Syria . Quick action was being urged , said he . because " the present situation in the unpredictable Balkans , and particularly in Rumania , will permit no delay . " By Wednesday night , he could see this campaign advancing right to Rumania , " a natural battlefield for open warfare between the mechanized units of modern armies . " By Friday , black Balkan headlines had given plenty of point to Editor Williams ' Balkan pointers ( see p. 21 ) . <P> Last week , too , Editor Williams added a few new twists to the recurrent yarn from France of a plot to overthrow the Daladier Government and establish separate peace with Germany . Alleged ring leaders : shelved Foreign Minister Georges Bonnet , now Minister of Justice ; and ex-Premier Pierre-Etienne Flandin , Deputy , capitalist spokesman and appeasement cheerleader . <P> Editor Williams added to his bubbling French plot the accusation that Flandin has been in communication with Nazi Propaganda Minister Paul Joseph Goebbels , that their liaison man is one Fernand de Brinon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Germany is Otto Abetz , pre-war chief of Nazi intelligence work in France . <P> With his Philco career thus launched with a splash , the rubicund seer of Greenwich Time rolled back to his placid office in the Connecticut hills , got out Saturday 's paper ( circulation : 3,297 ) .
