The current butt of Washington 's quipsters-War Department 's Pentagon Building-was the object of more serious criticism last week . Now it seemed that the cost of lighting , air-cooling and escalating it was too high . The Public Buildings Administration tried to needle the Federal Power Commission into doing something . <P> Because Pentagon was built on the wrong side of the Potomac River-in Arlington County , Va . instead of the District of Columbia-U.S. taxpayers must pay to Braddock Light &; Power Co. $650,000 a year-$150,000 more than if the bill was collected by Braddock 's big brother , Potomac Electric Power Co . ( Pepco has the same officers , supplies the current Braddock sells to the Pentagon , but operates on the District side of the river . ) <P> Pepco 's defense for the seeming $150,000 overcharge was that it and Braddock had laid out $1,000,000 to dredge the Potomac and lay the cables that carry current into Pentagon 's acres of office space . PBA replied that the extra $150,000 a year would pay for Pepco 's entire investment in four years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
