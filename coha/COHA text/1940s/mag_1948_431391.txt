 | If this seems to you like a very bad time , a depressed and discouraging time , there may be an iota of comfort in this article People go on saying the best years of our lives are the years of our childhood , just as the same people go on saying the good old days were the best in the history of mankind . I wonder if there is better reason for one of these sayings than for the other . They sound very much alike : like words repeated out of habit , without real thought . For myself , I can not speak with assurance of the good old days , whenever they were , for I did not live then , and I can not compare them with the days in which I have lived . But having lived both as a child and as a man , I can honestly and confidently say that each of my six decades has been better than the one before , and happier . Though I had a happy childhood , I have a better time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand why men think that the past was better than the present is . They are comparing the brief present of their own experience with the long past they have heard or read about . In the past , many centuries of it , there were great deeds and great heroes , great arts and great artists , great wisdom and great excellence , honorable hardships and comfortable satisfactions ? more of all these than in the present , a few years of it . Well , why not ? Look up at the sky on a clear night , and your eyes will tell you that you see thousands of bright stars arranged in orderly , splendid patterns on a vast blue dome arching over you . Then use your mind , and you will have to reflect that those stars are dispersed through space , nowhere close together , that they are arranged in a blue dome only in your imagination , and that the constellations you see as Lyre or Bear or Cross do not suggest those things to other eyes , if there are other eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So with the good old days . The happy ages have been far apart . Socrates and Shakespeare were not neighbors and knew each other no better than you know either of them . There have been no times so prosperous that most people were not poor , no times so good that many people were not bad . If you are going to compare the present with the past , you must first pick a past and a part of it , which reasonably may be compared with the present and the part of it you know at something like first hand . Do that , and your comparison will not be so easy , and your conclusion not so smooth and sure . We live , in 1948 , in a bad time if there ever @#  | was one . Almost any past time may seem better to us than this . How bad any future time will have to be , we think now . if men then can look back to this and envy us for living in the good old days : Yet that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it presumably will , and keeps up its habit , as it presumably will , of praising all the past at the expense of any present . This , I think , is what we do when we say we are better off as children than as men . Nature is kind to us by letting most of us forget unpleasant things and remember pleasant ones . All the pleasant things we remember from childhood come together in our memories and make the immediate situation in any given present seem hard and dry . Now we have to make a living . Then it was made for us . We forget how many things we desperately wanted and never got . Now we have to decide troubling things for ourselves .. Then they were decided for us . We forget how often the decisions of our parents and teachers seemed intolerable . It is all very well for us to say , now , that t things we then wanted and did not were unimportant ; or that the intolerab decisions were probably justified . T may be true , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the side of adults , because we have become adult have forgotten the unhappiness we f as children from those deprivations prohibitions . A surprising number of grown perso it seems to me , have poor memories how it felt to be a child . I remember ghastly embarrassments I used to through because I did not know how behave on some unforeseen occasion , was afraid of being laughed at . I not been embarrassed for years now , should care little if I were laughed at . know people talk about me behind back , and I do not care . I talk about - behind their backs . But I talk about less than they may suppose , and I know that they talk less about me  | I was once sure they must . When I was a child , I lived in fear of all kinds of things that might happen . Some of them did happen , and turned out to be no more than temporary inconveniences . Others have been difficult , and even tragic , but I lived through them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things we fear are not so fearful as they seem in advance . And I still remember the pleasures of my childhood ? which , I repeat , was a happy one ? as painfully mixed with fears and uncertainties . A philosopher of my acquaintance once said that if we could at any time hear all the serious words being spoken throughout the world , there would be no sentence so common to so many tongues as the " Do n't leave me " of women to their men , or the men who had been theirs . But watch in any street or playground , and you will hear the constant cry " Wait for me " from smaller boys to larger ones , who do not wait , or who wait grudgingly and reproachfully , while the others wear themselves out trying to keep up , with no better prospect than that of being snubbed and bullied , and perhaps again terrified at being left behind . Men and women are no more cruel to one another than children are . Much of the lives of children is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were invented by adults . Few injustices I have seen can equal those practised as a matter of course by children toward children who for some reason or none were unpopular . We can learn to laugh at the savages we once were , but it was no laughing matter then . S TILL , there is nothing to be gained by arguing about the relative virtues of children and adults . The point is that they are very much the same , because these . are the same persons at different stages of their lives . But they themselves hardly realize this . When we are children , we look passionately forward to the time when we shall be grown , which to us means free and responsible . When we are grown , too many of us look sentimentally back to a time when freedom and responsibility had not yet been thrust upon us . On the whole , I think the children here appear in a better light than their elders . Freedom and responsibility are things good in themselves . It seems to me better , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , than to find out about them and try to run away . Suppose we do find out that our lives are harder than we expected . Then we were wrong in our expectations , and must work harder and ve less than we thought we should . at is what we pay for freedom and responsibility . I have met persons who med envious of children , if not posi.ely angry at them , for being in the essed state of childhood . This is preterous unreason . But it is only an ggerated result of trying to escape m the life we now lead by . romantically gining that the best years of our lives re necessarily in our childhood , and remembering what those years were ually like . It may be a relief from the pressures us now , but it is also a fine way of ing ourselves less able to deal with m . Show me a man or woman who is ver saying that all children are lucky . rely by being children , and I will show a man or woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
