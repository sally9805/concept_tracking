At his magnificent estancia on the Uruguayan side of the Rio de la Plata , across the river from Buenos Aires , Don Aaron de Anchorena held a hunting party last week . Don Aaron 's father-in-law owns La Prensa of Buenos Aires , biggest newspaper in South America . His guests were two good friends , Foreign Minister Julio Argentino Roca of Argentina and Foreign Minister Alberto Guani of Uruguay . They went there , not so much to hunt as to discuss the defense of the Western Hemisphere 's most strategic waterway south of the Panama Canal : the Rio de la Plata , which in English means River of Silver , though the English call it River Plate . <P> Since the U. S. became concerned with defense of the hemisphere , it has tried to promote the building of naval and air bases in Uruguay to protect the River Plate-and with it the whole rich east coast of South America . But Argentina 's pride and the bugaboo of Yanqui Imperialism have operated against a U. S.-Uruguay deal . <P> When , after three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Argentina and Uruguay announced their deal last week , no mention was made of the U. S. Neighboring countries ( presumably Brazil , Paraguay , probably Bolivia and Chile ) will be invited to participate in the plans . The U. S. stayed out of the picture , but Ambassador Norman Armour and Foreign Minister Roca have recently had long heart-to-heart talks . Last week the U. S. lent Argentina $60,000,000 . Before the bases are built , the U. S. will most probably lend technical assistance-as well as money .
