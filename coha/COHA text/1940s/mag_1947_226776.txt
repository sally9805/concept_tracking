In the days when automobiles first clattered through cobbled streets , Europe finally had to face America . Europe never got over it . In the eyes of the frightened , fascinated Old World , one man symbolized this new historic force . The man was Motormaker Henry Ford , who would have traded in Europe for a slightly used Model T. Through watching him , two generations of Europeans caught a glimpse-however distorted-of U.S. capitalism 's great adventure . When he died last week ( see NATIONAL AFFAIRS ) , the event showed sharply what had happened to Europe 's picture of him and of America . <P> Bank Account in Heaven . In Britain , they still gaped at the facts &; fable of his wealth and power . " Henry bloody Ford , " said a Glaswegian . " I am a cheap Ford salesman and Ford 's a gentleman . He captured the world . Head of the atomic energy he is too . Mon ! He 's a fine chap . " But Socialist conservatism also spoke . Said a taxi driver : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's a good thing all that big business is finished over here . " <P> In Stockholm , Union Leader Yngve Moller said : " He was reactionary . This hardly appeals to a Swede . But he will likely find a credit account in heaven for the magnificence of his achievements . " In Paris , the Socialists were harder on him .

" <P> In Budapest , a businessman whose factory is being run as a joint Soviet-Hungarian enterprise rallied from his end-of-an-era sorrow to observe , with a peculiarly Budapestian wistfulness : " He would have made a great partner . " <P> To Italians , Ford was no anachronism . Said Bricklayer Luigi Breschi : " If all owners had poured back the profits in their company like Ford , there would be no need for nationalization . " Socialist Leader Giuseppe Saragat warned , through his paper : " Ford loved birds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted none of his artificial freedoms , and flew off . . . . "
