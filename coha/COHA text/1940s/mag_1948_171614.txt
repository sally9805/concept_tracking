The Chinese have never been noted for mass production of anything but masses ; but civilization is an old Chinese custom . Some 1,200 years ago , long before movies were invented , the Chinese had a fair substitute . They painted picture stories on long silk scrolls , to be scanned slowly from right to left . <P> One of the best of these self-propelled movies went on exhibition in Manhattan last week at the Metropolitan Museum . The scroll depicted a spring festival , Ch'ing Ming ( " Clear and Bright " ) , as it was celebrated along the Yellow River in 12th Century China . <P> In 33 intricate , crowded feet ( scaled roughly at a foot to a mile ) , the scroll follows a meandering road downriver , from dawn to dusk . In its 33-mile course , the road enters the gates of the high-walled Sung capital Pien-liang , and becomes a city street lined with pawnshops , paint shops , butcher shops , restaurants , lute shops , wineshops , needle shops , antique shops . <P> It passes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with beggars , jugglers , doctors , fortunetellers , scholars , salesmen and young blades on the loose , arches over a river where freight and pleasure boats lie moored in clusters . <P> Beyond the city , it circles an archery meet , follows a fox and tiger hunt up into the blue hills , where the hunters have set up an overnight camp of silken pavilions , and winds down once more to the river where , in the evening cool , a farmer 's family is having supper outdoors . <P> The road , the river , the rooftops , the mountains and the holiday throngs are braided into a clear flowing stream utterly unlike anything Western artists have achieved . The makers of modern documentary movies might learn something from a study of Clear and Bright .
