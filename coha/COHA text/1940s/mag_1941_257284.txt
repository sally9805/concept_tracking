Benito Mussolini 's official biographer , Margherita Sarfatti , writes that one day , as Il Duce was pacing his great room in the Chigi Palace , she asked him what his ambition was . <P> He said : " I am obsessed by this wild desire-it consumes my whole being : I want to make a mark on my era with my will , like a lion with its claw ! A mark like this . ... " And with his fingernail he scratched a chair back from end to end . <P> The lion 's paw drew its thin line across Libya , across Ethiopia , across Albania . But when Benito Mussolini tried to make his mark in Greece , the paw began picking up thorns-until by last week Il Duce was badly in need of his Androcles , Adolf Hitler . The biggest thorn , the one which hurt even more than Libya , was being pressed home by the British in Ethiopia ( see map ) . The seizure of Ethiopia in 1936 was what made Italy an " Empire . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had resolved themselves into one campaign-an encirclement of Addis Ababa . When he took Ethiopia , Benito Mussolini 's strategy was to send his main attack ( Marshals De Bono and Badoglio ) southward from Eritrea , and to meet it with a smaller containing attack ( General Graziani ) northward from Italian Somaliland . This time the British strategy was to bottle as many troops as possible in Eritrea and then converge on Addis Ababa from the northwest and south . The main British attack came from the south . <P> In Eritrea a six-week-old deadlock was last week still unresolved . The Italians were ensconced around Cheren on magnificent natural forts . The British were last week busily probing in all directions around the Italian-held heights , to see where the enemy might be vulnerable . They themselves claimed capture of some new heights . <P> From Italian Somaliland , up across the savannas , a British force last week advanced to near Giggiga , from which a road leads 50 miles to Harar , thence to the railway from the sea to Addis Ababa . <P> From other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This week the British announced that a naval force had made a landing and captured Berbera , capital of British Somaliland . While this did not mean that all British Somaliland was again in British hands , it did mean that the column advancing on Harar was comparatively free to go ahead without fear of being hit on the flank . The Italians were expected to resist at Harar . If the British could break that resistance , they could probably go on to Addis Ababa without taking Cheren . But now they will have to hurry , for in about a month the dreadful Ethiopian rains are due .
