Andrei Vishinsky likes to tell the world that U.S. capitalists are warmongers . A large contingent of clerks in Moscow is kept busy plowing through U.S. publications to supply Vishinsky and other Soviet statesmen with evidence in support of that charge . The other day , Vishinsky fell for his own propaganda . <P> In his violent anti-U.S . speech at U.N . ' s General Assembly ( TIME , Oct. 4 ) , Vishinsky cited a certain map as evidence that U.S. capitalism is plotting war . Said Vishinsky : " The map published by the Esso Company of New York is of ... insolently arrogant and war-inciting nature ... It is called , quite provocatively , The Map of the Third World War . ' That is what they are publishing in the U.S. . . . They are handing them out to motorists . This map , with provocatively militant appeals , carries the heading : ' Pacific Theater of Military Operations . ' The map is an example of malicious war propaganda against the Soviet Union and the new democracies of Eastern Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by <P> Europe 's leftist press-and by many other papers . U.S. newsmen in Paris became curious . A quick check showed that some overeager beaver in Moscow had committed a prize boner . The map in question was entitled : " War Map III , featuring the Pacific Theater . " It covered Japan , Korea , China and Southeast Asia . It was published in December 1944 , as an ad for Esso ; it was the third in a series designed to help the U.S. public follow the progress of World War II ( earlier maps had covered the European and African theaters ) .
