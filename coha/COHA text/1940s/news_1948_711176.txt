txt Gen. Omar N. Bradley , Army Chief of Staff , warned Congress today that ' the " real issue " in the mounting controversies over the prepared-1 ness program was whether the next war , with even greater destruction than the others , would be fought in the United States . The answer , the wartime deputy commander of American forces in Europe told the House Armed Services Committee , could be provided as well by universal military training as by the Air Force of seventy combat groups which was being demanded in Congress . He voiced concern that the fight , for greater air power might cause abandonment , temporarily at least , of UMT , designed to train 1.8-yearold youths to be future reserves . " There is no relationship between the seventy-group program and UMT , " he snapped . " The alternative to UMT is not 70 groups , 170 groups or 1,000 groups . The alternative to UMT , if we are to have the barest type of security , is a standing Army big enough to carry the Army portion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be effected . This would require at least twenty-five divisions initially , or about 1,500.000 men , and would cost many millions annually . " Little Mention of Draft Through another day , the proposed emergency stop-gap selective drafting of men of the 19-through-25-year age group became almost lost amid the issues raised within both the Executive branch and Congress . Through General Bradley , the Army joined the Air Force in seeking to override personnel and aircraft quotas recommended by James Forrestal , Secretary of Defense . With a still-undetermined segment of Congress already carrying the ball for the Air Force , General Bradley virtually ignored the quota of 782,000 men for the Army which Secretary Forrestal had proposed . He built his arguments to the committee on the 822,000 for which the Army had asked originally . This figure , he held , was the barest of minimums . It would provide only twelve divisions . These twelve divisions , he said , would be built up with a hope that six more could be supplied by the National Guard and the Organized Reserves . At present , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " largely composed of untrained boys . " Against this picture , the Chief of Staff spoke of a Russian Army composed currently of 170 divisions , which , he said , could be expanded to 300 within sixty days . This , it has been pointed out in testimony previously given by W. Stuart Symington , Secretary of the Air Force , was in addition to a Russian air force which was being supplied with planes now at a rate of twelve for each one being turned out for the American forces . A ' little latex today , the House Appropriations Committee took to the floor a bill designed to get under way , months in advance of original schedule , a $2,376,100,000 aircraft-procurement program for the Air Force and the Navy . It would produce about 3,100 planes of types ranging from long-range bombers to small , darting fighters . It was set for approval tomorrow , after the controversy over the seventy-group Air Force was decided . Secretary Forrestal , supported by President Truman , continued to back a fifty-five-group force , brought up to lull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Force it was emphasized that at the peak of World War II the United States had about 300 combat air groups . When General Bradley testified to the House committee on the need for 822,000 troops , exclusive of 15,000 required if the seventygroup Air Force program were adopted , and 95,000 who would train UMT students , he declared : " This is not a war program . But if we should be jumped on , we would want to attack at once . That 's all . " The present American Army stood at 542,000 officers and men , he pointed out , with most of it overseas . " Fight Overseas , " if at AU " We should plan definitely to fight overseas ? if fight we must , " General Bradley asserted . " Until guided missiles and rockets have progressed far beyond their present stage , the ability of the United States to fight in the initial phase of , the next war beyond its borders depends almost entirely on its ability to push forward and hold the air bases which will provide the support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start immediately . " any failure to seize and hold a forward line for an immediate air offensive will result in the certainty of hostile occupation of that line and the danger of a war at home . The Army will play a large part in keeping war away from home . " On the House floor , debate on the $2,376,100,000 aircraft-procurement bill was focused heavily on the demand for a seventy-group Air Force . Representative Carl Hinshaw , vice chairman of the Joint Congressional Air Policy Board , ' presented for a voting test tomorrow an amendment which would add $922,000,000 to the aircraft-procurement fund . This would finance the seventy-group " air armada . " Strong Democratic support seemed to be promised . Representative Carl Vinson of Georgia declared that " we would be gambling with our national existence if we did not provide " such a force . Representative Lyndon B. Johnson of Texas , another Armed Services Committee member , recalled in debate that a cry of " spending too much too soon " had preceded the last war -- a cry soon drowned out by the nation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ' ate .
