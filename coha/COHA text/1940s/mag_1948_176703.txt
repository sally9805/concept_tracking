( See Cover ) <P> Threading its way through Washington 's crawling traffic , a black Buick convertible with red leather seats glided along the capital 's stately avenues and slummy byways . Its driver , a man with a kindly but slightly worried expression , was as inconspicuous as his car was flashy . He looked like any slightly battered citizen going about his slightly battered business . And so he was . Columnist Drew Pearson was on the prowl for news . <P> At the Pentagon , he quizzed Chief of Staff Omar Bradley about a caustic letter from Senator Henry Cabot Lodge ( an Army source informed Pearson ) complaining about the Army 's " slipshod " training program . ( " As a result , " said Pearson , " Bradley has called in four ' top-ranking generals and raised hell . " ) Over lunch at the Mayflower hotel , War Crimes Prosecutor Joseph B. Keenan , just back from Tokyo , fed Pearson an " inside " story that Emperor Hirohito wants a military alliance with the U.S. An anonymous telephone call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ target , Senator Owen Brewster , for taking free rides on Government planes . <P> Round &; Round . This week all these items were tossed in the firebox of Drew Pearson 's clangorous Washington Merry-Go-Round . Such fuel , some chestnut-sized , some no bigger than pea coal , and every now &; then a nugget as big as a man 's hand , has kept the carrousel spinning for 16 years . Next week , the column and its author will share a milestone : on Dec. 13 , Pearson 's 51st birthday , the Merry-Go-Round will start its 17th year . Under a newly signed contract , Pearson can be pretty sure of four more years as the world 's second-best-paid newsman , and its **29;611;TOOLONG columnist . ( The yip-yippity-yip of his frenetic friend Walter Winchell has 200 more outlets , and pays about $140,000 a year better . ) His fellow journalists measure Pearson by a different yardstick . In 1944 Washington correspondents rated him at the top of the list in national influence . But in terms of " reliability , fairness , ability to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Pearson 's Merry-Go-Round appears in 600 newspapers with 20 million circulation . ( Estimated income to Pearson : $2,000 a week . ) Then there 's the radio . On Sunday nights he talks over ABC to 10 million people , for a weekly wage of $5,000 plus all the Lee hats ( his sponsor ) that he wants . His sponsors claim 77% accuracy for the predictions which , along with his disclosures , are his stock in trade . The batting average means little : " We can always boost it , " a staffer explains candidly , " by predicting things like tomorrow will be Monday . " <P> In all , Pearson takes in about $350,000 a year , and , after taxes and necessarily heavy expenses ( including a cut for Robert S. Allen , no longer his partner but still part owner of the column ) , keeps about a tenth of it .
