James was standing under the marquee with a glass in his hand , talking to another man . Adele was nowhere about . Leda went straight to him . She did not think at all . " Hello , " she said , smiling . " Leda ! " He put down his glass on the long table . " Where have you been ? " " Oh . . . around . Seeing Nicola get off . " " What are you going to do ? Are you going back to Hampton ? Can I drive you back ? " " Why , yes , " she said . " It would be nice . I 'll have them get my things together .

Even Adele who always says what she pleases . I knew all about your going in to that fellow 's studio , and you know I did n't want you to . It really was foolish of you , Leda . " " It was perfectly innocent . " " Of course it was perfectly innocent . But you need somebody to take care of you and keep you from doing crazy things . " " Do I ? " she asked . She smiled up into his face . He was very attractive . He did n't look too young . He looked responsible , like what he was , an intelligent young doctor .

If the dark moustache he wore had something loathesome about it  --  she could always make him shave it off . If his voice sometimes made her want to scream at him , because it was so kind , so gently humorous , so Bostonian , that could n't matter very much . There had to be something wrong with everyone . There was somethinga little wrong with every husband . " I 'll find the butler and get him to bring my bags down , " she said . " I 'll get the car around in front , " he said . " I 'll meet you there after we 've said goodbye to people . " " Listen , " she said , hesitating near the door . " You did n't believe what Adele said , did you ? " " Of course not .

He wanted to have a small family wedding with only a best man and Nicola and a few of their best friends . But that idea never got anywhere . They did n't discuss it . Leda knew what she wanted . She wanted a big wedding . She did n't want to sneak off after some little ceremony to  --  what ? Whatever was coming next ; life with James , what a funny sound it had , how meaningless . But she would see that it was very nice . It would be better than anything she had ever been able to have before . The wedding would have to be grand too . Things were going to be grand for her , now . No more make-do , no more little pleasures , and specially no more under-cover ; everything out in the open , where everybody could admire and envy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea about New York . She realized she had always been dissatisfied with Boston . But she could n't have gone before , especially after Nicola 's wedding ; not alone . This would be different . A big wedding , and then going to live in New York ; spurning Boston in favor of New York . It would mean something to be somebody in New York . She put it to James one night when they were sitting in the garden at Hampton in the starlight . James had his arm around Leda 's shoulders . When she broke the silence she slipped out from under his hand and faced him . " I do n't want to live in Boston , when we 're married , " she said . " I 'm deathly bored with Boston . " He did not speak for a minute . " Of course , I 've known you were , " he said . " What do you want to do ? I could see if I could fix it up about that Vienna thing , next year . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not what she wanted . It was too vague . They would be alone , they two , a couple abroad in a city where they would be foreigners . Vienna could come later , and so could Paris and London . In the meantime there remained work to be done , friends to be made ; the importance to be established that would outweigh anything Boston had to offer ; drowning old doubts and old fears . " No , " she said . " I want to go and live in New York . I 've always wanted to . " " Well , " he said , " I told you long ago I wanted to do anything I could to make you happy . I know you 're too big for Boston . I know I 'm getting a fascinating woman , darling , and I suppose I shall have a hell of a time with all your admirers . But you do love me , do n't you ? " He put his arm back around her.  | " Of course , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , pressing his lips against her face . " I wish you loved me the way I love you , " he said . " I 'm not a very emotional person , " she said . " I know , darling . I 'm not criticizing you . It 's just I do adore you and you seem so damned unattainable sometimes . But when we 're married I 'm going to make you love me . I 'll be so sweet to you , darling . " She felt a shiver of the uncontrollable disgust she felt sometimes at things he said and ways he said them . But there was no hesitation in her . She had resolved that he was what she wanted , and she never looked backwards . " But about New York , " she said . " I ' 11 see what can be arranged . I suppose I could practice there , but I do n't want to practice . I know a man at Columbia  --  he wrote me a year or so ago about some research .... 1 ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " I would n't want you to practice if it 's not the thing you 're interested in . You ought to do the work you like . " Pictures drifted in her mind ; low would a research doctor fit in , what time would he come in in the evening , what would people think of a distinguished researchdoctor ... . " I love to have you care about my work . " " I do . " He kissed her again , drawing her to him , holding her arms in his hands . " Please love me , " he said . " Nobody will ever love you as much as I do . " The answer rose in her mind  --  What nonsense . Someone had loved her more than this before ; and the far and golden future was all superlatives . But James would be her husband . And a very good husband . He was distinguished and well-bred and good-looking and he had money . " I know , " she said . She kissed him carefully on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that she loved him . " Oh , darling , " he said . The wedding was set for early September . James 's mother asked Leda soon after the engagement was announced whether she would like to have the wedding on the North Shore . But Leda had said no . She wanted , she said , to be married in Hampton . She was sure about this . The house was small , the gardens not extensive , but this was where she wanted the wedding to be . She wanted it to be upon the ground where she had grown up . Upon those long-ago and painful foundations she wanted to erect a wedding  --  the gaiety , the congratulations , the champagne , rising like fireworks above the place where she had walked a miserable and ignored child . She wanted it big ; she wanted it gay . She wanted to make it out of what was her own , and not be given it from outside . She ran the preparations almost by herself . She told her mother what she must do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flustered , and Bernard looked frightened and miserable . Leda found in herself an unknown and pleasing gift for organization . She was quite capable ofp203making the plans and giving the orders and keeping it all straight in her mind . When she encountered opposition from her parents she overrode it . There was the matter of the champagne . " Kitten , " Bernard said feebly . " It is n't just that I ca n't afford all that champagne . It 's that people know I ca n't afford it . I 'm not the sort of chap who buys cases of champagne , I mean . " " Father ! " Leda cried . " You do n't understand anything ! Do n't be so horriblyBostonian . Weddings are the time for big gestures . I suppose you grudge me a little expense . You 've both always grudged me everything I ever wanted . " " Leda , that 's not true , " Laura said with tears in her eyes . " ' We 've never been able to give you everything the way Nicola 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been satisfied with the childhood we gave you . But we did our best . " " Then you certainly are n't going to spoil my wedding with this business about champagne . Why , you ca n't have a wedding without champagne . " " I thought we could have a nice punch , " Bernard said . " I could mix upsomething , put a little stick into it .... " " Oh no , you could n't , " Leda said . " I just wo n't have a horrible little wet wedding with some nasty punch . I 'd rather not have a wedding at all . You 're just trying to ruin everything for me . Trying to keep me from havingthings right , for once in my whole life . " " I think you 've had quite a good many things right , " Laura said gravely . " We 've given you your own way about everything for years . I do n't like to have you putting a false value on things . I do n't like to think you put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your love for James and your marrying him , and it does n't seem to me that you should care so much about the superficial details . " " Oh , mother , " Leda said , burning with irritation . " Do n't be embarrassing . And do n't keep throwing our income at me . I ought to know we never can afford anything . But just this once I think we might have just a little bit of festivity . After all , other people do a little extra when their daughters get married . Do n't forget you 're getting rid of me , and after the wedding I wo n't cost you anything at all . " " I ca n't bear to hear you say things like that , " Bernard said . " I do n't think you realize how we love you , or you would n't hurt us like that . " " We love you so , " Laura said , " and sometimes it seems as if you did n't love us at all . " " Of course I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know you love me . That 's why it seems so funny that you do n't want me to have a decent wedding . " " All right , " Bernard said wearily . " It does n't really matter . If you want champagne that much you 'd better have it . " Leda picked her bridesmaids carefully ; she wanted six . Nicola , of course , would be matron of honor . She wrote to Janet Bellingham , in New York , and another New York girl , Cassandra Fellowes , asking them to be bridesmaids ; they wrote back notes saying they thought it would be divine.  |p204She  asked the Mayson sisters , in Boston , and Jean Harrower , and Marna Elliott ; Jean wrote and said she was so sorry , but she would be in Dark Harbor . It gave Leda a brief unpleasant sensation . Jean could have arranged to come down from Dark Harbor if she had really wanted to . But she did not allow herself to be too depressed . She asked Mary Thayer , who accepted . Mary was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls . She went to one of the most expensive Boylston Street shops and picked out the costumes . She chose dresses and hats that could be worn again , knowing how girls complained about being stuck with a bridal costume that hung in the closet forever . In the July weather in Boston it was pleasant and luxurious to be sitting in the showroom , ordering the dresses and givingdirections about them to attentive saleswomen ; it gave her the illusion of being very rich . Only she wished that Nicola were not away on her wedding-trip to the Mediterranean . At moments it was lonely , it was a little pathetic , to be attending to everything all alone . It was always she who had to do everything for herself ; she was never the one to have things really nice . however , after she was married to James she meant that everythingshould be really nice . . She went to Shreve Crump &; Low 's and ordered presents for the bridesmaids ; narrow gold bracelets with a tag attached like a gold baggage tag , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it . They were very pretty bracelets . As she might have expected , her parents made an outcry about the bracelets . But now Leda felt not only irritated but indignant . How could she invite bridesmaids and not give them decent presents , as other brides did ? Laura suggested giving each one a little enamel holder for the flowers they would carry . But imagine those girls if one gave them a little enamel holder ! Her own wedding dress Leda designed for herself . Not for her , she thought , the really lovely wedding dress designed by a great couturier ; as usual she must substitute wit and ingenuity for the advantages of other girls like Nicola . She went to a dressmaker where Nicola and Mrs. Kruger had had dresses altered , and for many hours on many days worked over plans for a really beautiful dress . Leda thought she could have been a great dress-designer . But she could be greater things than that . All alone she was slaving through the hot summer months while other girls were swimming and playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the last summer that she would have to endure staying in Hampton ; from now on life would be different . She worked very hard . One day when she returned from town she went down in the orchard behind the house . The midsummer air was stifling . Leda felt tired . She felt a wave of affection for this place , where she had grown up and which she was leaving soon forever ; perhaps when she was old she would come back and walk nostalgically over its acres . She wandered through the long , dry , yellow grass . A cicada screamed high and shrill from down toward the swamp , a melancholy , summer sound . In her mind 's eye she saw the small , thin figure of long ago , herself , wandering lonely and full of dreamsp205through this orchard . She thought the eyes must have been very large and dark ; the mouth sensitive . That child had not known that she was to conquerher loneliness , make a place for herself in the world outside , and these through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough , pinkish bark of an old appletree standing deep in orchard grass . On an impulse she climbed the tree and sat upon the horizontal limb , leaning back against the trunk , the smell of half-formed apples sweet in her nostrils . So had she climbed this tree long ago ; and sat here on this branch , staring out over the hot meadow lands . The golden swamp shimmered in the heat . This is a goodbye to youth , Leda thought . I shall probably never climb this tree again . She thought back over the years , mounting them gradually to her self-won success . Her mind came to Lambert and dwelt upon him . He would have understoodabout that strange little girl ; she could have told him all about her and he would have known . Now she would never tell him . Now the queer sympathy that had existed between them had been smashed  --  no , not smashed ; it had been stolen away from them . But its potentiality was still there forever , and perhaps when I am old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we shall realize that the sympathy is still there , and then we can talk together . I shall be a slim , distinguished old lady ; I will have travelled everywhere and I will be famous for my beauty too . That short dream was all over , the dream of hers and Lambert 's . It was all over , and what was there left of it ? Only its existence in their minds . You could not pin down hours , nor cast moments in bronze . Suddenly Leda slipped down out of the tree and walked up toward the house . On the lawn beside the house it was cooler , and the grass was still green there , and fresh . She went into the house and got a pad of paper and a pencil , and came out and lay on her stomach on the cool grass . She started to write . When she had finished her sonnet she rolled over on her back and read it . The way things are , the past lifts off like mist , The sun burns through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten all the mystery That filled us .. . And memory cheats us , skimping on the gold That leafed the hours and made them fabulous ; The words we said are taken away from us .. . And all our pain and passion 's stilly cold . Of the intangible days I spent with you None can you resurrect , nor I relive it ; No word I ever said can now be true Beyond the truth your memory can give it . This , then , is all we have of permanency : It once was so , and can not cease to be . She wondered what Lambert would think of it . He had always been moved by her verses , by her writing of them if nothing more . It was a shame that he could not see this , her epitaph to their days.  | Perhaps she owed him something . She would like to show him that she had not been heartless , that underneath it had meant a great deal to her . It was only kind , it was only sensitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him that for her it was all over , yes , but that it had been somethingprecious . She recopied the poem and went into the house and put it into an envelope and addressed it to him at the studio . Later that afternoon she drove through the village and dropped the letter in the mailbox outside the post office . The evening was dark and breathless . James came for dinner , and afterwards they walked about in the garden , under the dark sky . Leda talked about poetry . Ile was very humble about his ignorance of literature . " I 'll leave the intellectual pursuits to you , darling , " he said . " I 'm just an old scientific guy . " " I 'm interested in learning about your work . " " I know , hut you 're so confoundedly bright about picking things up . You seem to have an car for the jargon . I never was quick at things . You should have seen me plugging through medical school . In college I never could make any sense out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artistic side of our life to you . " " Do n't say artistic ' , " she said . " Why not say artistic ? " " It just sounds so wet , " she said briefly . She had no word from Lambert about the poem she had sent him , though for a time she found herself waiting for the mail . She hoped he would not telephone . A letter was what she wanted , something tragic , and beautiful , that would show her , as she had shown him , his state of mind . No letter came . At first she felt resentful , then she shrugged her shoulders . If he could n't even have the common civility to acknowledge her poem , she was well quit of him . He could stay in the mess he had made of his life . She rather regretted that she had sent him her poem . In August James went to New York to talk to a man with whom he had been in correspondence about doing research at the Columbia foundation. 1Ic would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Back Bay when he returned . She thought it would be rather nice to have a little vacation from James for a bit . She had seen him every night all summer , and while conversation was not difficult nor unpleasant , since James took such an enthusiastic interest in all that she was doing and thinkingand feeling , his love-making sometimes got to be a strain . Sometimes she could not restrain her repugnance . " Oh , James , do n't ! " she cried suddenly the night before he went to New York , when he was pressing his mouth against her neck , and it was hot . " I ca n't help pestering you , " he said . " I 'm afraid I 'm going to be rather an uxorious fellow . " " What do you mean , uxorious ? " " Uxorious means wife-loving , darling . " " I know what it means , " she said . " But if you mean wife-loving , why do n't you say wife-loving ? "  | " I sort of like uxorious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't know anything about words . You just sound pompous when you try to use long ones . I ca n't bear pomposity . You 'd better stick to saying what you mean . " " Do n't get mad at me , darling . I did n't mean anything . " " I 'm not mad at you ! " " I know , I know , darling . It 's been awfully hot , and of course it is a strain for you . " " What is a strain for me ? " " Well , the emotional strain we are both bound to be under while we are engaged . " " Oh , do n't be loathesorne ! " she cried . " Darling , darling . Do n't be nervous . Everything 's all right . I 'll be so sweet to you . Everything will be lovely when we get all this folderol over and are alone together . " " Please do n't say alone together ' . " " I wo n't say anything , " he said mildly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day after James had gone that the letter came from Lambert . Opening it , she realized that she had never seen his handwriting on a full page before . " Darling , " it said . " Do n't be a damned fool . We have n't forgotten all the mystery , not even you , although you 're such a tough little thing . Everything is one hell of a mess , is n't it ? I want to see you before the world blows up completely , and you 're bound to want to see me after the good purgative dose of Boston you have been getting . Before we 're all grown up and committed to boredom and Christ knows what , let 's see each other anyway once . Let 's be young together just one more time . I know you have to think of your God damned reputation . So if you 'll be down on the dock at Manchester about three on Friday I 'll sail up to it and take you off , and I ca n't think of any better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're not there , then you 're not there . Lambert . " The letter was like a gust of spring wind in the middle of Leda 's summer . She could see Lambert , as she read the letter . She could hear his voice and see his lips speaking . She told herself that it would be impossible for her to go sailing with him . Friday was the day that James returned , at eight o'clock in the evening , and they might be becalmed and she unable to get to the station to meet him . Besides someone on the dock , someone in another boat , might see them together . It was n't worth the risk . But there was one phrase in Lambert 's letter that echoed over and over in Leda 's head . " Let 's be young together just one more time . " It seemed to strike a note in her . " Let 's be young together just one more time . Let 's be young ... "  | On Friday after lunch she got in her car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the dock . After the heavy Boston air the breeze here was strong and fresh , the water and the sky were bright blue , and there was a lift , like singing . The white sails out on the water skimmed along nearly horizontal to the waves , and fled before the wind . She saw a sloop coming up to the dock , and the figure at the tiller raised one arm and saluted , slowly , and she raised her arm and saluted back . The boat swept in closer . Lambert brought it in to the dock and caught the edge of the round logs framing it as he passed them . Leda jumped down into the cockpit and he let go and they swept off again across the broad and rippling water . She sat down on the scat opposite him . " Trim the jib sheets , will you ? " he said . She shifted the ropes forward on the little deck and made them fast about cleats . " I have n't been sailing since Islesboro last year , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old khaki pants and a white shirt ; it was open at the neck . He was not looking at her , but up at the big sail . His face was brown and hard . " Who gives a damn when you went sailing last ? " he said . She laughed . " Have you been sailing a lot ? " she said . " Oh , nuts . I do n't know . Come over and sit beside me . You 're in the wrong place . " She slipped over to the other side of the cockpit . They were skimming along fast , and the little waves went slap , slap , slap , against the side of the boat . There were no other boats anywhere near them . Lambert kept his left hand crooked over the tiller and put his other arm around Leda . She looked up into his face and smiled and he smiled back at her . " God bless you , " he said . " You do n't have to talk everything over , do you ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I 'm a bastard , so that makes us two of a kind , does n't it ? " Somehow she did n't at all resent his saying that . She felt perfectly comfortableand happy , and leaned against him and put her head on his shoulder . " Our goose is cooked , darling , " he said . " Our cake is eaten , or something . The good days are over . I guess it was your fault . But I do n't know . I guess it would have been pretty bad anyway . I make trouble anywhere I am , and although you may not know it yet , you 'll make trouble anywhere you go too . What the hell . This is nice , is n't it ? " " Yes . " He leaned his head and kissed her on the lips . She did not speak . The cool fresh breeze blew incessantly across their faces . The sun caught in little points all over the blue face of the sea , and far away other white sails dipped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and shiftp209to the other side of the cockpit together , and Lambert would put his arm back around Leda . It was extraordinarily peaceful . There was a kind of suspension from the hot world , being off alone in a boat on the sea . Lambert would kiss Leda , and she would look up into his face and smile , and he would smile back . Then she would settle against his arm again , and keep her eyes fixed on the horizon , and more time would go by withouteither of them speaking . It was only much later in the afternoon when long shadows began to streak the water and the gulls flew low over the waves and shrieked that they began to talk . " How is Maizie getting along ? " Leda said . Her voice was husky from long silence , and she cleared her throat . " I guess she 's all right . The baby will be born in February . " " How do you feel about it ? " " All right . I 've sort of made up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they are , it 's probably the best thing that could happen to us . It should make Maizie happier . She 's excited about it . She wants a boy . " " What do you want ? " " A boy , I guess . I guess it would be nice to have a son . I 'd never thought much about it before , about a child itself , I mean . I 've thought about the idea of a woman being pregnant , but not . . . . I guess it will be nice to have a boy . " It was curious how unimpassioned their talk was . Their lives had arrangedthemselves , each of them had a role to fill waiting on land , separate paths that they would follow , all marked out and mapped . This afternoon was a dream occurring in the midst of their real lives , that did not disturb nor change anything . " When 's the wedding ? " he said . " September . You 'll be asked of course . I hope you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . Maybe Maizie will . I 'm not much on weddings . There is n't anything to do but get tight . Where are you going to live ? " " We 're going to New York . James has got work there . I 'm going down next week and pick out an apartment . " " Good , " he said . " Good . New York is much more the place for you . " " You too , I should think . " " I do n't believe in that , for me . I might like it , I do n't know . But places should n't make any difference to a painter . And Maizie would n't want to live away from her family . Not that she likes Boston . But New York would be worse . She 's a Southern girl , you know . I do n't think she 's ever liked the North . " " I know , " Leda said . They were talking like old friends . They were talking very wisely , very maturely . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smelling the salt wind , watching the light fade from the sea and the water turn to purple . " Do you want me to put you ashore again or will you cone along to the mooring and row ashore ? " " Oh , I might as well stay with you . It 's all right . "  | They tied on to the mooring in the late afternoon and rowed ashore in the little dinghy . There was no one about on shore . The land birds were calling in the early twilight . The air was warmer , but there was still the breeze from the sea . They walked in the dusk up the hill to where Leda 's car was parked . She got in behind the wheel and he leaned with his arms folded on the side of the door . " Goodbye , " she said . " It 's been a swell afternoon , has n't it ? " " Swell . " " Let me drive down to the turn in the road with you . I 'll walk back , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and got in beside her on the other side . She started the car and drove slowly along the road front the sea up the rise to the turn in the road . Then she stopped and pulled on the hand brake . The engine was running , quietly . Lambert sat beside her looking straight ahead . She turned her head and looked at him . " Goodbye , my darling , " he said . He put both arms around her and kissed her slowly , lightly . " Goodbye , Leda . " Suddenly she began to cry . She had no warning . Suddenly she was crying bitterly , endlessly . Lambert held her tight and said nothing . From time to time he kissed her , gently , on her wet face . She could not stop crying . She had never cried like this before in her life . She did not know exactly what it was that made her tears so urgent , so inexhaustible . It was something about a kind of life being over . It was something about youth being over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never really had , a kind of youth , a kind of simplicity . It was not that she felt anything must be changed . She simply felt heartbroken . She cried and cried . " We could always just go off , you know , " he said . " No , " she murmured , crying . " No , I suppose not . I wonder what kind of people we would have been if we had n't been born in Boston . " She did not answer . " My sweet , " he murmured . " Darling . My sweet love . " She felt his check hard and cool against hers . " It certainly has bitched us , " he said . " We stink as people . We might have been perfectly decent if we had n't always been fighting something ever since we were born . If we 'd lived in some normal , easy sort of place . We excrete all the wrong juices . We 're all uncoordinated for coping with life on an easy basis . " Nothing he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against hers . " I 've got to go , " she said . " I 've got to meet James . " " Yes , " he said . " I suppose so . " He kissed her again , still impersonally almost , on her wet lips , andp211opened the car door and got out . The dusk had grown deeper . He stood in the half-light looking at her . " Goodbye , " she said . She straightened herself in the seat , took a long breath . " Good luck . " " Do n't be silly , " he said . " Goodbye . " She did not look at him but threw the clutch in and moved away . When she was almost around the curve she looked back and he was standing in his shirtsleeves in the middle of the road in the twilight . Then she went on around the corner and the car picked up speed . She walked up and down the long platform downstairs in the Back Bay Station , waiting for the train to come in from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracks from the South End  --  the children calling in the evening heat . She had an unformed memory of herself as a schoolgirl standing so many days on the platform on the other side , waiting for the train to Hampton , alone , or , earlier , with Betsy Jekyll . It seemed very long ago , and not especially significant , just unforgettable : She was another person now . She was a tall young lady in a white dress and no hat , in socks and sneakers , walking up and down the platform . She passed a middle-aged man she knew slightly , a Mr. George Ames , also pacing up and down , carrying a stick and swinging it . He bowed , and she bowed gravely back . She was Miss Leda March . She would soon be married . As the train roared in , the tracks made a shuddering sound and the huge yellow lamp in front of the engine poked blindingly into the station , and then the train was slowing and halting with the sound of brakes put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each car , and on each end platform was a pile of baggage . When the train stopped the colored porters jumped down and began hurriedly to unload the bags . Then the passengers stepped off . Leda saw James at once . He was two cars away from where she stood ; looking around for her . She had no impulse to join him . She watched him with curiosity . He was tall , wearing a thin gray suit and stiff straw hat with his club ribbon round it . He looked prosperous , handsome , and Bostonian . He saw her , and hurried up to her , beaming . She stood still . When he got near she smiled . He put his arm around her and kissed her . " Everything 's set , " he said . " Got a splendid opportunity , working with Mayhill . Looked at a couple of apartments , too . One specially nice , with a river view . How 's my sweetheart ? Been playing tennis ? " " Yes , " she said . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to walk towards the stairs , up into the station , comfortably , with steps that matched . " Missed me ? " he asked . " Of course , " she said.  |p212WHEN  IT WAS SEPTEMBER , and the heat broke , and Nicola came back from her honeymoon , everything was different ; invigorating . Now Nicola went with Leda on the last shopping expeditions and gave advice . It was nice to be going about Boston , two tall slender well-dressed young women , one dark and one fair , going into shops together and sitting over a table at lunch . But Nicola could not always go along . She was married now , and arrangingher own apartment , and was subtly different from the way she had been in the old days ; just as good a friend , as complete a confidante , but with another life no one could share ; her married life . It was a strange little feeling . Soon Leda would be married too , and living in New York . She would come back to Boston on visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for clothes and the theatre , and they would go immediately to each other , and they would lunch together , and all four of them would have evenings . But it would never again be as two free-lances in the world . They would be women , with husbands , with establishments , with lives organized on a different basis . Nicola and Dicky had an apartment in a made-over house on CommonwealthAvenue , the two top floors . As soon as Nicola moved into it , it took on Nicola 's atmosphere . Mrs. Kruger had supervised its decoration while Nicola was away , and now it was a young married couple 's apartmentthat seemed to Leda a sort of criterion for young married couples ' apartments . There was silver tea-paper on the walls of the dining-room , the living-room was done in beige and white , there were flowers in the big simple glass vases , looking somehow like Nicola 's flowers and nobody else 's ; the wedding presents were put to use , silver cigarette boxes on the tables and silver dishes for ashtrays , lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment Nicola moved calmly in her trousseau clothes , her hair smooth , moving things a fraction of an inch to achieve perfection . She might always have been Mrs. Richard Fenton . Leda would go up to the apartment for lunch on a warm , clear Septemberday , or drop in at the end of an afternoon after shopping and be given a cocktail when Dicky came home . The two girls would sit at each end of the large sofa covered in rough white stuff , and reach out their hands for the wedding-present glasses , wet and frosty . Dicky was perfect too . He was the completely right young husband who sold bonds down town and played squash with other young bond-salesmen and came home to mix a drink for his wife and her friends . He teased Nicola and Leda in just the proper vein . The Fentons were an obviously happy , well-suited , and attractive young couple . They spent weekends on the North Shore ; they were in demand to dine . They were not bridal , nor in any way did they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive than that . They were calm and joking , they played all games well , they danced well , they dressed well ; an addition to society . Leda observed them minutely . She was learning the rhythm of living of an attractive young couple . She was continually struck with one thing : out of no overwhelming passion , out of what seemed hardly more than liking , the Fentons had made together a successful life . It showed that the novels were wrong ; that commonsense was right ; that happy marriages were not made from great love . Great love , on the contrary , could not possibly be fitted into such a chic apartment as this ; it would knock over all the little tables . Happy marriages , Leda thought , were made from little things : a nicknamefor your husband , plenty of money , a good forehand stroke at tennis , your charming mother-in-law dropping in for a cocktail not too often , little dinners with terribly good food and highballs afterwards from expensivecrystal glasses . The fact that Nicola 's marriage had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait around for a man who was everything you could ask for . You chose a man with certain basic requirements and then you constructed around him and yourself a delightful setting . In fact , you had better not wait around for a man you were desperately in love with . You might be hampered by love , you might not do as good a job on making a charming marriage out of it . James was extremely good material . He was infinitely better material than Dicky had been . She would have nothing much to do to James . And Leda was coming to have considerable confidence in her own talents for organization . Perhaps they were not as unerring and graceful as Nicola 's , but Nicola had been born with hers . Leda was not doing so badly for a girl who had been given none of the breaks , who had had to do everything for herself , she thought . The wedding was going to be lovely . Leda knew better than to attempt things that were beyond her scope , that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be charming ; individual . Less than a week before the wedding Laura came into Leda 's room one evening after she had gone to bed . She was going to bed early for several nights in order to be fresh when the festivities began . She was lying in her bed reading a magazine about decoration , in an old nightgown . All her trousseau nightgowns and other things were already packed , and she was wearing for these last weeks nightgowns and pajamas that would be given away when she was married . The screens were still on the windows , and the cool late summer air came softly into the room . Laura came in uncertainly and sat down on the old painted wooden chair . " You look so pretty , sweetheart , " Laura offered hesitantly . Leda smiled and laid down the magazine on the blanket . " I must , with my face loaded with cold cream . I feel like the ladies in thep214beauty articles . Take every opportunity to cream your face when you are alone , to make yourself beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did not understand that sort of thing . She had always been puzzled by her daughter , and now her daughter lived in a world whose jargon she did not even understand . She was not sure whether Leda was speaking seriously or whether she was making a joke . " Precious , I came in because I thought . . . perhaps . . . there are things we ought to talk about before you marry James . " " What ? " " Well , dearest , I do n't want you to be frightened about what . . . marriagemeans . It 's nothing dreadful . It 's very beautiful , and lovely , and it can be a sort of sacrament between you and your husband . " " Oh , my God ! " Leda said . " Look , I know about the facts of life . I 've known about them for years . Everybody does . " She was strangely revolted by the idea of her mother coming in to her to talk seriously and embarrassingly . She obviously wanted to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was incredible the way her parents always did everything wrong . Imagine Mrs. Kruger coming in to tell Nicola about sex . If she had ever done such a thing , she would have put it intelligently , attractively ; not slimed it over with this cast of revolting emotion . Leda picked up her magazine . But Laura stayed . " I know , " she said . " I know your generation knows all sorts of things . It was n't just to tell you what . . . sexual relations are , that I came in . It 's something else . It 's rather hard for me to put into words to you , Leda . " " I think I know everything I need to know , " Leda said . " No . It 's this . I love you and I want you to be happy and have a full , beautiful marriage such as your father and I have had . I know you are n't satisfied with the way we brought you up . I know you are impatient of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to see you happy . We do n't want to see you missing the most precious things in life . " " I do n't intend to , " Leda said briefly . " I think perhaps you 're a little hard , sweetheart . Not kind . Not outgiving . Perhaps it is our fault that you had an unhappy childhood , and it made you grow hard . But you are n't really hard . You 're the dearest little girl in the world . 1 remember what a sweet , gentle , dreamy little girl you used to be before you went out in the world and it changed you . " Laura 's eyes filled with tears . " James loves you with all his heart , " she said , " and I want him to get the little girl that we know . You can trust him , you know . He would never hurt you . I want you to be happy with him . What I wanted to tell you tonight was how beautiful , how exalting , relations with your husbandcan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's anything unpleasant about it . It can be the loveliest thing in two lives , if you love and trust each other . "  | " Oh , mother ! " Leda cried violently . " Please go away . I know all this . It 's so . . . wet , talking about it with you . " Laura looked at her reproachfully but humbly , with tear-filled eyes . Her face was white in the light . Her hands were folded on her lap . " I just want you to be happy with James , " she said . " I will be . Honestly , mother , I will be . Everything 's fine . Everything 's grand . I just do n't want to talk about it . " " I wish I could have been closer to my daughter , " Laura said . " We will miss you so when you are gone , but we have n't really had you for a long , long time . You left us long ago . " " I 'm sorry , mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , of course . " " I hope you do . I hope you really do , underneath . Because we love you with all our hearts , and we will always be here whenever you want us . You are our baby , and I want you to remember that we are always here for you , as long , as we live . " She got up and came over to the bed and bent over Leda . Leda held herself still and lifted her cheek to Laura 's kiss . Laura rested her face for a moment on Leda 's cheek . " My precious , " she said . " My little baby . Grown up , and going out in the world with her husband . I 'm so glad it is James you love . I trust him so . Oh , my baby ! " When she had gone out and shut the door behind her , Leda drew a long breath . But she could not go back in peace to her magazine and the pictures of dining-room arrangements . She was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years , since the time when she had first learned about sex and imagined her parents in the act of sex . It was a picture charged with disgust for Leda ; those two together made a picture shudderingly revolting . What a frightful thing sex could be that way , all cuddly and somehow filthy ! The only way that sex was decent was the way it must be for the people like Nicola and Dicky ; Mr. and Mrs. Kruger . Somehow Leda could not imagine them in the act at all , and that was the attractive thing about it . They would always be in control of themselves . They would say , Darling , you 're too divine . ' It would be clean . It would be attractive . She let herself think of something that she rarely did think of : herself with James . There was something potentially disgusting in James , his ardor and his moustache and the thought of his loving body . But it would be up to her to control that situation , and as in the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and acceptable . It was n't as if James looked like her father . He was well-built and well-groomed . She would say , " Darling , you 're too divine , " and be gay , and look lovely in a well-cut nightgown with her hair spread on the pillow . Three days before the wedding , things began to move with festive precision , the reward of the time Leda had given to organizing . She felt herself relaxing , at the same time that she was stimulated ; everything was coming off right . It was almost as if it were someone else 's wedding ; she could not help admiring it . Parties were given  --  a big dinner the first night by Mrs. Kruger , a luncheon on the North Shore by James 's mother , lunches and teas by girls Leda knew , the Mayson sisters and Marna Elliott , who were bridesmaids . Two nights before the wedding was the ushers ' dinner at the Club ; Leda took the bridesmaids to dinner at a restaurant in town that night , and they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other diners , wearing the round bouquets Leda had sent them . The night before the wedding the wedding party was given a dinner by Bernard and Laura  --  though of course it was Leda who had done everything about it  --  back at the Club . Leda looked up and down the long table . Even Laura looked fairly decent at one end , in a pink lace dress Leda had chosen . Bernard was at the other end , talking to Nicola , calm and lovely in honey-colored satin from Chanel with a red glass buckle . And up and down the table were bridesmaids chattering with the ushers ; the ushers were all a little tight , but making the most of the evening and of the bridesmaids . Up and down the table ushers rose and toasted the bride in champagne . Even Bernard had the wit to make quite an amusing little speech . After dinner more people came in to dance ; a small orchestra from Boston arrived and began to play in the little ballroom . Leda was very happy . Everything was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She laughed and joked and knew that she was looking well in a cherry-red chiffon dress . James cut in between every other usher ; she was pleased with him and smiled as he danced her into the corners . The usher from Richmond made a great show of falling in love with the bride at the last moment . " Beatin ' your time , boy , " he said to James , cutting in . " Not going to let this charming little Yankee girl get away from me . Aiming to let you wait for her at the church . " " Do n't pay any attention to these Southern devils , " James said over his shoulder as he walked away . " With their Southern lines . Professional heartbreakers , that 's what they are . " " Do n't you pay him no heed , " the Richmond usher said , dancing her off in a complicated pattern of steps . " It 's always my luck to find the real girl just on the eve of her weddin ' . " Leda laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a face like a boy 's , clear-cut and bony . HIc was a doctor ; acting like a Freshman in his few days of liberty from work . " Always thought Yankee girls were homely and cold as ice  --  brrrr ! " he said . " Never knew they were hiding anything like you back up here in the land of ice and snow . It would take old James to find you lurkin ' like a violet among the leaves . You 're his cousin ? " " Yes , " Leda said , laughing.  | " Honey , you ca n't go and marry kin . Old Dr. Merriman 's telling you , terrible mistake to marry kin . Old James must be forgettin ' his eugenics . Never marry kissin ' cousins . Marry me . This is such a charming wedding party , let 's throw a little excitement into it and elope . Leave a note for old James . Just say , Ca n't marry kin . ' " Another usher cut in , and Treat cut in , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with James and pushing him out of the way . " Warning this lovely girl against you , boy . Nice girls should n't marry their cousins . You know that , Doctor . Think of all those squalling brats ; not one of ' em 'll have good sense . How can you do that to a nice girl , James , boy ? " " Dominant traits magnificent in both of us , Doctor , " James said , pushing Merriman . " Do n't give me that . I know all about your dominant traits , Doctor . You have n't got a dominant trait that 's fit to print . " " How about your own dominant traits , Doctor ? " " Doin ' fine , Doctor , just doin ' fine . Besides , I ai n't kin to this lovely girl . Thank my stars . " He whirled Leda off . " Where do you keep your moonlight up here , beautiful ? " he murmured . " Got to have the proper light on my work . Is n't there a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Leda laughed and nodded towards the French windows that led out on the terrace . How many times as a child had she not thought with envy of this club , where all the rich and powerful people played and danced ! Then she had been a wretched little forgotten nobody . Now this club and everything else was hers . They were all here in celebration of her , the whole thing revolved about her . She liked being with this Southern boy who probably thought she was rich and had always been powerful and had what she wanted . From now on her life would be among people who took her on her face value of beauty and power . They walked out on the terrace under the bright sky full of stars , and down the slope of the grass toward the golf course , arm in arm . It was exciting ; it was romantic ; Leda knew nothing about this man nor he about her ; he was strange material that she did not understand , but he was a man and presumably responsive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was fun to flirt with him . It was especially fun because it was the night before her wedding ; just because she was being married she would not cease to be attractive to men . " Honey , " he murmured , and stopped still in walking . She stopped too . He took hold of her firmly and kissed her on the mouth . " You beautiful thing , " he said . " What in the world you getting married for ? " She pulled away from him sharply and started back to the clubhousethat stpod lighted like a ship upon the hill . She heard him corning after her . " Wait , " he said . " Do n't be in such a tearin ' hurry . You being a cold old Yankee girl on me ? Listen , you know you 're interested in a little moon-light . " " I 'm being married , " she said without turning her head . " Oh , listen , honey . " " In the North we do n't go around kissing people the night before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey . Do n't try to fool old Merriman . I know all about Yankee girls . Do n't pretend like you 're some little old Southern girl . " Leda did not answer . She hurried across the terrace and into the club . James was by the door , looking out . She caught at his arm and pulled him to dance with her . When his arm was around her she looked up at his face . " That man , " she said . " The Southern one . I-le tried to kiss me outside . " " Huh ? " James laughed . " I lc did ? Why , the son of a gun . Listen , sweet , do n't be disturbed about it . Those Southern boys are different . Merriman 's a bit high . I le did n't mean anything . " " Are n't you mad at him ? " " Me ? Oh , furious . I 'll knock his block off . No , darling , do n't let it disturbyou . It does n't mean a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . She felt annoyed , but at the same time she felt relief . There had been a moment when she had been frightened . That was why she had told James at once . For they might have been seen , or Merriman might have made something out of it . And she was not prepared to have anything happen to her beautiful plans now that they were running so magically . Nevertheless , James was annoying . Merriman 's kissing her had meant something to him . She was sure it did . Nobody ever kissed Leda and meant nothing by it . The wedding was at four o'clock in the afternoon . At six o'clock the matron of honor was in the bride 's room ; she sat on the edge of the bed watching the bride putting on pale beige **25;8309;TOOLONG . They were both very calm ; they were both very beautiful . " I hope you make a go of it , " the matron of honor said . " James is a darling , really . " " Of course I 'll make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoothing her stockings up her long slim legs . " The only thing I worry about is that you do n't seem madly in love enough . " The bride shrugged her shoulders . " I think that 's silly . You and Dicky are n't madly , madly in love either , and look at you . " " We 're different . Besides , we . . . we sort of have so much fun together . Do you have any fun with James ? " " Certainly I have fun with James , " the bride said after a minute.  |p219The  door opened and the bride 's mother came in . The matron of honor stood up , politely . The bride glanced up and went on adjusting the skirt of her beige suit . " My precious baby . . . " the bride 's mother began . There were tears in her eyes . But the bride was very calm . The bride and groom got away in a big car . The people crowded around the front of the house , waving and laughing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to the champagne and to their little groups . People began to leave , taking the white boxes of cake that were neatly piled on a table by the front door . The wedding was over and the bride had gone away . The party would last on a little longer , the bridesmaids and ushers going on a last dancing party in town that night , and the out-oftownushers would be put on the midnight train . The bride and groom had a drawing-room on the train . " Well , that 's over , " the groom said , smiling at the bride . " They 're all going dancing tonight , " the bride said . " It 's too bad , is n't it , we have to miss part of our own party ? I feel sort of left out . " She laughed . The groom laughed too , comfortably . " You look perfectly beautiful , " he said . " Marriage agrees with you , 1VIrs . March . " " Do I ? Good , " the bride said abstractedly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bride drummed with her fingers on the clouded window-pane of the train . The wedding party would be having dinner now , somewhere in town . Nicola would be there , calm and shining , and Dicky , and Janet would be carrying on her flirtationwith the Baltimore usher , and the older Mayson girl with one of the New York ushers , and the Richmond usher , the one called Merriman , he would be flirting with somebody . Bernard and Laura would be at home alone , messing around , picking up the debris . The presents would still be spread out on the tables , to be packed in a day or two and sent on to New York by Laura . All the guests would have gone home , gone to what came next in their day , to dinners or parties or the country or a quiet evening alone . Maybe they were still talking , a little bit , about the wedding . But it was all over . " Do n't let 's forget , " the bride said , " to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Read all about the big doings , " the groom said . " March marries March . Excited , darling ?

" Maybe it would have been simpler to have a little tiny wedding , after all . " " Really ! " the bride said . " This was the only possible kind of wedding . I mean , parents like to have a big do when their only daughter gets married . And all the rest of it . " " Naturally . I know , darling . Well , it 's over , is n't it ? " " Yes , " she said . " It 's all over now . "  |p220ON  THE Conte Grande the James Marches had a large stateroom on A Deck with two beds . The boat turned out to be not very gay at that season , but there were a few attractive passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and had a cocktail before dinner . The honorarypurser was the most attractive man on the boat , an Italian nobleman with a cocked eye and great charm , who had them into his rooms for drinks and entertained them with the facility which had made him one of the chief assets of the Italian Line . He was enchanted with young Mrs. March , who had such night-dark hair and such dark eyes and such a lovely figure . He flirted with her , smiling at her husband and saying , " You Americans find yourselves these charming ladies and then you do nothing about them . I tell you I am an Italian , and I would like to steal her from you . " He laughed and James March laughed and Leda March laughed . The third evening out there were movies after dinner and when the lights went up Count Ruggiero came over to where young Mrs. March sat . " Where is the bridegroom ? " he asked . " He went down to get some cigarettes , " she said , smiling up into his intelligentface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take a little walk with me round the deck , and perhaps every time the bridegroom comes looking for you we will be on the farther side of the deck ? " She laughed and got up , in her slim dark red tube of a dress , that stopped at the knees and showed her pretty legs . She took his arm and they began to walk . Perhaps it was as Count Ruggiero had prophesied , for they did not meet James . Now that they were alone together the Count did not flirt with her . He talked to her about Italy . " You are well read , " he said . " It is not every American young girl who has read Symonds . You will adore Italy . I wish I could be with you when you see Florence first . You will feel emotion . " " I know . 1 have a feeling about wanting to see it first at night , the lights shining on the Arno and all the palaces making big dark shapes . " " And you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so beautiful , so still , and you will see the David in the moonlight , and the peasants ' carts will go by over the cobblestones as they did five hundred years ago . " She sighed . " You are so intelligent , " he said , " but you have not been in the world nor lived among grown-up people at all , have you ? It is always so surprisingto me that you wonderful American girls will marry yourselves to yourp221nice American husbands before you have seen anything at all , before you know what there is in the world . " She looked at him in the quiet light of the deck . The sea was very calm and the ship drove through it steadily with a low , rushing sound . Very few other people passed them . " But then , " Count Ruggiero said , " I suppose you know what you want . It only seems odd to an Italian , that all you want , you , so beautiful and dazzling , is a nice husband and a nice house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your lives . For Italian women , yes ; they are brought up for that life . But for you it is different . You are intelligent , you are restless , you are like a man , except that you are so beautiful . I should think you would want to have had a great career , worldwide , with admirers , fame , applause , adulation . " " I do want that , " she said suddenly . " I do want that . It 's what I want to have . " " I am sure you have talent . Perhaps you sing ? " " No . " She took a long breath . " I write poetry . " " Ah ! A poetess ! Of course . I can see it in your eyes . You will write great poetry , . and it is true , the world will come to your feet  --  if you do not allow the house and the babies and the husband to make you forget . But of course , perhaps I am very wicked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps you would be happier . " " I could never be happy with just that , " she said with the same intensity . " I want everything . I want everything there is . I do n't want to miss any-thing . " " That is so American . And so charming . I am sure you will have it all . It only seems curious to an Italian that you should begin your career as you have done  --  the husband first , instead of at the end . But you perhaps know best . Your American husband will allow you to do as you choose and to make this career for yourself . To an Italian that would be impossible . If an Italian had a wife like you , Mrs. March , he would not permit her to go out of his sight . He would come home for lunch every day , and he would be insanely jealous . He would occupy every minute of your time . " " I would n't stand for that , " she said . " I 'd go away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But you are not an Italian wife . That makes it so nice for all of us , that you are not an Italian wife , for you and for everyone else also . " He laughed lightly . " Nothing 's going to get in my way , " she said . " I know . I am quite sure . It is not true at all that human nature is constant over the world . Perhaps it is some sort of arrangement of Nature , fitting the species to their environment . Certainly an American wife  --  the type , I mean  --  could not endure an Italian husband for a moment . They would eat each other up . He would beat her with a stick and she would leave him directly . It would be impossible and Nature sees that it shall not occur . " " All I want is to live , really live , and be happy . " " Yes , yes . I feel sure you will be happy in Italy . Italy was made for you , Mrs. March . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , I assurep222you that you will live , and beautifully . Do you speak Italian ? Parla ltaliano ? " " No , I do n't . I wish I did . " " Perhaps you will permit me to give you a few lessons as we are crossing the ocean . I am sure you will have an ear for it . It is a beautiful language . " " I 'd love it . " James came out of a doorway directly in front of them . He saw them and came towards them , smiling . " Where have you been ? " he demanded . " Count , have you been stealing my bride ? " " I have had no success , " the Count said smiling . " I return her to you with a thousand thanks for these few moments of pleasure . Until tomorrow , then , Signora . A rivederla . " " Well , " James said , as they walked on alone along the deck . " The old boy 's been doing his stuff on you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line . " Leda glanced at him . She had the oddest feeling that he was a stranger to her , that she had never seen him before . At the same time there was a familiarity about him , a familiarity as of old clothes , of a room one knows and hardly sees , of scenes so well-known that there is nothing left in them to view . " We 've been talking about Italy , " she said coldly . " It 's a swell country . I 'm dying to show it to you , darling . I 'll show you the Colosseum by moonlight . " " I do n't feel , " she said , " as if I could stand the Colosseum by moonlight . " But that night when she had gone to bed and the lights were out and somewhere across the room in the darkness James was lying quiet , Leda felt a strange , overwhelming rush of remorse . It was remorse for everything . It extended beyond James . It was like a terrible revelation . She was desperately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was so patient . He was so in love with her , and uncomplaining that his lovemakinghad hitherto been repulsive to her and she had not allowed him to approach her but once or twice . He believed in her and he adored her and trusted her , and he did not know  --  the revelation came in blinding shocks  --  that she was bored with him and revolted by him and that she had married him to suit her own purposes . For this strange moment she looked at herself with loathing . She had never felt this way . She saw herself as hard , relentless , and scheming , selfish and cold . She had not treated James like a human being . She had used him . He might not have been flesh and blood . And her parents . She thought of them , little and timid and frightened , dominated by her and forced to her will , apologetic and always bullied , never receiving any of the love or gentleness that they longed for . She had extracted everything she wanted from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their love even by tolerance . She had made them miserable for years . She was a monster . She felt that it was more than she could bear . She could not fight off the self-accusation that came in waves , making images before her closed eyesp223of unkind things she had done , of harsh things she had said . She was the most inhuman person in the whole world . She seemed to herself to loom like a symbol of grasping cruelty . It was unbearable to be herself . She slipped out of her bed and felt her way across the stateroom in the dark . She held her hand before her ; it touched James 's face . " What , darling ? " he said quickly . " Is something the matter ? Are you sick ? " He switched on the light beside him . He sat up in bed and Leda sank down on the edge with her face in her hands . " What , my darling ? What , my sweet darling ? " " I 'm so awful . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ badly . I 'm a monster . You 're good and kind and I 've been rotten to you . To every-body . " He put his arm around her and pressed his face against her cheek . " No , no , darling , no , you have n't . You 're the sweetest thing in the world . " " You do n't know . You do n't know . I 'm horrible . I hurt everybody thatgets near me , ruin everybody 's life , just hurt everybody . " Through her mind flickered a memory , faint and soon blotted out . Somebodyhad talked to her about hurting everybody , somebody else had said that of themselves . . . Lambert ... . " I 'm a beast , " she said . " I want to be better so much . I will be good to you , darling , you 'll see . Honestly I will . " It felt good to say it . " Darling , " he said , " you 're lovely to me . You 're the sweetest thing I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad . It 's just reaction , darling . It 's after the excitement of the wedding . Everything 's going to be lovely . You make me so happy . I 'll make you happy too . " " I do n't deserve you , " she said . " You deserve better than me . You 're wonderful and lovely . How can you say something as silly as that a beautiful creature like you does n't deservea boring old guy like me ? " " But I do n't , " she said . She could never tell him , even in such a moment as this , the reasons why she had married him . She could not admit that she had never loved him . Besides , now she loved him . She would do anything to make up for the way she had been . " Darling . . . darling . . . put your arms around me , too . I love you so , my darling . Darling . . . kiss me .... " In July of the following year Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the announcement of the birth of a son to Mr. and Mrs. James March of 440 East 57th Street , at Miss Lippincott 's Hospital . She cut it out and glued it in her scrapbook.  |p224AUTUMN  was the high time of madly blue skies and flaming leaves , the smell of fire in the air ; the time of football games and tea-dancing and driving at night through back roads that smelled of grapes and dead leaves , to park in the darkness and kiss . And now for Betsy there was no school any more to interrupt the absolute joy of being alive . The year that Leda was coming out , Betsy had finished school at the Hampton Country Day and was living at home waiting for romance to happen to her . Every morning she would wake up in her tower room and jump out of bed and run across to shut the window . Before she shut it , even when the mornings were cold , she would hang in her nightgown out of the window and gulp down the morning air . She would slam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would peer at her face , that looked like a boy 's face with curly light brown hair cut very short around it , and big eyes that stared back at her . She ran the comb through her hair and wrapped her old pink corduroy dressing gown tight around her hips , stuck her feet into a pair of ratty pink satin mules and clattered down the two flights of stairs to the dining-room . Minnie May would be sitting at the end of the table with a cigarette stuck in the corner of her mouth . She was reading letters or the paper through a cloud of blue smoke . In a dish that had held eggs half a dozen cigarette butts smoldered . The coffee pot was within arm 's length and as Minnie May read , she would absent-mindedly fill her cup again . Whorls and streaks of blue smoke drifted along the sunbeams and hurried over to the window . Tom 's place was cluttered with the remains of his toast and eggs ; he had left some time before , and so had the Brats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she came into the dining-room and surveyed the breakfast table Betsy would for a moment think of Maizie ; Maizie was gone away and she was wretched ; there was something terrible the matter with her life . But the sunshine and life itself were too brilliant and wonderful for sad thoughts . " 1 'm the Maizie now , " Betsy would think sometimes ; " I 'm the young daughter of the house now , I go to the parties and I have the beaux . " She would hug herself and grin all over her face and go and kiss her mother . If there was a maid Betsy would shout to her to bring some breakfast ; if there was no maid she would go out into the kitchen and cook herself something and carry it back into the sunshine . She would sit in the middle of the morning and cat and smoke cigarettes and drink coffee , feeling luxurious , talking with her mother about clothes and dates and boys and clothes again . There was Bob and Petie and Mac and Kipper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Faithful , " Minnie May called him . " Excepthe does n't gush , " Betsy would say . " I do the gushing . Pm going to tryp225to talk less . I think it gets them if you 're mysterious . " " Reckon it does , " Minnie May would say . " I thought you looked right mysterious in your new beaded red . " There was the new beaded red , and the purple satin for tea-dancing , with a purple felt cloche picked up at Filene 's basement , and the purple shoes ! " I might just kind of take purple as my color , " Betsy said . " Write in purple ink and always wear purple , and I 'd be known as the Purple Girl . That would be intriguing , would n't it , do n't you think ? " Minnie May agreed . But sometimes with all her interest Minnie May 's eyes seemed to Betsy to grow abstracted , and that was a moment she dreaded . It meant that Minnie May 's back was hurting her again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking about Maizie . Something had broken the Jekyll charm of happiness ; in their lives now was this shadow . It was almost but not quite the same happy-go-lucky , whooping family as in the old days . Betsy would raise her voice and hurry on , about the fur coat  --  the real fur coat , bunny , bought for only $45.98 at Hovey 's , and the patent leather pumps with three-inch heels , and the chiffon stockings , and the intriguing new perfume . Minnie May 's eyes would gradually clear and she would sparkle back at Betsy through the cloud of smoke . " Seems to me you 've got a real feelin ' for clothes , honey , " she said . " Do you really think so , Ma'am ? I do adore clothes so . Maybe I could get a job doing something about clothes , sometime . Maybe I could be a  --  a buyer . " " You know what 's snappy . " " Maybe I could pick people 's clothes out for them . Tell them how to fix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could . I always want to fix peopleup to be snappier . " " Reckon you could . You might try to get a job for yourself like that . You just go ahead and have fun for yourself this year , though . There 's time enough for a career . Maybe you 'll meet The Man . " In the old days Minnie May and Maizie had talked about The Man . Now it was Betsy they were talking about . Betsy drew a long , quivering breath . The sky was blue outside the window . The red leaves slapped against the panes . Later if Betsy was going anywhere she would dress , but usually in the late mornings she lay on her unmade bed and read . What she loved best was The Green Hat . She read it over and over . That green hat , worn gallantly , that long low foreign car  --  going to a man 's room ; all Iris 's lovers , taken gallantly , the great emerald worn  --  loosely  --  on the finger . The Marches are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that green hat , worn bravely , Pour le sport ! Betsy rolled over on her back and drew a sigh of purest delight . She knew just how Iris March looked  --  like Leda March , she was sure . But sometimes the face , so pale , so enchanting , beneath the green hat was Betsy 's own  --  gallant , desperate . And often when she was going out with a boy she felt herself wear a spiritual Green Hat , and her eyes would grow large and her mouth would droop and she would flick the ash from her cigarette in a gesture of disillusion . Blase . She bought a ring at the ten-cent store on Washington Street in Boston , with a large green stone in it , much too loose . She would sit with her hand dropping over the arm of a chair , and the emerald would hang loose on her finger . And sometimes a boy knew enough to cock a sophisticated eye and say , " Ah . . . the fall of the emerald .... " She went to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of her mirror . She had a Memory Book in which she fastened mementos  --  ared usher 's ribbon , dance cards from the boys ' prep schools to which she went even now ; with comments written on them by herself  --  Divine ! or , The Night . She went tea-dancing at Shepard 's Colonial in her purple satin . She danced extremely well . She would watch Boston girls dance by , separated from their partners and half walking as they talked . Betsy liked to dance too much for that fashionable trick . I Icr partners held her tight and did hot steps to the music . " You 've got rhythm , " they would say , and she would open her eyes and smile mysteriously . She went to football games in Cambridge . There was something about them , the cheering , the coonskin coats , the beautiful , tall , smooth young men , the crimson banners waving , that stirred her . It was cold , and the boy with her would bring a flask . All around , Harvard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all handsome , all broadshouldered , their felt hats battered , their socks falling down , all smooth , terribly smooth . She wore her bunny jacket and bright little red hats , for Harvard . Any day , any night , you might meet a Harvard man who would look at you mysteriously and say , " You 're smooth . " Later , when she had been tea-dancing after the game and out to dinner and dancing again , had parked somewhere on the road back to-Hampton , she would get undressed in her tower room with her eyes still entranced by the magic of Harvard . She would sing to herself as she dropped her teddy , her stockings : " Ten thousand men of Harvard . . . . " In November Minnie May gave a dance for Betsy . She was going to make her debut , and the word was magic , like the air . It was going to be at the Hampton Club . She bought a dress , bright scarlet , straight as a tube to the knees , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A silver evening bag . They got a good orchestra . It was not one of the expensive fashionable ones , but it played in one of the Boston hotels uptown ; Betsy had danced to it , and she knew a good orchestra when she heard it . It was a real bargain , five pieces . The leader was called Dave ; Betsy had often talked to him . Minnie May herself would supervise the punch for the dance . " I 'll put a real stick in it , " she declared . " I 'll make the punch your grandmother always made for our parties down home . " There were the invitations to he sent . The Junior League kept a list of Harvard men which people applied for in giving dances in Boston , but Betsy did not belong to the Junior League . She did not know just why not . How did girls join the Junior League , and that Vincent Club thing ? Shep227supposed you must have had to graduate from Miss Sheraton 's , or belong to one of the big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to have a dance ! She made out a list of girls she had known at Sheraton 's the year she went there , and of girls she knew at Hampton Country Day . She knew plenty of boys ; the list went over page after page . They got the invitations engraved : Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Jekyll request the pleasure of your companyat a small dance ... . And they were going to have an ushers ' dinner before it ! The dinner was at the Hampton Club too ; creamed chicken in patty shells , and peas , and ice cream and petits fours . There were sixteen ushers , and Betsy asked fifteen of the girls she had liked best last year at Country Day to dinner . When Betsy came downstairs to drive to the Club with her father and mother , it was like the nights long ago when Maizie had whirled off to dances ; but now it was Betsy who was the heroine . The Brats hung over the banisters and shrieked at her ; it was her party she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed into the Ford touring car that they now had , and drove to the Club . The other girls at the dinner were lumpish , with the vague stare and girlish speech which Betsy thought of as typical of Boston girls . Actually these were not Boston girls , though cast in their mold , but Hampton girls who had not gone away to school . They wore taffeta dresses in light colors . " Gosh , " they said . " She 's got a peachy forehand . " And the boys drank the punch that was served at dinner , the old Green punch , and said " Gosh ! Look at old Hump ! He 's getting stewed . Some punch ! " Minnie May , at the end of the table , talked and laughed and called down the table . Betsy went at her dinner partners with the peppiness that she had labored to master . She threw arch glances at them and cried , " You 're awful ! I think you 're terrible ! " and stuck into their buttonholes the carnationsbeside their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Club to begin dancing , the orchestra sounded loud and echoing . Betsy kept dancing up to the orchestra and talking to the leader , a thin , young man with patent-leather hair . She grinned at all the other men in the band . Minnie May had punch sent to them between dances . " This is a swell little dance , Betsy , " the leader said . " Your mother 's a lovely woman . I do n't know when I 've seen such a lovely woman . " Betsy had the feeling that they were playing with extra energy for her party . They played her favorite tunes , Who and Half a Moon and an old tune she loved , Mighty Blue . There was no receiving line . Minnie May or Betsy would spot someone coming in , and dash up to him , smiling and sparkling . " I 'm so glad you 've come ! It 's wonderful to see you ! Have some punch . It 's over there . " A staglinebegan to form , loosely , in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was almost too delirious to be true . Occasionally Betsy would remember to be mysterious . She would suddenly cease talking and look at her partner through half-closed eyes . Then she would forget again ; it was too exciting ; all she could do was laugh and laugh and chatter ; she could not remember about herself for more than a minute . Lots of Hampton people came . They were all people the Jekylls knew at church and of course they had been asked . But lots of Harvard men came too , beaux of Betsy 's . Once or twice she was baffled by seeing young men whom she did not know at all entering the ballroom . She quickly understood . " They 're crashing my party , " she thought . " It 's a good party , so people are crashing it ! " She was more flattered than anything else . All her schoolmates at Country Day came . And she was delighted to greet several girls whom she had known at Miss Sheraton 's . She realized that they were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet or the pilly ones ; but it was so nice of them to have come . She ran to them with beamingsmiles . " Lilian ! Betty ! Joan ! Flow simply darling of you to come ! Is n't it a lovely party ? " " These too were lumpish girls , who met her greetings with embarrassed smiles , and looked anxiously about the crowded room . But the ushers were doing their duty , dragging men out of the stagline and taking them up to be introduced to girls who had danced too long with one partner . Some really popular girls had come , girls that Betsy had met not at school but on dates , at football games , girls that she knew through boys . These girls were dressed , Betsy thought , smoothly ; in black and in red and in bright green ; they danced with their arms hooked behind their partners ' necks , and tilted their fluffy heads back and murmured as they danced , something surely intriguing , for the men bent over them , dancing with their chins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces with the look that Betsy thought of as snaky . She was dancing near the entrance to the ballroom when she saw Corinne Taylor come in with two men she had never seen . She broke away from her partner and hurried up to Corinne . Corinne was a girl she had known at Miss Sheraton 's , a girl who had never been important there but who to Betsy had always seemed more attractive than the others . She was a thin girl with beautiful red hair who giggled a great deal . Betsy had seen her often since the Sheraton days , out dancing with boys and at football games . She was quite popular . Her family came from " Texas and her father was now in business in Boston ; they were rich , and had a big house in Brookline . " Corinne , I 'm so glad you came ! Is n't it marvellous ? " Corinne giggled . " Looks like a wonderful party , " she said . " I see you 've got Dave to play . He 's hot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston . Betsy had often watched her on the floor . She had heard from boys that Corinne danced like a streak . Betsy glanced at the two men standing just behind . Corinne giggled again . " Oh , Betsy , I brought a couple of men , I thought you would n't mind . This is Oren Garth , Betsy Jekyll , and Peter De Laney . They come from New York ! "  |p229They  were both tall , and well-dressed , and very smooth looking . The one called Peter had sleek black hair and a dark skin darkened further with freckles . Betsy liked the way he kept his chin stuck out ; it looked smooth . The taller one , Oren , had brown curly hair ; his face was long and restless , with narrow blue eyes , and when he smiled his mouth went up only on one side . As he stood there , almost unnoticeably he did a tap step with his feet . He had a vague , wandering look . He put his arm around Corinne and they danced off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The one called Peter grinned at her . " Dance ? " he said . Betsy 's partner had disappeared . She started off with Peter . His dancing was smooth ; not complicated , but with perfect rhythm , without a jerk . " Do you go to Harvard ? " she asked , tipping her head back and sparkling at him . " Yep . Orey and I room together in Westmoreland . " " Oh ! Do you know Barky Harrison ? " " See him around . " " What do you go out for ? " " Me ? Oh , I play some tennis on the indoor courts . Orey does n't go out for anything . He 's a musician . He 's mad about the piano . And he plays the banjo like a streak . You ought to hear him . " " I have n't seen you anywhere around , have I ? " " No , we do n't go to these Boston dances much . Orcy ca n't stand Boston girls . None of them can dance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from New York , though . " Betsy was abashed . It was terribly impressive . " You can dance , though , " Peter offered . " I 'll have to tell Orey . " " Corinne can dance . " " You bet she can . " " And  --  oh , there are other girls in Boston who can dance . One of those Wolcott twins is supposed to be a marvellous dancer . " " Well .... " Peter said . " You see , Orey is sort of a strange guy . Sort of a socialist , maybe you 'd call it . He ca n't stand big social stuff and girls from big social families . He 's had a stomach-full of that in New York . " Betsy looked at Peter with large eyes . " You know who the Garths are , do n't you ? " he said . " Of course you 've heard of the Garths . Well , Orey got terribly fed up with all that stuff long ago . I went to St. Paul 's with him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been through hell with his family , his old man getting married all those times and everything . You know about all that Garth stuff , all the divorces and the money and all the scandals there 've been . Orey will inherit a couple of million anyway , I guess . " Scraps from the social pages of New York papers that she had scanned in search of glamour began to fuse in Betsy 's mind . Garth . . . Garth . . . of course . They were something like the Vanderbilts . . . were n't they cousins or something ? They had a chateau in Newport and there was onef ex-Mrs . Garth who was always arriving from or leaving for Paris , and one of the boxes in the Golden Horseshoe at the Metropolitan Opera was held by Mortimer Garth  --  that must be Oren 's father . " How intriguing , " Betsy breathed . Somebody cut in on Peter and he wandered off to join the stagline . Betsy danced on , and people kept cutting in , and she would smile and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She felt almost drunk , and the faces that appeared before her one after another seemed faces in a dream . SuddenlyOren Garth cut in . " Hello , baby , " he said in a melancholy , husky voice . Dancing with him was not smooth , like dancing with Peter . It was a fantasyof rhythm , of imaginative , creative interpretation of the music . You found yourself doing things with your feet that you had not known they could do . You did not even want to talk . You wanted to dance . " Peter was right . You can ( lance , " Oren said . His voice was as strange as everything about hint , his narrow eyes and his one-sided smile ; his voice was husky but not deep ; melancholy and teasing . Everything about him was elusive , the smile , the voice , the glance , as if in a second he would be gone . Somebody cut in , and somebody else , and Betsy chattered on and laughed gaily , but now something had happened to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes to see where Oren was . She saw him dancing with Corinne , and she saw him wandering back to the stagline ; standing there , alone , tall and individual , with his shoulders hunched a little , and his knees moving slightly ; he was doing a tap step by himself . Then she saw him start to walk on to the floor . She fixed her eyes on her partner 's face and talked rapidly , and prayed inside . It was all right . She felt her partner 's arms drop away from her , and different arms come around her , and looked up and saw that one-sided smile . " Hello , baby , " he said as before ; and they danced . They danced , and it was magical , but this time Betsy felt glad that dancing with Oren was so absorbing , and that he did not seem to want to talk , for suddenly for the first time in her life she felt at a loss for something to say . Her throat felt choked . Peter cut in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the stagline , and look around the room vaguely . " You 've made a hit with Orey , " Peter said . " He says you 're the best dancer in Boston . It takes quite a lot to make him say anything like that . " " Really ? " Betsy breathed . " Yep . Orey 's danced with some of the best dancers in the world , I guess . He danced with Lenore I lughes last year . You know , Maurice 's partner . " " Honestly ? " " Yep . He 's practically a professional . But of course his family would n't let him do it . That 's something else he 's got against them . He 's really good at tap , too . And he wanted to play the banjo in a band last year , but they would n't let him . I guess what he wants most is to play the piano . Play classical music , I mean . Concerts . He 's written some music , too . " " You 're terribly good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you see , I 've always kind of taken care of Orcy , since we were in school . He 's a crazy guy , always having to be got out of trouble . Absolutelyimpractical . I have to look after him . " " It must be . . . kind of wonderful , I mean it is n't like just looking after anybody , is it ? " " That 's so . I guess I love that guy , " Peter said . Somebody cut in on him . Betsy was in a daze . The way Peter had said " I love that guy " had a kind of fascination about it . These were new and exciting people with mystery about them . Betsy 's chatter and laughter were automatic now . She kept watching Oren . There was something so wonderful about him , and his strangeness , and the roommate that adored him . After far too long Oren cut back again . This time he did not speak at all . He danced her rapidly off into a corner and there began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suddenly he dropped his arm from her and smiled . It was a queer smile , one-sided and sweet and almost shy , but not that exactly ... . " Let 's have some punch , " he said . Betsy led the way over to the table where the punch-bowl stood ; she was hardly conscious of taking the steps that moved her forward . Everything was like a dream ; everything was drawn up into a knot of concentration on the young man with her . He got two cups and handed her one . " Good , " he said , sipping his . " It 's a family recipe , " Betsy said eagerly . " Mother 's mother used to make it down South where they lived . " " Really ? It 's awfully good . " He filled his cup again from the big ladle . " Want to sit out ? " he asked . " Oh , yes ! " She smiled with all her heart up into his face and he smiled back at her . They walked through the crowded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the hall , where couples were sitting on the stairs . Betsy started toward the stairs . Oren took her arm and pulled her gently . She felt his fingers on her skin . " No , somewhere else , " he said . " I want to talk to you . " They opened a door off the hall and it led into a back hall , lighted with a dim bulb in the ceiling ; cartons stood piled against the wall , and there was a high stool . Betsy sat on the stool . Oren let his back slip down the wall so that he was resting against one hip , his legs bent . The door into the main hall swung slowly to on a spring ; the sound of music and of laughter was suddenly shut out . It was perfectly quiet . But now that they were alone Oren did not talk . He seemed unaware of Betsy . He sipped his drink and drummed with his fingers against the wall . Betsy realized that it was a tap rhythm he was beating out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperately for something to say but for the first time in her life she could not talk . It was terrible . Now , when she wanted so wildly to be attractive , to be peppy and make this strange , wonderful man like her , she was dumb and felt like a shy child.  | He seemed to feel no embarrassment whatever . He seemed unaware of the silence . Betsy tried to feel natural too . But she could not . She felt that she was at her worst at the most important moment in her life . Oren leaned down with his strange grace that was almost awkward , and set the cup down on the floor . He straightened up again and put the heel of his hand on the edge of the stool . He looked down into Betsy 's face , smiling his tipped-up smile . Iier heart was beating frantically . She looked back up into his face and everything in her life seemed to stand still . She forgot everything except the way he looked . She had forgottenherself ; she was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no other in life , and it seemed to last a long time . Then he bent over and kissed her lightly on the lips . His lips were soft and sensitive ; they rested on hers for only a moment . She felt as if all the exaltation and eagerness and concentration inside her were flowing into her own lips . All of her seemed to be coming together and going out of her through her lips into him . He stood up again and stood looking down at her , smiling . " Sweet baby , " he said in his husky voice . Then suddenly it was as if he had forgotten that he had ever kissed her . The smile on one side of his mouth broadened , and his eyes sparkled , and he caught hold of her hand and pulled her off the stool . " Come on , " he said . " Let 's do some dancing . " She did not want to go back , she wanted to stay and be kissed by him again . But she could not show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping down from the stool , to fit herself to his mood . But it was so difficult to assess his mood . He was strange , like a wild creature , a deer . When they walked together back on the floor the orchestra leader caught Betsy 's eye and grinned . They were just finishing a tune , and now they beganagain , one of Betsy 's tunes . Oren put his arm around Betsy and they began to dance . Oh Gee . . . I 'm mighty blue . . . for you .. . I 've . . . been mighty true . . . to you .. . Forcing herself to do something , say something , Betsy tipped her head back and sparkled her eyes at Oren . " That 's your initials , is n't it ? O. G. ? O. G. , I 'm mighty blue for you ! ' " He smiled and said nothing . Betsy had a feeling new to her ; a feeling that what she had said might not have been amusing . She was surging with excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in . Oren wandered away ; she watched him go . He was so different from anybody else in the world . She danced on . While you whisper . . . nighty-nighty to somebody else . . . . I 'm mighty blue . . . When she woke up late the next morning in her tower room full of November sunshine , the whole of life was made of joy and glamour and excitement.  |p233Instead  of jumping out of bed she lay still and stared at the bright window . Her feet hurt pleasantly from dancing until five . Her head was full of snatches of music , and out of them emerged that tune , the tune  --  " Oh Gee I 'm mighty blue for you . . . . " She sang it aloud , softly . But she thought of it now as " O.G .  --  I 'm mighty blue . . . " It was a tune about Oren . Last night came back to her in flashes and she saw him again , and saw Peter , and then Oren again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing tap steps , and his one-sided smile , tantalizing and sweet , and his husky voice . " Baby . . . Sweet baby ... " I 'm in love , she thought . Oh , I 'm in love ! She leapt out of bed and clacked down the stairs in her old mules . Minnie May was still at the breakfast table , as usual , smoking . She looked up and smiled as Betsy clattered in . " Ma'am ! Good morning ! Is n't it a heavenly day ! " " Well darlin ' , did you like your party ? I thought everybody had a right good time . " " Oh , it was wonderful , Ma'am , wonderful ! I had the most wonderful time I 've ever had in my life ! " Minnie May poured a cup of coffee for her . " Somebody fell , I reckon . " " I do n't know . . . I do n't know . . . but I did ! I met the most wonderful man ... " Suddenly Betsy felt curiously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about a beau to Minnie May ! She swallowed a big gulp of coffee and grinned desperately . " Why do n't you have him out to supper , " Minnie May said . " We 've got a ham , has n't been cut yet . " " Oh , no ! " Betsy said , to her own surprise . " I could n't . I 've got to wait . I 've got to see . . . . " " Do n't see anything the matter with havin ' a beau to supper , " Minnie May said . " If you want to see more of him .  --  Betsy , I 'm real worried about Maizie . " Betsy looked at Minnie May and saw that the look had come into her face , the strained look that was no part of the Minnie May Betsy had worshippedall her life . It was all wrong . But today even that look could not disturb the sunshine , the music that sang in Betsy 's head ; she could not seem to keep her mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrowblue eyes and a one-sided smile . " What ? " she murmured . " Well , she did n't come last night . Course that man never does take her anywhere , but yesterday on the phone she did say he 'd agreed to come , bring her . Just like him to go back on it . Betsy , I 'd like to see that man boiling in oil . I declare I would . I 'd like to have him catch leprosy and beriberiand plague and pneumonia and be able to stand by and watch him suffer . " " Mmmmh , " Betsy nodded . " I am so worried about Maizie , honey . What 's going to happen to her if she goes on looking the way she does ? If I just could get to the bottom of it . If I could just get her to tell me what he does to her , what 's troublin ' her so terribly . I know I could fix things better . I 'd give him a piece of my mind . If I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She certainly has got it bad . If it just was n't that man . He does n't seem like he 's human . I do n't understand any man lettin ' his wife look the way Maizie does  --  like a ghost , that 's the way she looks . I do n't know if you even remember what your sister used to be like , Betsy . Why , she was the most beautiful , gayest , most popular .... " " I remember , " Betsy said . But nothing could cloud the sunshine . The telephone rang . Before the first ring had stopped Betsy was out of her chair and clatteringinto the hall , stumbling all over her dressing-gown cord . She heard Minnie May laughing behind her . She snatched the receiver off the hook . " Hello ? " she said casually . " Is Miss Betsy Jekyll there ? " It was . It was the husky voice on which life hung . " This is Miss Betsy Jekyll . " " This is Oren Garth . " " Oh , hello @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He made no answer to that . " Will you be in if I come to see you this afternoon ? " " Oh , uh , yes , I will . I 'll be in this afternoon . " " Fine . Goodbye . " He hung up . Somehow Betsy got back into the dining-room and into her chair ; a coffee cup was somehow in her hand . The sunshine came waving in ribbons and banners into the room , and the smoke of cigarettes danced upon the beams . The world was sunshine and music . The world was dancing and strange , one-sided smiles and a kiss , the first kiss in life that mattered , the only kiss ; " Baby . . . . " " I 'm goin ' in to see this doctor in the afternoon , " her mother was saying . " Tell me he 's a miracle man . Hope he can do something about this devilish back of mine . If he 's any good , I declare I 'm going to make Maizie see him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't have it . " " Oh , Ma'am , you 'll get back , wo n't you ? I need you . . . . This boy ... he 's coining out to see me this afternoon . That was him that called up . His name is Oren Garth . He 's . . . " Minnie May smiled and the cigarette on her lower lip waggled . " Oh ? I 'll get back real early , honey . " But now suddenly Betsy hoped she would not get back . Everything was topsy-turvy . Not wanting Minnie May to help her entertain a beau ! Everythingwas different . She was dressed , in an orange silk dress , and ready by three o'clock , and from then on she seemed to wait for hours and hours , sitting for a little while in the living-room and then hurrying to a mirror to see if her hair was still right , and going to the window and counting up to five hundred to see if he would come before she had finished , and running upstairs top235put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Once she opened the front door , and the sweet cold air of late November came in against her face , but she shut the door quickly and ran upstairs again to rearrange her hair . She was keyed to the sound of a car driving up . It was nearly five and dark when the doorbell rang . She ran to the door and opened it and Oren stood outside . He was very tall and narrow in a black overcoat with a velvet collar . He stood in the twilight on the thresholdand smiled his one-sided , shy smile . He had a big case in one hand , a banjo case . The light from the hall shone on his brown , rough curly hair . There was no car in the drive behind him . " How 'd you get out ? " Betsy asked . It was the only thing in the world she could think of to say . " I took some street cars . . . . " His voice was vague .. He came into the house and took off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . He kept smiling at her ; that smile , bashful but also self-assured , ingratiating . She led him into the living-room . He brought his banjo in with him . He was not like the smooth , decorous Harvard boys . He was not like anybody . He sat on a low chair and Betsy watched the way he sat down ; almost awkwardly , but at the same time gracefully and with a loose-hung individuality . He seemed always to be conscious of his feet . He wore a pair of black patent leather dancing shoes with his gray daytime suit , and they looked wet ; he must have walked up from Hampton Square . She felt tongue-tied and ill at ease . He came from a different world . She stared at him with big eyes , trying to think of something gay and intriguing to say . There was nothing . Perhaps , she thought , she had better try to be mysterious and say nothing on purpose . But she could not feel that way . She was centered on him , reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his banjo out of its case and let it lie on his lap . " Peter says you 're a real musician , " she said finally . " Hmmmm ? " His voice was husky , low and endearing . " God , I 'm not good . I 've played this thing since school , that 's what Peter 's talking about . Banjo ! I want to be a pianist . But it 's so late . You have to begin young to get a concert technique . I 've never been let to do anything I really cared about . " " Are your family very mean about things ? " " Oh . . . the family , " he said . " Nobody has any idea . I 'll tell you all about them some time . " That meant he intended to see her again . " Do n't you like your father ? " " I hate him , " he said . " He 's hurt everybody so much . My mother . I do n't know her very well . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clyde Vanderkirk afterwards . They live in St. Jean , I 've seen the chateau and visited her there , but I 'll never really know her now . She 's beautiful . She 's the most beautiful woman I ever saw . " " How beautiful ? " Betsy said in a faint voice . It was like a Michael Arlen novel.  | " She paints . But she 'll never be any good , it 's too late . Vanderkirk is a painter , but he 'll never be any good either . They 've been ruined by money , and never being allowed to do things till too late , and people like my father , and , oh , all the stuff you get into . I want to get out of it before it 's too late . " He looked wretched . " Could n't you just leave , I mean run away or something ? " " My father . . . . You do n't know . All this stuff about being a Garth . God ! He 'd disown me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's more to it . . . . He wants me to be an international banker . " The words were in capitals in Betsy 's mind . International Banker . " He ruins people , " Oren said bitterly . " After my mother he married a woman and then got rid of her later . When I was in school he married a beautiful woman . Peter knows all about that . I was in love with her . God ! You can imagine what that was . In love with my father 's wife . I ca n't talk about it . Now he 's married to somebody else . They travel a lot . God knows what 's happened to Elena . Lovely Elena . " He picked up the banjo and held it with his long nervous hands , and began to play very softly the tune San and to sing in his husky , ingratiating , melancholy voice : I had a sweet Mamma I had a sweet MammaBut she 's turned sour now ... It seemed to Betsy incredibly skillful , professional ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music so teasing and provocative . Gee . . . . She handed me one grand surprise Because I thought I had her pasteurized ... . I had a sweet Mamma ... . " We made up the words , " he said , laying down the banjo again . " Peter and I. Back at school . Like it ? " " 1 think it 's wonderful . " He got up and walked around the room with light , nervous steps , as though he were dancing . He glanced out of the windows into the dark . He picked things up off tables and looked at them and put them back . Betsy felt panicky . What could she say to interest someone like this ? Suddenly he broke his wandering with a sharp , loud tap-step on the floor . Ta-da ! He looked at her and laughed , and did it again . He was like a child , unique and unself-conscious . " I 've got a room in Boston on Newbury Street , " he said . " Where I can get away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a piano in there where I can practice . It 's rather nice . You must come in some time and see it and I 'll play for you . " " I 'd love to . " It was at that moment that Minnie May came in in a flurry from her trip to town . She had picked up the Brats at the house where they had beenp237playing , and all of them burst into the living-room laughing , talking , rushing around . Betsy introduced Oren to Minnie May . Jane and Glory stared at him for a moment and then began edging closer to him , still staring , and grinning . How was he going to like this , Betsy thought ; for the first time feeling uncertainty about her wonderful family . He was used to things so different from this , beautiful , strange women , great houses , butlers ... . But everything seemed to be all right . Everything was fine . Oren was sitting on a chair playing the banjo very fast and loud and the Brats were hanging over watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May , who was laughing and chattering back . He seemed to love it . Betsy slowly relaxed inside . Oren 's face had lightened from its melancholy and he kept laughing at things Minnie May said , and acting pleased and excited and much more like other boys . How wonderful Minnie May was ! She was n't stricken speechless by this strange young man . She took him in her stride , as she did everything else . " Now , you must stay to supper , " she said . " May I ? " Oren murmured with one of his shy smiles . " You 've got to . You do n't look as if you ate enough , either , " Minnie May said vigorously . He smiled again at her , and Betsy felt as if she could not bear it , he was so wonderful , so enchanting . She went out with Minnie May to get the supper and heard Oren singing in his husky voice to the Brats , the low , nervous thrum of his banjo behind it .. . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her personal pride .. . " Is n't he wonderful ? " she asked Minnie May breathlessly . Minnie May was slicing bread . The ham was on a platter ready to go into the diningroom . " Right nice . Right pathetic . Does n't look like he ever had the proper care . Nobody to keep him in order . So he 's The One , " she said , smiling at Betsy . " Oh , Ma'am , I 'm crazy about him . He 's so wonderful , I mean different . All his family and everything , in New York . His roommate told me he 'd inherit millions . I 'm so afraid he wo n't like me . " " Betsy , do n't be stupid . You 're a Green , child . Take a lot to beat that . And money ! You ought to know better than to talk like that . I think he 's a right nice boy . I wish Maizie had ever got a chance with somebody like that instead of . . . " She sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised and delighted and like a child during supper , fetchingand carrying at Minnie May 's orders and doing tap steps under the table , which delighted the children . In the middle of supper Tom came in from town and Oren was introduced . " Good evening , sir , " Oren said in his husky New York voice . " ' Evenin ' , " Tom said in his tired voice , looking at him uncertainly . Oren stayed late . It was midnight when he said he must go . Betsy drew along breath . It was awful to have him go , but it was a relief too . The strain of the adoration and wonder she felt , the eagerness and the tongue-tied feeling , were terrible . " How you going back to Cambridge , boy ? " Minnie May demanded . " I guess the same way I got out , on a street car , " he said . " Street cars stop running from here at eleven , " Tom said . " Well , I can walk . " " Walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll call up and get you a taxi . " Oren smiled , one-sidedly , ingratiatingly . " You 'll have to lend me some money , then , I 'm afraid . I have n't got but fifty cents . " Tom reached in his inside pocket and took out his bill fold and drew out a ten , dollar bill and handed it to Oren . Betsy saw him to the door , when the taxi came . Ile ran down the steps without looking back , that tall , narrow figure with its fidgety feet , and jumped into the cab . Betsy closed the door and came back into the living-room . Minnie May was turning out lights . " I never thought , " Tom said , " that I 'd be lending money to anybody named Garth . It 's right funny , come to think of it . " He smiled at his wife across the room , and stuck his hands into his trousers pockets ; tall , rangy , his bullet-head turning gray , his face simple and with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oren and Peter almost every night . They would go to some place where there was music ; to strange downtown places where Betsy had never been before , with tough customers and a down-at-heels air , the St. Regis and the American House below Scollay Square . They sat in a booth and drank orangeades into which Peter put a spike from a bottle of gin that he carried in his pocket . They danced with Betsy by turns , and with Peter it was smooth and rhythmic and with Oren it was inspired . Oren knew all the men in all the orchestras and he would stop and talk to them , not as the college boys Betsy knew did , but seriously ; about music ; on a basis of equality . Sometimes when the music stopped and Oren and Betsy would be standing in the middle of the floor , he would break suddenly into a wild short burst of tap , and one of the men in the orchestra would grin at him and improvise a short strip on his instrument to accompany him . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Oren . Peter looked at him all the time too . She had the feeling that they were both adoring him , both taking care of him , and that he was wild and beyond either of them . Every night she knew more that she was terribly , finally in love with him , but not in any way that was solid or secure , for he never said anything to her about love . He called her baby , and they had these threecornereddates nearly every night , but it was as if she gave him something he needed and he had drawn her into his orbit , along with Peter . She wondered whether she would ever be able to make him fall in love with her.  |p239He  filled the centre of the stage and she and Peter revolved around him and she felt that although he needed both of them he hardly noticed them . Sittingat the table he would suddenly begin to beat out a meter , with his fingers , looking around the room with his narrow blue eyes , a melancholy smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of whatever place they had been and get into the car , Peter 's car , a tiny old green Italian Bugatti . " Button your coat up , Oren , " Peter would say in a worried voice . " It 's cold as hell . You ca n't go around with your coat flapping like that . " Oren would sling himself behind the wheel of Peter 's car and Peter and Betsy would slide in beside him . The motor made a deafening roar in the dark silence of the downtown streets . They tore through the empty city and out under the cold stars toward Hampton . The three of them were always together . Except for that first time , Oren brought Peter with him when he came out to the Jekylls . Peter was smooth and neat , with his dark , freckled face , the jaw thrust out ; he was extremely polite to Minnie May and to Tom , and carried food in from the pantry , and joked with the children , and absolutely fitted in . But it was Oren @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wild as a buck . He spoke abruptly or not at all , but it wa i he whom everybody adored , Brats and Minnie May and all . Everybody felt the instinct to take care of him . Betsy ached with love and longing to hold his restless hands in hers , to pull his head down to her cheek . Often he looked thin and white , and it would turn out that he had forgotten to eat all day . It came as a great shock when the Christmas vacation began . Oren and Peter were going home to New York ; they were driving down in the Bugatti . Betsy and Oren sat on the circular window-seat in the living-room the night before they left . Peter sat at the old piano , playing in his neat , civilized way . The dance tune he played sounded orderly and pleasant , like Peter himself . Sweet child . . . you 're driving me wild ; I 'm putting it mild . . . sweet child . . . I 'm wild about you ! Say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . Then say it again . . . sweet child ... . Betsy was tense and concentrated on the expressions that slid over Oren 's eyes and mouth . He sat staring ahead of him ; his strong , long fingers beat time on the windowsill beside him . Sometimes he would smile at something inside his mind , but his face was in the main melancholy and restless . He never seemed to feel the need to talk . Suddenly he spoke . " You ought to come over to New York during the holidays , " he said . " We 'd take you to some parties . I 'm going to miss you . " " I 'm going to miss you ! " Betsy cried . He turned his sweet and sidewise smile upon her . " Sweet baby , " he said in his husky voice . " You better come over . Try to , will you ? "  | " Yes , I will . I will , " she said . " God ! " he cried , jumping up with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop that ? " Peter slid off the piano stool , smiling . Oren dropped down and began to play in his strange , untethered way . He pulled the tune all to pieces and put it together again . Peter came over and sat down beside Betsy . " Make him wear enough clothes driving down tomorrow , " she said , in a low voice . " It 's getting so cold . " " I 'm going to do my best , " he said , and their eyes met and smiled . As suddenly as he had gone to the piano Oren got up and walked away from it . " God , " he said . " I 'm so terribly , terrible lousy . God , I 'll never be any good . " " You were going to town on that tune , Oren , " Peter said . " That ! Jazz . God ! Make me work , will you , Peter ? Or I 'll never be any good . " " You have n't been in to the room enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They always spoke of the room . ' Betsy had never yet seen it . Now , as if in fury and irritation , Oren broke into a tap step in the middle of the room , his whole body liquid and mechanically accurate . After a second he stopped and stood still . He smiled across at Betsy and Peter on the window-seat ; his sudden , sweet , crooked smile that stole the heart out of Betsy 's body . Minnie May was all for taking a trip to New York . " I 'd love to , honey , " she declared . " We 'll have a real good time . We 'll go to a good hotel and enjoy luxury . " So they went . They took the one o'clock train from Boston , and lunched on the train , and Betsy felt the excitement and glamour coming on : the busy , rich-looking people lunching around her , the atmosphere of everybodygoing to New York . In New York they drove in a taxi through the early darkness to the hotel . Minnie May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The place smelt of expensive perfume , and of flowers from the florist 's shop ; beautiful women in furs were hurrying through the lobby , and well-dressed men , and there was string music playing at one end where people were finishing tea . Waiters hurried through in white coats , and bellboys , and on the desk stood vases of roses . They took a room , and it cost ten dollars a day . A bellboy carried their bags up in the elevator . Their room was square ; it had rose-colored covers on the twin beds , and low , comfortable little armchairs , and a dressing table with a triple mirror . Betsy went over to the window and looked out . Below on Park Avenue the cars moved and stopped , moved and stopped , their lights like diamonds in the early evening ; the red and green lights went on and off , like jewels too . Across Park Avenue there were lights in the apartment houses . Betsy drew a long , quivering breath . " Are n't you going to call the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minniep241May said . She lay on the rose-colored chaise longue , smoking a cigarette . " My , I love luxury , " she said . " I have n't been at a hotel for years . I 'd forgottenhow I love it . " Betsy curled up on a bed . She reached for the telephone book and began leafing through it to the G 's . " Garth , Mortimer . " There were three numberslisted , office , residence , and garage . Betsy 's heart was pounding as she picked up the telephone and asked for the residence number . A man 's voice answered the telephone  --  the butler 's  --  and she asked for Mr. Oren Garth . " Yes , madam . Will you hold on , madam ? " In a minute Oren 's voice was on the other end . " Hello , baby , " he said . " God , I 'm glad you could make it . " " It 's wonderful to be here , " she said . " Your mother bring you ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and his voice trailed off in its characteristic way . There was a silence . It was agonizing . " Well , " Betsy said . " I just wanted to let you know I 'd come over . " " Yeah . What time shall I come ? " " What ? " " Oh . This aunt of mine 's giving some sort of party tonight . It wo n't be any good . I have to go . We wo n't have to stay long . We can go dancing somewhere else , or something . It 'll be horrible . Do you mind ? My aunt 's Mrs. Horatio Starr , she 's an awful woman . " " Oh ! " Mrs. Horatio Starr was a name like New York itself . " Suppose I pick you up at ten , " he said . " All right . " " So long , baby . " Betsy lay flat on her back for a moment , and then jumped up and began to unpack her bag , shaking out the evening dresses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the song that so often now ran through her mind for hours ... . O.G . . . . I 'm mighty blue for you , I 've . . . been mighty true . . . to you ... . Minnie May lay on the chaise longue in a cloud of blue smoke . " Let 's have a marvellous dinner , " she said . " Let 's spend all our moneyquick and enjoy ourselves . Let 's go out and buy some clothes tomorrow . " It was all like a dream of glamour . Oren came at eleven . Betsy could never remember that he was always late and count on it . She had been dressed for an hour and a half and sitting in their room rigid with tension waiting for the desk to ring up and say that Mr. Garth was waiting . She wore the red dress that she had worn for her party ; she felt that it brought her good luck . At last the telephone rang and the words that Betsy had been hearing in her head were actually spoken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lobby and they went out onto the sidewalk . Thep242New York air was high and rare , and long dark cars swept past ; people came hurrying into the hotel in evening dress , and the atmosphere was purest magic . Oren had Peter 's Bugatti at the curb , and they climbed into the little front seat . The engine started with a roar . " Oh , I adore New York so ! " Betsy cried . " It 's the only place , " Oren said . " It 's got everything . " Not knowing the city she was confused as to where they went , but it was not far . They drew up in front of an . enormous brownstone house on what Betsy knew was Fifrh Avenue ; there were lighted windows of great shops all up and down the street . A red carpet was laid down a broad flight of steps and across the sidewalk . A footman ran down and pulled open the door of the Bugatti . Betsy got out . Behind the Bugatti other cars , great limousines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glimpse of white shirtfronts and jewels within . " Stick this somewhere , will you ? " Oren said to the footman . " Yes , Mr. Garth . " They went up the red carpet and through the huge glass door which was opened for them , into a marble hall with palms standing in pots . There seemed to be dozens of footmen . One of them indicated to Betsy where to leave her wrap . She went into the dressing-room . It was filled with women , young ones both plain and pretty , and older ones . Betsy peered anxiously at herself in the mirror . She thought she looked rather well . She had more snap to her than most of the girls in the room . Her head looked like a boy 's , and her slim figure was as straight as a boy 's in the tubular red dress . She smiled at herself in the mirror : a melancholy smile , that tipped up only one side of her mouth . It was her new smile . She had a long ostrich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and cast a backwards glance at herself . Oren was waiting in the hall . They went into a circular room where dark paintings were hung on the walls . They stood in line , and came at last to their hostess , whose photograph Betsy had seen many times in rotogravure sections , in fashion magazines and on society pages  --  Mrs. Horatio Starr . She was an old woman , in a blazing silver dress , with a wide silver bandeau holding her white hair ; her shoulders were powdered , soft and plump ; around her neck were blazing stones ; Betsy realized that she was looking at a diamond necklace . Shc shook Mrs. Starr 's hand . " Oren , " Mrs. Starr said , " it 's about time you came to one of my parties . Where 's your father ? " " They went down to Palm Beach yesterday . " " Did n't tell me . I low are you , dear ? Harvard . . . . Nice to see you .. . Miss Jerkkblf . " Her head turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were dancing . Oren and Betsy went in and began to dance too . It was a funny kind of a party . There was no stagline . A few men stood gathered in the doorway , but they did not do any cutting in . The orchestra , although this was New York , was staid and played strictly on beat . Oren paid no attention to the orchestra men . The walls of this room , too , were hung with paintings  --  misty landscapes with a greatp243many olive green leaves and blue-green distances . Betsy spoke of them to Oren . " Those are the old boy 's Corots , " he said . " General Horatio 's Corots . God ! " He executed a difficult bit with his feet and Betsy followed easily . They were outstanding on that floor , she thought . The house , the footmen , the atmosphere were impressive , but the other women were not impressive , they were merely rich . They did not look as though they were vamping anybody . They had no pep . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family butlers , of Newport villas , of all the things you read about in the society pages . The hostess came in and began to circle the floor slowly within the embrace of an old gentleman with a bay-window . " I 'm actually looking at Mrs. Horatio Starr , " Betsy thought . It was as if she were looking at the Taj Mahal , only much more so , for the Taj Mahal was on view to the public . They danced , and had some champagne , and danced again . Nobody asked to be introduced . But then , there were no ushers , as at Boston dances . And anyway , this was all different . It did n't seem to matter whether you were popular or not . Betsy tipped her head back and chattered animatedly at Oren , making herself the picture . of pep and popularity . He smiled his onesidedsmile at her and hardly spoke . Suddenly he said , " Come on . Let 's get out of this now . " They said goodbye to Mrs. Horatio Starr and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . They got into the Bugatti and the footman slammed the little door after them . " Let 's go up to the family 's , " Oren said . " There wo n't be anyone there : " Betsy 's eyes were enormous like those of a young puppy . They drove up Fifth Avenue , among the colored lights and the low , thrilling hoots of motor horns . Betsy had the feeling that her heart was too big for her body . All her life she had dreamed of glamour , but now glamour was around her . It was more wonderful than anything she had imagined . They drew up in front of an apartment house and a doorman came out and took the Bugatti . They went up in an elevator lined with mirrors , to a floor high in the building . Betsy had always thought of apartments as little places with small rooms . But now Oren opened the door onto a great hall . " Servants all gone to bed , I hope , " he said . They passed through to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corner , rosy and dim . There was a deep sofa before the white stone fireplace and Oren dropped down in it . He held out his arm . " Come sit by Papa , " he said in his husky voice . The room was full of the smell of lilies , tall and white in vases on tables and on the grand piano at the end of the drawing-room . She sat down beside him and he put his arm close around her . Her heart was pounding . He had not kissed her since the first night she had met him . Now he kissed her . His skin felt curious ; tough and a little moist . " I love you so ! " The words . simply came out of her . " Sweet baby , " he murmured . " Do you ? Love you too , baby . "  | " Do you ? Do you really ? " " I really do . Really love my sweet baby . " He kissed her . Then he lifted his head sharply and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stressing the off-beat and moving his head slightly as if he were working out some problem about it in his mind . Then he laughed out loud and bent his head again and kissed her . This room might have been in a dream ; none of it seemed real , the smell of lilies , and far away the sound of the cars passing on Fifth Avenue ; the silence and dimness here . " Oh , darling , " she murmured . " I adore you . All I want is to do things for you . I love you so . I do n't think of anything but you . " He went on kissing her . She did not know how long they stayed there in the mysterious room , kissing on the velvet sofa . " Baby , " he said once , " 1 love you to love me . You do n't know how horrible everything gets . God , my family ! And the kind of life they want me to live . You do n't know anything about what hell can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need you to love me , baby . " " I love you with all my heart . I 'll always love you . " " I hope to God it 's not going to hurt you , " he said in his melancholy voice . " I ca n't stand the idea I might hurt somebody . " " Oh , no ! It makes me happy just to look at you . " " I 'm not an ordinary sort of guy . I 'm always getting in the most awfuljams . " " It 's all right . I love you . Anything you do is all right . " She felt both exalted and humble ; she had the feeling of vocation ; Oren was the beginningand the end , of everything . Of course he was different from everyone else . But he would n't hurt her . ' What might hurt another girl would only exalt her ; anything that was him she wanted . " God , I do n't know . Sometimes I think I 'm going crazy . Love me , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . " " I do  --  love you . I do . I adore you . " She clung to him . " It is n't any fun for anybody who 's near me . I put them through hell . Like poor Peter . I ca n't promise you any fun or any happiness . " " Oh , darling , I have everything just being with you ! " He kissed her rapidly and held her to him . " I guess I might to go , " she said after a long time . " Ma'am might get worried if I stayed out too long . " Oren jumped up . Suddenly he was galvanizes . He began to laugh , his almost hysterical laughter that she never understood but always joined in . He began to dance around the room , on the deep carpet that made no sound . He drew out a long-stemmed lily from one of the vases . They walked out of the front door to the elevator , Oren holding the lily in front of him and laughing . When they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to the elevator man and thrust the lily into his hand . " For purity ! " he cried , laughing harder than ever . Betsy laughed too , eagerly . It was a line from The Green Hat . It sounded glamorous to hearp245Oren say it , but she did not know what he meant nor why he was laughing . They went into the cold , late night . Betsy and Minnie May went back to Boston four days later . Betsy leaned her face against the cold , damp train window and looked out at the snow falling slowly over the New England landscape . She was tired from excitement , from being , up very late every night . But her fatigue exalted her mind into a state where music and the thought of Oren floated like the flakes of snow outside . Close to the train windows the flakes flurried in eddies , but beyond out over the fields they fell in a great peace . " O.G. , I 'm mighty blue for you . . . . " Minnie May had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she looked through them , her yellow , homely monkey 's face alert and curious , and she moved about restlessly and at last got up and walked swaying down the aisle to go into the lounge car to smoke . Betsy felt wonderfullyalone . The early dusk was beginning to tinge the white landscape with blue , and the snow kept falling , slow , slow , over the Connecticut fields . The train stopped at New London . Then it started again and went racketing on over the country , breaking the silent fall of the snow . Something in her seemed to have awakened and she knew with a feeling of predestination that she loved Oren and that she would always love him . The only necessity was that she should always be near him . This was worlds different from crushes ' and yens . ' This enveloped her , calmly , deeply , like the snow covering the fields outside the train . She prayed that she could be worthy of him and good enough for him to want to marry . She would wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any time necessary , but she must have him . It was breathtaking to think of being married to Oren Garth . She would be so good ; so gay ; she would take such care of him ; he would not be able to get along without her . Nobody , she thought with a deep absolute assurance , nobody would ever love Oren as much as she did . Minnie May came staggering back up the aisle . of the lurching train , sat down and grinned at Betsy . The train was slowing for Providence . " Did n't we have a good time ? " Minnie May said . " I had the most wonderful time I 've ever had in my life . " " Certainly do like New York . Got so much going on all the.time . I declare sometimes I wish we lived in New York . Every other place seems tame in comparison . " Betsy stared at her mother with dreaming eyes . Some day she would live in New York . She would live in New York , and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would meet all sorts of wonderful people and she would be quite a different person from the old Betsy Jekyll . The world felt huge and glorious , with snow falling over it and lights shining through the snow and music playing , and , vistas opening beyond and beyond and beyond . All through the world she heard a voice whispering , and singingsoftly . " Wonder how Dad 's been , " Minnie May said . " I hope he has n't got all balled up without me here . Thing I really do worry about is Maizie , though . Everywhere I go I ca n't forget about her . It most ruins things for me . If I could just do something . . . I 'm her mother and I 'm perfectly helpless . She wo n't even tell ' me . . . . " Betsy heard her voice going on . She loved her sister , but there was no room in her for trouble . Even her mother did not seem quite real any more . She lived in a private world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was on the edge of another life ; the old life was half sloughed off . The only reality was the future . AFTER THE New YEAR a great deal of snow fell , and the young men came back from the holidays and began to cram for midyears , at the Widow 's or other tutoring schools in Harvard Square . It was very cold and the snow made high mounds between the street and sidewalks in Boston , so that the street could only be crossed at intervals . Out in the country in Hampton the snow clogged everything and the ruts in the roads were very deep and everyone put chains on . Betsy began in January going in to the room . It was in a brownstone house on Newbury Street . The lower floors had been made over into shops and offices . In the evenings Newbury Street would be very still , the streetlightswinking , the flakes falling quietly down over the city ; beyond ArlingtonStreet lay the Public Gardens and there it was an open stretch of deep snow , with the wooden walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would park the loud Bugatti at the curb . They would go up the dark steps to the unlit vestibule ; it seemed mysterious , like an underworld lodging house . Oren turned the key and they would go into the building , and up one narrow flight ; two flights ; three flights . There was a door toward the front , painted gray , that Oren also unlocked , and then they were in the room . It was a high-ceilinged room of medium size , obviously a one-time bedroomfront the days of the house 's private life ; a door led to a passage with closets , and a bathroom with a hanging , glaring light and gray marble washbasin . Oren had furnished the room out of his allowance to suit his tastes . There was a large Oriental rug on the floor . Heavy dark blue curtains hung at the three long windows overlooking Newbury Street . There was a dark blue velvet cover fitted to the broad couch , and dark blue velvet cushions . The grand piano stood filling much of the room . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Betsy wondered sometimes when she saw that room why it seemed to look like her idea of a haunt of dope fiends . Betsy would stand between the curtains looking out over Newbury Street and the still and orderly city ; behind her Oren played the piano . She felt suspended above the world , shut away in the tower of an enchanted castle . He played Mozart , Bach , Brahms , Chopin , Debussy , and to Betsy , who knew nothing about music , they all sounded like variations on the samep247deep , surging theme  --  the room , and their being together there . The music was part of the loveliest thing that had ever happened to her . She could not help believing that more and more he loved and needed her . For Peter did not come to the room too . It meant that it was she that Oren needed for this most important part of his life . When he was playing music he was bound up in inner processes and urgencies that she did not understand , but still he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark blue , sinister-looking couch , letting the torrents and tricklings of the music flow over her mute mind , letting them become a part of what the room with Oren meant to her . She was always waiting for the time when he would get through playing and it would be he and she together , kissing . There were two ways in which he might stop . If he had been satisfied with his own playing , which was seldom , the notes would trickle clearly like drops falling slower and slower from the edge of a cliff , and stop , and he would be coming toward her , smiling , ready to kiss her and make jokes that she did not understand , and laugh wildly . But if he did not like his music , and generally he did not like it , it broke off sharply and turned into hectic rendering of some piece of jazz , and then that would stop too and she would hear his voice say " God ! " He would look as if he hated everything , as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touching him or trying to be comforting because he hated that ; he hated the air around him . " God ! " he would say . " God ! " The only thing was to try to get him to talk it out , and that way bring him slowly round to where he would begin to make jokes and laugh and burrow his head in her neck . He was taking lessons now , in spite of impending midyears , from a young musician in Boston , for whom Oren had the most tremendous respect . " He 's absolutely contemptuous , " Oren would say . " God , that guy can be contemptuous ! And he 's right . I have n't got a thing . I was ruined years ago . It 's too late . The only thing I 've got to respect in myself is that I will try ; I will try . . . . Fernald knows I 'm a lazy bum , a rich man 's son ; he 's so right . How am I ever going to get anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ international banker . " He laughed hysterically . " Nobody else cares a good God damn what I am . " " I care , " Betsy would say , with the desperate hope that it would make some difference to him . But he sat in silence on the edge of the couch with his hands dropping between his knees , the light from the lamp beside the piano gilding his brown curly hair . " What am I ? " he would begin again . " I 'm a product of a system that 's dead . I 'm an end result of what the capitalist system can really produce when it 's given a chance . God ! I see myself , all the time . I see myself at school in a sweater with a letter on it . I could shoot my lunch . I 'm a Harvard boy , a rich Harvard boy . I 'm Oren Garth . I 've had it rammed into me all my life . I 'll never get away from it . I 'm a Garth and I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Listen , " she said one evening . " I know how you hate Harvard , so whyp248do n't you leave it ? Why do n't you write your father that you want to study music , and then you could just move in here and work hard all the time at it . If you said that was what you were going to do , I do n't see what he could do about it . " " Oh , no , " he said in his melancholy voice . " You do n't know my father . You do n't get the picture . Nobody ever understands .... He 'd cut off my allowance and then how could I live ? He 'd  --  God knows what he 'd do . He 's a terrible man . I think I admire him more than any man alive . Can you understand that ? He 's like God , or the Devil . He does absolutely what he wants , and makes other people obey . Women . He takes women and owns them and takes everything out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you know that my father pays out nearly a million dollars a year in alimony ? " And then Betsy would think of the ex-wife named Elena , that Oren had been in love with . He spoke of her sometimes with a wistful , tortured look . Perhaps he would always be most in love with Elena . But Betsy was willing to fill any niche , however inferior . Perhaps she could be the comforter , the essential presence . . . that was enough ... . " Well , why could n't you get a job and make enough money to support yourself and pay for lessons ? " she asked . " Oh , no . Oh , no . Do n't you see , my hands are tied . They 've been tied since birth . I could n't take a job . I do n't know how to do anything . And then there would n't be enough time to practice , . and it would be bad for my hands . And ca n't you see the papers , God , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those big stories in the Sunday paper over two pages , like about my mother , about how Oren Garth was working in a factory for twelve dollars a week . I 'm lost . I ca n't do anything . I ca n't even have fun . " " It would n't have to be a factory . . . . " He shrugged his shoulders as though it were an anonymous voice that was cross-questioning and heckling him . He spread his hands before him as though he had never seen them , and moved the fingers one by one . They were beautiful hands , strong and nervous with blunt-ended fingers . Suddenlythe movements took rhythm and he was beating out a meter with his fingers on his knees . " Ta-ta , ta-to-da , t t t t-t-clay he cried.aloud , and suddenly his face broke into a gay , child 's smile . " Baby . . . " he sang in a husky voice , a jazz voice , " When my baby , my baby , smiles at me twa twa twa twa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time being himself , always  --  himself . He snatched up the banjo that lay at the foot of the sofa and began to play a fast accompaniment . He kept his eyes fixed steadily on Betsy 's , and sang in that exaggerated style , with a look of ecstasy . " I sigh  --  ah-hah ! I cry  --  ah-hah ! It 's just a bit of heaven , when my baby  --  smiles  --  at me. . . .  --  Is ev'rybody . . . heppy ? " " Honestly , Oren , you ought to go on the stage . You 're terribly good . You 're absolutely professional . Peter says you could any day , and Peter knows all about that kind of thing , " she said . " Poor Peter , " Oren said , dropping the banjo . " I 've ruined his life . I ruinp249everyone 's life . I 'll ruin yours too . You better get away while the going 's good .  --  I could n't go in the theatre . I can see my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried . . . I wanted to go on the Keith Circuit with a sweet little girl who could dance like mad . We would have been good . Gretchen . Sweet Gretchen . She 'll be in the big time before you know it . She came from the West . We used to work out some pretty hot routines together . But then my father heard about it . That 's when I went to St. Jean two years ago , and saw my mother . God , she looked unhappy . " He sat , his eyes brooding , his fingers moving on his knees . Betsy watched him , respecting his grief , burning with jealousy of " sweet Gretchen " ; her head spinning with that incomprehensible , desperate , rich , frustrated world that made Oren so unhappy . " Ah , baby , " he said suddenly in his sweetest voice , and put his arms around her . " Do you know what 's the difference between a cynic and a stoic ? " " What ? " " A cynic 's vere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brings de babies . " He laughed crazily . He pushed her back on the couch and lay beside her , tickling her . " Baby . . . my sweet little virgin .... She was pure as snow , boy , but she drifted . Would n't you drift , just the least little bit , for Papa ? " But this was never even so much as a problem . Betsy had a streak of pugdog obstinacy in her . She knew that she was not going to lose her virginity . She did not think it over , she did not think about it at all . It was as if there was one corner of her that was different from all the rest that loved glamour and intrigue and Michael Arlen atmosphere . The fall of the emerald was one thing , but this was here and now and on the fourth floor of a brownstone house on Newbury Street , and she simply never consideredgiving up her virginity . She was willing to do everything else . She had done nearly everything else for a couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night . She herself had never got much pleasure out of necking , and she did not now . The loveliest moment in her whole life had been when Oren kissed her that night she first met him . And the beginning was always the best part , the first , fresh kisses before things got hot and sticky . She liked neckingless and less as it got further and further . But she had always had a feeling that this was something she must render . It seemed to matter so much to boys . Many of them had told her that it was extremely harmful for a man to stop . . . . It did n't hurt her . With Oren , because she loved him , she had a feeling of happiness in knowing that he was finding what he wanted . But she was happy because he was happy . She was always rather glad when he was through with active necking . There was a feeling that during the last of it she , as a person , was almost forgotten . Later they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pet-names , and play like children . When they left the room it would be late , and they came out into the deserted street and shut the door behind them . The street-lights blinked ,  |p250solemnly  at the white sky . The Bugatti stood beyond the massed ridge of snow at the edge of the shovelled sidewalks . It started with a deafening roar , and shot around the corner to Arlington Street , into Boylston Street , and out into the country toward Hampton . The lights in the houses were out , and the country lay white and still beyond their leaping headlights . Minnie May always called out , softly , as Betsy tiptoed up the stairs to the tower . She would open the door of her parents ' bedroom , softly , and Minnie May would whisper , " Have a good time ? " Tom was always fast asleep . " I had the most wonderful time I ever had ! " Betsy would hiss . It was a kind of formula . " Where 'd you go ? " " Just dancing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Good night , " she would whisper , and then go on up the other flight of stairs to her tower room . She never gave any thought to lying about what she did in the evenings . It was just a necessity . She could n't say where she 'd been . One afternoon in late February , after the lights had been lit in the Jekylls ' nouse , Tom Jekyll got home from the office . They were all sitting around in the big living-room . The Brats were doing homework and sucking lollipopsat the round table at the end . Minnie May was in the most comfortable chair , looking through a fashion magazine , in her customary cloud of smoke . Betsy sat in the window-seat putting silver paint on an old pair of silver slippers ; she had got some of the silver on to the window-seat cushion . The front door opened and swung back and banged against the hall wall . Tom Jekyll walked in . He took hold of the door and slammed it closed again . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all looked at him . Was he drunk ? He had never been drunk in the afternoon on days when he went to the office . His pugdogface was set . He did not take off his hat or coat . His hands were in his trousers pockets , and there was the sound of money sharply jingling . " You , " he said , jerking his head at the Brats . " You children get upstairs and stay there . " Jane and ( dory edged out of the room to the stairs , staring at him . Tom Jekyll stood without speaking , jingling his money , until the sound of the children 's feet going upstairs had ceased . " Torn , honey , what in the name of . . . " " I 'm goin ' to talk , " he said . " You all keep still till I get through . I put up with a lot . I put up with this God damned place and these God damned Yankees , trash goin ' through my house night and day . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to put up with , by God . I 'm not going to have my daughter a common prostitute . I 'm not going to have a common Yankee bastard on a train telling me my daughter is a prostitute and laughing at me , the Yankee bastard .... " Minnie May glanced sharply at Betsy and back at her husband.  | " Honey , you 're so mad you do n't talk sense . Try not to be so mad . Calm down and say exactly what 's happened . " " I will get mad , " he said . " I 'm going to get so God damned mad something'llhappen round here to make things different . Get mad ! Nobody gets mad up here , that 's just what 's the matter , those God damned , pawky , smooth-talking bastards that never get mad . What this place needs is for somebody to get mad . Maybe if I 'd been man enough to get mad long ago I would n't be standing here looking at my daughter who 's a common prostituteand my wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married to the God damnedest son-of-a-bitch in God 's creation , and my children grow up in this God damned place along with these God damned Yankees , so they 'll be prostitutes too , and bastards 'll get hold of them and all the time those bastards , those Yankees , standing there laughing . Never getting mad at anything , just standing there laughing . . . . All right , I 'll tell you . " I get on the train tonight to come on home after work . There 's nobody on that train but a lot of stuffed Yankee frozen-faced bastards , and generally I say to hell with them and read my paper . Tonight one of them comes up and says can he sit down , so I say sure and move over to give him room . But he wants to talk . He wants to tell me something , he says , that he thinks I ought to know . " Tom 's voice went up into a bitter imitation of a Boston accent . " He 's a member of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newbury Street , right next to some houses . And in one of these houses , he says he happens to know that young Garth , the son of Mortimer Garth of New York , he says , has an apartment . He does n't know what he has it for , he says , since he 's going to Harvard out in Cambridge , but he supposes , he says , for the usual thing . Young men , he says . And sitting in his God damned son-of-a-bitch Copley Club he says he has often seen young Garth coming out with a young girl , late at night . Very late at night , he says , oh , two or three . And the thing I ought to know , he says , is that the young girl is my daughter . " He hopes I 'll understand his motive in telling me , he says . He says he took an unpleasant duty upon himself to tell me because he was sure I 'd want to know . And then he looks at me . Jesus Christ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at you ! Figuring out how I 'm taking it . Figuring how his own daughters would n't do such a thing . Laughing at me . And looking at me . Me sitting there in the seat with my pants down before a Yankee . What the hell could I say ? What did I know ? I told him thank him for his interest in my business . He said he was sorry if I wanted to take it that way , that he thought fathers ought to know what their daughters were up to . I said thank you very much , Sir , again , and acted like I was reading the paper . " " That was n't the way to act to him , " Minnie May said . She looked concentrated , abstracted . " I know . I know . I do n't know how the hell to act to a Yankee . You should have been there . You can do everything . Well , you can have every last Yankee in Yankeeland and act to them like you please as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know I did n't act right . I 'm not a God damned Green . I 'm just a country boy and I do n't know how to behave , and I do n't get along with Yankees and I 'm nothing much . But I do know a couple of things . All right . " First . Betsy , have you got anything to say about this ? Have you been going to Garth 's room , or have n't you ? " " Yes , I have , " she said slowly . If somebody had seen her , there was n't any point in trying to lie . Besides , for the first time in her life she felt frightened of her father . " Only you do n't understand . What we did was different from what you think . . . . " " I do n't want to know what you did . If I know any more than I know now I 'll vomit . Now you look here . " " Yes , sir , " she said . Years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was going to tell her what her punishment would be , he would say , " Now you look here , " and she would say , " Yes , sir . " Then he would take her across his thigh and spank her hard . But that had n't happenedvery many times ; not in the Jekyll family . " We 're going to get out of this God damned place , hear ? Right away . We 're going to get out just as soon as I can get someone to take over my work at the office . We 're going back down where we belong , where we should have gone long ago . We 're going back to Annestown so quick you ca n't count it , and we 're not coming back . We 're going to live down there where we should have been living all the time . I hate this place , do you hear ? " he cried to his wife and his daughter . " I 've always hated it . Life 's not worth the living up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't got peace and your daughters are out prostituting themselves with Yankee bastards . I want to get out , and I 'm going to get out , and you all are coming too , and we 're going home . " But first I 'm going to have a talk with this young Garth man of yours . I 'm going to tell him what a Southerner has to say about Yankees . I 'm going to tell him enough so he 'll keep his hands off a daughter of the South next time he 's looking for a fancy woman . I 'm not going to make him marry you . 1 ca n't stand another Yankee son-of-a-bitch in this family . Maybe I ought to . But I wo n't . If you want to get married you can marry some decent Southern boy  --  if any of them ' ! ! marry you being what you are . " " Tom , you 're talking crazy , " Minnie May said firmly . She looked ready to take the situation in hand . " Betsy , go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up later after I 've talked to your father . Go on , now . " Betsy got up and went out of the room and up the stairs . Her heart was thumping heavily . Out of the tail of her eye she saw her father slump down into a chair facing Minnie May , and let his head drop back against the upholstery . He had stopped talking . As she went upstairs Betsy heard her mother 's voice going on , steadily , intensely . She was lying flat on her face on the bed when she heard her mother 's footsteps coming into the room . It was entirely dark . She turned over quickly and switched on the light.  | " Ma'am , I ca n't go away , I do n't want to go away , Ma'am , I 'm in love , I 'm so in love .... " " Now hush . " Minnie May sat down on a chair . " You let me talk for a while . You 've been a sillier girl than I thought any daughter of mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that later . " We 're not going away . Your father is half crazy with the humiliation you 've put him to , the having a man he hardly knows come up to him and tell him a thing like that . . . . I do n't want to leave Hampton any more than you do , and we 're not going to . He sees that now . He 'll see it better in the morning , when I can talk to him some more . Poor Dad . You 've done a dreadful thing to your father , Betsy ; I 've never seen him like this before in his life . I hope he can get good and drunk and feel a little better . " We 're not going away . I 've got him to agree to that . I 'm not going back down to Annestown and moulder away , and that 's all there is to it . We 're just beginning to get started up here , because it does take a right long time in the North before they realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it 's on condition . That 's no more than fair . You 've been a silly , silly girl , and a fool , and you 've got to expect to pay for it . " " What ? " " You 've got to promise me solemnly that you wo n't see this boy , Oren , again , ever . Your father makes that an absolute condition . He 's going to see him tomorrow  --  he 's talked to him on the telephone already and he 's coming to your father 's office  --  and he 's going to get him to give his solemn promise too . That 's the conditions on which we can stay here and not have to go on back to Annestown . Your father does handle the money , you know . Reckon in the last analysis it 's him that can decide . And I 've never seen him this way . He means what he says . And do n't forget you 've brought it on yourself . And all of us . " " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ca n't see him again ever ? I 'm in love with him  --  I want to marry him . . . . " Betsy threw herself around on the bed . " He ask you to marry him ? " " No . No , not yet , but he 's in college , Ma'am ; he ca n't ; how could he ? " Suddenly Betsy sat up straight . " Ma'am , what Dad said about me is not true . I never did . . . honestly . I never have . " " I did n't think you had , " Minnie May retorted . " Now look here to me . Dad 's had an awful shock . He 's got ideals about his daughters  --  men have . It does n't take the top off my head that you 've been to a man 's room , but I know it does n't have to mean what he means . And it does take the top off Dad 's head . Now look here to me . Dad 's going to see to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in any case . You can make up your mind to that . You 're not going to be allowed to see him . It 's a question of whether you want us all to have to go on back down home with our tails between our legs and be buried for the rest of our lives in that poky old town . Or whether you 've got enough sense to see that if we stay up here everything 'll keep happening , and you 'll meet a lot of other interesting men , and Jane and Glory will have a chance . To say nothing of me . Maizie and Dad 's the only ones who have any homesickness for Annestown and I 'm sure I do n't understand why . Poor darlin ' Maizie , I suppose anything would have been better for her than what she got . But Dad  --  I can just see him if he 'd stayed down there in a two-by-four office on Courthouse Square . You do n't want to go back to Annestown , do you ? " " No , " Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me your promise you wo n't see Oren again , and I 'll tell your father you have , and pretty soon this will blow over and your father will forget about it and everything will be all right . " " I feel as if I 'd die if I could n't ever see him again . It 's giving up my whole life . " " Well , you 're not going to get to sec him anyway , either way . You might think of the rest of us . " " All right . All right . " " You promise ? " " Yes , 1 promise . " Minnie May got up briskly . " That 's sensible . I 'll go and tell your father , and try and get him to calm down . " " Ma'am ! " " What ? " " I 'm so terribly unhappy .... " " Well , Betsy , you deserve to be unhappy . You 've certainly been a silly girl . You 've made your father plenty unhappy , I can tell you that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your head . Southern men , anyway , have ideals about their women . More ideals than you could shake a stick at . There is n't anything a woman does that they have n't got an ideal about . I do n't know about Northern men . But Southern men do n't want to know about what you may be feeling really or your reasons for things . They just want you to be ideal . I would have thought you 'd know that . " " Ma'am , do you hate me ? " " Of course I do n't hate you . I 'm amazed at how little sense you 've got . I reckon practically any girl on earth knows better than to let herself be seen going to a man 's apartment . That 's just sense . You ca n't imagine any Boston girl doing such a thing . Leda March . You ca n't imagine her . " " I 'm so unhappy . I feel as if you hated me . " " No , I do n't , but I hope you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted Betsy briefly on the shoulder . " You 'll get over it . Plenty of other boys , goodness knows . " She went out , and Betsy reached up and switched off the light again . She lay there quite still in the darkness , staring at a star that had appeared in the window . She felt so empty , so bereft , that she could not yet begin to cry . She did not know where to begin thinking about what had happened to her . She wished there were someone in the whole world who could understand and sympathize . But her mother did not sympathize.  --  She would have sympathized with Maizie , Betsy thought , in one of the stabs of inferiority . But Maizie would not have done it.  |p255But  Maizie would be able to understand about doing it  --  would n't she ? There was no romance left any more in the tower room . It was just a room . Betsy lay on the bed and big , heavy tears began to roll down her face . Oh , Oren , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face again ... . Two days later Betsy went to see Maizie in town , in the afternoon . It was awful at home . Her father would not speak to her , and her mother seemed irritated and impatient , and the Brats knew perfectly well that something was the matter and that Betsy had done something wicked . The idea of the meeting between Oren and her father haunted her mind , and she had the most strange and differing pictures of what the interview could have been like . Her father shouting at Oren as he had shouted at Betsy . . . . Oren championing her innocence and  --  perhaps ?  --  asking for her hand in marriage . . . . She did not dare to ask her father anything about it . She asked her mother , the following morning , and Minnie May said merely that Oren had given Tom his promise not to see Betsy again . She felt she would die if she could not tell someone the way she felt about Oren . ' The thought of Maizie had seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rudds lived in an apartment at the back of Beacon Hill . A middle-aged , slatternly Irish maid opened the door to Betsy 's ring and eyed her . " Yeah , she 's in , " the maid allowed . " She 's been in bed all day . They was out to a pahty late last night . You can cmin . " Betsy went in to Maizie 's bedroom . Maizie lay on one side of the very large double bed , in a nightgown and an old pink crocheted bedjacket . She just lay there ; there were no books or papers around her . Her face was white and slack ; deadly tired . Her brilliant yellow hair lay uncombed on the pillow behind her . A lamp was turned on beside the bed , and the Venetian blinds of the windows were slanted shut , although it was three o'clock in the afternoon and the sun was bright outside . An evening dress and underclothes lay across the back of a chair , with slippers kicked at angles underneath it . A pair of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another chair . Maizie had been smoking all day , for the air smelled dead and smoky ; there was a pile of butts on the table beside the bed . A tray that might have held lunch and was now a confusion of dirty dishes had been pushed down to the foot of the bed . " Maizie ! You sick ? " Maizie smiled ; her stiff face broke at the mouth . " No , just restin ' , " she said . " We were out late last night and we did n't get to sleep till the sun was up . I 'm getting rested for when Lamb gets home tonight , " she said , and the smile went away and the anxious leaden look came back . Betsy put the evening trousers on the same chair with the dress and sat down.  | " How 's Lambert ? " " Oh , he 's fine . He 's fine . . . . He 's doing a portrait , did you know it , of your old friend Leda March .... " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are you getting along all right with him , Maizie ? And everything ? " " Yes , " Maizie said . " We 're terribly happy , terribly happy . . . . I love him terribly , Betsy . I love him with my whole soul . " Betsy stared at her sister . She did not look happy . She looked wretched . What was it ? . . . The voice she talked in , the things she said ... . " Maizie , you look so tired I hate to bother you , but I wanted to talk to you so much .... I 'm in the most awful trouble . . . . I just wanted to tell somebody about it , nobody understands .... " Maizie sat up part way on one elbow and looked at Betsy and nodded . " Dad wo n't speak to me . Ma'am 's furious . It 's because I went to a boy 's room on Newbury Street , and somebody saw us coining out . . . . But it 's not what I ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just terribly in love with him , that 's all , and now they 've made me promise I 'll never see him again , never , never . " Betsy stared at Maizie with stricken eyes . " Yes , " Maizie said vaguely . " Ma'am told me about it over the telephone when she called me this morning .... " " She did ? Did she tell you Dad was so furious , he wanted us all to pack up and go home to Annestown ? " " No ! " Maizie sat up straight , her eyes suddenly bright . " She did n't tell me that ! Annestown ! When are you going ? Oh , you 'll all go home to Annestownand leave me here in the North and I 'll die here .... " " No , no , we 're not going , it was just Dad wanted to .... " " And you do n't want to ? " " No , I do n't want to go down there . " Maizie shook the tangled hair away from her face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're unhappy , are n't you , and you wanted to talk to me about it , and I love you , Betsy ; you 're my sister and I 'd like to have you happy and not go through torment . Go back to Annestown , go on , go . Everything that 's terrible comes because of this place up here . Go on back down South where you can be happy . You can rest there , and nothing ever frightens you . It 's not like this . Do you see how I keep the blinds drawn down like this in the daytime ? " Maizie asked . Betsy nodded . " It 's because I ca n't bear to look out and see this place when I look out of the window . I keep the curtains drawn so I ca n't see . The buildings look like bare bones there in the cold wind . Oh Betsy ! " she cried , and tears began to fall down her exhausted face . " I know you think I sound perfectly crazy , and maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the North . I ca n't bear it . I ca n't bear it ! I can feel it killing me . You say I look tired . It 's just this place . If I was at home I would get well . But never , never . . . . You know , " she said , and her voice sank to a whisper , and she looked quickly at the door as if she were afraid someone might be standing there , " when I was in South America when I was first married I had some trouble with my insides . I had an operation , Betsy . And it was so queer and awful down there that thingsp257went wrong , I did n't get well . . . . One of my tubes  --  Fallopian tubes  --  got enlarged , and it used to burn and burn , all night . They say it 's all well now , but it is n't . I feel it burning . I feel it right now , burning . " " Why do n't you go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to doctors all the time . I 've been to five different doctors this winter . Lamb hates me because I go to so many doctors  --  no he does n't ; Betsy , do n't pay any attention to that , please ; I did n't mean it . Lamb wants me to be well and strong , and I will be . I 'm going to get very strong and be able to stay up all night . . . . But I 'm just telling you , in private , about that burning . Do n't tell anyone I complained , will you ? Do n't tell Ma'am . . . . She 's so impetuous , she might tell Lamb I 'd complained . Doctorsdo n't do any good . It 's too much for them . They ca n't find what it is . I 've had every kind of test there is , I keep having tests and they ca n't find out why I have that burning and they ca n't find out why I feel so sick ... . I 've got bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't strong enough . Up North everybody is so strong ; they take exercises and they never get tired at night . Southerners are weak . You 'll find you 'll be weak too , like me . You 'd better go on down home while you can , Betsy . Then you can do things and it wo n't be too much for you . " Betsy was squinting in her effort to understand . " He does n't treat you right , does he ? " she said . " He does n't take good care of you . " " Oh , yes ! Oh yes he does ! Betsy , do n't think that for a minute . He 's the wisest , greatest man in the world . I worship him , do you know that , 1 worshiphim . It 's me that 's wrong , I 'm weak , I get tired too easily , I have n't anyintelligence .... Oh , no , it is n't his fault . It 's the fault of this place , " she whispered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make him take you away from here if you hate it so . He could n't want you to be living in a place that you were wretched in . If that 's all it is , " Betsy said , drawing a breath , " why do n't you just get him to live somewhere else where you like it ? Annestown . He does n't have to live in Boston , does he ? He has n't any business . He can paint anywhere . " " Oh , no , no , no . You do n't understand . You do n't understand what it is to be really married . You want to submit to your husband in all ways . You want to worship him . You do n't ask for things . You do n't want your own way . You live for him to get what he wants . I would n't ask him for anything for me . He would be angry  --  no he would n't , Betsy , I did n't mean that ; but I only want to obey him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many wives who do that much for their husbands . " " No . There 're not . Most women do n't understand marriage . Most women are bitches . Lamb says they are bitches . They do n't understand about obey-ing . " Betsy stared at Maizie , and they were both still . " Maizie , " Betsy said , feeling awkward about changing the subject , " what am I going to do about Oren ? The boy , I mean ? You see , I really am terrifically in love  --  I mean , of course , I know it 's not what you mean , but , gee , it certainly feels like a lot to me , Maizie . What 'm I going to do ? I want to marry him ! And I know he would have asked me . But he 's still in college . Do you suppose he would be true to me and wait until he could ask me .. . only I do n't believe that could happen . . . oh dear . . . . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Maizie said . Her head was back in the pillows and her eyes were shut . " You do n't know what love is until you have given yourself , utterly , and you belong every pore of your being to a man . " " Well , I know , but I could n't do that , nobody would want me to do that until I was married . You should have heard Dad . Ile thinks I did do it . But I love him all 1 can , with everything I 've got . " " You do n't know what love is , " Maizie said again . " Nobody knows what love is till they have given their whole selves away . " Betsy felt frustrated and helpless . There was nothing she could say . It was not at all the way she had thought it would be . Maizie had changed so . Five years ago she would have understood all about it . " I guess I better go and let you rest , " she said , hesitantly . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat up . " What time is it ? Five ? I 've got to get up . I should have gotten up half an hour ago . Why did n't you tell me ? Lord , I 'll have to hurry .... I 'm a wreck . . . . " She leapt out of bed , and snatching a brush from the top of the littered bureau , began to brush her hair with long , vigorous strokes . " Do you think my hair 's got darker , Bets ? " " No . It looks beautiful . " " Here , hand me that jar . I want to slather cold cream on my face while I finish brushing , it sinks in . . . . Throw me my mules , will you ? My feet are freezing . No circulation . I 've lost five pounds in the last three months , do you think it 's becoming ? " The change in Maizie was bewildering . Betsy felt a little hurt . Maizie had shown practically no interest in Betsy 's affairs , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her own concerns . But the change in her in the last few minutes was at least reassuring . She seemed normal now , she talked quite reasonably ; not like that frightening murmur that had come from the bed . Very likely she had been half asleep , to talk that way . She looked much better now that she was up . Her eyes sparkled , her skin looked more alive . It must mean that she needed to make a little effort , to pull herself together . Now she was hurrying around the room like any girl getting dressed in a rush . Betsy felt in the way . " Goodbye , Maizie , " she said . " I hope you 'll feel better . " " Oh , goodbye ! " Maizie smiled and sparkled through the mesh of her hair . Betsy went to the door . " Wait a minute , Bets . . . . Do n't pay any attention to anything I said this afternoon , will you ? " The look of strain was back on Maizie 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You did n't think I sounded disloyal to Lamb , did you ? Did you ? " " I thought you sounded terrifically loyal . Goodness ... "  | " All right . That 's all I meant . Just I would n't want anyone to misunderstandwhen I sometimes feel rotten . Lamb is a wonderful husband . He 's perfect . " Betsy smiled at Maizie . There was nothing to say . She wished she could get back to the old love between them . She thought , I 've lost her . She 's been lost for a long time . I have n't got my sister any more . She went down the narrow dark passage and let herself out of the front door and went away . The days of early March were loud and windy . Sam called up , Old Faithful , and asked as usual for a date and sounded almost incoherent when Betsy said he could come round in the evening . They stayed in the living room . Tom and Minnie May were in the study . The Brats had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his Boston accent ; he was such a fool in his brown tweed suit and his brown shoes , with his big brown eyes and his serious expression . Betsy was torn between irritation and an almost pleasant melancholy ; romantic , bereft . She sang under her breath while Sam talked ; not listening to what he said . " O.G .  --  I 'm mighty blue . . . for you , I 've .. . been mighty true . . . to you . . . . " Suddenly she wanted to cry . It was n't romantic at all . It was true . She got up and stood in front of the fireplace , leaning against the mantel . " I 've .. . been mighty true . . . to you ... " she sang softly , wretchedly . How true she had been ! She would love Oren all her life ; she could carry him in her heart , as Iris March had Napier , and the things she did , the hearts she broke , would mean nothing to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a crooked smile . Sam came and stood looking down at her with his large brown eyes . " Gosh , I 've loved you a long time , Bets , " he said . " Is n't there any chance for me ? " She smiled at him , bitterly , putting a provocative look into her eyes . " Can I kiss you ? " he said in a low voice . " I have n't kissed you for such a long time . " She did not move . He leaned forward and kissed her gently on the lips . " Gosh , I love you , " he said . She still smiled at him , mysteriously . She was probably ruining his life , she thought . It was always the one you could n't get that you loved ... . Her life had been ruined , and she was here , unhappy , without a heart , ruiningSam 's life too . Well , it would probably do him good to have it ruined , she thought irritably ; maybe he would stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rang . There was no reason any more to dash when the telephone rang . She heard her mother 's footsteps in the hall . Sam lit a cigarette . " Betsy ! " Minnie May called . " Some girl wants to speak to you . " Betsy crossed the living-room , a doomed , romantic figure . It was Corinne Taylor . Betsy heard her giggling when she picked up the receiver . She said , " Hello , Betsy ? " " Hello , Corinne . How are you ? "  | " Oh , I 'm fine . I wanted to know if you could come for the weekend next weekend . Come Friday in time for dinner . " " Why . . . yes , I guess so . I 'd love to . " " It wo n't be exactly a house-party , " Corinne said , giggling . " just a couple of kids . There 's one person who wants to see you very much , though . " " Who , " Betsy began , and then she knew . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , because if she did n't know it would n't be her fault . " I 'd love to come , " she said hurriedly . " Thanks for asking me . " She hung up . " What 'd they want ? " Minnie May called . " It was Corinne Taylor . She 's having a house-party this weekend . I can go , ca n't I ? I said I could . " " That 's nice , " Minnie May called . Betsy floated into the living-room . Sam Was sitting smoking the same cigarette . She gave him a blinding smile . FRIDAY NIGHT they had all driven far down toward Providence to a roadhousefor dinner . Nobody , Corinne said , that they could possibly know could possibly see them there . They had had the duck dinner sitting round a table under dim lights , and every time anyone arrived at the roadhouse they would all look , quickly , to see who it was . Nobody came that they had ever seen before . But they were all tense about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of gin that he kept under the table , where the white cloth covered it , and from time to time he made them drinks with ginger ale and ice . There was a small , inferior orchestra playing and they got up and danced sometimes , indifferently ; they were all too good for the music . Betsy and Corinne wore bright-colored crepe day dresses ; the boys had on dark suits and Oren , as usual , wore patent leather dancing shoes . The snow was deep outside . When trey left , around midnight , Peter drove Corinne back to Brookline in her roadster and Oren and Betsy got into the Bugatti . That was the way they had come . It was all strange , and special . Betsy was a suffering , wronged romantic heroine . Froth the moment that she had seen him late that afternoon Oren had been attentive and hanging over her as he had never been before . Peter had squeezed her hand and said , " God , Bets . Oren 's been through hell about this . " Corinne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they had got dressed together in Betsy 's room at the Taylors ' big house , and Corinne talked to her in a new admiring way . The whole evening had been charged with significance , and the significance was the frustrated love betweenBetsy and Oren . She had never been quite so happy in her life . The Bugatti started up and the grinding wheels sent up a spray of hard powdered snow . They followed the other car for a little way , and then lost it . Oren was driving with his left arm  --  the car had a righthand drive  --  around Betsy , and she sat deep down in the seat with her head leaning against his arm , her short curly hair snapping against her face in the cold , dry wind . " Baby , " he said , turning his face and pressing it against the top of her head . The lights of the car bobbed up and down over the white nightveiledlandscape as they tore down the long road . " Darling , " she said . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Oh , darling , yes . " " You do n't know what I 've been through , " he said , slowing down so that his voice was clearer above the engine noise . " I thought I 'd go out of my mind . My little sweetheart taken away from me . I nearly cut my throat . Peter had to stay up all night with me for a couple of nights . " " Oh , Oren , " she said , feeling anguish for his anguish . Still , it was over now ; now it was wonderful . " Listen , tell me . Was it awful seeing Dad ? I mean , was he awful ? " " It was pretty grim . God , yes . It was grim , all right . I hope he did n't do anything frightful to you . " " It was horrible , " she admitted . " He called me all the most terrible names . " " If he only knew ! " Oren said , laughing shortly and bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She felt so happy . Now , instead of his long silences , his queer laughter , his ignoring her sometimes for periods of time , Oren was adoring ; he was all she had ever dreamt of his being . They went roaring through the little New England towns in the night , alone together , exalted . He turned the car off on to a back road and stopped , in from the road on a bare patch where a sweep of the wind had driven the snow away . " Kiss me , my sweet , " he said . She put her arms around his neck and they clung together , their mouths soft and warm pressed together with the cold sharp wind around them . He put his hand gently inside Corinne 's beautiful fur coat and held Betsy closer . " I 'll love you all my life , " she murmured . " You 're my sweet baby . You 're my sweet baby , " he said , and shook her softly with his hand . " Do n't leave me again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , I thought I 'd die when I did n't think I was ever going to see you again . Do you really , really love me ? " " I love you , " he said . " I love you . I 'm so hot for you I could die . Let 's get married . " " Oh , darling . . . . " At first she hardly realized what he had said . " Let 's drive somewhere , let 's go to New York tonight , and get married . Connecticut , " he said . " I think you can get married quick in Connecticut . I want to get married . Let 's do it . " " Darling , we ca n't ! " She sat up straight . " Oh , Oren , how could we ? It would ruin your career . " " I do n't care , " he said . " I ca n't go through any more of the hell I 've been going through without you . What does it matter ? Let 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college . All I want is a lot of loving with you . " " What would your father do ? " " God . He 'd do plenty , I can promise you that . He 'll probably cut me off out of his will with a shilling ; he 's threatened to do it often enough . He 'd do that all right . I could get a job in an orchestra . I could get a job playing banjo any day . " " Darling , I ca n't let you ruin your life , " she said . In the dark her forehead was all puckered up . " I want to marry you more than anything in the whole world . But if we did it right now it would just make such trouble for you . Would n't it be better to wait , and you could tell your father and kind of get hint prepared . . . . Or something . You know I 'll wait till you finish Harvard . I 'd wait forever . " He reached inside his overcoat and got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time lighting it , and she watched his queer , rocky profile in the small red glow . She felt desperate with indecision , and yet inside her the impulse grew and grew that she must take care of him , at the expense of her own desire ; she had always wanted most to take care of him . She felt as if her heart were breaking , and yet she felt noble , too ; she loved him so terribly she could not let him wreck that glorious career that everybodyknew lay ahead of him . Later , when they did get married he would love her more for her heroism ; besides , he might argue her out of it now . She was prepared to be argued out of it . " I want you to get everything there is out of life , " she said , as the glow died and the cigarette tip was the only stab of red . " I ca n't let you ruin your career . That 's what would happen if we got married tonight . " He put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrenched her heart . " You 've got my life in your hands , " he said . " Take care of me , wo n't you ? Be good to me . " " I 'll be so good to you .... " " I guess I 'm a crazy fool to want to get married tonight . I 'm always a crazy fool . You 'll have to take care of me . I 'm just so crazy hot about you , I want to drive this old wreck as fast as it will go in the night till we get somewhere where we can get married . Oh , baby , baby , do I want to get married tonight ! But you know best . " She felt beloved and happy  --  but disappointed. " just wait a hole . . . kind of arrange things . . . " she said . " I know , " he said in his melancholy voice . " That 's right . God , it 's got to be all right . 1 ' 11 tell my father about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's got to let me do what I want . He 's got to let me be happy just once in my life . " " What are you going to tell your father about me ? " she said . " Do n't tell him about there being this mess with Daddy . " " No . I 'll tell him you 're the most beautiful little girl in the whole world and I want you for my baby . Oh , God , he 'll want to know about your family . Your family is n't Boston , is it ? "  |p263How  strange he was . He knew about , he had discussed , her family coming from the South . " No . We come from Virginia . My mother was a Green , " she said , with a feeling of pride . " I 'll tell him that . Maybe he 'll know . He 's got to let me marry you . He ca n't always crucify me . Oh . . . oh . . . oh "  --  he put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pressed her to him , moaning in. an ecstasy of tenderness  --  " such a sweet , soft , cuddly , cute , hot little baby for Papa ! " Saturday they all drove up , with Mr. and Mrs. Taylor , to their winter camp in the south of New Hampshire to spend Saturday night . None of them knew how to ski except the Taylors , and Corinne , who had always seemed so languid and lazy at school , turned out to ski beautifully . There were skis enough for everybody , and they spent the short , sunny afternoon falling into snowdrifts and taking turns letting the lumbering farm horse pull them on their skis until they fell down . The mountain shadows fell in luminous blue across the snow fields , and in the twilight they ploughed home through the snow carrying their skis . Mr. and Mrs. Taylor had gone before . Peter and Corinne went ahead , as was only proper , and the lovers , Betsy and Oren , stumbled together with their arms entwined , their skis clashing ; now and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the cold fresh snow , they would cling together and kiss . Their mouths felt very warm . When at last they climbed the hill to the camp the others were inside having tea . It was like a dream , after so little sleep the night before , to be sitting before the big log fire beside Oren , drinking hot , hot tea and eating , and turning to see his eyes on her , Betsy , with their melancholy , shy , ingratiatingsmile . For all Mr. and Mrs. Taylor knew they were only two more of Corinne 's friends ; but Peter and Corinne knew ; they realized the romance . Betsy felt more than ever like a heroine now ; she had made such a sacrifice last night . If she had not been so devoted to Oren 's truest interests , she would be married to him now . They were engaged ; what else could you call it ? They were all so sleepy from the fresh air that they went to bed early . The sleeping arrangements were open porches ; one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out with Corinne and Betsy . She was a comfortable , middle-aged woman who had a pleasant acceptance of young people and let Corinne do what she pleased ; as different from Boston people as anyone could be , Betsy thought . In the morning they skied some more , and Corinne tried to show them a little about it . Oren was by far the quickest at it ; he learned to do a Christy in an hour , and practiced and practiced with a look of ecstasy on his face . " God , it 's beautiful ! " he cried . " Corinne , I 'm mad about it ; I 'd give my eyes to do it like you . God , you 're beautiful ! You look like a dark angel swooping down like that . "  |p264Betsy  worked hard at it too , gritting her teeth and setting her pugdogface . " You look more like a boy than any girl I know , " Peter said , as they climbed the slope together . His voice had a husk in it , the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a boy . " " Do you like me that way ? " Betsy said , laughing and sparkling her eyes at him . " Do you think it 's smooth ? " " It seems to get away with Oren , all right , " he said . He came nearer to her and let his voice sink confidentially . " Oren told me about the other night . I mean , Oren tells me everything . I want to tell you you did a fine thing , saving Oren front himself like that . " " What ? " she said , wrinkling up her nose . " He 's such a madman . If you two had got married the other night there would have been hell to pay . I do n't know what Mr. Garth might not have done . Oren 's damned near a genius , but he has n't any sense about himself . " " I did n't want hint to ruin his career , " Betsy said , slowly . " That 's what I mean . God , what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Betsy started to say something about their plans for getting married later , but somehow the impulse died in her . After all , Peter did n't have to know everything . He smiled his dark , smooth smile at her , sticking out his jaw as he smiled , and took her mittened hand and squeezed it . " Good girl , " he said . That night they were back at the Taylors ' house in Brookline . Mr. and Mrs. Taylor went out to dinner and the young people changed and had supper and went into the drawing-room and turned on the gramophone . They were silly and playful after the day in the snow . Oren did a dance , half tap and half ridiculous contortions , his face split in a broad , one-sided smile ; he looked wistfully and pleadingly at them as he convulsed his body . Suddenly he came out of it and snatched at Corinne who leaned against the wall . He danced her off with wild and incredible steps which she followed with precision . Gertrude Lawrence 's tempting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Di-de-di , de-di-di-di ! " Oren sang with the record , his voice husky and sweet . Betsy wanted to be alone with Oren . She wanted to talk to him , to resumetheir long , caressing dialogue about love ; to discuss marrying , and especially to talk about what they were going to do about seeing each other now . Now that the prohibition had been broken it was out of the question not to see each other . I t was right . It was the other that was wrong . There was a law much stronger than obeying your parents or keeping promises or telling the truth ; the law was love . Betsy felt stalwart and virtuous with it behind her . But Peter and Corinne did n't clear out . Time went on . They kept the gramophone going . They played all the tunes of that year and the year before  --  the Taylors had hundreds of records ; the Gershwin tunes , and the new , crazy tunes by Cole Porter , all the rest . Sometimes Oren pulled Betsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get him to be anythingp265but wild and unrestrained . He was laughing out loud half the time . His dancing did n't have any love in it , it was almost acrobatics . She did n't enjoy it . But she laughed and sparkled , and pretended to feel the same way herself . Oren and Corinne were working up an adagio dance together . She held her lovely slim body rigid and with one hand on each of her hips he lifted her high above his head  --  and then let go ; he caught her again as she fell , leaning her body backwards , just before her head hit the floor . It was hard for Betsy to feel admiration . She wanted it to be herself Oren was dancing with . She knew he loved her . But why did he dance so much more with Corinne ? It was because he was wild tonight ; he was in one of his mad moods . It would pass . But there was so much to talk about , and when would they talk ? The boys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nine o'clock class in Cambridge . Sometime after midnight Corinne said they would all have to go to bed or the boys would n't get any sleep at all . Suddenly a kind of lassitude struck them . They were tired , after all . There was nothing to say . They trailed up the broad slippery stairs . The boys ' rooms were on the floor above Betsy 's and Corinne 's rooms . They drawled out good night and continued up the stairs . Corinne cane in and wandered around Betsy 's room for a while ; she yawned again and went away . Betsy sat on the edge of her bed in the dark , her finger on the switch of the lamp . She did n't feel at all sleepy . She wanted to see Oren . As she sat there she heard Mr. and Mrs. Taylor come in and go to their room beyond hers and shut the door . Then everything was still . After a while she opened her door softly and went out into the dark hall . There was a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone to bed yet . Or perhaps it was only that the light had been left burning . She decided to go downstairs and get something to eat from the dishes of sandwiches and fruit that had been in the study when they came upstairs . She started down in her bare feet , feeling her way . Something soft hit her in the head . It dropped to the step below and she bent over and picked it up by feel , fumbling at it . It was a man 's undershirt . She looked up , and Oren was leaning over the stair-rail on the upper landing . Her heart jumped . She whispered , " Hello ! " He began to run down the stairs , without noise . In a moment he was beside her . He did not speak . He kissed her quickly , and picked her up in his arms and ran with her down the rest of the stairs . She held her breath ; it was absolutely dark . But he tossed her to her feet at the bottom , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and they stood and looked at each other . He looked wild , and bad , and wistful , and teasing . He went into the study , and she followed him . They turned on a lamp and sat down on the broad deep leather sofa . It was cold , to Betsy who had on a nightgown and a thin wrapper . Oren wore a dark red dressing-gown . " How are you , baby , " he whispered . " How 's this ? Just a little Mr. and Mrs. , huh ? Who 's going to change the baby 's diapers ? "  |p266She  laughed . Perhaps soon he would begin to be nice . " Mama love Papa ? " he whispered . " O00000h , sweet Mama . Give Papa lots of lovin ' , hmmm ? " He liked to talk in the language of popular songs . It was part of what Peter called his socialism . Ile hated the upper-class talk he was too used to . But she liked it so much better when he talked as if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . " Oh , Oren , I love you so , " she said . He ran his hands down her upper arms and held them tight at the elbows and shook her , gently , persistently . She shook all over . " Oren , when am I going to see you again ? " she whispered . " Will you see me in your dreams , baby ? " he murmured . " Will you ? Because you 'll be in mine . My sweet baby 's goin ' to give Papa a lot of hot dreams , 000h ! " " I think of you every minute , " she said . " Awake and asleep . " He put his head in her neck and burrowed , crooning wordlessly . She put her arms tight around his back and held him . " I do n't see how I 'm going to live without you till you get back , " she said . " Oren , will you write to me ? Will you tell me what your father says ? " " Hmm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mmmmh . I 'll write to you . Let 's pretend we 're married now . Let 's put the sofa cushions down on the floor and pretend we 're in our little bed , in our little home . " " I wish we were , " she said . " We will be , " he said . " Honestly , we will be . I 'll get what I want this time . God , I will . He 's got to let me live my life . " This was better . Betsy clung to him . " I want to so much , " she said . " So do I , baby , sweet baby . Let 's pretend we 're married . I want to eat you all up . " He jumped to his feet and threw all the sofa cushions on the floor and pulled her down with him . He could not seem to keep still an instant . He hugged her , nuzzled her , shook her . The light was very dim . This was the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got beyond being thrilling . " Sweet baby , " he breathed against her skin . " My cute hot baby ... . Let 's have a little love . Hmm ? " " No , " she said . " No . I do n't want to do that . No . " She sat up . He sat up too , in a moment . " You 're not giving anything away , are you , baby ? " " Oh , darling ! It 's not like that . It 's just I never am going to , till I get married . " " I know . I know about that . That 's why hot babies come so high . God ! And when you count the alimony in , why , it 's higher . " " Oren ! How can you hurt me like that ? "  | " All right , " he said . " I take it all back . We 'll get married , baby . Do n't worry . I 'm going to have to have you , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stood , quite still , staring out of the window at the starlit snow outside . Suddenly he did a sharp , exaggerated tap step . It sounded muffled on the carpet . " Let 's go to bed , " he said . " Nighty-night , baby . " " Let 's talk a little while , " she said . " What is there to talk about ? " he asked . His voice was blank . She felt wretched . " Good night , " she said . Suddenly he hugged her , kissed her , and it was all right . They went up the staircase in the dark with their arms around each other 's waists . He kissed her on each step , and at the top . " Do n't forget all about me , " he said . " Oh , darling ! How could I ? " she whispered desperately , and could have begun a long , explaining conversation , but he was going up the second flight silently , two steps at a time . He waved down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two WEEKS LATER the long waiting was broken . A telephone call came for Betsy in the evening , and it was Peter . Nobody had ever said anything about not talking to Peter . . . . But why did he sound so funny ? " Listen , " he said , in his metallic New York voice . " Listen , Orey 's in the hospital . He 's very sick . " " What ? What . . . Tell me what . . . " " Well , look , you see , it was like this . I have n't got much time . Got to get back and talk to the doctor . But I thought you 'd want to know . Driving back Sunday  --  you know how cold it was , it was snowing part of the way ... he would n't button up his coat , you know , I kept telling him .. . Anyway , that night back in Cambridge he was tossing around all night and in the morning he could n't get out of bed . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them ever since St. Paul 's ; he had it there .... He 's got pneu-monia . " " Oh , Peter .... Where is he ? " " They 've got him up at Stillman Infirmary . He 's very sick . Of course his family is off somewhere , California , they left while we were in New York . I 've been telegraphing everybody . I 've got to go now . I just wanted to tell you . . . . " " Peter  --  Peter , is n't there anything I can do ? " " Nothing anybody can do right now . You ca n't see him . They only let me . He does n't know it . " " Peter , you 'll let me know , wo n't you ? Call me up ? " " All right , all right . I 'll keep letting you know . . . . it 's double . " His voice faded off and there was a click , but Betsy could hear his voice , still murmuring . . . it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sat still in the empty , brightly lit hall at home , with her mind beating in thumps , it 's double ... Oren . . . my Oren . . . my love . . . It 's double ... they 've got him in Stillman Infirmary ; and a sour little strain began to run feverishly in her head , So young , so sweet , so fair . I went up to . . . I 've got those St. James Infirmary Blues . . . . Those Stillman Infirmary Blues . . . . So young , so sweet , so fair . She walked back into the living-room . The lights were all full on and there was nobody there . She went into the window-seat and pressed her face against one of the large panes , staring out , seeing darkness and from the corner of her eyes the lights of the room reflected blankly on the pane . Outside the snow of the winter was beginning to melt and she could hear the torrents rushing in the gutters of the street . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at it , grew larger , yellower , the shape of a huge four-pointed star with rays running far , far out from its heart ; then it shrank again to a point of light in the darkness . She watched it swell and contract for a long time ; her chest hurt her where her heart was . After four more days of it Peter telephoned her again in the morning . " He 's going to be all right , " he said . " It 's just nursing now , the doctor says . It 'll take a long time . I-He 'll have to stay perfectly still in bed , and God , it 's going to be a job to make him . As soon ' as he begins to feel better , ... You know . " " Oh , Peter , Peter , is he really all right , really ? " " Sure . " " Are his family here or anything ? " " God , no . They would n't come . They did a lot of telephoning . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're going to stay in California . " " Peter , ca n't I see him ? I would n't talk . " " He ca n't see people yet . I 'll let you know as soon as they say it 's all right . Honestly . I 'll give you a ring . 1 ' 11 keep you posted . " She hung up . If she had married him that night when he wanted to marry her , she would be at his bedside now . She would be his family . She would be Mrs. Oren Garth . But if she had married him he would never have got pneumonia . She would have cared for him like a child , so dearly .. . Here in my arms . I le was her child , her love , her father . She had read that somewhere and now suddenly she understood it . He was all there was to be to a woman , he filled her life . Here in my arms . It 's deplorable , that you are never there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had he said to his father , what had his father said to him , what had he been coming back to tell her when he was stricken down , his mercurial body struck still ? Would they get married when he got well ? Was it all right for them to get married if she waited till he had finished college ? But she could n't even see him . He could n't tell her . Did he think about it ? Or was he too sick ? She could n't even see him ! Here in my arms . It 's deplorable , you never will be there . Hush , that was only a song . You must n't let yourself think songs and phrases were omens . But they seemedp269like omens . This was the spring of the year . The snows gushed freely into rivers in the streets and the fields shook themselves free of the snow . This was the season for love beginning . But she could n't even see him . Oh , God , I love you so , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephoned her every day , giving her bulletins on Oren 's progress , in his New York voice , in his New York phrases . " It 's too lousy for him , " he said , and , " Anyway , they 're taking nifty care of him , I must say . " He said , " The whole thing 's absolutely too grim . He looks like a shadow . " Every word he said cut her heart and the metallic accents were ground into her and she would never be able to forget them , entangled with her suffering . After a week he telephoned her and said , " I 've got the doctor to say you can see him . I explained about your being an actual girl of his . Do n't stay more than ten minutes . " " I wo n't . Oh , Peter , I 'm so glad I can see him ! " " Yes , but listen . How about your family ? Are they going to let you see him ? I mean , after all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . She had given no thought whatever to whether her parents knew what was happening , whether they had heard what she had said on the telephone on different days , what they thought of Peter 's voice asking to speak to her . It simply seemed too unimportant to matter . The only thing in the whole world that mattered was Oren , and now that she might see him she was going to see him and nothing was going to stop her . She simply said , " Can I have the car this afternoon ? " Nobody said she could not . If anyone had , she would have done something else about getting there . She had to get there . She drove in the swishing slush , the gray April air , to Cambridge and along the curving , melancholy drive , out to the Infirmary . When she got out of the Ford , the gutters were running with noisy water . She went into the stiff , brick building . She wondered whether the nurse who led her to Oren 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is the girl he has been talking of in his delirium . Did they all know ? She felt special , sacrosanct . She was the beloved of Oren Garth . Peter was there . He was sitting in an armchair by the window . Oren lay , a narrow , flat strip in the middle of the bed ; his face was thin and white . But his eyes were bright blue , and his smile , when she came in , went up the side ; irresistibly . " It 's the red-hot Mama , " he murmured . She felt as if she were drowning in relief , in emotion , in the sheer overwhelmingnessof seeing him at last . He stole the heart out of her body . She wanted to go down on her knees beside the bed and press his hand to her cheek and tell him she adored him and would never leave him . Why did n't Peter go away ? He sat there , his dark , freckled face serious , his black hair brushed sleek , his jaw thrust out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was taking care of Oren . He had made all the arrangements , sent telegrams , been on the inside of everything . No mother could have donor more . But it could have been Betsy . If she had just said yes instead of no she would be sitting in that armchair now , looking serious and important , belonging there . No , Oren would n't be here at all , if she had said yes . They would have been together somewhere . And she heard his old , strong , husky voice say " Little Mr. and Mrs .... " " I 'd ask you to kiss the invalid , " Oren murmured , " but you 'd get bugs . And my temperature would go up , 000h .... " " Oren , do n't try to talk , " Peter said . A nurse came in and put a glass down on the table beside the bed . She was a pretty , red-haired girl with a neat figure . Oren smiled up at her . " This is the fair Elaine , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovable , Elaine the lily-maid .... Meet your rival , baby . She gives me baths , do n't you , beautiful ? Baby over there never gave inc a bath . " He laughed , a ghost laugh , with the echo of the old teasing , the wistfulness in it . He was unbearably the same , though faint and diminished . Betsy grinned at the nurse , hating her . When the nurse had gone they all sat there . There was nothing to talk about except Oren 's illness , how it had come , what it had been in suffering ; about his recovery . Betsy did not know what to say . But suddenly somethingburst from her . " I 'm so terribly glad you 're getting better , " she said . " You do n't know what I 've been through , thinking of you sick . I have n't thought of anything else . " " He 's going to be all right , " Peter said . " He just has to take it slow . " Why did he have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Oren looked at them both with his sick-looking , but still provocative eyes . " Lucky me , " he sighed . " Got two Mamas . Got Peter . Got you , baby . Got lots of Mamas . Everywhere I go , there 's a sweet Mama . " " Do n't talk so much , " Peter said . " Got Hope , lovely Hope . Got Elaine , the lily-maid . She gives me baths . You ought to take a bath , " he said to Betsy . " You look as if your arm-pits smelled . I ) o they ? " " I . . . hope not , " she stammered . She was bitterly hurt . Perhaps he did n't know what he was saying . Perhapshaving been ill did this to him . She had heard of patients being irritable . She could only smile , feebly , foolishly , at him . " I think you 'd better go now , " Peter said in a low , important voice . " He 's only supposed to see people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's been allowed to see , " he said , smiling as if he were giving her a present . " Do n't pay any attention to what he says . You know Oren , " he continued , as they walked toward the door . " He just goes crazy if he has to keep still . I 'm going to have a hell of a time with him before he 'll be well . " She felt dispossessed . At the door she turned and smiled at Oren ; she felt that her heart , her soul , all her humble longing and adoration were in her smile ; they burst from her.  | " Goodbye , " she said . Now he looked gentle and sweet . " Bye , Bets , " he whispered . " You were an angel to come to see me . Will you come again , hmm ? Please come again . " " I will , " she gasped . " Just as often as they 'll let me . " Peter went along the corridor with her , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long was he allowed to stay there ? She felt wretched and unattractive picking her way through the slush across the road to the car . She had no right there , with the one person in all the world that she worshipped . Out of her love and her unselfishness she had refused to elope with him and become his wife with more rights than anyone else ; and this was what the reward for love was : she was barely permitted into his room ; an outsider , a tolerated visitor . She tried not to think of the thing he had said to her that had hurt her so . Peter was right , he was a wild creature , and if he were confined he probably really did go crazy and say things to wound out of what was pent up inside him . He was really so sweet , like a beautiful child ... . But who was Hope ? Or did he mean hope ? Surely he had meant hope . Yes , that made perfectly good sense . He meant , I 've always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say . But why did he put it in the middle of talking about real girls ? He had only been teasing about the nurse . It was like Oren to be persuasive and wistful with any pretty nurse . It was to be expected . She knew it would be horrible , often , when he played and smiled with other women . But she was willing , eager , to put up with anything at all , if she could just have him . It was her dream . It had to come true . As she drove along , she let herself drift into the mood of the dream . Herself and Oren , together for always , Mr. and Mrs. Oren Garth ; with sweet music playing , and dancing , and the shy , wild smile ; and she caring for him , being everything to him ; his necessity . She did not see herself in the dream , specifically ; she had no picture of how she would look ; she was just Oren 's attendant spirit , laughing with him , being crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But who was Hope ? Surely it was only hope . But how about New York ? Had he met somebody ? He went to New York to talk to his father about Betsy . Soon he would be able to tell her what had happened ; if Peter would only get out of the room . He was in New York more than a week . Had he met somebody ? Named Hope ? Betsy went to Cambridge every day . Sometimes she got the car to drive over . Sometimes she made the long trip by train or street-car to Boston , by subway from Park Street to Harvard Square , and then the long , wet gray walk out to the Infirmary . The Square was full of boys ; their overcoatsopen and flapping in the warm wind ; in old gray battered felt hats . Ten thousand men of Harvard . She hardly noticed them , she never even gave a provocative glance up under her felt cloche . She was through with all that . It was only Oren now . She got there to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special effort to keep from being found out . She simply did not mention where she had been , and made up careless stories of other occupations , shopping . The prohibition against seeing Oren did not seem real any more . There was no law but love . They were unhappy , desperate weeks . It was nothing but agony when she got to Oren 's room . He was sweet to her only in snatches . He was cruel , and teasing , and unrestrained . But she had to go , as she had to breathe . He got stronger steadily . When she carne he would be sitting up in the big armchair in a dressing-gown . His face was thin , his hair was ruffled , there was a wild look in his eyes . It was front having to keep still so long , she knew . When he was able to get out of here and do things and get back to his piano and dance , he would be himself again ; kind and loving to her . The doctor said that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his recuperation ; he would be able to get outdoors . Betsy met the doctor two or three times . ' 1'he only happiness she got for herself out of these trips was the feeling that , as she passed along the corridor to and from Oren 's room , the nurses and doctors knew who she was : Mr. Garth 's girl . He sat up for longer and longer periods during the day . At last a day was set when he could go home to Westmoreland with Peter . Betsy went to Cambridge by street-car the day before his dismissal from the hospital . It was May . Hampton was green and soft-aired now , and even here along the drive in Cambridge the distant trees were furred over with green and the air was sweet and on the Charles the shells swept by like water-beetles , all the oars moving together . She walked along with her head bent ; this was the last time that she would have to walk this dismal walk . To the Stillman Infirmary . The St. James Infirmary . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and sit on a coat in some meadow and kiss . They could go dancing at roadhouses , and drive back in the night through the spring air , and hear the frogs singing in the swamps , and stop the car and kiss . The old prohibition , that she was not to see Oren , simply did not exist any more . She was going to see him all it was possible for her to sec him , and they could do what they liked . She had to see him . When she cause into the hospital room there were three people there : Oren , Peter , and a girl . They were all sitting in chairs and drinking out of tall glasses and laughing . Betsy stood still in the doorway . Peter got up . " Hope , this is Miss Jekyll , " he said , with his correct , metallic accent . " Betsy , Miss Bayne . She came over from New York to see Oren last night . " " How do you do , " Betsy said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " We 're drinking ginger ale . Funny ginger ale , with tickles in it . Peter , fix up some funny ginger ale for Miss Betsy Jekyll . " He turned his full face on her and gave her a smile that made her choke : wry , wistful , teasing . The girl from New York had the ineffable New York look . She was thin as a rail , with hips as narrow as a boy 's . She had a head of dark yellow ruffled curls , and long green eyes , and a big scarlet mouth . She had a cigarette between her fingers . Her legs were long and thin and the ankle-bones stoodp273out sharply . She wore a beige jersey dress with pleats all round the brief skirt , and a choicer necklace made of big blobs of red glass : New York clothes . When she talked it was with the New York voice : husky , metallic , slurring ; an important voice . She paid no attention to Betsy , and instead of feeling resentful Betsy found that she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her beside the huge , threatening despair . Hope talked , and Peter talked , and Oren made his strange , hysterical jokes ; they all had a sound in common in their voices ; they were all being New York together . " But darling , I said to him , it 's simply too lousy , " Hope said , with that magic rasp in her voice . " After all , I mean , a thing can be just so lousy . Darling , can you imagine a speak run like that ? I mean it 's simply too much , honestly , darling . " Betsy could not understand half the words they were using in this conversation , this bitter hell , " Darling , get me some more of that lousy ginger ale , " Hope said to Peter . " I mean , have n't you got anything to put in it ? " " Oren 's not meant to drink anything yet , " Peter said . Peter was just the same as ever . But now you saw where it came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own kind . " I ca n't exactly bring anything in to the hospital , I mean , can I ? But we can tonight . " " Tonight I 'm gon na be in Heaven , " Oren said . " I 'm going away from this little hell , " he continued conversationally , across the room to Betsy . " I know . . . " she said desperately . " I 'm gon na walk all over God 's heaven , " he said . " Ta-ta-da . They 're gon na have angels in that heaven and their name 's gon na be Hope . Sweet Hope , " he said , giving the girl his sad , wild smile . So they were all going to do something tonight and nobody had said anything to her . She had n't been asked . Betsy looked at the floor . Perhaps they had to entertain this girl over from New York , she thought faintly , this girl named Hope ; perhaps when she had gone Oren would call up and everything would be all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , no . Hope 's voice went on and on . Darling , she said , darling , I mean . If you were like that , you had everything . You understood how to treat Oren , you made him play up to you . But he used to play up to me . But all the time I was weak as water inside , and it- was only God 's Providence . The New York thing . They talked , and they knew so well what they were saying ; they had assurance , and everything was lousy , and they were not impressed . If you had that you could get what you wanted . If you had that you could not be hurt . It was New York . Betsy got up . She wanted to go away . But she could not go away like this . She set her small pug-dog face . " Oren , " she said . " Look . I 've got to go . But I just stopped by , uh , to know if you could go dancing next week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter go dancing with Corinne . And me . Corinne wanted me to ask you . She did n't know whether you 'd be well enough . . . . " She heard her voice go onp274and on . She could always fix it with Corinne . Perhaps , perhaps , by this route , perhaps everything would be all right . Oren 's face twisted in one of his rare frowns . He looked cross ; like a tired child . " No , I do n't want to , " he said loudly . " I do n't want to go dancing with old giggling Corinne . I do n't want to go dancing with you . You 're too hot . " Suddenly his frown broke into a laugh and he bent his head and vibrated his hand as if he were playing a banjo . " I had a sweet Mama . . . But she 's turned sour , now . ' You 're too hot , but you 're not hot enough . " He laughed a high , hysterical laugh , and then smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't mind , do you , baby ? " " No , naturally , I just was asking for Corinne . . . " she mumbled , and somehow got to the door . " I 'd hate it if you minded , " she heard Oren say , differently , anxiously . But she kept on going . " Goodbye , darling , it 's been divine meeting you , " I lope 's voice said . Peter came to the door with her . He opened it , and she went out along the corridor . He was beside her . " Do n't let it get you , " he was saying . " Orey Bayne , on his mind lately . .. You know how Orey is . Listen , " he said . " Listen . I 'll call you up . Orey 's completely vague . I 'll call you up . " Then she was alone and walking along the barren , springlike drive . She kept her shoulders hunched . ON AN EVENING IN MAY Betsy walked out into the yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was failing down the streaky sky . The Brats were playing Prisoner 's Base , farther over , near the house . Where Betsy stood it was bare and flat , looking off towards the distant woods at the back of Hampton , and the sky . It was like a frontier . At her feet lay the remains of a flower bed attempted by her mother the summer before : there were old steins , and seed-pods , flat to the damp earth . Far away in the marshes beyond the town , near the woods , the frogs sang loud and sweet in their springtime chorus . The voices of the children screamed . The air was sweet with the things beginning to come out of the earth , the buds swelling on the twigs . The light faded from the soft late afternoon into the spring night . Betsy felt the torrent of tears behind her eyes , but she could not cry . Here was the spring , and here the mild weather , the sweet smells and the country all around in the dusk ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she smelled it all alone and felt the little chill of the air on her skin , her neck , her cheeks . The high days of autumn were long ago gone , and the winter was over , and the spring had come at last and she was alone.  |p275the  stood for a long time looking over the country toward the woods , listening to the sad , sweet music of the frogs . After a while she turned and walked back to the house . The children were ; Nanning in the deepening twilight . She went in the back door and through the unlighted rooms to the hall . There were lights in the study where her parents sat . She went up the stairs , and up the second flight , to her own room where it was dark and the windows were open . She took her clothes off slowly and felt the blowing air on her body . She went into the bathroom and switched on the strong white light and ran a bath . She stood and watched the water run , pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bare and clean . When it was full she got into the tub and let the hot water go on running . There was the faint sucking gurgle of the water running out of the overflow pipe . The hot water soaked through her and she lay in the bath staring at the faucets . The heat made her feel better ; not so rigid , not so aching . She began to cry , without noise ; the tears fell from her eyes , off her cheeks , and dropped into the water . She began to sing , under her breath , in the tub , as she cried . " O. G. , I 'm mighty blue . . . for you , I 've been mighty true .. . to you , I 've decided , Something I did , made . . . you go away .... " She sang it with her voice catching on her sobs , listening with a sort of satisfaction to the sound of her broken voice , and felt better . But when one afternoon Peter called her up everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maybe , like a heartbeat . " Will you go out with me tonight ? " he said . But the sound of his voice meant so much more , it was like an echo or a promise of a world she thought she had lost . Maybe , maybe . Maybe Oren was sorry and this was the way . . . . Maybe . She had been going around for days in old dresses , but now she spent a long time dressing . She put on her newest bright green crepe dress , with a gold belt around her hips . She leaned forward across the bureau and stared into her own face . Peter came alone . He was driving the Bugatti . " How about the Brunswick ? " he said . " How about dancing a little ? " " Marvellous , " she said . The worst was getting into the Bugatti and seeing the familiar instrument panel , feeling Peter to the right of her , and fitting into the seat so . She talked as fast as she could , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not keep to it . After they were at the table near the floor , drinking gin and ginger ale , she said , " How 's Oren ? " She tried to say it as if it had just occurred to her to ask . Peter sat beside her in his dark gray suit . His hair was black and shining , his freckled face was smooth and worldly . He kept his feet and hands quiet . When he picked up his glass he drank from it and then set it down and let go of it . " He 's fine , " Peter said , looking out over the floor . " Working like the devil to try to make up some of what he lost . He wants to go to summer school to make up some credits . His family want him to go abroad , though . Dance ? " Is he . . . is he . . . . She almost asked a dozen things that cried out inside her . Is he still in love with Hope ? Is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Does he ever say anything about me ? Does he laugh at me ? But she did n't ask any of them . All the answers , she thought , were right here ; in her being here at this table , out dancing with Peter . She wondered why he had bothered . Maybe he felt some kind of loyalty ; maybe he remembered all the times when they had sat together and watched Oren . She got up and led the way out oil to the floor . Peter put his arm around her and they glided off . It was very smooth , dancing with Peter . IIe held her beautifully , and danced in perfect rhythm . It was inconspicuous , correct dancing . And because it was she felt her heart wrenched and chewed inside her . Driving home the spring night was all that she had ever looked forward to . Even above the noise of the Bugatti she could hear the frogs in the swamps . She did n't try to keep up the conversation any more . She put her head back against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face . The sky was blazing with spring stars , the Milky Way was crowded , and she saw the Big Dipper , filled with night , spilling down the west . She forgot that Peter was behind the wheel , at her right . She did not precisely pretend that it was Oren . It was more that she was alone , in this car in which so much of her life had happened , rushing through such a night as she had dreamed about . She lifted her head from the seat-back as Peter stopped the car . He had turned up a side road and they were under a row of willow trees , beside a marsh ; the frogs were very loud . She lifted her head and turned it and looked at him in the dark in surprise . He was lighting a cigarette . He put his arm around her . " Hello , Honey , " he said . " What a night ! " So that was what Peter said , she thought . He said Honey . So he wanted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most ironic , the bitterest thing that had ever happened to her , to be sitting here beside Oren 's roommate , waiting for him to begin to neck her . But why not ? He put his mouth on hers and she caught his smell , rather dry and musty . So that was how Peter smelled . " Does Oren send you around to do his repair work after he 's through ? " she asked . " Now listen , Bets . Do n't be like that , " he said , moving away . " What a thing to say . Naturally not . I 've always thought you were swell . But naturally before . . . you were n't in circulation . " " I see , " she said mildly . He moved back . " You 're a wonderful little girl , Honey , " he said . " You 've always appealed to me . " And with that to hold her , she thought  --  he started kissing her . It was like his dancing , smooth and technically correct . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls for years , expertly . Why did he want to ? He did n't seem especially excited , or only in an expert way . It was interesting to watch . Hisp277necking progressed in technically correct stages ; this , no doubt , was how t hey did it in New York . At intervals he breathed , " Honey " or " You 're wonder-ful . " " Ah , Honey , let me , " he murmured . " You 're so wonderful . " She said nothing and made no resistance . This was what she had never done before ; this was what she had thought she would never do . Perhaps if she had , things would have been different ; she had thought that a great deal lately . Perhaps that was what she had done wrong  --  Wheat did f do or say ? She had never done it and she had lost everything she ever wanted . Why had n't she done it ? She could not seem to think why , now . Why not do it ? Suddenly she wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that this was what Oren , whom she loved with her whole heart , had wanted , and she had never given it to him ; and now she was giving it to Peter , for whom she cared nothing . Peter lay with his head pressed against her neck ; his arms slowly relaxing from around her . Oh Oren , Oren , something cried out suddenly inside her . Oh my darling , my love . Oh Oren , Oren ! He was with her so vividly , that she could see the texture of his skin , the color of his brown eyelashes , the edges of his large , flexible mouth as it began to curve up one side . Every look of his was stamped upon her memory . She began to ache , inside , in heavy throbs . Oh Oren , darling , my darling ... . Peter moved away . " Look , " he said . " I promise you I had absolutely no idea . . . . Honestly , I did n't know at all . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . " " God . " They drove back into town and stopped at an all-night drugstore . Then he drove her home to the house in Hampton . There was nothing to say . At the door , when he went up the steps with her , it was too much effort even to say goodbye . She smiled mechanically and went in . Nothing untoward came of that night . But he did not call her up again . She was glad he did not . She did not know what she would have said . She did not have any prejudice for or against him . In late May during a visit from Maizie , the Jekylls had a glider swing put out under the maple tree in the yard , and a couple of rickety canvas deck chairs , and sat out there most of the time . Minnie May liked to sit there , while the blue smoke of her cigarettes floated away on the air , and look at the spring coming to the grass , the miniature maple leaves , the elm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every now and then she would sit up straight and put her hands on top of her head and start to lift first one side , then the other , of her chest , pulling up hard . It was one of the exercises Dr. Cunningham had given her . He said her back trouble was all bad posture . Then she would place her hands on her hips and stiffen her abdominal muscles . She had become an addict of Dr. Cunningham 's . Posture was the answer to everything . All illness came from things being out of place , muscles being improperly used , organs pressed down . She went in to his office every fortnight and was gone over by the doctor , then sent upstairs where his techniciansgave her new exercises , to be repeated morning and night , ten times each . But Minnie May did them many more times , during the day , whenever she remembered . " I declare I feel ten years younger already , " she said . " People get old before their time , lettin ' their stomachs sag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Physical guts . All that sag I had is moving up , turnin ' into muscle around my chest . " She laughed . " My Lord ! Maybe I 'll acquire a bosom , at my time of life ! " Betsy sat in one of the deck chairs , fitting her body to its curve . Minnie May was after her all the time , now , to stand correctly , chest up , stomach in , buttocks down . But Betsy had no wish nor intention of standing like that . She could not conceive of ever being anything but thin and hard all over . She stood with her shoulders forward , her chest flat , her hips thrust frontwards , but her stomach was hard as a corset . She listened to her mother , only half hearing . There was nothing to do but sit out here under the tiny leaves of the maple , in the sunny , sweet air . " Now , I 'm just countin ' on its doing Maizie some good , " Minnie May said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm just as positive that it would solve all her troubles for her , make her feel well again . I do n't think she takes it seriously enough . . . . Bets , I 've got a feeling that things are worse than usual . I thought I 'd seen my daughter look like Death before , Heaven help me , but this time is the worst . Betsy , things ca n't go on like that . Human natureca n't stand it . She 's got to leave him or I do n't know what will happen . " Poor Maizie . Poor Minnie May . Poor everybody . Everyone was sad , everyone was beset . There used to be joy everywhere , gaiety , laughter . But not now , in this place . This was the place where everything happened . This was the place where it had all begun and where it had all ended . " Ma'am , " Betsy said . " I want to go away . " " Away , honey ? Where ? " " I want to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hang around here any longer . I 'm not having a good time . I 'm not getting anywhere . My life is just kind of marking time . I do n't want to go out on dates any more with the boys here , and have Sam hanging around , or even meet any new boys , around here . " And always compare them , she thought , always see how dull and flat they are . " I want to get out and have a job . I want to go to New York . I 've thought it all over . " Minnie May put her head on one side and considered , blowing vast clouds of smoke from her slightly separated lips ; her upper lip was yellow . " Well , " she said . " I do n't know why not . I see what you 're talkin ' about . For a minute I thought you maybe meant go on back down to Annestown , I get so much of that from your father and Maizie , I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But , of course , you never did want that . New York . Unh-hunh . It would be excitin ' . Everything 's going on there , always something moving . Remember what a good time we had Christmas ? ' " I remember , " Betsy said.  | " What kind of a job would you get , honey ? " " Something to do with clothes , I guess . That 's what I 'd like . " " You 've always had a knack . Well . I do n't see why not , Bets . I 'll talk to your father . he ought to be glad that you 've got some get up and git . Yes . Yes , I always thought of it that way . Maizie the one who would make a brilliant marriage and have beautiful children . You the clever one . My poor darlin ' Maizie ; she certainly has n't got what I 've wanted for her . She 's got nothing . " You always loved her more than me , Betsy thought quietly . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder what are the ways , I wonder how you make someone really love you , best of all . " Will Daddy mind ? " she said . " Do n't worry , darlin ' . I 'll take care of your father . He 's mostly got over what happened last winter , but I think it kind of hurts him still . Might heal up better if you went away . Course I 'll miss you , darlin ' . Terribly . But I do have the feeling , this is what you were meant to do . The clever one . " " I 'm not clever , " Betsy said . But a tiny nerve jumped in her . Could I be the clever one ? Clever ? Betsy left for New York the first of June . The untidy lilacs were all in bloom in the yard the day she left , the road was shimmering black with tar , a bobwhite called from the fields behind the house . Minnie May drove her in to the Back Bay Station to take the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed all over her and squealed with excitement . She had said goodbye to Tom Jekyll earlier , before he left to catch his train . After all the months when , she realized , he had tried not to have to look at her , he put his arms around her and kissed her and when she put her head back she saw that there were tears in his eyes . " Goodbye , Bets , " he said . " I still feel as if you were just a little tike , you know . Going off like this . " " Daddy , " she said , and kissed him again . But more than anything she wanted to get away . She could n't begin to think , begin anything , till she was clear away and could start fresh . All the way in to the station Minnie May talked steadily . For they had just heard the great news . Maizie , who had just gone home , was going to have a baby . It overshadowed everything else . Betsy realized that her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Maybe this will fix everything up for Maizie , " Betsy said . " Bets , that 's what I 'm prayin ' for . It 's bound to make a big difference . The only thing disturbs me , Maizie looks so poorly . It takes a lot out of a woman to go through nine months of having a baby . I dread it for her . But if it 'll bring that man around . . . . She 's going to have to go to Dr. Cunningham . I 'm going to make her . I just know he can do wonders for her . She 's got to do it , for her own sake and my sake and the baby 's sake . All of our sakes . " They kissed goodbye on the gritty , windy platform of the station as the train came roaring into the cave of the Back Bay . Betsy remembered how the engine used to rush in like this when she and Leda March took the train home from school . That was long , long ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bags up on the car platform and she climbed the steps , and turned at the top to wave to her mother . Minnie May waved back , with both hands. , and then she walked away . She was going directly from the station to Maizie 's . THAT OCTOBER Betsy used to walk from the Barrington Hotel , where she lived , to catch the Lexington Avenue street car to work , with the highest sense of jubilation . She was in a new world . There would never be anything again like those New York mornings before nine . The sun was bright and the air was sharp , brilliant and gay . The people hurried along the sidewalks on the way to work . In the florists ' shops they were setting out pots of bronze chrysanthemums . There were also orchids on display , crammed lavishly into glass vases . But they belonged to the night world , the same New York as the drawn , shirred curtains in the big apartment houses where the rich women were still asleep . In the mornings , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' sleep , Betsy felt as strong as ten men and her heart was as high as the air , and of all the places in the world there were to be in , she was glad to be here . She walked with long , vigorous steps on her high heels across the freshly watered streets , in her new , smart little tweed dresses and her little hats . She knew she looked like a boy and she was glad ; she felt like a boy . To be a young girl in New York in those days was to be like a young boy : as free , as unshackled , as adventurous . She had got a job on a fashion magazine at twenty-five dollars a week . She would stride in to the big office where her desk was . There were about ten desks in this room . Some of them belonged to older women , wheelhorseswho did the work of copy-reading , proof correction , who were constantly on the telephone to the press . At the other desks sat girls like Betsy , young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and minds quick to imitate the way things were done . They worked here for small wages and were glad to get them for the experience , the prestige , that a job on Lady gave them . Many of the most important women in New York had started out on Lady . The advertising manager of one of the biggest department stores , a famous woman writer , countless stylists and buyers of the first rank , to say nothing of several women now married to great New York fortunes  --  had begun their careers just this way , as a little girl on Lady ; a caption-writer , an assistant to the fashion editor . Betsy was one of the assistants to the fashion editor . Shortly after she had come in in the morning she would get a summons on the telephone , and march in to Mrs. Edison 's office , where everything was babel and chaos and sunshine . The offices of the editors were quite different from the big , bare cowpasturewhere the young women 's desks were . The editors ' offices werep281decorated along Lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Edison 's office , on the south side of the twenty-fifth floor , was as chic as a rich woman 's sitting-room . The chairs were covered in a chintz with huge lilies , there were baroque mirrors and framed originals of covers painted for Lady by French artists , the carpet was soft deep beige , and Mrs. Edison sat behind a frail , beautiful little fruit-wood desk . Mrs. Edison had a clever , red mouth , cold eyes , long red fingernails , and exquisite clothes that she bought in Paris on her two yearly trips abroad . When Betsy came into Mrs. Edison 's office in the morning , incredible numbers of things would be getting attended to at the same time . On one telephone Mrs. Edison 's voice , low , husky , assured : " Mr. Goldstein ? Mr. Goldstein . We thought that a very amusing little pajama and we hope so much to get it into a page of . . . " On another telephone her skinny little secretary , nerves worn ragged but voice poised and social : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Colony at one , Friday . " On a third telephone another of the assistants , young and tall , looking like an illustration for Lady on a total of $19.85 , speaking in imitation of Mrs. Edison'svoice , but more eager , younger : " Could you have the bracelets and the clips at Schumann 's studio for a sitting at three ? . . . " And all over the chintz-covered armchairs , clothes : dresses , furs , a box full of hats spilling out on the sofa . On Mrs. Edison 's desk , a dizzying clutter of papers , photographs , photostats , cables , big first-draft drawings , and among these a pair of bright red gloves , two pigskin purses . There were fresh flowers in vases . The cool , yellow , October sunshine came in and lay upon everything . In a corner cringed a little Jewish messenger who had brought the box of hats and was to wait for them . Every woman in the room except the secretary had her hat on . " Jekyll , I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hammerstein and Koven 's showing , it wo n't be any good but talk to them nicely . Miss Grindle will give you the address . . . . " Now she was off on another tangent , the telephone again : " Is that Mrs. Lovell ? Oh , Mrs. Lovell , this is Clare Edison . About what we were saying last night at dinner . I am hoping so much you will let us photograph your two little girls . . . . " But now her voice was soft , disarming , husky in merely a well-bred way . The secretary was talking on the telephone too : " This is Mrs. Edison 's secretary . Will you have a round bunch of red camellias here by half-past twelve ? Mrs. Edison wants to wear them out to lunch .... " Betsy might be sent on any one of a dozen different sorts of jobs out into the Seventh Avenue garment district . She might be sent to help at a fashion sitting where professional models with beautiful , expressionless faces and tall , curveless bodies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the country to help a photographer to take pictures of the interior of some fashionable woman 's Long Island house , or of some children in ridinghabits . In a pinch she might be sent to fill in at a sitting herself , as a model . All the fashion assistants were chosen with an eye to their ability to pinch-hit as models ; they received nothing extra for doing it , but it increasedtheir value if they photographed well , their faces were recognized in the trade ; it was just another little wedge . Betsy photographed well . With her boy-like , stubborn , tilted face and her thin boy 's body , she looked the way young girls were supposed to look in the pages of Lady . It was exciting to be a model occasionally , and try to make friends with the strange , mute , beautiful professionals , , and have her picture appear in photostat , in proof , in the finished issue . She sent the pictures home to MinnieMay , before the issue had appeared on the stands , to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very best out of New York life . She worked very hard all day . She was on her feet most of the time . It was quicker to walk to Seventh Avenue than to get there any other way except by taxi , and taxis could not be put on expense accounts ; the assistantsrode in them occasionally when they were accompanying one of the editors , who took taxis everywhere . Sometimes , when lunch came in the middle of an important job , an editor would take an assistant along to one of the fashionable restaurants where the editors always lunched : the Colony , Voisin 's . The luncheon would be of a professional nature : everything was professional ; it would be with a head buyer , or a publicity head , or a man who owned a great shop . " This is my little assistant , Miss Jekyll , Miss Weinkopf . How chic you 're looking ! " They would eat the most delicious food , which the editor would put on her expense account , and Betsy would keep perfectly quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would look wisely around the restaurant , recognizing faces ; there was Mrs. Addison Fiske at her regular corner table , there was Curtis Bright , there was a table of debutantes ( Fisher , de Haviland , Hayden , Perkins ) . When she was spoken to she tried to be as intelligent as possible about the things these women were so terribly intelligent about : fashion trends , the market . The rest of the time the assistants lunched , alone if they were out on a job , on a sandwich and a cup of coffee picked up somewhere ; in bunches of two or three if they were in the office and could arrange to go out together , to Schrafft 's or to little Italian speakeasies they discovered where it was possible to get a cocktail and a meal served in a kitchen for seventy-five cents . They trooped in and out of these places , looking like debutantes , as fresh and smart , and the sum they had all spent for their collective clothes would not equal the price of one debutante 's dress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were going somewhere . New York was a germ in their bones and in their blood . They were embarking on a hard , exciting trip to the top . They were learning fast , faster than they had ever learned in school . Their eyes were sharp , their memories were like steel traps . They were getting their New York values . They were learning to keep an eye to the main chance . Betsy 's principal friend was a girl named Elizabeth too , but called Liz : Liz Symonds . She was taller than Betsy , with short tight red curls all over her head , a long , beautiful , strong neck , and shoulders as broad as a man 's ; she dressed in tweeds and bright-colored knitted caps , and she was always used , when they needed somebody quick for a sitting , for the outdoor girls ;  |p283the  girls in riding-habits or wearing skiing clothes presumably in St. Moritz or Davos . She had brilliant high color and great energy and although she was as ambitious as the others she talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their lunches in cheap speakeasies she referred to Lady as the old prostitute . At all times her language was colorful and unrestrained . Nevertheless she seemed to be the favorite among the assistants with Mrs. Edison . Liz got the only really indulgent smiles Mrs. Edison ever dealt out . She would stride into the beautiful little cluttered office and sit down and put her feet up on the arm of a chair . " Mrs. E. , darling , you have me hanging on the ropes . I 'm worn to the bone . You 're a hard , merciless woman . Ca n't I have the afternoon off ? " Then would appear , miraculously , the indulgent smile . But the indulgence went no further than the smile . " Liz , you 're a dreadful girl . I 'm positive you only want to meet a beau . Get out of that chair and go to work . " " Naturally you 're absolutely right , " Liz would say cheerfully , and hoist her long legs and body up from the deep cushions . Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirty-five dollars a week . Up until now she had lived in an apartment with two other girls , one a model in a Fifty-seventh Street shop and the other in an advertising agency . But the lease ran out the first of that October and the model married a wholesale manufacturer and the advertising girl decided to move back to her family in East Orange and commute . Liz moved into the Barringtonwith Betsy . By that time they were on good , easy , free-speaking terms , like two young men . Neither trespassed on the other 's privacy . In the Barrington the rooms were tiny cubicles ; there was one bathroom to every two rooms . Betsy and Liz occupied two such rooms . The hotel was for women only . There were other young girls , and women ranging up to elderly spinsters . They were all working women . By nine o'clock in the morning the hotel was virtually deserted . It was a very inexpensive place to live , and very respectable ; men were not permitted above the mezzanine . Betsy hoped that made her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Baboonery . It was a gay , confident life ; the smell of success , in different , dissolving scents , was over everything . It was over the whole of New York for them in those days , it was over the working days and the sparkling nights and it was in the way they lived . In the cubicle just beyond Liz 's lived a girl they saw sometimes going out to the elevator : tall and hawk-faced with black hair ; she worked in the daytimes , somewhere , and at night , sometimes even when they came in very late from dancing , they could hear the sound of her typewriter , steadily ; she must be going to be a writer . The muffled clatter of her persistence was one more note in the rising crescendo around them . At half past eight the women came out of the Barrington on their ways to work , and all the young ones had the same look : of pursuing something , cleverly , wisely , shrewdly , looking their best , dressing their best , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their pursuit , and there was no need to ask what it was they pursued . It was success . Success was scattered all over New York like specks of glittering mica fluttering in the city wind , settling on everything : in the interiors of town cars at night , halted for an instant in traffic ; on the lapels of doormen at nightclubs ; on a florist 's boy as he ran up the steps of a private house to deliver a square , white box ; on Mrs. Edison 's silver foxes as she hurried out of her office on the way to the Colony to lunch , on her chauffeur 's uniform as he followed her bearing packages ; on taxis and the awnings that led up to apartment entrancesand people having tea in the lounge of a hotel , on men 's bowler hats as they waited outside the grill of a speakeasy . The golden dust settled on the tops of the drinks that were being drunk all over New York , on the Side Cars and the Martinis and the Manhattans and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making New York sunshine different from other sunshine . Liz knew quantities of men and introduced them to Betsy , and through each man they met a dozen more . They each had a little book in which they wrote down names and telephone numbers , of men in the Federal Reserve Bank , men in art galleries on Fifty-seventh Street , the office telephone numbers of men with families in the Seventies , of men in business offices , and dozens and dozens of customers ' men . The girls were on as confidenta footing as the men . The men had unlimited money ; but they had unlimited youth , and were equals . They said what they pleased and did what they pleased , knowing that if one man did not like it there was anotherwho would . With their long , boylike stride they walked into the Embassy Club , the Lido , the Broadway nightclubs with a floor the size of a handkerchief , the theatres , along the side-streets towards a taxi , into a hundred speakeasies on all the West and East streets near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiters , dancing , listening , talking : with their cropped heads held high on their long necks , their broad shouldershunched as they leaned on a speakeasy table , their hair bare when they pulled their hats off with a careless gesture in a restaurant ; their hips narrow , their legs long . On Sundays Liz and Betsy would get up around noon . One of them would take her breakfast , which was left outside the door in a box , to the other 's room , and in pajamas they would sprawl on the bed and one chair and talk , or lie on their stomachs on the floor like children and read the Sunday paper . They spent this one day loafing , smoking cigarettes , discussingpeople , mending clothes , drinking milk that they kept on their windowsills , until the street turned dark and the lights went on and they separated to get dressed to go out to dinner . One Sunday , lying on the floor in a flood of autumn afternoon sunshine , Liz said " Look . " Betsy leaned over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing her nails . Liz was looking at the front page of the society section of the New York Times . She pointed to a photograph of a man in tweeds leaning on a shooting stick . " Mr. William Fellowes at Green Run , Virginia , " the caption said . " That 's Eddy 's beau , " Liz said . Eddy was what she called Mrs. Edisonp285in private . " Ai n't he beautiful ? " It was a very handsome man , with a heavy , vain face . " Madly , " Betsy said . " But I thought she was married ? " " Oh , absolutely ; she 's got a baby . You should have seen her last year when she was pregnant , just as dynamic as ever , dashing to the hospital at the last minute shrieking back to poor little Porky  --  ' Get those hat pages redone ! ' But if you could see what she 's married to you 'd see why the poor darling really rates a lover . " " Mr. Edison ? Does n't she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's just the least bit hunchbacked , for one thing . " " What on earth did she marry him for ? " " To get into the Social Register , " Liz said simply . " That was the only thing she could n't get for herself . He is frightfully good family . " " That seems perfectly silly . " " It works very well . They give dinners .... This boy , Fellowes , is the love of her life . It 's very romantic . She 's been in love with him since she was about our age . But he 's always been married to some horror with lots of do-do-deo-do who would n't divorce him . He goes abroad every year just when Eddy does the Paris collections . Terribly coincidental . Everybodyfixes it on those big Long Island weekends so as they 'll have adjoiningrooms . " " Does n't Mr. Edison mind ? Do n't people get shocked ? " " No , my precious . That 's one of the reasons we all love New York so . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't believe he functions so good . And as far as everybody goes  --  do n't you think it 's nice , and romantic ? She 's got to have some fun , poor darling . After all , tolerance is the most important thing you can have . Intolerant people really are the last straw . I mean , what 's life for except to be happy in ? I think you ought to be just as happy as you can get yourself without hurting anybody , " Liz said . Betsy listened intently . Never in all the casual years of school had she studied as carefully as she did all the time now . She was learning about New York , the greatest place in the world . She was learning how to becomea New Yorker . As Liz finished , however , she spotted another picture on the same page , and snatched it up from the floor . " Look ! " she cried . " That 's a picture of Leda March . She used to be my best friend . She married her cousin last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James standing at the rail of a liner , and the caption said they were returning from their honeymoon in Europe . Liz viewed the picture critically . " Terribly good-looking , " she said . " She 's old Boston family , and so 's he , " Betsy said proudly . " I think he 's got loads of money . Do n't you think he 's attractive , too ? " " Yep . " Liz dropped the newspaper as if she had thought of something else . " But why do these divine girls our age want to get married , that 's what I want to know ? " Betsy pulled her knees up under her chin.  | " But would n't you get married if you fell madly in love with somebody ? Somebody divine , with lots of money , and everything ? " " I 'm damned if I would . Some day , but why now ? I suppose you had to years ago if you wanted to stop being a jeune Lille and have any fun at all , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage that would be worth the things I 'd have to give up ? I mean if I did it while I 'm still young ? " " Mmmm , " Betsy murmured . She was watching Liz , who was lying now on her back on the floor , smoking ; she wore a pair of dark blue polka-dotted pajamas and her short red curls were rough . " This interests nee very much , " Liz said . " I think about it . I mean , the question is always coining up and I think , well , how about it ? But I think it 's this way . We 've stopped being women , in the old sense of women . Girls like you and inc . We ca n't make the regular calculations . It 's more as if we were men . 1 mean , to figure on . We work , and we have a big time , and if we do n't like what goes on we can do something else . I guess it spoils us . I know I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to make all the compromises and adjustments and bothering with all that , no matter how much I was in love . I mean , love is divine , but why marriage ? Well , money , yes . But what a lot to give up to get money . Maybe I'lI be making a lot of money some day . Or maybe somebody will be foolish enough to give me some . But to give up my independence and the ability to do just what I please when I please , and being accountable to nobody  --  for any love-nest I do n't care how cosy and warm  --  I think it 's crazy . " " How about wanting to be loved ? " " Oh , pooh ! I mean , that 's absurd . God knows I 'll be loved a lot more by somebody who does n't feel he 's tied to me . Like poor Tubby , or Pete , or Tom Hawkins . Or even the beautiful Mr. Starr , I think his resistance is wearing down , Betsy . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved that I wanted , I 'd certainly stay out of marriage . If you 're not married to them they have to keep showing you how much they love you to remind you , and that 's the divine part . But actually I do n't think I 'm much interested in being loved , the way you mean it . All I want is to have F-U-N . " She spelled out the word . " No , but I mean the thing about having somebody love you and you love them back , terrifically , more than anything in the world , so that you want to be together all the time . " " Oh , pooh ! I think that 's absolutely abnormal . It makes my flesh crawl . I know what you mean . And maybe when I 'm absolutely doddering with false teeth I 'll be all for it . But not now . The thing is , I love to feel free , and strong , and I have the feeling that that love business absolutely incapacitatespeople ; they get all weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time in the most completely loathesome way . I mean , I think going to bed with somebody fascinating is one thing , but you ought to do it gaily , and for Heaven 's sake have a little fun doing it . " " Were you ever really  --  in love ? " Betsy asked . " Millions of times . Sometimes shatteringly . But thank God I never corn/pletely went ga-ga enough to get married . All the girls I 've ever known who have gotten married are leading the most vomitous lives , with their husbands either pawing them or refusing to speak , and the whole house reeking of babies ' diapers.  --  Have you ? " " Once , " Betsy said . " Last year . It almost killed me . I was played for a complete sucker , I guess . I would have cleaned his shoes . He came from New York . " " Did you want to marry him ? " " Terribly . " " You ought to thank God you did n't , if you felt that way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun would be if you ran things your own way . Are you still crazy about him ? " " Not really . I mean I 'm glad I 'm out of that hell . But I get a funny feelingsometimes . Sort of like homesickness . Sort of sad , because it 's all over and I did put everything I had into it . " " D' you go to bed with him ? " " No . " " Maybe if you had you would have pulled out of it better . I mean , I would n't ever dream of marrying anybody I 'd never been to bed with to find out if I really liked them . I think it 's madness not to . I mean , you might simply loathe everything about it , and then just think if you 'd marriedthem . Betsy , I 've sometimes wanted to ask you , have n't you ever done it with anybody ? " " Yes . I did . Afterwards . With his roommate . " " You do n't look as if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't . It just was n't anything at all . " " I know what you mean , " Liz said thoughtfully . " The only thing about it is , " Betsy said , hesitantly , " I do n't like the feeling that they think they 've conquered you . That you 've surrendered to them . " " Me surrender ! " Liz gave a loud laugh , a hoot . " I 'd like to see anybody conquer me . Look , if I should do that with anybody I 'd conquer them every bit as much as they 'd conquer me . That 's the way I feel . I go out for what I please and I turn down what I do n't like . I 'm in command of what I do with my life . I mean , for instance , I do n't consider that I 'm what people call promiscuous . Not a bit . I 'm good and choosy . Anything I do , I do because I 've decided I want to do it . Nobody 's going to have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's going to be some poor shrinking little man I 've decided I like . " Betsy nodded thoughtfully , and ran her fingers through her short curly hair . " That was the thing , " she said . " It just seemed so empty and nothing . And as if I was licked , somehow . " Liz shook her head . " You went about it all the wrong way , then , " she said . " You want to be triumphant . Maybe you were trying to get even with your real beau , or something . I know how it would feel . But that does n't count , it 's madness.  | Do what you want to do . March in and conquer . Have fun . Be on top of everything , running things . Or at least act as if you were . The great thing in life is to put on a good act . Do I look like a miserable wage-slave making thirty-five bucks a week ? " " You certainly do n't . You look as if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe I will be . If you act as if you were something somehow you always get to be it . That 's the way I see it . Look at Eddy . It 's all a great , big , beautiful act . Actually she comes from Ohio or somewhere and never had a dime , and look at her , the wonderful Mrs. Edison , editor of Lady , minks , silver foxes , Social Register , Long Island , Paris , what have you . Do n't you adore her ? Hard as nails , but underneath she 's such a cutie . " " I 'd love to be rich , and famous , " Betsy said . " And you will be , Innocent , if you stick to it and just listen to the words of wisdom I drop you . I can give you lots of the best quality advice on where and when and how . Symonds on Success . Symonds on Sex . And you ask me to dinner when you 've got your own chateau at Newport , dearie . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . Liz began to pull things out of the small closet that the Barrington provided : hats , dresses , jackets ; putting things together , discarding things , making combinations , evolving the costume in which she would emerge this evening , tall , beautiful , and chic . " Who are you going out with ? " Betsy asked . She picked up her cigarettes and prepared to depart . " Mr. Starr . Again . He totters , Betsy ; he seems to feel the thrill of life along his keel . Even if he is the son of Mrs. Horatio Starr . " Betsy laughed . " That ' man I told you about took me to a party of Mrs. Horatio Starr 's . She was his aunt . " " Honestly ? You ought to be able to use that somewhere . Heegleef , dear . Per aspera ad astra , meaning the Starrs . I could just eat the Starrs . I 'd like to wriggle my bare toes in them . They 're so rich . We never eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , the sweetie-pants . Where are you going ? " " Speakeasying . With Basey . " " What would we do without our customers ' men ? " As Betsy got up to go she caught Liz 's eyes , and suddenly they both grinned hard at each other . Standing in the middle of the little room , Liz threw her arms straight up in a long stretch , on tiptoe , her head bent back in a yawn , the muscles of her neck standing out , her waist hard and flat , her thighs lean . Then abruptly she relaxed and grinned at Betsy again : a smile full of sweetness , gaiety , and forthrightness . Betsy went out through the bathroom to her own room . Before she turned on the light she stood at the window looking over the square of New York that could be seen outside . The lights were going on over the city , twinkling and merry . She put her hands around her upper arms and hugged herself hard . It was a new world . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not belong to her . She wasp289young , and strong , and charged with ambition . New York was like the slotmachinesin the speakeasies where you stood and put in quarters ; somebody had to get the jack-pot , and she felt in her bones that it would be she . She used to write her mother long letters about the famous places she went to at night and the famous faces she saw there . Minnie May wrote back that she was thrilled . " Vincent Astor , Dorothy Parker , Heywood Broun and the Marchioness of Queensberry all in one evening really is too much riches to be true , Bets . What bliss ! Now you have an inkling of how I used to feel when , as a young girl , I visited your dear Aunt Glory and her husband in Rome . I was presented to the King and Queen and we used to see the Duke of Aosta frequently . Such a handsome man . " I have news about Maizie for you , good , thank Heaven . Her doctor has put her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baby is born the end of February . I feel so relieved about it and I keep thinking that that man ca n't get at her now she is safely in bed . It seems that several times she started to miscarry and since she is so set on having this child it would have been too heart-breaking if the poor child had had that to endure too . I wanted her to move right out here into her own room where we could all take the best of care of her . I can tell you if that man had started any of his monkeyshines whatever they are with her under my care I would have got some oil boiling in the kitchen and popped him in . It would have given me the greatest of pleasure . But I must say he seems to be behaving better . She chose to go to his mother 's for her long ordeal of being bedridden  --  she'snot allowed to get up out of bed at all  --  because I think she felt apprehensive about being even as far as Hampton from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that man and his whole family . Personally the baby will always be a Green and a Jekyll to me , I hate the very sound of the name Rudd . But anyway , Bets , she 's at Mrs. Rudd 's house on Commonwealth Avenue , all established in a very comfortable , sunny bedroom , and I must say I feel the greatest relief . They have engaged a maid especially to look after her and make her bed with her in it , since she does n't actually need a nurse . I go in every day to see her , of course , and take her little things . She seems so much calmer . I am sure all will come out well for her now at last that she is being allowed a little rest . That blessed doctor is right around to see that she is as she should be , and he orders early hours and long times of quiet rest in the daytime , and I am so grateful to him I could spit . Now she can rest and be in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandchild  --  and when he comes there 'll be that to make her happy and take her mind off that monster , and if he begins making her wretched and unhappy and exhausted again then  --  well , then , I really will carry out my threats and attend to him myself with a good big knife or gun . " We all long to see you , Bets dear , and the first chance you get try to come up and pay us a flying visit even though I know your position on Lady keeps you tied down . I 'm so proud of my daughters . Maizie to becomea mother and you having such a gay time in New York and making a name for yourself . I have decided to send Jane to Miss Sheraton 's next year . I have made great friends with Anita Cunningham  --  Dr. Cunningham'swife  --  and she will do all that is necessary about Jane . Both the Brats are making so many friends around here . Jane hits it off splendidly with the little Cunningham girl , Sara , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , so entertaining and yet thoroughly solid and Bostonian . Your father does n't get on with Dr. Cunningham worth a hoot , I 'm sorry to say , but he has so many prejudices about Boston people . I do my best to break him of them . Everything of that kind just takes time . The Brats really are turning right into little Boston beans . So much happier for them . We are having dinner at the Cunninghams ' tonight and going to the Symphony . All I hope is that your father wo n't go to sleep . I am willing to grant that classical music can be mighty soporific . Anita Cunningham wants me to serve on her Welfare Committee with her , and I welcome the prospect . I 'd like to get my teeth into something 1 can really work at and put some life into . " OF ALL HER NEW BEAUX Betsy thought Basey McKean was the nicest . He was in love with her , and she thought that probably she was in love with him . Being in love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do-or-die businessshe had once thought it ; she even found it was possible to be in love with more than one person at a time , for she was quite a lot in love with Basey , and also with a young Englishman who worked in Wall Street , named Dudley Forsythe , and a little in love with Max Wilkes , who was an assistant in an uptown art gallery and knew everybody and never stopped talking . He was enchanted with Betsy and kept exclaiming over the tilted-back poise of her head , which he declared was the lost head of the Victory of Samothrace . " Not the least Greek , you understand , but of our time , nco-Gracco-Manhattan . Divine . Darling , you must let me take you round to Benson Levy 's studio . He 'd go mad . He could do such marvels in terra-cotta with you . He 'd make you famous overnight in New York as a beauty . Betsy , darling , I do adore you so . You make me think of the ocean , the wine-dark sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to let me take you to Benson 's . " It was all so thrilling . Betsy thought it would be a wonderful thing to be made a beauty overnight , and one afternoon a date was fixed for her to come to Levy 's studio . She could not get off from work till late , and she rode uptown in a taxi to Fifty-eighth Street as the lights were coming on in the shops ; free from the day 's work she felt exhilarated , as if she had had a drink already . She ran up the stairs of the building and knocked at the door marked " Benson Levy . " Max threw open the door and smiled at her and took both her hands . " This is my angel baby beauty , " he cried over his shoulder . " Benson , do come here and simply look . "  |p291She  stood there laughing , a little out of breath from running upstairs , with her head back . A thin , dark man came forward out of the shadows of the big room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " Max talks my ear off about you , " he said , very gently , as if he did not want to frighten her , she thought . It was so absurd to think that anything could ever frighten her . " Max , angel , " she said . " I 've got a taxi waiting downstairs and not a dime to pay it with . Would you ? I wanted to get here as quick as I could . " Max ran down the stairs . It was a trick Betsy had learned from Liz , of going to meet beaux in a taxi and getting them to pay for it at the other end . They appeared to love doing it . It was convenient . But more than this , to Betsy it had an air about it , a cosmopolitanism , a dash . To arrive glowing , breathless , brimming over with chatter , exuding youth , and waving a hand over a shoulder to a waiting cab ... . " I did n't realize you were so young , " Benson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sit down , wo n't you , and I 'll give you some sherry , not very good . Better than bath-tub gin . " She hated to sit down , even , and sat on the edge of her chair , tense with sheer vitality . She could not erase the smile of her delight from her face . She looked around her in the shadowy room . On high stands were objects covered with wet cloths . It was a sculptor 's studio ! Max came back , talking steadily as he entered , and they all sat and Max did most of the talking . Betsy was conscious of Levy looking at her , and when she got up to go with Max , he said , " I hope you arc going to let me do a head of you . " " This awful work I have to do . . . " she said . " How about your lunch hours ? You could stretch them out a little , could n't you ? " " I guess so . " They arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she left , running down the stairs again with Max hand in hand . In the cab he kissed her gaily . The kind of being in love Betsy had with Max was gay and unbothering . " Darling , you were superb , " he said . " I do adore you . " For a while from that day Betsy 's life was more hectic than ever . She would get to Levy 's studio at one and stay for an hour and a half , while he worked on her head in clay . He did not need to have her stand still , and so she walked around the studio , with her head tipped back triumphantly , smoking cigarettes . It was funny . In the old days she had tipped her head back because she was little and wanted to look up , and later she had tipped it back to look at boys she was dancing with , and to these had been added an imitation of Liz 's glorious poise of the head . Now Levy was doing her head and she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really beautiful at all  --  she never had been in other places . But she had the New York thing , the thing they liked to look at.  | Levy smoked too and talked , and they had nice , companionable times together . One day when he was almost through with the head , he kissed her , suddenly , as she was going away . She laughed and kissed him back . " You 're a lovely child , " he said . " So terribly young and so sweet . You move me very much . " After that he began to ask her to go out to dinner with him ; he became one more beau . There were far more invitations for Betsy than there were nights to divide up . Sometimes she made late dates and met some man after she had dined with another , and went dancing or to a midnight show . She felt rich . All these nun were in different stages of being in love with her , and she was in different , pleasant , untroubling stages of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other love , the being iii love with Oren . She shrank front remembering that more than she could help , the agony , the longing , the humiliation . She did not ever want to be in love like that again . She thought that she never would be . Nobody could be in love like that , so terribly , but once in their lives . It was something she had lived through and passed beyond . Sometimes in a taxi , late at night , by chance she would look out and see that apartment house where she had gone once with Oren , where his family lived . She always looked away quickly . The sight of it , the number on the apartment awning , were too stabbing still . She did not want to remembersuffering . There was nothing but pleasure in the life she was learningto live . The head , cast in plaster and terra-cottaed , was a success . Levy declared that he was satisfied with it and that he would put it in his spring show at the Rangoon Galleries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It looked so coppery and triumphant . That was her neck , long and muscular , her lifted chin , her nose , the sockets of her eyes . Max Wilkes said it was just what he knew it would be , and it was marvellous , and Benson was marvellous , and Betsy was the most marvellous of all . And from Max that must be praise , for he went out to dinner at famous houses and spent weekends on Long Island . Betsy looked forward to the summer that lay far ahead , beyond this winter , for by that time she would know even more people and be asked on weekends on Long Island . They seemed to her to represent something . Dudley Forsythe went away on weekends constantly , but that was principallybecause he was English , and as Liz said , " They ca n't eat enough of the British . " He was very young too , younger than any man Betsy knew in New York , and had brilliant color , and an accent that was sometimes almost incomprehensible . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it ; he said the air affected him like champagne and that furthermore there must be a great difference in the climate because , whereas in England he could drink a good four whisky-sodas without disaster , here in America two did for him nicely . He gave cocktail parties in his flat uptown , which was filled with signed photographs of English beauties , all fair and with their heads tipped down slantingly , taken by Cecil Beaton . He was like ap293child at its own party , rushing round the room with an immense shaker in the shape of the Statue of Liberty that someone had given him , shrieking with delight at each new arrival . Afterwards , when everybody had left around ten , he would take Betsy out to dinner . " Darling , did you ever see such absolute masses of people ? " he would say . " I am so glad to be alone with you , nay sweet . " They would hold hands across the speakeasy table and it was all rather sweet and affectionate . Sometimes Dudley would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling . D' you mind ? " And she would laugh . " Of course I do n't mind . I love you too , Dudley . You 're so sweet . " He was kind , and in a way protective ; not that she needed anyone 's protection . But she liked the feeling that he wanted to look out for her . " Betsy , d' you know I think you scatter yourself . Rather badly . You should n't , you know . I mean I know you 're frightfully young , but after all . Why do n't you concentrate for a bit ? On me , as a matter of fact ? " She laughed , for he was so very young-looking too , and one of the things she loved best about this new life in New York was that very thing , scatteringherself . It was possible to he in an amazing number of places in one day . Dudley did n't understand the magic of that . And besides , he himself got around to all sorts of places when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back of their minds an idea that it would be nice to reserve a girl for their exclusive use , and of course the whole fun was not being reserved . but being , as they said , in circulation . It was probably English of Dudley to talk so much about it . He was very English , or at least not New Yorkish , about a number of things , much as he loved the city . He was , for example , not tolerant . Although he said American girls were glorious , Betsy had noticed that he sometimes said hard and biting things about girls , called them tarts and old hags when they were not in the least . His intolerance showed in the way he criticized the way people lived , pointed to flaws in their morals . It was not his business , Betsy reminded him ; it was not tolerant . That was one of Basey McKean 's greatest virtues , his tolerance . It was impossiblenot to realize that actually he saw through everybody in his wry , mocking way , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them hang themselves in their own time with their own rope . He was rather older than the other customers ' men ; big and lazy and saturnine . He had narrow blue eyes in a face that remained healthy and brown in New York . He dressed carelessly , in Brooks suits with plain white collars and knitted black ties . He knew everybody , and never seemed to put himself out to be pleasant , but Betsy could tell by the way women called to him from tables in speakeasies that they thought he was wonderful . He was never impressed with anything , he walked with a slouch , he knew all the places of yore , and yet Betsy was sure that in his way he loved New York too . She wondered why he had so little ambition ; why he was content to remain a customers ' man . " Why should I do anything else ? " he would say , smiling at her . " I make enough money to make out . The one thing I want to avoid is responsibility . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being alive as you are , kitten . " " But you could be the head of something . You know so much . I never heard of anybody who could repeat so much poetry by heart . " " I might explain that to Mr. Rothstein . I 'm sure he would get your point and make me the head of something . Only I do n't want to be the head of something , see , baby ? I want to be all free and unworried and no stomach ulcers . " She grinned at him and he put his hand out palm up on the speakeasy table for her to put her hand in . " How do you like being my best girl ? " he said . " Millions are screaming , but you 're elected . I love you . I love you because you look like a baby puppy and because you 're so absurd and because you do n't bother me . " " Why should I bother you ? " " You should n't . I like your kind of girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to hear how the other kind call you up . At the office . You do n't . You 're busy , and you have the hard heart of a child . Quote . That 's why we can have such fun together , and why I 'm quite a lot in love with you , pet . " " Me too , " Betsy said . It was just before dinner , and she had come in a taxi to meet Basey at this speakeasy on West Forty-ninth Street , and they were drinking Side Cars . She looked happily round the bar they sat in . It was one of Basey 's favorites . Interesting looking men and girls were sitting at the other tables and at the bar . Betsy stuffed a handful of potato chips into her mouth ; they tasted salty and delicious . The little red-shaded lights were on at all the tables . It was gay , and cosy , and exciting . She squeezed Basey 's hand and wriggled with pleasure . " I love you because you have such a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a present for a good girl . " He leaned over and gave her a light kiss on the cheek . Then he ordered another Side Car for himself . Betsy was not halfway through hers . She always forgot to finish her drinks . She felt intoxicated enough without a drop . But Basey drank a lot ; he was a really heavy drinker . He was never unpleasant when he was drunk ; he was just more like himself , more lazy , wry , tolerant . The fashion assistants on Lady had another value to their superiors , and that was as fillers-in at dinner parties . It was always convenient to have on call a number of charming , lively young women who on no account would ever decline such an invitation although it came at the last minute . It was an unofficial part of their jobs . For them it was worth it , since they had there the opportunity to meet all sorts of famous people , and every introductioncounted in the climb up . Liz Symonds often filled in at Mrs. Edison 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them , and he had become the heaviest of her beaux . Betsy had her first such invitation early in December . When she was dressed she went through the bathroom into Liz 's room to show herself.  |p295Liz  had finished dressing to go out on a date ; she was just putting on a jacket made of tawny red foxes that matched her hair . " For Heaven 's sake , " Betsy said . " Where 'd you get that ? " " At Jaeckel 's , precious , and it cost precisely eight hundred dollars . " " Liz ! How divine you look ! Do you mind telling me where on earth you got eight hundred dollars ? " " In the nicest possible way . What you do is this . Mr. Starr is going to buy some wonderful stock , and he imagines , just makes up in his head , some money which he invests in your name . It 's all on margin anyway , so what 's the difference ? Imaginary money anyway . So when the stock goes up ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the imaginary stock which by that time has made something over eight hundred bucks . And you take it in your little hot hand and walk into Jaeckel 's and say , ' Mr. Jaeckel , have you got a nice fur coat ... " ' " But the eight hundred dollars are n't imaginary . " " You bet they are n't . But the principle is there , the high principle . Mr. Starr never gave you no money , see . All you 're spending is the profits of some money that never existed anyway , so he is n't giving you anything . Your Aunt Sophronisba could n't see anything wrong with that . " " You certainly look marvellous . I wish I had a fur coat . Just one really good thing makes such a difference . If you 've got one good thing you can wear cheap other things and it makes them all look expensive . " " You 're telling me . " Liz put on a tiny felt hat the same orangey-red as her hair and the coat . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the skirt of her pale blue chiffon dress stood out like a morning-glory ; it had silver beads making a girdle round the hips . " Like the nicest possible jeune fine . I hope you make a big killing at Eddy 's tonight . " " I 'm scared pink . " " Do n't be crazy . Get in there and fight . Give all you 've got for dear old You . " " What 'll I talk about ? " " What do you generally talk about ? Talk about you . That 's what the boys will ask you to talk about anyway . Tell ' em you cone from Virginia . " " Well , I do n't , really . I mean , it was such a long time ago . I really conic from Boston . " " Well , then you can all have a good laugh at poor old Boston . But I think you ought to try Virginia sometime . See how it works . " Betsy nodded thoughtfully . It did not really matter much what place you said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up was to declare how divine it was to have gotten away from it . Everybody here seemed to come from somewhere else ; there was hardly a living native New Yorker ; all were loud in relief at being in New York . Nevertheless , she was shy as she walked into Mrs. Edison 's beige and white drawing-room . It was so completely the top of everything . It representedthe pinnacle of the success that everybody was working for . It was far more enviable than the drawing-room of Mrs. Horatio Starr , where Betsy had once been . For the Starrs and the others like them were the backwater , rather dull . Mrs. Edison 's surroundings spelt the acme of everything that was most of the moment in the ' twenties . They held the works of the most fashionable artists , dead and alive , the most talked-about people of the day , the atmosphere of absolute , dead-center chic . But it would never do to show her shyness . It would be all too easy to be swamped in a party like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there fighting . " The faces of the women were beautiful and clever and animated ; there was no help to be expected from them , since to them another woman represented just one thing , competition . Mrs. Edison was the last person to expect a helping hand from : she respected you if you could do well and make a showing on your own , but if you could n't you had forfeited her respect , in work or socially . Now was the time for all Betsy 's technique , for everything she had learned in New York . She lifted her head , remembering that the tilt of it was her great specialty , smiled brilliantly , and sailed in , knowing that she was younger than anybody in this room , as she might have known that she had money in her pocket . At dinner she found that she was seated next to Curtis Bright , who was unquestionably the most famous bachelor in New York . He was about forty , with a small , clipped moustache and sad , restless eyes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the social pages of the guests at every important party in New York . In the summer there were pictures of him at the helm of a racing sailboat ; he was a famous yachtsman , the owner of the Casnpaspe . It was frightening to be sitting next to this man who was hardly a man at all , rather a printed name , a legend . On Betsy 's other side was sitting , she read by his place-card , Mr. William Fellowes . In an instinctive flash she grasped what that meant , for beyond him was Mrs. Edison . She had put Betsy next to him because , as an assistant to Mrs. Edison , Betsy could not possibly be competition with this man Mrs. Edison loved . She stole one good look at him as he settled himself in his place : a big , ruddy-faced man with a well-fed , sleek look ; she could smell his hair-tonic from where she sat . Then Betsy turned her shoulder firmly and began to talk to Curtis Bright . By the middle of dinner his sad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charming to her . He talked to her as if she were a little girl , but the expression of his eyes showed that he admired her as a woman . " And you work on Lady , " he said . " That curious publication . It must be very stupid . Once in France some misguided organization sent the men a great package of magazines , and when they were opened it was found that they were all copies of Lady . Hardly the thing to send men that , one hoped , were going to kill Germans the next day . " Betsy blinked . " You mean you were in the war ? " she said , breathlessly . He smiled sadly . " I was indeed . I suppose that makes me an antique to you . It seems so veryp297odd to me , on the other hand , that you undoubtedly remember nothing about that show . Odd and delightful . Perhaps if I remembered just a little less of it I should be better off . " " Does it sort of haunt you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some things you can forget , but some you ca n't . I ca n't talk about it at a table like this ; the incongruity of it would be insane . It 's just that it was so bloody awful for my generation . None of us will amount to a row of pins , ever , of course . We might as well never have been born  --  far better never . We 're a vacuum , as far as counting goes  --  a missing generation . " Betsy felt tears rise into her eyes . She was putting herself in his place as hard as she could . She had n't realized how empty men of his age who were in the war felt . It was something she had never given any thought to . He was so tragic . Instead of being frightening he had turned out to be pathetic . She wished there were something she could do to make him feel happier . All the time , all these years , at all those parties , he had been going about with this awful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this at least for him , be terribly gay , and terribly young , and yet terribly sympathetic and understanding . " Will you come to tea with me one day ? " he asked . " I sha n't ask you to go to one of these rotten noisy speakeasies . I can give you a good cup of tea or a decent cocktail if you prefer . My man makes excellent cocktails , and I thank God I still have a bit of drinkable whisky left from the deluge . " " I 'd love to , " she said . Into her eyes she tried to put sympathy , trust , youth , enthusiasm , freshness . The effort made her blink . He laughed . " Or should I be corrupting the young ? " he said lightly . " Snatching from the cradle , and all that sort of abominable thing ? " " I 'm quite old , " she said . " I 'm practically twenty . " " Practically twenty , " he repeated , and looked at her as he wiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An antique , " he said . THE WEEKEND AFTER CHRISTMAS , Betsy got Saturday morning off , and went up to Boston to spend the weekend with her family . She took the train after work , Friday . She could not help thinking , as she sat in the club car smoking and looking at the people , how different a person she was than when she had taken the train for New York last June . Then she had known nothing , her heart had been broken , and she had nothing but hope . Now she was a true New Yorker . She had an enviable job . She had got herself a whole string of beaux and kept getting more . Quite a lot of people knew who she was . Although in New York she felt young and breathless , now , on the train , she felt sophisticated . She knocked the coal off the butt of her cigarette and lit another.  |p298It  was fun to be at home with the Brats squealing and hanging on her , and Minnie May asking all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mornings and went down to breakfast in her old corduroy wrapper that she had left at home . She and Minnie May drank coffee and smoked together in the sunny dining-room . But now she was an important person . Outside in the snow in the yard the Brats played with their friends . They had grown , Betsy thought , just since she had been away . Jane especially was a young girl , not a child , who wanted to examine every article of clothing in Betsy's. bags and exclaim over the dresses , the junk jewelry . Glory was a child still , but a very wise-looking one . She stood and stared silently , and seemed to have her own thoughts . She picked up a long string of huge imitationpearls that lay on Betsy 's bureau . " They 're not real , arc they ? " she asked . " I think real are nicer . " " Honestly , " Betsy had said , turning to Minnie May , " she sounds like an old Boston dowager , does n't she ? You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thin , straight little shoulders . The Christmas tree stood , as in those other years now far away , filling the bay window in the living-room . Betsy cried out and admired it , not patronizingly but as a grown woman recapturing a moment of her lost youth . It seemed very long since she had lived in this house . It seemed much more than a year since the last Christmas tree . Then she had been in a fever to get to New York and see Oren . A stab of the old agony struck her as she looked at the mantelpiece where he had stood so many times , leaning on his elbow , suddenly to break out into a wild tap step . She could almost hear the to-da . She had a sad feeling of the waste of it ; she had given her whole heart , and been hurt so , and all for nothing . She was glad she would never be able to love anybody again like that , and at the same time a little melancholy . She would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces . But it was happier , to have only pieces to give . It was nice to be appreciated . It was nice to be in love with people and have them in love with you without there being any hurt in it at all . She opened the presents that had been saved for her from Christmas . She liked best a pigskin purse , from Maizie , and her father 's present , a check for twenty-five dollars . She could use those . Her mother 's present , a small fitch fur , was , she thought , a measly little thing and she could not wear it by itself ; however , in the spring she could have a suit made by one of those inexpensive little tailors that you had to work with , and have the fur incorporatedas a collar . A year ago she would have been enchanted at owning a real piece of fur , she thought amusedly . A year ago she knew nothing . " How 'd Maizie get me this ? " she asked . " I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Lambert got it , " Minnie May said . " I have to admit , he 's behaved real well . Seems to me having a baby and all Maizie 's been through 's done him a lot of good . He got all the presents she wanted to give people . A man does n't enjoy that kind of shopping . I 'm so happy about it . Reckon things are going to come out right , after all . I feel like I could relax and enjoy life if Maizie was all fixed up . "  |p299She  still loves Maizie , best of all of us , Betsy thought . But now she did not feel the pang of jealousy that she used to feel . On Sunday afternoon they went in town to see Maizie . A neat middleagedIrish maid opened the door of the big house on Commonwealth Avenue , and they stepped into an interior that Betsy viewed with amusement . She had forgotten that such modes of decoration existed , she said to herself . The dark walnut woodwork , the wide , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of the stairs and on the landing , the heavy , dark-red velvet portieres  --  it had its own kind of chic , of the moulderingold aristocracy in the cities like Boston and Philadelphia . Mrs. Rudd received them . She was tall and upholstered in handsome brown cloth . " I think your house is charming , " Betsy said with the frank look that was always so successful . " There are n't many houses left like it . I wish you 'd let us photograph it for Lady some day . I work on Lady , you know . " Mrs. Rudd turned her large gaze on Betsy . " My dear Betsy , " she said . " I should n't dream of such a thing . This is not New York , you know . " Betsy almost laughed . They went up the deeply-carpeted stairs to Maizie 's room . Maizie was lying with her head on two pillows ; her brilliant hair was spread out ; she wore a satin nightgown with a bedjacket to match . She looked ecstatically happy . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and kissed her . She was very thin , but that was no doubt from lying in bed for so long . There was no mistaking the look of radiant happiness in her face . " Is n't it wonderful about the baby ? " she cried . " Mrs. Rudd , show Betsy the layette .  --  It 's all in those drawers over there . " She waved her hand toward a small bureau at the other side of the big , comfortable bedroom . Lambert came in while they were exclaiming over the pretty baby 's clothes . He shook hands with Betsy and stood at the foot of his wife 's bed . Betsy thought he looked much older than the last time she had seen him . His dark face was much more serious ; he did not have such a wild look . Having babies changed people all round , she thought ; made them get serious about whatever it all was ; they stopped being young people . " How do you like our heroine , Betsy ? " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay in bed all these months . We 're hoping it will be twins to pay her for all her trouble . " Mrs. Rudd lifted her eyebrows , but indulgently . Maizie smiled at Lambert and he smiled back . Betsy saw Minnie May look from Maizie 's face to Lambert 's and back again . Minnie May did not look worried any more . Babies certainly had their uses , bringing people together . All of them , Maizie and Lambert and Mrs. Rudd and Minnie May , talked about only one thing : the baby . Everything was plans for the baby , little jokes about what to call the baby , more clothes they were ordering for the baby ; plans for Maizie to go to Manchester for the sea air as soon as the baby was born and she had stayed three weeks at the hospital , which would bring them to the end of March . They talked about the nurse that had been engaged already for the baby , the nurse that had been engaged to take care of Maizie at the hospital , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week and the week before that . No wonder Maizie was happy . The world of this house revolved around her and the miracle that she was about to perform . " My wife is a born mother , " Lambert announced . " Darling , you should have thought of this before . We 're going to have an extensive family and they will all look like their mother , Betsy . " " No , like their father , " Maizie said , smiling at him . " You 'll be like the old woman in the shoe , " Betsy said , playing up . " Do n't you remember ... . There was an old woman who lived in a shoeAnd had so many children she did n't know what to do . But there vas a young woman who lived in a shoe , And she did n't have any children , for she knew what to do.  --  that 'll be me , if I ever get married ! " Betsy said . But her little joke , so well meant , was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was a silence . " Youth , youth , what wo n't you think up to say next ? " Lambert murmured . That relieved the atmosphere , but Betsy felt annoyed with all of them . Even Lambert could have been less stuffy . Youth indeed . Anybody would laugh at that , except a Bostonian . They had no tolerance , that was the thing ; no tolerance at all . " We must all leave Maizie now , " Mrs. Rudd said after a while . " Dr. Forbes wants her to be very quiet most of the time . Have a little nap if you can , dear . " Betsy kissed Maizie goodbye . " Make Lambert wire me the minute it arrives , " she said . " And I 'll do my damnedest to come up and sec my nephew . Or niece . " " It 's going to be a nephew , " Maizie said radiantly . Her face was flushed . How awful it must be just to stay in bed all the time and never sec anybody but just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lamb , kiss me goodbye , darling , " Maizie said . He bent over her and Betsy saw the white , very thin arms go around his neck . When Betsy and Minnie May said goodbye in the big dark hall downstairs , Mrs. Rudd barely touched Betsy 's fingers with hers . " Goodbye , " she said . She must still be stuffy about that rhyme , Betsy thought . She was silly if she thought Betsy cared ; for Mrs. Rudd meant a little bit less than nothing to her . She could be stuffy all she wanted to . She seemed to be on the best of terms with Minnie May ; they took a long time saying goodbye , discussing matters about the baby and both saying over and over how wonderful Maizie was being . Minnie May was so different from Bostonians , Betsy thought , watching them ; but she always managed to make everybody like her , no matter how different they were . If she wanted to be liked in Boston , she would be ; you could trust her . It mightp301take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now look at her ; you could trust her to get where she wanted to . Minnie May took Betsy to the station and they stood talking on the cold platform , waiting for the six o'clock train . " Give Dad lots of love and say goodbye to him , " Betsy said . " I feel as if I 'd hardly seen him . I 'm sorry he had to work all day Saturday . I wish he 'd come with us to see Maizie . " " He hardly ever goes . I try to get him to go oftener . I 'm afraid it will hurt darlin ' Maizie 's feelings . But it seems to do something to him , I do n't know how to explain it , to see her lyin ' in bed there so good and patient . I keep tellin ' him she 's just as happy as a bee , lookin ' forward to her baby and all , but he gets a look on his face . Sick . Men do n't understand how happy women can be about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buck . . . . All he seems to see is his daughter lyin ' there in bed . Poor Dad . It 'll be all right as soon as the baby 's born and Maizie 's strong again . He 'll forget she ever was in bed . " " She 's all right , is n't she ? I thought she looked thin . " " Maybe just a little . But Dr. Forbes holds out assurance all will go well . Says she 's as able to have a healthy baby and recover as any woman . And it 's my belief the rest is doing her good . Just what she needed . She was complainin ' about so many pains  --  in her feet , and her side , and her back . ... Course , if she 'd done everything Dr. Cunningham told her , like I told her to do ... " The engine roared into the underground station and the red of its fires cast a murky glow on the ceiling . They kissed goodbye hurriedly and Betsy got on the train . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the club car as the train pulled out of Boston , past the Arena , through the confusion of tracks  --  the old scenes , so familiar to Betsy from days now long ago and discarded . Just past Providence she got up and walked , balancing herself against the lurch of the train , to the ladies ' toilet at the end of her own car . The door sank slowly shut behind her and she stood in the brightly lighted little place looking at her full-length reflection . She looked very smart  --  not a Boston girl at all ; a New York girl . She wore a beige knitted jersey dress with a leather belt around her hips , a string of big pearls looped once round her neck and hanging , and a small beige hat . She smiled at herself in the long mirror , an assured , gay , important smile . She did not see how people could be such fools as to stay in Boston when there was New York to live in . In New York it was possible to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress . After New York other places were faintly ridiculous , contemptible . She gave herself another fleeting , wise smile . She was a New Yorker . New York was waiting for her at the other end of the long tracks ; its lights and people , its streets , its apartment houses , its smart women , its men . It was her city . She felt her heart beating faster for it . She loved it and she had the feeling that it loved her . It had made her one of its own and like all of its own beyond ridicule , beyond contempt . She was one of the wise ones , the assured ones , the lucky ones , now.  | " You make me so terribly happy , darling , " Maizie said . Lambert uncrossed his legs and slowly crossed them again the other way . Then he spoke , with careful gentleness . " I 'm glad , darling . You know I want you to be happy , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be lovely from now on , is n't it ? " " Lovely , " he said . He hoped that his voice carried the calm and assurance that he wanted it to . He did hope everything would be lovely from now on : for Maizie , and for the baby they would have , and for himself . No more hell , no more anguish , no more dangerous ecstasy for anybody . It was January now and for some time he had dedicated himself to making things be happy ; to defeatingthat subterranean , eruptive spring in himself that was opposed to happiness , opposed to Maizie , opposed to calm . and comfort . Perhaps it was drying up , for he had had no overflows of it ; he had been gentle , considerate , quiet , and even found that one of his tasks was to restrain Maizie 's emotion , calm her , try to make her , like himself , controlled . That was a funny thing . It was after dinner and he was sitting in Maizie 's room beside her bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee that he had brought upstairs , and it stood on the bedside table , with little Chinese figures walking round it . He let his eyes rest on it ; it was a charming cup , thin , of old design , scarlet and black and gold . There had been good coffee in it , very strong , the way he liked it . Such things gave him comfort now . He thought perhaps these were substitutes that had to be made as a man got older , as he found himself a husband , a father ; responsible , necessary . Hell , you could n't be young forever . Sometime you had to be what people wanted you to be .  --  But if you had something else , something invaluable that had to be sacrificed ? With the habit he was learning he put the cover down hard on that . There was time for everything later . As Maizie kept saying , everything would be lovely . If you were a painter , if you were any good , would n't you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absorption that everyone else had to pay for ? You could n't kill talent . . . could you ? He jerked his head to put a stop to treadmill speculation . There was a job to get done first . That was the thing to remember . It was only a question of a month or so more . He put his other hand up to the new moustache that he had begun to grow soon after Christmas . It was amazing how fond he was of this moustache . He turned his eyes away from the coffee cup and smiled at Maizie . She smiled back , eagerly ; over-eagerly , perhaps . He hoped his smilep303had n't been a frightening smile . It was a hell of a thing to know that you scared another person out of her wits ; your smile , your voice , just your face . He said everything very softly , smiled cautiously , hoping that he would n't get her all upset ; that she 'd stay calm and relaxed the way she was supposed to . " Hello , old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How is old Clem this evening ? " Their son 's name would be Clement , after his grandfather . He was there , with them in this room , already alive . He was the thing that they had made together , he was why Lambert was here at all , he was why Maizie was in bed , he was why two people plucked from opposite worlds , two people who had brought each other only anguish , were here together in a warm , curtained room holding hands and talking in low , controlled voices and smiling at each other . " He 's been cutting up all day , " Maizie said lightly , without moving her eyes from Lambert 's face . " Kicked me practically out of bed this afternoon . " " The little tough . I 'll give him a licking for it as soon as I can get at him . " They laughed . Maizie 's hair was bright against the pillows , her eyes were bright and blue . It seemed to Lambert that they were like an animal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and secret . All at once he was swept with an awful wave of feeling : they did not know each other at all , they never had and perhaps they never would . They were going to have a child together and they would be that child 's parents and perhaps the parents of other children , and live together all their long lives without knowing each other ; congenital strangers . They had been married now for several years and their juxtaposition had meant to them agony , frustration , suffering . From now on , because he was bound it would be so , there would be no more suffering , but they would still be two stranger beings . He smiled at her again . All these years she had been wretched , hurling herself against his difference to penetrate him and possess him when it was impossible because they were of opposed species . Poor Maizie . He was desperately sorry for her . Perhaps it was out of that pity that something would come that would make everything possible ; what she called lovely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , he did feel protective , sheltering , to this strange racked being with whom he had lived so long in violence . The violence in him was over like a storm that had blown itself out . Now there was the tired calm , the pity , the quiet . " Darling , " she said eagerly , " Dr. Forbes says I 'm going to be as strong as I ever was in my life , when it 's over and I 'm back on my feet . I have n't got a thing wrong , just not being able to hold on to Clem . " " Slippery customer , " he said . " Wo n't it be wonderful ? " she pressed . " Oh , darling , I 'll make you so happy ! I just know I 'm going to be as strong as an ox . We 'll go dancing . " He almost said , " Oh , do n't ! " It was all so pitiful , so pointless ; something heard and heard again , a thousand times before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he tried . He thought in some ways she was the strongest , the most relentless person he had ever known . She never gave up . She beat at him as she had beaten for years , she did not know hopelessness , the tension mounted in her and she said , " I 'll make you so happy , " with that eagerness , that lack of comprehension he had heard in her voice and her words before , so many times . She wanted something that had never existed and never could , and what he was trying to do was to offer her something else that he had to give ; something furthermore that would not hurt her or frighten her . But still with this tension , this perverseness , she clawed for the other thing . She wanted his violence , his passionate love , all the things that he realized now she could n't take and that he was bound he would not flog her with . Besides it was too late . Those were things of youth and he and she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said intensely . " I do n't mean to complain . " " Of course you are , darling . You 're a soldier . If it was me I 'd be crabbing steadily . " " Would you mind terribly , " she said , " would you be terribly angry if it was a girl ? " He uncrossed and crossed his legs . He did that to give himself time to summon the essential patience . And yet it was fair enough . All she had ever known of him was anger . " Of course I would n't be angry , pink-face , " he said carefully . " I 'd think it was cute . I hope it would be a dead ringer for its Ma . " " It wo n't be , " she said eagerly . " I just know I 'm going to have a boy . 1 feel it . No girl could kick as hard as Clem does . " She laughed , and to his ears her laugh sounded hectic . " Either way I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , and his gorge rose at the things he recognized in her smile , the longing , the frantic possessiveness , the passion . " Nobody ever had a husband as good to them as you are to me , " she said . " Nonsense , my good woman . " " I just hope . . . " she said . " What do you hope , my pretty ? " " I just hope , " she said in a low voice , " you do n't hate me . For being in bed and all the things I know you hate . " He felt his fingers clench . " No . No . No , " he said . " You do hate me , some , do n't you ? You wish I could have a baby like other women , without going to bed . I know you hate invalids . " " I love you very much , " he said , and his lips felt stiff . In a moment she would say that she knew he hated her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know what he would do . Control was everything . It was like a raft to the drowning . He clung to it . He would not be trapped into losing control . He leaned over and kissed her mouth to stop it quickly . " You hush , " he said . " You 're supposed to rest , do n't you know that ? Not work yourself all up about something that is n't so . Now you be quiet . Everything 's lovely , " he said . " I 'm right here beside you and Clem 's rightp305there planning how he can make trouble for his old man as soon as he gets born , and Forbes is sitting on his ass waiting for a chance to work on you ; Mamma 's in a ferment to get her grandson , and you 're a heroine with beautiful golden curls and no sense . Darling , " he said , stroking her hair . She looked up at him with her wild , animal 's eyes . " You 're so good to me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you really love me , underneath , inside ? " " I really love you . Underneath . Inside . " They were both silent . This was the best that could be done . The surface must be calm , like a lake . Underneath lay the past . The thing was never to go back to it , to keep it covered . The terrible old years of South America , of Boston , of agony and tears and shouting and hate and fury and exhaustion , lay behind everything . Maizie kept scratching at the surface to get at the past ; like picking the scab off a sore . If he hung on to control long enough she was bound to stop , and then the past could die . This was , he thought , his ordeal ; a sort of test . This way he was paying for what he had done to her . He would continue to speak calmly , gently , softly , until the crust over the past was too thick to pick off , until the new life was established @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would that be ? Well , calm ; quiet . And would it be worth living , he thought suddenly . He jerked his head , and put his hand up to his stiff , short moustache . " I 'm going to let you rest now , so you 'll have a good sleep tonight , " he said , getting up and releasing her hand . " Where are you going ? " " I thought I 'd run up to the studio for a while . I 'd like to get some fresh air and do some work there . I 'll be back early . You just go to sleep . " " Darling , " she said , " you know I 'd understand if you . . . " Everything screamed inside him suddenly . " . . If you felt you had to have a woman , " she said . Very slowly , very carefully , he bent over her and kissed her . When he had straightened up again he spoke . " Do n't you be a silly , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a woman if I saw one . I 'm an old , respectable married man about to be a father and I 've got quite enough on my mind without strange women scaringme to death . Now , do n't give me any more of your lip . " " I 'd understand , " she said again , watching him with that awful eagerness . But he was far too wise to be trapped . He knew all about this . He knew from long ago . He knew from South America and from last year and from the year before . Oh no . " Darling , " he said . " Get this through your pretty head . I 'm going to be absolutely faithful to you . That 's a fact . I want you to get your teeth into it . If I find you 're stewing about any such thing I 'll give you hell , " he said with great gentleness and care . " I want you to be happy . I 'm not going to do anything to disturb that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truly . "  | " Oh ! But I 'd understand . . . you know that , do n't you ? " The anxiety came back into her voice . " I know that , " he said . He kissed her again . " You got everything ? Water ? Sleeping pills ? Your bell ? " " Yes , darling . " He went very softly out of the room , leaving the door ajar . The air outdoors on Commonwealth Avenue was very cold , and smelled of snow . The street-lights seemed to snap , white and small , all up and down either way . Lambert ran across the street and began to walk fast uptown on the shovelled path in the middle of the Mall . The big bare trees on either side creaked in the winter wind and cars went by at intervals , downtownand up . At Massachusetts Avenue he turned left and walked along the broad sidewalks that were skimmed over with ice and had sand thrown on then , past the big dark buildings , past the lighted windows of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block , and then he turned the corner into Ipswich Street and ran against the hard wind , and up the steps into the studios . Inside it was hushed and overheated and only one light burned ; the old elevator stood empty and lighted at the back . He ran up the staircase and went along the dark hallway with the boards creaking under his step to the end , and climbed the concrete fire-escape at the back to the second floor and crossed the corridor and unlocked his studio door with a key . He went into the darkness and closed the door behind him and stood still . It was warm and smelled of paint and dust and turpentine and nitric acid . He went down the stairs from the balcony in the dark . The great north window was luminous gray against the lights outside . The shapes of things stood out dimly in the room : the two tall heavy easels , the model stand , the high table before the window . It seemed to hirn to breathe as he stood in it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while he was away and still drew their long , quiet breath . He felt relief , as if he had returned to a place that held his shape suspended on all sides  --  like floating in water  --  that gave way and filled in smoothly , silently , to all his motions ; warm , soundless , enveloping . He switched on a blue light beside the high table and began to wander around the studio doing little things . He scraped the palette he had used and transferred the blobs of paint to a sheet of glass and went into the bathroom and put the glass into the bottom of a soup plate that he filled with water . He cleaned a bunch of brushes with water against a cake of soap . He stood in front of the biggest easel and stared at the painting he had been working on that day , a nude leaning back in the blue upholstered chair with her head turned aside so that the sterno-cleido-mastoid muscle of the throat stood out like a long , taut cord . He stood in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to look at it with his eyes and see it without thinking about it . But his thoughts kept forming in little gusts and making sentences about it , that he pushed away . He kept thinking that it was painted well , the construction able , the values intelligent ; there was nothing that he could find with his conscious mind that was the matter with it . Butp307he knew it was not any good . The thing that was the matter with it had nothing to do with thought , with technique or knowledge or conscious criticism . The thing it lacked was something that had been missing in his eyes when he looked at it in painting it and looked at the model he was working from . His eye had looked at her and seen what she was , a nude with certain forms , values , planes , and had transferred these things to the canvas . But the picture was no good because he had not seen it or the model with an innocent eye . He threw a stack of old newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The fire roared up and he tossed on two logs . He went and sat down on the old couch beside the fire , still staring sidewise at the canvas . The innocent eye , he thought . The innocent eye saw things as they were : without association , without literary values , without their meaning anything except what their shapes and colors meant privately to the painter 's dissociatedmind . A tree must never be a tree , that word with its associations , to a painter ; he must see it innocently as a shape without an associated meaning ; to him it should have equal interest whether right side up , upside down , or sideways . It was certain form with certain colors , upon which the light fell in certain ways . Its interest to the painter lay not in that it was a tree ; it would be better if he did not know its name ; it lay in the pattern it made with other things around it , its design , its notan . Seen innocently and with delight , a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became something beautiful and essential and significant for the first time ; as fresh and unknown as dawn on the first day of creation . Painters had painted trees , nudes , boxes , eggs , since the beginning of art . If a painter today saw them for what they were known as , he would only be painting another tree , another nude . But if his eye were innocent , if he was an artist , he saw these things and they were as new as if they had never before existed , because the lights could never fall upon them twice the same way , because they were always in a new relationship to their surroundings , because the painter 's own eye was fresh and curious and amazed and innocent . Pictures could always be painted that were new , undiscovered , a revelation . In those paintings was the only glory of art , its unassailable glory : the world born again and greeted with joy and wonder . The innocent eye encountered the world and rendered what it saw , the world with a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That was the only art that was art . It could only be seen and made by the eye that was innocent . He put his head in his arms and shut out the picture that shivered with the shivering red light from the fire . He felt bound ; tied up with the long black and white tape of thought , and each new thought tied him tighter and he was further away from freedom and his proper alignment , that of his nature bearing directly upon what he saw . Thinking was an evil to a painter , this sort of thinking : this analysis and explanation . His eye was sick . The symptom of the painter 's illness was this long tortuoustrain of thought . It was not a healthy symptom that worked toward recovery . It drew a thicker and thicker skein , a mesh , before the eye . With his hands he felt the muscles of his upper arms through his clothes , his deltoid muscles ; they were hard . He was a healthy strong human animal but as a painter he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The picture out there in the room could have been painted by anyone with a sound technique . It was one of a hundred thousand studies of nudes , displaying what was known about the form , the color , the action of nudes . It was not seen for the first time . It had no delight . Lambert dropped over sidewise and lay on his back at full length , looking up at the high shadowy ceiling of the studio where a faint light shifted . What am I going to do , he thought . What am I going to do ? He stood up abruptly and went into the bathroom and turned on the light . He looked for his face in the small , paint-smeared mirror over the washstand , and there it was , no different , as far as he could remember , from always ; except for the new , small , dark moustache . He opened the door to the cabinet behind the mirror and from among a mess of turpentine bottles and old squeezed-out tubes took a pair of barber 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and began to trim his moustache . He might look just the same but he was not himself . All that mattered in himself was not there . He trimmed the bottom edge of his moustache , along the edge of his upper lip , and wondered what cure he would employ , if he was free to cure himself at once . " Oh , Christ , " he said out loud to the mirror , and suddenly felt like a nostalgic child , longing for the hoot of a steamer 's whistle moving out to sea , for the long sound of a train whistle . " Hey , " he said to the mirror , and put the scissors away . " Got to think this out . " He went back into the studio and sat down on the couch and began to try one more time to think it all out again , so that he would see how he had got here , and why he could n't go anywhere else . All right . For God 's sake , do n't begin any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and redigested and regurgitated until it does n't mean anything . All right , begin with Leda . Leda was wonderful . Do n't go into why . All right . That stopped . She went away . Why did she go away ? She went away because Maizie started to have a baby , because she wanted to put a stop to Leda . So she put a stop to Leda . But , Christ , that need n't have been so , there were a hundred things that could have been done , a thousand things . I could have . Leda could have . Maizie could have . All right , but they did n't . Get to something else . It could have been wonderful with Leda , it could have been right ; suppose it was the last chance for something , it 's lost and I 've got all over thinking about that , for itself , months ago . Months ago . It 's just the last chance aspect ... . So Maizie started the baby . Hate and rage and more tears and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then it was August . Then there was that early morning . Waking up . How long had she been awake ? Sitting up in bed , and lying down again when the pains came , and sitting up again , watching the clock ; too scared to wake me up because I always get mad when I 'm waked up . She said , " Oh darling .... I did n't want to wake you up . Youp309would have been so angry . " Oh , for Christ 's sake , for Christ , Christ , Christ . Telephoning , and carrying her down in blankets , and racing to the hospital , and Forbes waiting . Your wife 's going to miscarry in a few hours . Sitting in the waiting-room and thinking that Leda was n't married , not yet , when Maizie was somewhere waiting to miscarry . She said , " Oh darling . . . . It 's the end of everything . You and this baby are all there is . I wo n't want to live . " And she meant it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the universe , but she means it . She really does feel all these things . I did it all to her . All right , so she did n't miscarry . Forbes said : " I do n't understand it . " She said , " Oh , darling .... " All right , here we are . After that , you could n't . It meant a miracle to her , being rescued from some kind of hell in the nick of time , and her face like a God damned Madonna . Nobody ever looked so radiant . And frightened . You could n't . You had to stay . Because it 's like this . The miracle happened to her and she 's going to have the baby . She 's going to have it anyway , now , and she 's put to bed so she ca n't miscarry it . There are n't going to be any more miracles . She can tither have it and it can be awful for her , some strange unimaginable kind of awful that you 've just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . Or else she can have it and be happy , and the way she does that is if she gets the kind of things that in her world mean heaven . A kind husband . A kind , gentle , considerate , unfrightening husband . That 's you . Do n't throw out your arm . Move slowly . Smile . Speak quietly . Smile . Stick to safe subjects . Stick to the baby . Keep remembering she 's going to have a baby . Everything 's for that . It 's all about the baby . Hush . Do n't . Everything 's going to be lovely . Yes , yes . Everything 's going to be lovely . Well , everything is going to be lovely , is n't it ? Naturally you 'll still know how to get to work . Do n't be an ass . If you can forget how to paint in a few months you never knew how to paint . If it 's your eye that 's the matter , then why wo n't your eye get well when there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it wo n't get well ? And you can quit looking for trouble ahead because that 's then and now 's now and you 've got a job to do first . Everything 's going to be lovely . God damn it , stop saying that . Or say it some other way . Everything 's going to be . . . all right . I swear to you it is . Look , fellow , everything is going to be all right . Everything 's going to be lovely . He stood up and jerked his head , and put his hand up for an instant to touch his new moustache . He picked up his hat from the paint table . He switched out the blue light and in the darkness went up the creaking steps to the balcony . His hands felt for the spring lock on the door and turned the little knob , and he went out into the long , empty , dim corridor of the studio building , smelling of dust and old paint.  | He had a latchkey to the house on Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still on full in the hall and upstairs on the drawing-room floor . He walked lightly up the stairs , thinking how his footstepssounded like all men 's footsteps he had heard going upstairs all his life . He looked into the library and his mother was still up , sitting beside the fire that died slowly in the grate , reading . She had her glasses on her nose , and held the Atlantic out in front of her , rather far away , to bring it into focus . " You still up , Mamma ? " " Why , Lambert . " She laid down her magazine and looked over the top of her glasses at him . I icr small feet in satin slippers were set side by side on a footstool . She wore the black satin and lace tea gown in which she dined at home . Her hair , that did not resemble hair but a dense pile of some substance , curled and twisted and massed and gray , capped her head and below its edges at the side there glittered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come in and warm my feet ? " " Of course , my dear . " She leaned forward and pulled symbolically at the arm of a chair to draw it nearer to the fire . He sat down slowly and thrust his legs at full length towards the small , hot coal fire , and lit a cigarette . " Maizie all right ? " " I went up to see her for a little while after you went out . I think she must be asleep by now . She has n't rung . " He nodded . The fire , of briquets , was silent . Its red glow was moment by moment dimmed by gray ash , but the heat given off was intense . His mother had gone back to the Atlantic . He turned his head and looked at her . She had always been a perfectly satisfactory mother because she had never interfered with him . She was dignified , conservative , occupied with many things ; a great lady . When he was a child he got from her anything it ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help , money  --  but it had never been in him to turn to his parents for much . He had always had what he wanted most inside himself . If his father , who had been one of the last Boston gentlemen politicians , had lived , there might have been trouble , Lambert thought ; objection to the way he had chosen to live and the career he had desired . But his mother had been able to assimilate the idea of an artist into her scheme of things ; at least she had never said a word in objection , never insisted upon Harvard because it was traditional for Rudds and Lawrences , taken his art education in her stride . Now he was thinking that really he had no idea what she thought of him . She had looked a little dizzy that night long ago when he brought Maizie home as his wife just before they left for South America . She had rocked on her heels a little , but that was all . Maizie was , he thought , the utter antithesis of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , passionate , possessive . But they seemed , now , at close quarters this winter , to get along as though it were the natural , ordinary thing . As soon as the doctor had said Maizie must go to bed for the rest of her time , his mother had stepped in and proposed the present arrangement , which solved everything . Lambert wondered what his mother , really , thought of Maizie.  |p311He  threw his cigarette on to the dying coals and watched a flame spurt for an instant . " Well , she 's almost through it , " he remarked . He wanted to talk ; that was a curious thing to feel , for him , whose conversation with his mother had always been a reflex thing , but no more curious than anything else these days , he thought . It all stemmed from not being satisfied with his work , and that stemmed from Maizie having a baby . . . . Wanting to talk to people ; feeling lonely . It was a hell of a way to be feeling . He grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother would think the grin went with what he had said . " Only a little longer , " she said . She took off her glasses . " I think everythinghas gone extremely well  --  under the circumstances . Maizie is remarkable ; she never complains , I 've never heard her . " She looked directly at him . " And I think you have behaved beautifully . " He wondered what she meant by that . He would probably never know . And in a little while he would n't care . He bowed . " Thank you , madam , I 'm sure . " " Men hate sickness , " she remarked . " They can never accept it . Your father was that way . Sickness seemed to him an outrage . " " But you 've never been sick a day . " " No , I have n't . But there were times when I could see what his attitude was . " We 've never been much of a family for getting sick , have we ? " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though of course there was your uncle Gaspar . " " My uncle Gaspar . . . . Was he the one that died of drink ? " His eyes sparkled to see his mother 's eyebrows lift minutely . " He had a very unfortunate love-affair when he was a young man . A Miss Hemingway . She treated him very badly . He did n't have your father 's stamina . He was never able to put it out of his mind . " " Did I ever see him ? " " He died before you were born . It was very sad to see so much ability wasted . Your father said he had twice the political sense he had himself . But he never displayed any interest . He wasted himself . He spent a good deal of time in Paris in the ' nineties . Dear me , I have n't thought of Gaspar for years . " " Another black sheep like your son . " " My dear boy , I ca n't permit you to call yourself a black sheep , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid . " " Mamma , you overwhelm me.  --  What was Uncle Gaspar doing all the time in Paris ? Raising hell ? " " I believe he was writing some kind of poetry , " she said . " He was writing poetry . . . . I never knew that , Mamma . I low amazing . You never told me that . Was it any good ? " " I believe not . " " Have n't we got any of it ? "  | " There was a book . . . somewhere . . . privately printed , I believe . .. It may be somewhere in the house . I do n't know . " There was a silence between them for some minutes . " Well , " he said , " I expect I 'll be hitting the hay . Do n't you ever get tired , Mamma ? " " No . But you look tired . " " I ca n't imagine why . 1 do n't do a thing to get tired about , these days . Maybe I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed , but in a second he stopped laughing . " I expect your painting can be fatiguing , " she said . He stared at her . " On my feet , you mean ? " " Perhaps . I have noticed that things like that can often be more tiring to people than work . " He started to say something , but there was nothing to say . It should not be surprising that his mother did n't consider painting work . There was no reason why he should find her words slightly unpleasant ; why should he care ? She did n't know anything about it , and he had always taken that for granted . He smiled gently and said nothing . " After the baby is born , " she said , " you 'll be going on with your paint-ing ? " His eyes sought her face in a moment of bewilderment and then he got up , not too quickly . " Oh yes , " he said . " I expect so . Yes . " " You 're going up now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mamma , " he said . But he stumbled on the edge of an Oriental rug , going out of the room , He went up the stairs . He had the remains of a smile fixed on his lips . He went along the upper hall to the staircase that led up to his room . " Lamb .... " Maizie 's voice . He turned and went back to her door , just ajar , and put his head in . A light was switched on within , and he saw Maizie raising herself on her elbow , her eyes dazed with light . " Why are n't you asleep ? " he said softly . " Conic in and say good night to me . " He went and sat on the edge of the bed without putting too much of his weight on it , and looked down into her face . " You must go to sleep . " " When I close nay eyes , " she said , " all I can see is spinach . It 's like that . All spinach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masses of it , And I ca n't go to sleep . " Lilte chaos , he thought . But it might not seem like that to her , and it might frighten her to hear the word . He stroked her hand . " You take a pill , " he said . " Here . " He shook out one of the yellow capsules into her open palm and held the glass of water for her while she put the capsule in her mouth . He wondered what it could be like to have your life confined to one bed , in one room , forp313a long time . He thought of his father . " Sickness seemed to him an outrage . ... " He wondered what Uncle Gaspar had thought of sickness . He himself , he used to know the feeling of outrage . So many , many times , in so many places . But he was getting quite used to it . It seemed the normal thing . What would life even be like , without sickness in it ? He bent down and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " You know you 're my whole life , do n't you ? " " Yes , " he said , " I do . " " I love to know you 're here . It makes me feel so together with you . " " We are together , " he said . " And I stop seeing the spinach . " " Go to sleep , and you wo n't see any more spinach . " " All right . " She sighed and turned her head into the pillow . " We are together , are n't we ? " " We are together . " Again he crossed the upper hall , and went upstairs where , in the upper regions , a gas jet wavered against the wall . He went into his room and switched on a light . The old furniture stood around , the desk , the bed , the bookcases holding Latin grammars and Henty . He stood in the middle of the room . This was the room of one part of his life , even as the studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tried to imagine how he had felt as the boy whose room this was , the boy who was not yet a painter . 1-low could it feel not to be a painter ? " Are you planning to go on with your painting ? " he said out loud . " What makes you think I 'm not ? " he said out loud . It was funny how he had got this trick , lately , of speaking to himself out loud . IN FEBRUARY Dr. Forbes said that Maizie might get up for a little while each day in order to strengthen her muscles ; there was now no further hazard of miscarriage . The day predicted for the baby 's arrival was less than two weeks ahead . The first day , Dr. Forbes was there when Maizie took the steps from her bed to the big armchair . He took one arm and Lambert the other and Maizie , in a voluminous pink dressing-gown , took the steps slowly and sank into the chair . There was an atmosphere of triumph , of progress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . Dr. Forbes stood and looked at her . He was a man with an immense beaked nose and small blue eyes behind thick glasses ; his reddish-brown hair fell in a lock across his forehead . " There you are , " he said . " Do that every day , now . A little longer each time . " " The baby wo n't come too soon ? " Maizie said . " He can come any time he likes now . We 'll be ready for him . But if you take it easy and do n't trip or anything , you 'll be able to get a little muscle there . It 'll help . Not necessary , though , " he added . " Can I do the getting up late like this ? Then Lambert can be here to help me . " " Any time . " " You do n't mind , do you , darling ? " " Of course not . " He wished so she would get over being afraid of him . He wished it so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 11 be going along . You 're doing fine . " " Just one thing . I ca n't seem to sleep . . . . " " One of the yellow capsules at bedtime , " he said briskly . " Another if you awaken . But it is my thought that getting up , moving around , will make it easier for you to sleep . " " Oh , good . " " Well , keep your fingers crossed , " the doctor said , and left . Every time he left , he said that . Keep your fingers crossed . In two or three days Maizie was walking out into the hall , and on the fifth day she went downstairs , on Lambert 's arm . It was shortly before dinner time . They paced into the drawing-room , where a big log fire was snapping . The lights were not on , and Lambert reached out to the switch . " Do n't , " she said . " It 's lovely like this , with just the firelight . " The red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-ceilinged room . They sat by the fire . Maizie drew a breath . She sat turned slightly away from the blaze , facing the space of the room and the reflected light and the shadows . Lambert lit a cigarette . " It 's like a cave , " Maizie said in a whisper . " Is n't it ? It 's so queer . It does n't seem like any place I 've ever seen . It 's as if I were with you in a great cave with a fire at the end of it . " " You 've had to be in bed so long it would n't be strange if you did n't recognize this room , " he said lightly . " No , but Lamb ; look . Is n't it like a cave ? Somewhere far away . And we 're alone in it . Everything else has disappeared . I 've just waked up and here we are in a cave . Just me , with you . " " And the baby . " " It 's as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She stared at the long , high shadows that stalked and raced across the walls . " It 's just us and nothing else in the world . In a cave . I 've loved you such a long time , and now I 'm here . " He smoked and looked at her , wondering what she meant , wondering what Maizie 's thoughts felt like to have . She laughed suddenly . " I feel happy , " she said . " Everything seems so simple . I just keep on and keep on and keep on loving you , and that 's the answer , it all comes out and it 's happy . I just keep on . Oh , now it 's going to seem simple . " " Of course it will , " he said . " It 's going to be lovely . ' 1 have n't said boo to you for a long time , have I ? "  |p315She  did n't answer . " Nothing matters any more , " she said . " You can do anything to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , and on , and on . It seemed so big , and complicated , and frightening , but it is n't really . It 's little . It 's tiny . All I have to remember is just to keep on . " " Do n't work too hard , " he said . " I think you 'd better be taking the trek back to bed , darling . " " All right . I hate to leave it here . I love it . I feel so happy . I wish it would just stay like this , all simple and in one little place . " " Do n't you worry . Everything 's going to be as easy as pie . " He helped her to her feet and side by side , his arm around her waist , they paced out of the firelit place into the brightly lighted hall outside , and climbed the stairs , slowly , laboriously . All the lights went on in the house , upstairs and downstairs , in the middle of the night , near the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a burglar ; along the dark , melancholy stretches of Commonwealth Avenue , above the lonely snow , into the before-dawn emptiness  --  suddenly the lights blazed out , upstairs and downstairs . Inside the house all was purposeful . The telephone calls were made by Mrs. Rudd , sitting in the upstairs hall in a mulberry-colored dressing-gown with her curious hair hanging in a tail down her back . Lambert had dressed in a hurry when Maizie 's bell rang : the long-awaited , the fateful ring . He had put her suitcase , packed long ago , by the bedroom door ready to go down . Maizie sat up in bed , smiling , her hair tossed back , holding Lambert 's watch in her hand to time the pains . " Now take it easy , " he said , cheerfully . " Wait till the nurse comes . No use your wasting strength dressing . " Mrs. Rudd dressed , in the large chamber that was hers , in a black suit and a white shirtwaist with a jabot , and put up her hair and crowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put on her rings . The front doorbell rang , and Lambert ran downstairs to open it . The nurse came up to Maizie 's room , with a small case in her hand . She took off her hat and her coat and stood forth a strong young woman with short black hair , in a starched white dress . She had been engaged months before . She took Maizie 's pulse and then laid her hand on Maizie 's abdomen and looked abstractedly at Lambert , standing there . " Dr. Forbes said as soon as they were coming every fifteen minutes , Miss Percy , " Mrs. Rudd said , coming into the room with a black fur coat over her arm . The nurse smiled . " I think we might be getting dressed and ready to go , " Miss Percy said . " Mr. Rudd , if you would . . . " Lambert went out and shut the door . He went slowly , step by step , down the broad stairway . He found that he was smiling . He peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mother 's car standing there at the curb . He opened the door against the February wind and called to Peterson . The chauffeur came up the steps , grinning . " Come in and keep warm . Have a butt ? "  | They stood smoking in the brightly lighted hall . Lambert forgot to talk and lit another cigarette off the first one . After a while there were footsteps on the stairs and side by side his wife , his mother , and the nurse came down , with Maizie in the middle . She had Mrs. Rudd 's fur coat wrapped around her . The chauffeur stabbed out his cigarettequickly in the hall-table ashtray and came forward to the foot of the stairs with Lambert . The women stood aside and let the two men help Maizie down the front steps to the car . Then they all got in . Through the empty lonely streets the car drove , fast , to the hospital . Maizie smoked a cigarette Lambert gave her . He sat beside her and held her hand . Mrs. Rudd , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on a jumpseatand looked out . There was nothing personal or emotional in the atmosphere . It was objective and charged with a significance that had to do with time and speed and efficiency . The car drew up at the big doorway of the hospital where all the lights shone out in a blaze , and an orderly came out with a wheel-chair . The night was just turning to dawn . " Good luck , Mrs. Lambert , " Peterson said . Maizie got into the wheelchair . " Thank you , Peterson . " Everybody was fine . Everybody knew his role and played it . The wheelchairrolled along the hushed corridors , and the nurse and the husband and the mother-in-law followed it ; up in an elevator , along more corridors , and into a room , where they were joined by a floor nurse . There was a tap on the door and Dr. Forbes came in smiling . Lambert and his mother went out and came back again , and Dr. Forbes went away . Nurses came and went , carrying piles of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in bed , in a cotton hospital shirt ; she made a big mass in the narrow , strict white bed . Lambert gave her another cigarette and she smoked it , knocking the ashes off into a kidney-shaped basin . There was a round top bulb in the ceiling of the room that cast a hard , white light . Outside the dawn was coming and above the sounds inside , sparrows could be heard chirping loudly . Lambert went to the window and drew up the shade . Outside the light was dirty and gray . He drew the shade down again . " Now ' , " Maizie said , glancing at the nurse . " I think we 'll have to ask you to go out now , " Miss Percy said . Mrs. Rudd and Lambert walked down the corridor past the desk where two nurses were and went into the waiting-room . They sat and talked in low tones . Maizie 's mother and father came in . Everyone shook hands . Mrs. Jekyll was chattering and gesticulating ; she held Mrs. Rudd 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces . " Maizie 's wonderful , " her mother said . " She 's just bein ' so wonderful . . . . " Mr. Jekyll stood off , to one side . He did not speak . Lambert held out his pack of cigarettes . Mr. Jekyll shook his head . He made a sucking sound with his mouth , and went and looked out of the long windows at the end of the room . Tom Jekyll 's back was tall and narrow and he held his hands clasped behind him.  |p317The  floor nurse who had first met them came to the door . She looked from one to another of them . " Mrs. Rudd is going up now , " she said . " She wants to see Mr. Rudd before she goes . " He started toward the door . Tom Jekyll turned from the windows and looked at him . Lambert saw him looking at him , all the way to the door . The stretcher was coming out of Maizie 's room , with a nurse and an orderly easing it around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came down the corridor . " Hello , " Lambert said . " Hello , darling . " Maizie smiled . He had never liked her so much as now . She was behaving beautifully . She was perfect . There was nothing to ask . The nurses moved away and left the stretcher pushed up against the wall in the corridor . " Keep your chin up , sweet , " he said . " I 'm cheering for you . " " Things are really happening , " she said . " Does it hurt too much ? " " I like it . It feels all right . There 's nothing frightening about it at all . " " You 're a wonderful , strong , beautiful girl . And I love you . " The nurses and the orderly came back and Lambert watched them steer her down the corridor to the hall , and on to the elevator . Then the green door slid shut and she had gone up to another floor . At eleven-thirty that morning Lambert was in the middle of a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hours . They sat in Maizie 's room , before the wide window ; Lambert sat in the low armchair . The checker-board was on the hassock that made his chair into a chaise longue ; opposite him Jekyll sat on a straight chair , his elbows on his knees , his head nearly a foot higher than Lambert 's . They stared at the counters on the board , the red and the white , but sometimes Lambert would look up and find Tom Jekyll staring at him . About once an hour the nurse would put her head in . " Everything 's going well , " she would say . " The doctor says it wo n't be much longer . " They would look up at the nurse , and watch the door close behind her . The ladies were out in the waiting-room . They had all had breakfast on trays in the hospital , at seven . Once in a while , after a game , Lambert would lean back and light a cigarette and try to start a conversation . Jekyll would look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he would say , and they would set the counters up in double rows again . They had played dozens of games , and Jekyll had won all of them . He played a quick , tricky , unbeatable game . Once he said , " I learned to play this game in the Army . In the War . " A picture came into Lambert 's mind , of Jekyll in khaki , playing checkers , and somehow he felt as if he had actually seen it . Jekyll was the type for a uniform , he thought . He was just the kind of man who had been in the War . Lambert 's mind seemed to be functioning on three separate and unre/lated planes . The first was concerned with Jekyll . Like a jeering little boy this part of his mind kept figuring Jekyll out , realizing that his father-inlawdisliked him and was jealous of him today . It realized that Jekyll was trying to prove something to himself by winning again and again from him at checkers , and got malicious pleasure out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lambert , did n't give a damn who won the games . The old bastard thought he was a bastard . Maizie was his darling daughter and Lambert was the bastard who had taken her and got her with child and put her where she was now , writhing in labor . Jekyll was the one to whom this meant the abuse of something he loved and probably wanted to keep for himself  --  his little girl under glass . Jekyll hated him , and he thought " Yah ! " at Jekyll , because this was life and reality ; for him Maizic was not under glass but in childbed . The second level of his mind was sad and sorry for this . This level comprehended the older nian gravely and realized the futility of his position on this day . It saw Maizie up on another floor of the hospital , going through what must be gone through , in suffering but also ordered , measured , controlled , like a ceremony with unchanging rites . It saw himself , the man , who had set this machinery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hospital room ; his part played ; his role to wait until he was shown the fruit of the whole long process , the child at length brought forth . He found that he loved Maizie . More than ever before in their life she seemed his partner , carrying out her end of a complicated bargain between them . She was up there going through the rites and he was grateful to her . She was his wife and it was a bargain that would stick now . After all the violence , and unhappiness , and conflict , they had put themselves into a machinery of parenthood that took hold of them and moved them along ; they had to do it together and they had done it . It was the only time they had done anything together toward the same end . The third level of his mind sailed like a cloud up from the top of the second . Like a cloud it floated without thought . But his eyes felt tired and oddly clear . It was like waking up , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful to him , round polished discs of blood-red and ivory white ; he almost wanted to put one of them to his mouth and touch it with his tongue . The fabric of the upholstered chair , rough , of striped blue , was as surprising as if he had been blind until this moment . He turned his head and looked out of the window . The angle of the hospital , in white stone , stood pure and dazzling in the winter sunshine , and a long stretch of ground was covered with snow , criss-crossed this way and that with footsteps ; its surface glittered in points like mica . A nurse crossed the snow along a path , in a blue cape that blew up sharply and showed her white dress beneath . The blue and the white and the figure walking were full of surprise and delight . Jekyll spoke and he turned back and moved a counter promptly . Jekyll jumped three of Lambert 's men . Lambert laughed . Jekyll pressed his lips together . The door opened again and the nurse stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got a beautiful little daughter , " she said . " Born ten minutes ago . " The father and the grandfather looked across at each other . " Congratulate you , " Jekyll said in his Southern voice . Lambert bowed . " . . . You , " he said . He felt extraordinarily excited . " If you 'll just come now , and go to the waiting-room . She 'll be coming down in a little while . " The men got up and Jekyll folded up the board with the counters inside it . They clattered as he put the game that he had won again and again on the hospital bureau . Lambert stood back and let Jekyll walk first out of the door to the corridor . Mrs. Jekyll kissed Lambert on both cheeks . Mrs. Rudd was smiling . All of them sat in a circle and smiled at each other ; Jekyll 's smile kept coming and going . Mrs. Jekyll pressed her husband 's knee with her hand . " All over , Tom , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come back and tell us some more . Why , I do n't even know how much the little darlin ' weighs . Declare , I ca n't wait to see my precious little granddaughter . Oh , I do just love new babies . Tom , honey , the first grandchild ! Think of that . Us . I 'm so excited ! My , I 'm goin ' to have such fun spoilin ' that baby to death . " Lambert , watching , saw his mother put out her hand and put it over Mrs. Jekyll 's and smile . It was extraordinary how well the two women got on , when they might have come from separate hemispheres . But they had something all fixed up between them . They were one about something . It was a baby in the family . He wondered if it ever did that to men . He glanced over at Jekyll 's face on which the smile came and went , and knew that he would always be an enemy in Jekyll 's mind . He felt sorry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's down from the delivery room . Getting along fine . We want her to sleep for a while , now , but she wants to see you , Mr. Rudd , for a minute . Just a minute , now . " Lambert got up and walked to the door once more . Once more he saw Jekyll 's eyes follow him , and the sound he made , sucking his lips in . Maizie was back in bed , flat and narrow under the covers . Her face was white , framed with her metallic hair . Lambert put his hand over hers , and she opened her eyes . They looked drugged . But she smiled and her face bore a look of absolute joy , of triumph . " Darling , " he said . He felt a tide of great happiness and relief and loyalty . " I 'm so proud of you . " Her lips moved . " Do you mind that it is n't Clem ? " she murmured . He felt a queer stab that that anxiety should follow her into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a girl , " he said . " I 'd much rather have a girl . " She shook her head slightly . " Say it again . . . that ... "  | " I 'd much rather have a girl . " " No . . . the other ... " "  --  I 'm so proud of you , my darling . " " Say it ... " " I 'm so proud of you . " He tiptoed out of the darkened room . He could have cried . ON A MARCH DAY nearly three weeks afterwards they drove out to the house in Manchester from the hospital . Lambert sat in front with Peterson , and Maizie , Mrs. Rudd , Miss Percy , and the baby were in back . The baby lay wrapped in a pink knitted blanket in Miss Percy 's lap . It slept . Maizie sat in the middle , her eyes wide with happiness . She felt like a little girl going on a journey . Ever since that strange , half-conscious time in the delivery room when a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the corners : " You have a little girl . Perfect . A little girl , Mrs. Rudd , " the happiness had risen , day by day . Everything was lovely . All the trouble was over and dead . This life was a life of joy and perfection ; everything , everything was happy . The smiling nurses , the trays of things to eat , the doctor 's visits like visits of daily congratulation . The vases and vases of flowers , the telegrams , the letters , the presents for the baby . The lovely nightgowns on her new flat body , and the pretty bedjackets , and the nurses admiring everything , admiring her , admiring the baby , the presents , the nightgowns , the masses of flowers . Her mother and her mother-in-law , adoring her for the thing that she had done . Her father , looking down at her silently as if she , and the baby in her arms , broke his heart ; she reached out from her heaven and patted his hand that hung by his side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy as a queen . " And the baby ; that treasure , that little miracle , whose name was Honora . It had been the name of one of Lambert 's aunts , long dead , and once , a few days after the event , when they were talking of family names he had mentioned it , and Maizie snatched at it . " I want to name it after your family , darling . It 's your baby . I 'm yours . I want everything to be your things . " She smiled at him and could not smile hard enough . It was impossible to tell him , to show him , how she loved him and how happy she was . She held the tiny baby at her breast , giving it milk ; the room was shaded from the afternoon sun . She loved to have Lambert sit with her while she nursed the baby . And he liked it too . He loved her and he loved his baby and he sat beside her bed stroking her hand . She lay there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure happiness . This afternoon , when she was dressed and ready to start , and sitting in the big armchair in the window , Miss Percy had brought the baby in ,  |p321dressed  for the first time in its own clothes . Maizie had never seen it except in the hospital shirt and blanket . She looked at it , lying in Miss Percy 's arms ; Miss Percy , beaming , leaned over and laid the baby in her lap . The little cap , the little pink coat . Suddenlytears rolled down Maizie 's face and she looked up at Lambert ; she smiled and the tears rolled into her mouth and tasted salt . " Oh , look ! " she said . " Just look . " Lambert smiled and laid his hand on her shoulder . She could n't say what she meant . It was the little face , so new , wearing the pink cap . . . . It was the little coat , to go home in . She wept . " It 's just that I 'm so happy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodbye as she rolled along in her wheel-chair to the elevator . She loved them all ; they were part of her triumph . " Goodbye , Mrs. Rudd , " they cried . " Be good , now . " They leaned over the baby Miss Percy held in her arms . " Goodbye , Honora , " they said . " The best baby in the nursery . Get fat , now ! " Maizie rolled through the hospital with her little entourage , saying goodbye , goodbye ; goodbye to the orderlies , to the desk nurse , to the elevator man . The car drove smoothly and fast along the roads to the North Shore ; Lynn , Salem , Beverly , around the curves of the black road , past the great summer places that were closed now . She looked at all they passed with pleasure , as though she were a child . The baby slept in Miss Percy 's lap . It was extraordinary how much she loved Miss Percy . Miss Percy had been there with her through all of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the next morning , smiling in the sunshine  --  " How does it feel to be a mother ? " Maizic felt as if , really , she loved Miss Percy more than any woman alive , more than her mother . " How delicious the salt air smells , " Mrs. Rudd said . She ran the window down a little and ran it up again . " We 'll get strong in no time in this grand air , wo n't we , Mrs. Rudd ? " Miss Percy said . The car rolled up the crackling gravel of the drive . The front door flew open and three maids ran down the steps to the car . " Ah , look at the little darlin ' ! " Maizie stepped out , Lambert helping her ; her face was covered with smiles . The little procession moved into the house , up the stairs , into the big bedroom . " Oh , how lovely ! " The wall-paper was blooming with pink roses . There was a fire crackling in the fireplace , bright and tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table by the fire and on the white bureau . The bed had been opened ; the smooth sheet turned over on the pink blanket , soft and inviting . " Now the first thing for us to do is to get into bed , " Miss Percy said , coming into the room . " Oh , no ! " Maizie went to the window , running away from her nurse , and pressed her face against the cold pane . There was a white gate , leading into a pasture . Beyond stood a big red barn . And far away , making the edge of the earth , lay a gray line that was the ocean . The scene was suffused with afternoon sunshine . It was as beautiful as a dream . The moments while she stared at it seemed to form themselves into a flower ; this was the happiest moment in her whole life , the happiest of all . " Let me help you to undress . " " Oh , no , I want to look ! " But she turned . She sat by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her stockings . She put on the dear blue nightgown ; she had worn it the day after Honora was born . Her feet slid into the white fur slippers and she got up and went to the window again . " This is the happiest  --  the very happiest  --  day in my whole life , " Maizie told the nurse . For the nurse would understand . " Of course it is , dear . But you must come to bed now . " " Must I ? " Of course she must . She climbed into bed and lay with her hands smoothing the cool sheet . She watched the nurse picking up her clothes and hanging them in the closet . " Where 's my baby ? " she said . " I want to see my baby . " " We must n't wake her up now . She 's having such a sweet sleep , in her beautiful new crib . " " Oh , I want to see her beautiful new crib ! " " Tomorrow . We can have a little tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going for real hikes . Down to the beach and every-thing . " Maizie hugged her arms close to her inside the warm bed . There was a sound . Was it the sound of the world revolving , going comfortably round and round ? She listened . It was the sound of the ocean . A low roar , a deep , ceaseless sound . It was there behind everything ; the sound that went with this new world . She lay still with her eyes shut and listened . When the baby was just under five weeks old Miss Percy left . The day before , the nurse that Mrs. Rudd had engaged to take care of the baby had arrived . She was an elderly Irish woman with black hair ; her name was Katie Moran , but she wished to be called Nana . She and Miss Percy had spent the day together in conferences over the baby . " Still on the breast ? " Katie Moran asked . " Gaining well , too . " Miss Percy said . " We 've cut out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night I just change her and she goes off again . . . . " For the ten o'clock feeding the night before Miss Percy left , Nana brought the baby to its mother , marched into the rosy bedroom with the little blue woollen bundle held upright against her shoulder and laid it down by its mother 's side . Nana laid back the flap of the blanket . The minute lips were beginning to move , Maizie looked up at the lined , leathery , respectable Irish face . " Oh , but the boric acid . . . " she said . " It 's right by you , madam . " Maizie reached clumsily for the cotton in the jar and the other jar of solution , on the table by the bed . Miss Percy had always wiped off the nipple for the feedings.  |p323The  car came round to take Miss Percy to town soon after breakfast . Maizie had breakfast in bed . " Be good now , " Miss Percy said . " And come and see us some day at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and hat . A maid came in and took the tray off Maizie 's knees and carried it out of the room . The sun was shining outside . The fire was lit in the little fireplace . On the walls the roses climbed up the trellises . " I ca n't realize you 're going ! " " You wo n't miss me a bit . Nana 's going to be fine . " Maizie reached up her arms . The nurse bent down and kissed her affectionately . " I feel as if you 'd always been here , " Maizie said . " We 've had a lovely time . Now , you call me up when you have little brother , wo n't you ? I 'd just love to nurse you when you have little brother . " " I 'll never have anybody else . " " Well , goodbye , dear . " " Goodbye .... " Maizie was alone in the pretty bedroom . Miss Percy had gone . Who would rub her back in the afternoon ? She must stop thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stronger every day , and back to where she had been  --  years ago . Was it three years ? Winter  --  summer  --  winter  --  summer ... South America . . . . She tried to grasp the feeling of well-being she had known back in the days before she ever met Lambert . Anyway , that was the way she would feel again now , now that all pain was past . In the meantime the day stretched out empty before her , and today she must live it through alone . But she had her routine . Miss Percy had left the routine , established , behind her , and there was that to cling to . All she had to do was to follow it . She got quickly out of bed . She went immediately to the window . She went to it every day when she got up , and so it , too , was part of the routine . It was , she thought , a magic window . The world was beautiful through it as through no other window . She would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had first looked out , at the white gate , the empty pasture , the red barn , the sea-bound horizon . " It 's all sunny , " she whispered aloud . " And there 's the white gate . And there 's a barn . They 're so beautiful and sunny . " There it was , but somehow she could not let go to it , it did not give her the stab of happiness . She pointed it out to herself , again . Surely it was only that she was missing Miss Percy . That would pass . When she had dressed before the fire , that bit of ritual that had held so much pleasure , she made her trip into the nursery to look at Honora in her crib . Nana was sitting in the window in the sunshine folding clean diapers . She looked up and nodded silently , with a glance toward the crib . Maizie tiptoed across the room . Honora lay there under the blue blanket , withp324her tiny pink face pressed against the sheet , asleep . Maizie looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my baby . But it was as if something behind her were pushing her ; hurrying her on to do something else , so that she had no time . She made herself stand still and look at the baby . She tried to think about what a beautiful baby she had . But she must hurry . She must go downstairs . Mrs. Rudd was at her desk in the little morning-room , writing letters . She glanced up . " Going for a walk , dear ? It 's a lovely morning . Warmer every day . " She went back to her letters . The house seemed big and strange . She must do something quickly so as not to think about how strange and large the house seemed . She went into the hall and Lambert came out of the dining-room . " Are n't you going in to the studio ? " " I thought I 'd stay home today and play Miss Percy for you , darling . In case you missed her . " " Why , Lamb ! What a sweet thing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was true : he was a new , wonderful Lambert who did love her and was good to her . That was something she must remember to hang on to , until everything slowed down again inside her and she could think again . " How would you like to take a walk ? " " I 'd love to . " They put on tweed coats that hung in the hall closet and went out into the sharp , salty spring morning . The lawns were brown , the garden was full of bare shrubbery . They walked along the paths , and Maizie drew in long breaths of cold air . For ' Miss Percy had said , " Fill your lungs , dear . It 's good for you . " They crossed the drive to a wide , flat lawn that stretched back of the house toward the farm . " I 'm going to put out the croquet set this afternoon , " Lambert said . " Do n't you think that might be fun ? A little mild exercise for the nursing mother . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine ... . But she must gradually increase her activities . " Do a little more every day , dear , " Miss Percy had said . " Lovely , " Maizie said , and thrust her arm through Lambert 's . Everything was perfectly all right . Here she was , walking with her husband in the sunny spring morning . The thing to do was to think about what a lovely day it was and how spring was coming . They stood at the foot of the lawn looking over the farm toward the ocean . Through the high , clear air came the ocean 's sound , the long , deep roar . " I love the sound of the ocean , " she said , loudly . " So do I , " he said , and squeezed her arm.  |p325She  looked down and poked with the toe of her shoe in the dead grass , the dead leaves . And there was a spike of green . " Oh , look ! It 's flowers ! " " Some kind of bulbs . Crocuses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They look fine when they 're all out . " Spring was coming . Spring was strength . Think of it that way , she thought . It can be a symbol for me . As the spring comes 1 ' 11 get better , and better , and better ... . " I 'm going to get better , and better , and better , " she said to Lambert . " You 're fine now . " He put his arm round her and pulled her facing him . " I want to kiss you , God damn it , " he said . " Do you know I have n't had a good kiss for I do n't know how long ? Without nurses and my dear Mamma superintending . " He put his mouth down over hers . It was a new kind of kiss  --  a very old kind of kiss ; the other kind . She strained herself against him , pressing her mouth to his . This was the beginning . It had to begin again . She was his wife again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life could begin as it had once been  --  but different now , because now everything was lovely . It was n't going to be agony this time . He was n't going to hurt her any more . This would be something happy . She was going to show him  --  she had thought of it so many times  --  how passionate , how strong she could be . Now it had come . It had begun . She was going to be all he ever wanted . Now that everything was lovely she would n't fail him any more . " Hey , whoa ! " he said , laughing . " You do n't want me to rape you in the farmyard , do you ? Because if you do n't , you 're riding for an awful fall . " She stood back , breathing fast . " Come on , let 's go down and look at the cows . Mamma loves to be told how handsome her cows are . " But she hung back . " I 've never walked that far . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I just . . . I do n't want to overdo . . . " She tried to explain . " You 're still nurse 's darling , are n't you ? " But he said it good-naturedly , and turned to walk back to the house . " You do n't hate me , Lamb , do you ? " " Quit that , baby . I do n't want any more of that stuff . See ? " He held her hand and swung it , smiling down at her . " It 's just that I do want to get terribly strong , and I do n't want to get set back by overdoing , and  --  oh , darling , you understand , do n't you ? " " Of course . Stop acting as if I was an ogre . " He squeezed her hand . " It does n't matter . I do n't want to see the God damned cows . You 're all the cow I want , baby . You 're a lovely cow , are n't you ? I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but now that we 're on the subject I do n't mind telling you that it makes me horny as hell to see you giving Honora her dinner . God damn it , it 's quite a sight . " He drew her nearer to him . " Sweet , do you know I love you ? Do you know I want the hell out of you ? Do you ? " Her legs felt weak and her head spun . " Darling . . . " she muttered . " You do , do n't you ? You want me too . God , it will be so fine getting you back again after so many months . It 's not much fun leading a celibate life , did you know that , baby ? I 've been celibate as all hell for you , you know . We 'll make up for lost time , wo n't we , " he whispered . " Listen . How would you like to go upstairs now and make up a little lost time ? Think that would be fun ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " Why , you little virgin . I did n't realize how you 'd retrogressed . Listen , dear , you got married , remember ? To me ? " What was it that was so impossible ? This was her husband , and she had thought so many times of how it was going to be . But she could n't . No , she could n't . " Not now , Lamb . . . . It 's the middle of the morning . " " And a damned fine time too . Do n't tell me you do n't want to . I know all the signs . What do you want to do ? " " Well . . . before lunch we always played Canfield . " He stared at her , and then put back his head and roared with laughter . He stopped to look at her and then roared again . " I love you , " he said . " I think you 're wonderful . All right , baby , we 'll go back to the house and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't forget I wo n't be here tomorrow morning . Maybe you 'll be sorry then , when you begin lusting after me . " " Oh , darling , I did n't mean to make you mad . It 's all right . Let 's .. . let 's go upstairs now .... " " Do n't be an ass . I 'm just kidding . There 's lots and lots of time . And for God 's sake stop thinking I 'm mad at you . I 'm not going to get mad at you . That 's all over and done with . " She smiled anxiously . The thing about his being mad had just slipped out . She must stop . Of course it was not true . It was just today that the feeling about it had come back . Perhaps if he did n't swear so much  --  maybe that was what made her feel that in a moment he would slip over the edge and they would be in hell again . But that was silly . He swore naturally . They went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table before the living-room fire . Just so and in this place had Maizie and Miss Percy played cards every morning since they had been home . But it was not the same . How could it be ? This was Lambert , not Miss Percy . But it was different beyond that . The cards .. . The cards were unpleasant . She played faster than she had ever played . She did not mean to , but something was hurrying her . Faster , faster .. . At lunch , in the white dining-room , they ate minced chicken on toast and drank raspberry shrub out of big engraved glass goblets.  | " Do n't bolt your food , " Lambert said . " For Heaven 's sake , where 's the fire ? Honora can wait . " " I do n't know , " she said , helplessly . " I just keep feeling as if I had to hurry . " " You 're tired , " Mrs. Rudd said . " Go up and take a nice nap after lunch . " After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Irish nurse , Maizie lay stiff in the bed and could not sleep . It was as if she could not put her head down into the pillow , as if her head was lifted an inch above it . It must be simply that Miss Percy had gone , and she had not got used to it yet . It must be simply that she was tired . She wanted to comfort herself . She put her hand up to her cheek . " There , there , " she whispered . " Just tired , that 's all . " Maizie came down to dinner in a new pale-blue pajama costume that her mother had given her . Its silk crepe clung to her thighs , and flared around her ankles . It had a black diamond-shaped plastron on one hip , and a draped neck that emphasized the breadth of her shoulders and chest . Her hair was beautifully arranged ; it glittered in waves and the curly tendrils over her ears and in her neck . Her cheeks were brilliant and her eyes shining . She talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock feeding ; how much the baby weighed today , the competence of Nana , and about the coming of spring . She turned her face from Lambert to Mrs. Rudd and back to Lambert , emphasizing her words and looking into their eyes eagerly . Lambert sat eating his fish , his beef , his dessert . He smiled and looked at her vivid face appreciatively . After coffee she glanced across the living-room at Lambert . " Now our breath of air , " she said . They had made this custom , since they had been here , of going out after dinner to take the air and look at the dark sky together . It was a step in the routine . " My wife is becoming as much a creature of habit as you , Mamma , " Lambert said , getting up . Mrs. Rudd smiled comfortably and picked up the Transcript . They walked over the brittle grass in the cold spring night . His arm was around her , and she leaned against him , but it was more as though she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The wide sky above the land was crowded with great white stars . " A damned fine skyful tonight , " he said . " I feel them , " she said ; " do n't you ? I feel them sort of pushing me . " " That 's nice . " He laughed in the darkness . " Is n't it funny how everything seems to mean that for us . . . I mean all the stars and that sound all the time , the ocean off there .... Everythingmeans we have to do it . " " That is a very satisfactory way to respond to nature . "  | She stopped short and threw her arms wildly around him . She lifted her face and kissed him again and again . She was trembling . " Come on , let 's go in , " he said . " Just a minute . . . wait . . . I want to kiss you . . . I ca n't let go . " After a while he disengaged her rigid arms and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows on either side of the front door . " Children . . . " Mrs. Rudd 's voice called from the living-room . Lambert glanced down , making a rueful grimace , and shrugged his shoulders as they dropped their coats in the hall . Maizie looked back at him with that fixed brilliance in her eyes . They went into the living-room . " I wanted you to look at this editorial , " Mrs. Rudd said to Lambert . " After all 1 've said to I ) onald I ligginson . . . . " He picked up the Transcript . Maizie sat down in a chair opposite Mrs. Rudd . Her arias were crossed , and her hands gripped her shoulders . Lambert 's eyes moved down the column of type . Mrs. Rudd made an exclamation . She got up and put her hand on Maizie 's forehead . Lambert let the paper drop , and saw that Maizie was shaking all over . " She 's had a chill . Lambert , she 's burning with fever . " Lambert said nothing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised to them blindly . " Get her right upstairs and into bed . I 'll call Dr. Forbes . " When Maizie was lying under the covers , with Lambert walking around the bedroom smoking , Mrs. Rudd came in . " He said stay in bed till we see what this is . And to give her plenty of fluids . He ca n't come out himself . He said to call the local man to find out about whether there 's sonic infection , so I called little Dr. Walker and he 's on his way . Put this thermometer in your mouth , dear . " With the tube between her teeth Maizie lay still , her eyes following Lambert around the room . It was almost pleasant to feel her body burning like this . It felt rich and flowing . But her mind still shivered . There was still that pressure in it , that insistence ; something was there that must be done . . . Lambert .... And then a tune began in her head and went round and round , brassily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifes to play . In spite of its strange symbolic quality , she did not at first recognize what the tune was . The doctor was shown upstairs and came into the room . Maizie turned her eyes eagerly on him . He was a small round man with a head as bald as an egg and a face like a bank clerk . It was inconceivable that he could be a doctor . She had seen so many doctors  --  and none of them looked like this one . He sat down on a chair by the bedside . Lambert went out of the room . Mrs. Rudd was explaining everything , and Dr. Walker kept nodding and blinking his eyes . He had no eyelashes or eyebrows . He kept his eyes on Mrs. Rudd 's face . " And I took my daughter-in-law 's temperature . One hundred and three.  |p329Dr  . Forbes asked if you would call him when you have made an examination . " " Ayah , Ayah , " the doctor said in a nasal , New England country accent . He might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , or sold dry-goods over the counter . " Surely , " he said . " Well now , let 's see . " He turned the covers back gently and took a stethoscope from his bag . " Still nursing your baby ? " he asked , with the instrument in his cars . She nodded . Then he took out a blood-pressure device . Maizie watched as he wound it round her arm . She wondered how many different types of device for taking blood pressure she had seen in the last few years . But the tune filled almost all of her mind . Round and round it went , round and round . Hinky-dinky , parlez-vous .... ' " Nothing there . . . " He sat back in his chair and regarded her . " Anything on your mind , trouble you ? Been having enough milk for the baby ? " " Oh , yes ... " " Nothing else troubling you ? " " No ... " " Feel happy , contented ? Not distressed about anything ? " " Oh , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wanted to go on , to explain about how happy she was , but then she stopped . It would take too much time . She had to listen to the tune . Mrs. Rudd was telling more of her medical history , about the threatened miscarriage , the months in bed . " Ayah ; ayah . . . . " " But the delivery was perfectly normal . " " Ayah . " Maizie raised her head from the pillow . " It could n't be the tube again , could it ? " she asked . Her eyes glittered with fever . " The tube . . . ? " " The Fallopian tube . It was enlarged . Oh , long ago . When I was first married . Long ago . .. " " Well , now . . . I do n't want to examine you , you know ; now . Maybe when I call Dr. Forbes . See what he says . Ayah . " The talk between the doctor and her mother-in-law went on and on . She lay now with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in two parts , like the halves of an orange . In one the tune went round and round : Hinky-dinky , parlez-vous ' played on shrill , squealing fifes . In the other there was a pulse-beat , a throb : tube , tube , tube . She was convinced . It was something corrupt in her , that was making her sick , that had made her feel so queer all day . It was that tube , from long ago . Take that out , and she would be whole and well . Once she had fought against the idea of losing that tube . Once long ago . Now she knew that was the root of everything . This was the way cancers were . She had a tube of corruption poisoningher . She could feel the poison moving along her veins.  | She opened her eyes . The doctor stood at the door with his bag in his hand . " Plenty of fluids , before she goes to sleep . I 'll call Dr. Forbes right away . And I 'll be here in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tune went round , louder and louder , merry and ghastly . Somebody put a glass to her lips , and she raised her head . It was Lambert , holding a tall glass of orange-juice . Mrs. Rudd had gone . Maizie drank . " Poor old baby , " Lambert said . " Sick again . " She sat up abruptly in bed . " Oh God , " she said . She began to cry , and the tears stung her hot eyes . " Please do n't cry . Please rest . " " Oh , God . Oh , God . It 's all back . " " What , darling ? " Lambert sat down on the edge of the bed . " All of it . I 'm sick again , and you 'll go off .. " " Hush . . . hush . . . I promise you I 'm not going off , anywhere . I 'm staying right beside you , right here ... " " It 's all back . The old days . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't forget , everything 's lovely . You 've got Honora , and you 've got me ... " " I forgot Honora . Listen . I know what the trouble is . It 's my old tube . The burning . I can feel it . It 's coming back . Lambert . I want to have it taken out . Right away . Then I can get well and then I can sleep with you and you 'll love me and you wo n't leave me . " " Darling , do n't get upset . I know you feel like hell . But please stop worrying . I can wait , you know . I 'm not an ogre . There 's no hurry . I 'm not going to leave you . " " Not ever ? " " Not ever . " " Lambert . Make them take that tube out . Right away . So I can get well . " He looked at her uncertainly . " You really feel it again ? What makes you think that 's it ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , again . You see , 1 keep hearing that tune . That tune they played on the deck before they ducked us . Hinkydinkyparlcz-vous . ' Do n't you remember ? " " No . " " And the next day was Guayaquil . And then it happened . That was when the tube began . And I hear the tune now , and I know it 's the tube again . Do n't you sec , it 's all together . The tune came first , and now it 's come back . " " Did you tell this guy about your tube ? " " Yes . But he does n't know anything . Oh , Lambert , make sure Dr. Forbes knows about it , wo n't you ? Tell him . Just in case anything happens and I ca n't . " " What do you mean , something happens ? " " I do n't know . " " Look . You 've got to stop worrying now , and rest . Just put all thisp331business out of your head and try to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And you wo n't leave me ? You wo n't . . . go off , somewhere , with some girl ? " " Look . What can I do to convince you ? I swear to you by everything that I never think of such a thing . I swear to you I 'll never leave you . " She closed her eyes . " Now rest . Everything will be all right . " " But I ca n't sleep with you . I 've got to sleep with you . " " It 'll all come . There 's no hurry about anything . " " I keep hearing that awful tune , " she said . " It 's so awful . It means it 's all going to happen again . " " No . Listen , darling . Listen to the ocean . Keep listening to the ocean . Hear it ? " " Yes . " " Has the tune gone away ? " " It 's going , " she cried . She opened her eyes and looked at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm sorry , darling . " " Quit being sorry ! " he exclaimed . " There . I 'm sorry , too . " Mrs. Rudd came into the room . " Better , dear ? Dr. Walker thinks you 'd better not nurse the baby until we see how you are tomorrow . It just might be something contagious , and the baby might catch it through the milk . He 's left a formula to try . Nana 's down in the kitchen making it . " After a while they went away and turned out the lights . Maizic lay with her eyes open in the dark . Her mind was bursting . Everything in it was terrible . Lambert said to listen to the ocean . He had told her to do that , and so that was what she must do . Listen , listen , she thought . She strained out of herself , to pass by and beyond the contents of her mind , to hear the ocean . And it was there ; booming deeply on the distant shore . DR . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped to normal . " Better spend the rest of the day in bed . Ayah . And now about the nursing . " " Did you tell Dr. Forbes about the tube ? " She felt cool and quiet this morning . " Ayah . . . He 's pretty sure there 's no pathology . . . Certainly if the fever stays down like this .... " " But there was n't any fever . . . before . . . " " Well , well . Do n't worry about it . You say you feel it burning ? Well ... But about the nursing . Dr. Forbes agrees , we think it might be a little wiser , ayah , just in case there might be something . . . Hard to tell right now . Formula seemed to stay down pretty well last night and this morning , the nurse says . Have you got a strong piece of cloth , unbleached muslin , use for a binder ? " Mrs. Rudd , standing by , nodded . " Do n't feel badly about it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You 've nursed her five weeks , have n't you ? Ayah . Plenty to give her a good start . " " You mean I ca n't nurse my baby any more ? " " Well , just to play safe , you know . It 's just minor discomfort . We can relieve you if it hardens up much , ayah , a breast-pump . Hand one . Get it at any drugstore . " He looked up at Mrs. Rudd as though for corroboration . " Is n't Dr. Forbes coming to sec me ? " " Well , now , you have n't got fever today . Let 's bet that you 're going to be all right by tomorrow . " " But what made me sick ? " " Well , these things just happen , sometimes , you know . Ca n't always tell . Go away too quick . Forget about it . Chances are tomorrow you 'll be chipper again . " After he had gone Mrs. Rudd came with a long strip of heavy cotton and a paper of large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chest . " The tighter it is the quicker the milk will disappear . " Maizie 's breasts already ached and burned , from the missed feedings . " Ca n't I see Honora ? " " Yes , dear , of course you can . Nana will bring her in . Dr. Walker does n't think it could be anything she could catch except through the milk . He just does n't want to take any chances . I would n't kiss her , though . " At half-past ten the nurse entered , carrying the little blanketed bundle over her shoulder . She laid the baby beside its mother and turned the blanket down . Maizie had forgotten . Why , here was her baby , her precious . Like a tiny flower : so sweet , so small , so tender . " She took her bottle ever so nicely , " the nurse said primly . The tears poured down Maizie 's face . It was too cruel . Here was her darling beside her . Mother and baby , side by side , who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , my darling , " she whispered , and the tears dropped on the blue wool blanket . The nurse turned and went over to the window . " Oh , my darling . They took you away . " There was no fever that day , nor the next . " Now look , darling . " Lambert sat on the edge of the bed . He spoke in a gentle voice ; he spoke slowly and carefully . " I talked to Forbes for a long time . He says it could n't be the tube . It could n't be . You 're to stop thinking about it . What you had was some little flare-up , and it 's gone . You 'd have fever if there was anything the matter . If it was anything aboutP333the tube , it would bother you again later and there 'd be plenty of time to do something about it then . It ca n't do you any harm . I asked him what you said , and he said it is impossible for a tube , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your system . It does n't work that way . But there 's nothing the matter . " He wants you to get up and begin going around again . Resume your routine , ' as he would say . He does not want you to stay in bed . He wants you to move around and get your strength back . He thinks seeing you 've started weaning Honora it 's probably a good thing . Help you to get strong quicker . See ? Now , you just get up and we 'll take a little walk . It 's a swell day . " Maizie stared at him . " Did you ask him about sleeping together ? " He laughed . " I must confess I did , sweetie . He says that 's okay too , now , any time you feel like it . But for God 's sake do n't think you have to . I can wait . I know you want to . I 'm perfectly prepared to wait . " She shook her head slightly . " You must n't stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go to the studio . " " You quit stewing about what 1 want . What I want is for you to get the hell well again . Now you just hoist yourself up out of bed . 1 ' 11 wait for you downstairs . " That evening , in the middle of dinner , at the long oval table lighted by white candles in silver candle-sticks , Maizie broke into tears . It was loud , brutal , uncontrollable sobbing . Through the tears her eyes , like the eyes of an animal , flickered in terror back and forth from the faces of her husband and her mother-in-law . Lambert got up and dropped his dinner napkin beside his plate . He put his arm round Maizie 's shoulders and raised her from her chair . " I 'll take care of her , Mamma , " he said . Without speaking he led her out of the room and upstairs . He laid her down on her bed and stood looking at her for a moment . Then he drew up a chair and lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How about telling me what 's the matter ? What are you crying about ? " " I do n't know ! " " You do n't know what 's the matter ? " " No ! " " Ca n't you think ? " " I 'm frightened ! " " What of ? " " I do n't know ! " He went on smoking his cigarette , flicking the ashes aside , drawing neatly upon it so that beneath his dark moustache the coal brightened at the end . He did not take his eyes from Maizie 's face . Her crying slowed , and she gasped . " You know what I think ? " he said .   " What ? " she whispered . " I think what you need is to snap out of it . I think you 've been babied so long you do n't know how to act like a grown-up woman . Look . We all know you had a bad time . But it 's all over now and you 're perfectly all right . I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but being sorry for yourself . You 've got to quit . God knows I 've been patient as all hell , we all have . But the time 's come when you 've got to snap out of it . Quit babyingyourself . " " Oh , Lambert . . . Oh , please do n't be angry with me ... " " For Christ 's sweet sake , will you stop saying that ? I 'm not angry with you . I 'm telling you to stop being a damned little quitter and get some guts into yourself . " And indeed he did not look angry . He looked strong and remote ; a judge , dark and muscular and cold , of the creature that lay upon the bed and stared at him . " I 'll die , " she whispered . " I 'll die if it all begins again . If you 're going to hate me again . It 's all come back . Oh God ! Lambert . . . kiss me . " He drew upon a fresh cigarette , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't be hysterical , " he said . " The thing for you to do is to get a grip on yourself . You wo n't get anywhere by hurling yourself around . " Mrs. Rudd tapped at the door and came in . In the dim light of the bedroomshe looked large and reassuring . " Feeling better , dear ? Good . After you went upstairs I thought about you a little bit and I came to the conclusion that you might very well be lonely for your mother . Most natural , and with having to wean Honora ... And so I telephoned her and she is coining out tomorrow to spend a few days . Does that make you happier , dear ? " " Yes . " " And one other thing . You may think me very silly , " Mrs. Rudd said , with calm assurance . " But I telephoned Miss Percy and found that she is free . She 's coining tomorrow too . Just for a day or two . You see , I decided that perhaps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . With your mother , and Miss Percy , it will be busier for you . Are you pleased ? " Maizie sat up straight on the bed . " Oh ! I know everything will be all right now ! " she cried . But Lambert started to his feet and jammed his cigarette out in a dish . " For Christ 's sake , " he said , and walked out of the room . Maizie put her hands up over her wide , staring eyes . When Mrs. Jekyll and Miss Percy had come , Lambert began driving in to the studio again every day . He went into town each morning before Maizie was up , and returned in the late afternoon before dinner . Maizie was now surrounded by women again . She would look across the room at him , apologetically , pleadingly , but if he caught her eye he would smile and look away . He took the evening stroll with her after dinner each day , but he would not talk ; he looked at the stars . When she threw her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without violence , carefully , and turn his mouth from her hot face that reached up to him . " I do n't want to get you all upset , " he said . " When will you learn I 'm not an ogre ? Apparently I upset you . I 'm sorry . Naturally I want you to get well , when you get ready to . I hope you 're feeling better , with all your nurses and mothers . " " But I 'm not , " she whispered . " It does n't work . . . It 's getting worse ... I keep going faster and faster . " " Well , go slower then , " he said . Maizie threw her head back and looked at the skyful of stars . She thought , Oh stars , save me . Oh stars . . . stars over my love and me , calm , cold , lovely stars ... . But the stars were too big . Far too big . They were hideous and huge . Now the routine had been re-established , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking gaily and thrilled with the baby . Maizie strained to hear what they said ; the baby was beautiful , unique ; she tried to think what the words meant and to feel it too . She hung over the crib with her mother . There was a little face there , against the blanket . It was her baby . She tried to enjoy the things that , such a little while ago , had been happy and comforting : the breakfast tray , the walks , the coining spring . Why was it all horrible ? One afternoon she was lying on her bed , for her daily nap . But now she never slept . The contents of her mind surged round and round ; voices , and scraps of a hideous tune . She kept her eyes closed and with them the world outside seemed to close and she was alone in a red place where everything burned and whirled . She opened her eyes and the world was there again , and she looked at the clock beside her bed . It was time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went across to the window . Each time , she went to it with hope . Perhaps , one of these times , she would look out and the magic would have come back . She saw the gate , the pasture beyond ; the red barn , and far away the line of ocean . They were loathsome . They were phlegm-gray . They were so menacing and full of evil that she could not take her eyes from them , but went on staring . It was the most frightful scene she had ever looked at . She wrenched her eyes away and began to dress , faster , faster , faster . . . . There was n't anywhere to get away to . There was n't anything else to think of . The door of her bedroom opened with a harsh , screaming squeak . Miss Percy stood there . " We 're going to have a nice little game of croquet , " she said , from far away . " We 're all waiting . " " Oh , yes ! " Hurry down the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawn , where Mrs. Rudd and her mother waited , in thin spring coats , talking . . . . It took too long to decide who would play with whom ; it took too long to pick out the colors on the mallets ; oh , hurry , hurry , hurry.  |p336The  grass was turning green and the wickets were painted white . The leaves were in bud on the trees that bordered the lawns , and a bird sang . There was no time to look or listen . Quick , quick , the first and second wickets , the third , across to the fourth , hurry . " My , look at her , " the nurse said . " She 's half way through before we 've begun . " " Did n't know you were such a whiz at croquet , honey . " " Now , I 'm going to catch her , " Mrs. Rudd said , striking her ball precisely . She moved majestically down the lawn . They played and played , and Maizie won each round . " Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere . " I declare I 'm worn out . Let 's all go and sit down somewhere ! " Then they were in the glassed-in sun porch off the living-room , drinking tea . There was no tulle to drink the tea . The ocean N'as outside . It never went away . On and on and on , the roaringrolled . " Flow about our favorite game ? " the nurse said . " Your luck is so grand today I 'm sure you 'll beat me hollow . " They laid the cards out on a wicker table . The two older women talked at the other end of the porch . The western sunshine came at an angle into the room ; the red western sunset of New England , sad and strange ; and the ocean of the North beat rhythmically upon that phlegm-gray shore . Maizie turned to the spread-out game . But the faces on the cards looked at her . They looked at her ; the kings , the queens , the knaves , with little shrewd ferret-faces . Like animals in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hurried through the darkeningforest , and there was a whispering of animal voices and all the bright little eyes peered at her passing . When Lambert came in the sun was just sinking and the light was crimson . " Lambert , " his mother said . " I think it would be a nice idea if we all had a drink . Could you make us a cocktail ? A Martini , perhaps . " He came back with a tray of filled glasses . Maizie drank hers eagerly ; liquor made people feel better , she thought . Lambert went to the gramophonein the corner and began turning over records . " Lamb , honey , play us something nice and gay . " " I wish I saw what you do in this awful caterwauling , " Mrs. Rudd said to Mrs. Jekyll , raising her voice as the first long notes began ; the St. Louis Blues . " St. Louis woman , with her diamond rings , " Minnie May sang , smiling brightly at her daughter . But this was living hell . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twilight of the room Maizie looked toward her husband . He stood before the gramophone , smoking . She had to stand it . It must be endured . It could not be endured . That evening sun go down . . . ' But this was ultimate evil ; this meant the end , louder and louder to the end .. . " Oh , stop that ! " she cried . Lambert turned around very slowly ; in the dusk his face was a dark shape .   " No , " he said . " You ca n't run everything , you know . Your mother and I like it . " " Oh , honey , I do n't care one bit . Turn it off , if it bothers Maizie . " " If you do n't mind , I wo n't . She 's got to learn she ca n't have everything her own way . " Nobody spoke. 1 hate to see ... that evening sun go down , 1 hate to see . . . that eveningsun go down .. It was evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on her . After a while the lights were turned on , and soon after that they all went in to dinner . Maizie sat at the table in a chair with a plate before her . The candles in the centre blinded her , but all around the table were her friends . She must remember that . They all loved her . She was lost in hell but they were there , quite close , and they were her friends . It was herself that was evil . She was drowning in a sea , a moaning sea . It filled her ears so that she could hear nothing that was said at the table . That was her evilness . They were there and she must hear what they said . The world was getting smaller and smaller around her and these people who loved her were outside the circle . What she must do was push with all her strength to keep the circle from closing . She must look out of it , look up from it ; not in and down . She must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I love you all ! " she cried . Mrs. Rudd and Lambert looked up but did not speak . The nurse smiled . Minnie May stared at her daughter and her yellow , dry monkey-face puckered . " Dad called up this afternoon while you were restin ' , " she said . " I forgot to tell you . He sent you lots and lots of love . " Maizie wished that she could cry . She tried to see her father 's face , to hold it still upon the chaos . But that could not be done , any more than she could cry . Her heart beat in her : bang , bang , bang , bang , bang . That night she could not sleep . The mounting hours went by like elephantsmarching . She was alone . She was fighting to keep above the rising tide , to keep the circle open . She did not dare to close her eyes . Something was hurrying her , and in bed , under the blankets , her legs were tensed as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an irreparable wrong . She tried and tried to find what it was that she might undo it . She heard the clock downstairs strike twelve , and then strike one . She sat up and turned on the light . In the night the ocean was booming forever far away . The room seemed striped with falling rain , long gray lines slanting down across the walls . And up the walls crawled little shapes , rodents or cockroaches , colored pink . She put her feet out of bed and put on her wrapperand went to the door . She crossed the hall , the lights from her room lighting her . Directly oppositewas the closed door to Lambert 's room . She opened it and crept into the darkness there . Her hand struck the post of his bed . She felt her way along the edge , and touched his solid body lying warm under the covers . She got into bed beside him . He opened his arms and received her , and did not speak in the darkness . Her lips kept moving and making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be done . His mouth came down hard over them and stopped them . His arms held her and his body was heavy , big , and very warm . She pressed herself against him with all her strength and it was not hard enough . If she pressed herself hard enough she would escape . Now she could not seem to feel him there at all . It was only herself in the bed , pressingharder , harder ; straining for the opening that would let her out . Everythingseemed to give way before her . Everything sank back . She must press harder and find a resistance which she could break through . But it went away . At last he sighed . His arms fell away from her in his sleep . After a long time she got up and out of the bed . She was as cold as stone . Her hands were clenched . She went out of the dark room and across the hall and got back into her own bed . The light still burned . It threw liquid yellow streaks through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went queerly to sleep . She woke up hearing , from far away , the downstairs clock strike six and the ocean ; the ocean , still roaring , on and on . She opened her sick eyes and saw the glutinous light . She shut them again . Inside her , chaos was small and round and filled with chopped-up , surging stuff . Faster and faster , and closer and closer . It would have been easiest to stay drowning and suffocating in horror . But there was a strange morality involved . While she could she had to get up and find help . If she stayed even a little longer the space would close down to a pinpoint of existence , and then she could never , never tell any more and she could not call for help . That was the way of evil . The way of good was wrenchingly difficult ; she dragged herself out of the bed and crawled along the long corridor down to her mother 's room . All the air now , gray with hideous dawn , was streaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ push through the rain . Her mother lay asleep in bed . Maizie could not see her through the rain , but it was her mother . She knelt down by the side of the bed and stretched her arms over upon her mother 's shoulders . " Mother . . . Mother . . . Mother . . . Mother ... " In an instant her mother was there . " Maizie ! Darlin ' ! What on earth 's the matter ? Tell Mother what 's the matter . " She drew her daughter up on the bed and held her in her arms . Maizie was rigid . " Mother . . . " " Mother 's right here . Tell me , darlin ' . Are you sick ? " " Yes , I 'm sick . Mother . . . Mother . . . I want to go home . I 've got to go home or I 'll ..  | " Home , darlin ' ? " " I 've got to go home to Virginia . Make them let me go home . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh ! I 'm so frightened , Mother . Mother ... " She muttered her words . Her eyes were dry . Minnie May held Maizie 's wrist in her fingers . " It 's too fast to count , " she said . " Darlin ' , you 're sick . I 'm going right and call Lambert this minute and he 'll drive you in town to your own doctor . We 're going to get to the bottom of why you do n't get well . " " Oh , no ! " Maizie 's voice rose shrilly . " Do n't call him . Do n't tell him . Please do n't . It makes him so angry to be waked . . . . Promise me you wo n't call him . " " Maizie , you 're shakin ' . Tell Mother what you 're scared of , darlin ' . Did you have nightmares ? " She held her daughter close to her as if she were still a little girl , and rocked slightly . " No . . . Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've got to get to him before it 's too late . " " Do n't talk that way . You 're goin ' to be all right , yes , you are , Mother 's baby . Now , you stay warm here under the covers and I 'll go call Lambert . " " Oh , do n't , Mother ! Please , please . . . Just take me away and do n't tell anyone . Do n't leave me . I 'm so frightened . I ca n't stand it any longer . " " Ca n't you tell Mother about it ? " " It 's raining everywhere . . . " Minnie May did not speak . " Oh , please , please , Mother , take me away and get the doctor and make him let me go home . If I could just go home it would stop . . . . I could get out . . . Please , Mother ... " Minnie May began to get out of bed . " I 'm goin ' down and phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm going to ask him what 's right to do . You just stay here , darlin ' , and keep covered up , and I 'll be right back and everything will be fine . " Maizie stared while her mother got into her dressing gown . " You wo n't tell Lambert ? " " Honey , he 's the first who 'd want to know if you 're sick . He 'd want to drive you in , if that 's to be done . " Maizie bit the knuckles of her fist . " Ma'am . Ask the doctor . . . ask him now . . . ask him to let me go home . Oh please , Ma'am . . . " " Maizie , darlin ' , you 're in an awful state . I do n't know what 's the matter . But Dr. Forbes will be able to get you all straight . He 'll do what 's right . Now , do n't you worry . " " Dad will , " Maizie mumbled . Her heart hammered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll let me go home . Even if none of you will . Dad will . " She shook her head and her eyes were dry and bright like an animal 's . Her mother was hurrying out of the door . Maizie could see her , through the gray and fast-falling rain . If she could just last out till she got to ther doctor 's office , she thought . . . . If she could hang on until she got home , back to Virginia , the world would clear . They would try to stop her . She did not trust even her mother . Her father was there ; she knew now that he had always been there . He would try to get her home . But could he ? They were all lined up to stop her , all of them , and everywhere , shadowing them all , the tall dark figure , the hard dark face , Lambert , Lambert .. . Why would he never die ? Why could he not be killed ? Why must he be in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil ? Lambert , whom she loved ; and her love was like . . Her love was hate , her love was hate , she hated him , she hated him murderously , for he had killed her and killed her again , she hated him ... . And in the silent house Maizie began to scream . It made no sound . ON AN AFTERNOON IN JUNE Betsy Jekyll Jayne stood on a curb on Park Avenuewaiting for the lights to turn . She was going home from a day spent lying in a bathing-suit on a truckload of sea sand in a photographer 's studio , posing for a color picture to be used in advertising . In the five years since she had come to live in New York she had changed little . In particular , she had not changed inside ; she felt the same about things ; she was still governed by enthusiasm , by admiration untempered with criticism ; she was still directed in her behavior by the behavior of those she admired . She had never judged anything that seemed attractive as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reporter had interviewed her standing there at that instant on the curb , that she was a New Yorker . She liked feeling that she was a New Yorker . She dilated pleasurably to the song , The Broadway Melody , and to the line , " it 's a fake , it 's a phony , but it 's my town . . . . " But she did not think it was a fake or a phony . She thought it was wonderful . She considered herself outstandingly lucky to be what she was , where she was . Anything that had gone wrong in five years , and things had gone wrong from time to time , she laid to her own unworthiness or stupidity . For she was vain without being self-confident . Her vanity was a youthful thing concerned with her person . She had no conviction of inner worth . The self-assurance which her appearance indicated was based purely on knowing that she was a good imitation of a model pieced together from New York types . She had no feeling of inferiority , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in whose image she had formed herself . She was not , however , conscious of this . She had no instinct for selfanalysis . She could use the catch-words of Freudianism in conversation only because they were among the things she had picked up to use in making the New Yorker named Betsy Jayne . She collected and employed phrases , expressions , styles , accents , manners , like a magpie . P341She was charming . She stood quite still , in a red print dress and jacket and a white straw hat with a red ribbon . She looked like a picture in a fashion magazine , all except for one heel which showed a hole above the shoe . With all her talent for imitation she could never go far enough as to keep herself in real order . It was the Jekyll in her . There was always , if you looked for it , a little flaw somewhere ; a hole , a run , a ripped seam ; the edge of a pique collar , not soiled but not first-day fresh . She could never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be noticed . She was now , in the early ' Thirties , the gallant manly type of girl instead of the pert boyish type that she had been in the ' Twenties . But that was fashion , and the times , which were late Prohibition . In just such a way , what she had now was glamour instead of " it " . She admired Marlene Dietrichinstead of Clara Bow . Her supply of energy and youth was undiminished . The surface , from the outside , was different ; but the girl , inside , felt the same . She was still looking for something that she had not found ; but she was still absolutely sure that she would find it . She had never been afraid . She had never visualized defeat or despair or shame . She was like a shining , brown , uncracked nut . Nearly five years ago her sister Maizie had entered a sanitarium in Annestown , Virginia , where she still was . Various euphemisms were employed by the Jekyll family in speaking of the cause of Maizie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breakdown . Betsy had never been able to grasp the cause or the reality ; she thought of a nervous breakdown in terms of a tall , white-faced woman with streaming black hair , who pressed her hand to her bosom and was exhausted , too exhausted to lift her head from the pillow . This image had nothing in common with her sister Maizie . She had seen changes in Maizie the year before little Honora had been born , but those changes were now blotted out in her mind ; Maizie , when she thought of her , was a laughing , golden-haired young girl surrounded by beaux . What was this Maizie doing in the Annestown Retreat , which Betsy faintly remembered from her childhood , a brick building covered with ivy , set a little way back from the street ? Once , on a visit home to Hampton , Betsy had said , " I should think she 'd get so bored , poor Maizie , cooped up there in that old sanitarium . " Her mother glanced across the room at her father , who dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " her mother murmured , " that Maizie 's was a mighty small world . He said it was getting smaller . I do n't like to think about it . " Tom Jekyll got up and walked out of the room . " But why does it take so long to get over a nervous breakdown ? " Betsy asked . " Takes time , honey . Everything takes right much time , things like that . " It was mysterious and unsatisfactory . They said " a mental condition , " but what did that mean ? Did it mean Maizie was crazy ? She could n't be crazy , not in the Jekyll family , and besides the Annestown Retreat was n't an insane asylum ; it was a place for people with nervous breakdowns . Honora , who looked like Maizie , spent half her time with the Jekylls and half with Mrs. Rudd . She had a nurse who went with her from one house to the other to take care of her . She did not seem one of the family , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her as if she had been some very superior form of doll . But Jane and Glory were far beyond the doll age now . Jane had come out in Boston last year at a dance Mrs. Rudd gave her at the Somerset , and Glory was in her last year at Miss Sheraton 's and was going to have a dance at Mrs. Rudd 's house in Manchesterthe summer after she graduated . The Brats had changed . They were terribly Boston . There was a chasm between them and Betsy . They were like rather stiff strangers . When they came to New York for clothes they came to Betsy 's apartment , but they looked at everything in a supercilious , Boston way . That was absurd , becauseeverybody knew Bostonians would give their eyeteeth to be New Yorkers . There was no question in Betsy 's mind but what her life was enviable . It was simply that her little sisters had turned out rather stuffy . No doubt they would learn better with age . Everything was somehow different . The whole family was different . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Junior League and the Vincent Club , and Glory was thick with all those healthy Sheraton girls . In Betsy 's day it had n't been like that . She thought of the family as a Southern family , transplanted to the North , but still Southern . They used to be that . But now they were a Boston family . Minnie May had done it , because it was what she had wanted and she always got what she wanted . There was nothing to do but admire her . But it made a difference . Betsy still would have sworn that her family was the gayest , the most marvellous family in the world , but perhaps , inside , she did not wholly feel it any more . Once the family had been there , a heart , a core , a whole . Now it was pieces . Maizie was gone and cancelled out from life , her child that she had left a doll , and Lambert gone away to live in Italy , because  --  this was one more thing that Minnie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Dad was cancelled out too . He never talked when Betsy was at home ; he sat behind his paper and Minnie May said he was tired ; he looked old ; he was some way withdrawn from what had been the family , so that he too was a minus quantity . The Brats were Boston debutantes ; they talked with a Boston accent . They might have been daughters of another , a Bostonfamily . Minnie May was the same ; tremendously the same while she was being quite different . She seemed to have conquered Boston , without ever strikingher colors . Shc was still slapdash , exhilarated , and garrulous , and she went everywhere , knew everyone , was asked to serve on committees and be a patroness . Betsy said something about it once ; that Minnie May had the stiff Bostonians eating out of her hand . " Pshaw , child , " her mother said . " They 're just people . They 're just real shy , and real scared , and if you take ' em by surprise and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they love it . They 'd like to be like Southerners but they do n't know how . " But the family was broken into bits . After all , and in the end , it seemed  |p343Who  would have thought it ? It made her feel quite wide-eyed and thrilled . She was a New Yorker . She was seen at all the places . As a professional model , a Powers girl , her face was seen in advertisements in magazines . She was just not quite somebody . But there was lots of time . It took you a lot of quarters to hit the jackpot . Betsy had been fired from her job on Lady nearly two years ; she had worked in an advertising agency for a year and lost that job too ; since then she had made her living posing for photographers and , occasionally , commercialartists ; she was given five dollars an hour and her popularity ranked in the middle of the Powers models . By one means or another she had saved about five thousand dollars , which she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having done this , since most of her friends had lost their money in 1929 . Actually it had not been intelligence that had protected her from the market , but the fact that she knew so many customers ' men that she had never been able to decide which to intrust with her money . But she had forgotten that . In her first year in New York she had married a young photographer named Wilson Jayne , in the middle of the night , over a weekend , in Maryland . This fact seemed vague and dreamlike to her now . She had not seen Willy for two years , since he had left for the promise of a job in California , and she had not lived with him for some time before that . Willy was a drunk . He was a thin , endearing , childlike character and she was very fond of him ; their marriage seemed a dream partly because with him she had never felt quite grown-up , and there had been nothing grown-up about him or their relationship . She had seldom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a bad drunk , he was gentle and melancholy , and inclined to nostalgia . He was sweet ; she had sat in numberless speakeasies with him holding his hand . He was so much sweeter than anybody else she knew that she had had an idea , that night she married him , that this was perhaps the right kind of way to be in love . But it was obvious to her in a day or two that she was not in love with him ; the feeling she had about him did not change in the least the interest other men had for her . Nor was he any less fond of all sorts of other girls he knew . Neither of them minded . They lived for a while in an apartment hotel in West Fifty-fifth Street . Then Willy got involved with an Austrian girl who called herself a Countess , and after a while they simply stopped living in the same place . Neither of them ever got mad at the other ; they loved each other very much , but it did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that made them feel in the least married , was when Betsy discovered when they were in Fifty-fifth Street , that she was going ' to have a baby . Willy found out the name of a doctor , and one cold morning in January they had driven through the snowy stretches of Central Park , in a taxi , to an address far up in Manhattan , where the doctor had operated on Betsy . It was nothing very bad ; she felt quite well the moment she came out of the gas they had given her ; but Willy put his head in his arms , out in the waiting-room , and cried with fear and pity ; the doctor 's nurse had given him a drink of bonded whisky . P344That was the only thing that they had ever done together . When she thought of him at all , now , Betsy thought of Willy with affection and amusement and a little worry for fear he might be in trouble out there on the Coast . There had never been the time or the desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years , a few colds , a case of trench-mouth , and influenzatwice . She had lived in the Barrington , the Fifty-fifth Street place , and an apartment with another girl on Lexington Avenue ; an apartment alone on Fifty-sixth Street , and now she lived on Forty-eighth Street in the top floor of a walk-up . She had been to Florida for two weeks on a posing job for a magazine , to race meets in Maryland with a horsy beau she had had at one time , to Martha 's Vineyard to visit a girl , to Long Island on weekends of many widely varying kinds . She had picked up some French , and a smattering of German and Italian phrases . She stood on the curb in her white hat with the red ribbon , sweating little beads on each side of her short nose . At this hour the day was limp and dusty , waiting , she always felt , to turn triumphantly into evening . She was on her way home and she had no engagement that night . She meant to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses . But she also meant to , and knew self-indulgently that she would , make it a night off ; a sybaritic evening , in bed reading magazines with cold cream on her face ; shameful if you were the kind of girl who had nothing better to do , but luxurious if you knew you had only to pick up the telephone and call one of half a dozen men to spend the evening out instead . The afternoon traffic swept by up Park Avenue : limousines with Wall Street men in back reading the paper , taxis , and cars with their tops down bound for Queensboro Bridge and Long Island . The hot , late sunshine climbed the buildings on the east side ; the people walking north and south hurried across the street with an eye out for swooping cabs . Out of the traffic a funny little town-car bobbed , and pulled up directly at Betsy 's feet ; a Ford parody of elegance ; the chauffeur jumped out and ran round like a mechanical doll to open the door . Somebody cool and lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Betsy ! Betsy ! Get in . " It was Elizabeth Starr , the rich and well-known New York beauty who had once been Liz Symonds . Betsy had seen her only once since her marriage , when they had had lunch together ; but she was one of the people Betsy read about . Betsy jumped into the car as though she were jumping into a perfumed bath . It started uptown again . They kissed each other lightly on the cheek and cried , " Darling ! " Liz was noticeably the same ; conspicuously without affectation or the grand manner . Betsy felt almost completely at home with her . With her bright eyes she took in all the delights : the thin black dress , the big black hat thrown on the floor , the big chunky ruby ring and the enchanting dis/arrangement of red curls . Among them was a wide streak of short gray hair also erect and curly , and all at once that was amazing and enviable . Here was perfection . Here was Mrs. Horatio Starr , Jr . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town ? I should think you 'd be in the country . " Those pictures of Liz in shorts playing tennis in Southampton ; laughing in a bathing suit at Newport . " Horatio has had an attack of being indispensable and I am just the little woman . So here we are quietly melting away . How are you , darling ? I 'll take you home . Where ? " Betsy gave the address and Liz repeated it through the speaking tube . " Please come up and have a drink . You 've never seen this apartment . I 've missed you terribly . " " Darling , it makes me sick . I never see anybody I want to see . Such boring people . I never have a minute . " This was of course nonsense . But Betsy appreciated her being so polite . Betsy had never borne a grudge in her life . She accepted changes cheerfullyas inevitable . Being a New Yorker she knew you had to fight for what you got . " Just come up a minute . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . But look ! I have a brilliant idea . What are you doing tonight that you ca n't get out of ? " " I 'm not doing anything , " Betsy said , eagerly . " You 're dining with us then . Lord , what a load off my mind . We 're living in the town house for a day or two and we 've got this man . Horatio said we had to have him . A newspaperman or something like that , " Liz said with a wonderful innocence , an utter ignorance of the ways in which people made their living . " Anyway he 's writing a book about the Starrs . You know , the whole blush-making story . Horatio thought perhaps if we were nice to him he would n't rake so much muck . I do n't agree . If we give him a heavenly dinner he 'll just go away and make us more Bourbon than ever . So here we are saddled with this great lump , and I was terrified . I would n't know how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepping in and saving me . I know you 'll handle everything too beautifully . I can just relax . " It was done so gracefully . Liz was a clumsy , terrified little thing and Betsy was conferring a real favor . It was n't at all that Betsy had been asked to fill in a four at the last minute chiefly to pacify her hostess ' conscience at neglecting her old friend . " I 'd love to ! " When the little car pulled up smartly in front of the brownstone house made into apartments , Betsy jumped out laughing and nodding . It was a lovely world where things like this popped up , quite unexpectedly . The house of the younger Starrs , on a street near the river , was small and gay . Like the Ford town-car it was a sort of joke . Everything in it was cheerful and unimportant and pretty ; there were surprises round every corner , little tricks of decoration that were all wit and no grandeur . It was a toy house arranged by a child having fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that had its speech to make : Is n't it silly to have so much money ? And besides we lost most of it in that ' 29 business . For goodness ' sake , we 're not rich ! We just want to have fun . There 's nothing here that could scare anybody . We are rather divine , are n't we ? ' The living-room had one dark-gray wall , one light-gray wall , one white wall and one pink wall . The cocktails were on a fat little table made entirely of glass , and Horatio Starr , a red-faced young man in his forties wearing a white dinner coat , mixed them himself . Liz sat on the pink buttoned sofa in a long pink and white striped cotton dress like a dairymaid 's , with her feet drawn up and tucked under her . It was hard to see how anybody could be angry with such disarming people . ' ' Do you love rum , 111r . Connolly ? I do . " The rather grim-faced young man sat on a tufted chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other . Betsy smiled her childish smile at him . She had stepped into this atmospherein her yellow dress and hugged it to her . Her eyes were very wide open . " Have another , Connolly . " Horatio Starr shook the glass shaker , with a swishing , tempting sound , and lifted his eyebrows towards his guest . " Let 's all get just the tiniest bit pie-eyed , " Liz whispered , suggesting conspiracy . Hector Connolly held out his glass and half-lifted himself from the chair in a compromise between two possible behaviors . Then he sat back . He had not quite caught hold of the atmosphere . He was much more serious than the other people in the room . He kept looking from one to the other of them and it was obvious that he was trying to catch on . He had a big , heavy build like a football player 's , under his black dinnercoat . It was quite a good dinner-coat , but a very serious one . His face was big and long and pale . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big . He had thick , colorless hair brushed very smooth and straight to the side . He had a way of thrusting out his chin suddenly , but he seemed to realize that he was doing it and that there was nothing to do it for , and then he would retract it . A man in a white pea-jacket came to the door and bowed . " Yes , Jean , " Liz murmured . " Shall we let ourselves be buffaloed ? " Horatio Starr said , looking at his wife . " They treat us like dirt , " Liz whispered to the others . " They absolutely run us , Mr. Connolly . They 're so stern . I 'm going to assert myself , by golly . I 'm going to have another drink . Darling , give me another drink . We 'll all have another drink and show them . " She was so very pretty . The red curls and the white one stood straight on end in defiance . She set her jaw . Mr. Connolly laughed . After a while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the dining-room.  |p347One  side was all glass and looked out over the garden , which was now illuminated like a little stage . Instead of being placed round the table , the chairs with their violet and white striped seats were one at each end and the other two behind the table facing the scene , as children might rearrange their seats so as to look at what they pleased . Liz and Horatio sat at either end . Liz bounced up and down twice and then kept as still as a mouse while the butler brought in the soup . " Black bean ! " Liz cried . " Oh , I love it so . I do n't see why I ca n't ever have just soup for my dinner when I love it so . " Hector Connolly gave just one , instantaneous glance at the big spoon in his hostess 's hand and picked up his and began to eat . " You been many years on the Dispatch ? " Horatio asked his guest , quite shyly . " No . I 've only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Pittsburgh Progress . " " %Vas it awfully smoky ? " Liz asked . " Pretty smoky . " Hector Connolly laughed . Betsy leaned both elbows on the table like a child and gazed at the man beside her . " I love to hear newspapermen talk , " she said . " So sort of experienced sounding . " " Out of the corner of my mouth ? " Hector Connolly glanced at her . " Oh , no ! " " Do you come from Pittsburgh , Mr. Connolly ? " Liz asked , blinking very seriously and taking an intelligent interest . " Well , no . I 'm sort of a Southerner . You probably never heard of it . Annestown , Virginia . " " Not Annestown , Virginia ! " Betsy put down her fork and switched entirely around in her chair so that she was sitting sidewise facing Hector Connolly . She put her elbows on her knees and her chin on her fists and beamed . " But I do n't believe it ! It 's not true ! Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , I lived on Pinckney Street for centuries , all my entire childhood . . . . Do n't look so calm about it ! " He smiled uneasily , but he stopped eating and looked at the flushed and shining face that leaned toward him . He almost turned around in his chair too . His voice held no trace of Southern accent . It was part Irish , part city ; hard and truculent and defensive . " You would n't have known me , " he said . " I was on the other side of the railroad tracks . " " But there 's nobody on the other . side of the railroad tracks but the negroes . Did n't you ever know my sister , anyway ? My name used to be Jekyll . She was Maizie Jekyll . " " Oh , yes , the Jekyll family , " he said . " Oh , yes . I saw you all . In fact I lived right down the street from you . But you would n't have known me . We did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . And hell , I have n't been there since I was fifteen , " he added roughly.  | Betsy stared at him without moving . The plates were changed again but she did n't turn back to the table . Horatio Starr talked , and Liz winked at him . " I remember , " Betsy said . " I have n't been back since I was terribly young , either , but I remember where you lived . You had that house behind the fence . On the corner . And there were always fires burning in the yard . And a lot of children . " " And , spit it out , you were n't allowed to associate with them . " " Was n't I ? " She looked like a young angel , rosy and healthy in her clean yellow dress . Nobody could be angry with her , or suspect her . Hector Connolly 's heavy white face smiled reluctantly . " Okay , " he said . " I 'm Irish . I 've got a chip on my shoulder . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skip it . I did n't say you looked down on me . " Betsy shuddered and squinted up her eyes . " What an embarrassing idea . God . I ca n't believe it , that you lived in Annestown . Why , do you know I never met anyone before that came from Annestown . I mean , nobody comes from Annestown . Except us , " she added cosily . " Do you remember Miss Addie Lane ? The one with the red parasol who had fits sometimes when she was downtown ? She had one in Williston'sdrugstore once when I was a child . " He laughed out loud , a harsh , eager laugh , and this time , glancing first at Liz , who was paying no attention to him , and moving self-consciously , he too turned around in his seat and faced Betsy . In a few moments he had forgotten himself and was laughing and talking without taking his eyes from her face . He seemed almost like the others . " This is a divine dessert , " Liz shouted plaintively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I wish somebody would pay me some compliments . " Hector Connolly turned back to his plate and his face turned heavy and conscious again , " You never did a stroke of work in your life , Mrs. Starr , " he said . " You 're joking , of course . " " Well , I did n't make this dessert , except in spirit , but by golly I 've done plenty of work . Have n't I , Bets ? Did n't we two stoke coal side by side for years iii the stinkhole of Lady ? " " We certainly did . " Hector Connolly raised his eyebrows . It was the expression of a diplomat in a movie . " No kid , " he said . " I wish you 'd let me find who you know that I know . Pittsburgh ... . Did you ever know Evelyn Swift ? " " Yes . I knew that piece . " Liz never flinched . It was true enough that she had worked for years before she met Horatio Starr and some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever was unnecessary from those years . She had an airp349of charming and befuddled innocence , a cockeyed irresponsibility , the childishness of one who had always had a great deal of money . " Tell me , did you see much of her ? " " Not too much . She was a friend .... " " A good friend ? Spill the beans , do . I always thought she was a naughty girl . " " I was going to say , she was a friend of my wife 's . " " Oh . I wonder if I ever knew your wife . " " You probably do . Her name was Cornelius . Baby Cornelius . She divorced . me last year . " " I 'm frightfully sorry . " A variety of expressions drifted quickly across Liz 's face . " I 'm frightfully sorry I brought it up , " she repeated . " It 's okay . " Connolly 's face was heavy and defiant , and at the same time proud . Liz jumped up from the table and swung her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Let 's have coffee outside . They hate to give it to us outside . The French . Outdoors . But I do n't see why I ca n't sit in my own garden , do you , darling , " she said , hooking her arm through her husband 's . Beyond the glass wall was a little fairyland . The bluish floodlights lit up the curly white iron chairs , the rows of geraniums in pots , the starshapedstepping stones , the little iron version of a Madame Recaniicr sofa . Outside and above and beyond and all around , the city roared , but this was like a private kingdom fixed just so within the walls . The grown-up world howled outside , its radios blared , its children cried in the tenements across the street , its traffic rushed and screamed and hooted , but this was the garden of two children playing house . " Do you like my rose tree ? I raised it from seed . " " You 're an awful liar , darling . " " Are n't I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in this blue artificial moonlight where faces were only partly seen , where cigarettes glowed for an instant . The coffee cups made a cosy chinking noise as they were set down in their saucers . A tray of drinks was brought out and for a time the lights in the dining-room shone and then they were extinguished . The ice rattled in the glasses . " Mr. Connolly , I bet you hate me for making a break at dinner , " Liz said sadly much later in the middle of something her husband was saying . " It makes me so unhappy . " Connolly cleared his throat . " No . I love you , Mrs. Starr . " " I love you too , Mr. Connolly . What a relief . " She gave a loud sigh . Connolly cleared his throat again in the darkness . The butler in the white coat came to the glass door and spoke in French . Horatio Starr got up . " Do you want me too , darling ? Look , will you excuse us just a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Horatio 's . If I do n't stand at his elbow the man who runs it will skin him . You go on talking about your childhoods , will you , darlings ? " They were silent in the garden . Betsy 's dress was like a beam of yellow light across the blue-white chair . Connolly got up to make himself anotherdrink . " I suppose you speak French too , Mrs. Jayne , " he said in his angry voice . " Hardly any . The man said the captain of the boat wanted to speak to him . " " Jesus Christ . I suppose the horrible little boat of Horatio 's , " he said , in a shrill falsetto , " is the god damned Andromeda . Just a few thousand tons , that 's all . Just a lousy little rowboat , something to get around in . " Betsy giggled . " You 've got to admit they 're divine . " " What do you mean , divine ? Oh , all right . I admit they 're not like what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act . But Mrs. Starr seems like a good kid . All right . " " It is n't an act , " Betsy said earnestly . " Honestly . I 've known her a long time and she 's sweet and natural and everything . She never put on an act in her life . " He had filled his glass ; he walked across the garden in the clear , synthetic moonlight and stood in front of Betsy , looking down at her . She tipped her head back . She looked up at him . " Hello , " she whispered . " Hello , kid . " He bent down very slowly and kissed her on the lips . Then he stood up . She reached out and took his hand and pulled him down on the iron sofa beside her . Then she simply went on staring at him , with her mouth breakinginto little smiles . " I knew something wonderful was going to happen to me tonight , " she said in a small , breathless voice . " I knew it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on drinking from his glass and looking at her . " Do n't kid me , " he said , and cleared his throat . " I 'm not the boy to kid . " " I do n't want to kid you . I do n't expect you to feel the same way . It 's just me . I just feel about seventeen . " " Like to go dancing , later ? " he asked abruptly . " Yes . Let 's ! " " I guess we can get away . " " Yes . I did n't expect to meet you . " " All right , I did n't expect to meet you either . I did n't expect a lot . These Starrs  --  are they really on the up-and-up ? " " They 're just people like anybody else , only more attractive . " " She is . They 're just capitalists . No matter how thin you slice it . She 's quite a girl for pulling the wool over your eyes , is n't she ? " " But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just the same . We used to room together when she made thirty-five dollars a week . " " Well . . . . Look , you say when you 're ready to go , and I 'll say I 'll take you home , see ? "  | " Yes , " she whispered . She squeezed his hand and looked at him shyly in the blue light and took her hand away . The Starrs came back , talking about their boatman . When Betsy went to get her wrap to go , Liz went with her to the upstairsroom . She sprawled on the bed while Betsy did her face . For a moment it was almost like the old days in the Barrington . " He 's kind of a rough diamond , is n't he ? Queer . I 'm always scared to death of those kind of men . They 'd like to put a bomb under Horatio , I can see it in their eye . But you did marvels , darling , marvels . Thank God for dear old where's-it , whatever the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think he 's divine . " " You do ? That 's nice , dear . You know who he makes me think of ? " " Who ? " " Horatio 's cousin Oren . Golly , were n't you in love with him once or something ? Maybe you run true to form . The same kind of queer business , kind of abrupt business , unpredictable ; they 've got the same thing . You can have it . " " What 's Oren doing now ? " Betsy was putting on lipstick . She looked wide-eyed at herself in the glass . " Oh , you know . Funny places , Brioni in summer and Sestrieres in winter , but still always well within the pale . He is n't a real rebel . I bet you this man downstairs is n't either . You know why ? " " Why ? " " His wife . Pittsburgh Cornelius . Lots and lots of money . It 's all very well a newspaper and books about wicked tycoons , but that was a perfectlyrespectable dinner coat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set against the rich and marrying them at the drop of a hat , trying to be chic and saying he hates it because he does n't think he 's doing it right . Do n't let me put you off . He 's probably divine . " Betsy stood up . She put on a short yellow jacket that matched her dress . In the doorway of the bedroom Liz put her arms around Betsy . Liz smelled of some far-away delicious perfume ; for an instant a snatch of something forgotten , sweet and nostalgic , and in an instant lost . They kissed each other affectionately . They might have been nearest and dearest friends . There was no formality about departing . The butler did not even appear . Starr got Connolly 's hat himself . " Ca n't I get you a taxi ? " he asked anxiously . " Let 's walk ! " Betsy cried . Connolly shook hands . Starr opened the little red front door , and Liz stood waving as they climbed the steps to the brightly-lighted , still hot street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the hell does that mean ? " Connolly said as they started to walk west . " Have a good time . ' But I did n't tell her we were going dancing ! " " Why not say , have a good time ? " " Is n't it funny how people know what you 're going to do ? " she said.  | At four o'clock in the morning they came walking slowly down FortyeighthStreet arm in arm . The city was quieter , closed up . It seemed very calm . In the empty , dark street a policeman tried an areaway door , singing to himself . . . " No more money in de bank . . . . " Across the still city came the hoarse sound of a boat-whistle on the North River . Betsy unlocked the downstairs door of the brownstone house and they went up the three narrow , dimly lighted flights to the top , and she unlocked the second door . The keys she took from her evening purse were attached with a chain that ended in a huge , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " They were giving them away at the opening of a new speakeasy , " she said . " Nice , " he said . They went directly into a square room that was faintly lighted from outdoors , through windows giving on the back . She began groping towards a light . Ile followed her and pulled her outstretched arm under his . " Let 's look out of the window . " It was not yet dawn . The sky was dull whitish dark and the shapes of a few high buildings stood out , their edges blurred ; in some of the towers an occasional light burned far away , single and remote ; who was there , in this lonely hour , and what did they do ? Whoever they were , they too were awake and living , across the air . His arm was round her shoulders and after a while he turned her to face him and stood looking down at her in the darkness . " I do n't just love you , I 'm in love with you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . " I 've never been able to be in love , but it 's what I 've always wanted , " she said . They began to move away from the window , with their arms entwined . They went slowly through the obscurity before them , into the next room . In that unseen place they leaned down , separately , bent and turned , and at intervals each reached out a hand in a caress to still the qualms of the other . They lay smoking cigarettes side by side in the dawn that had come . " I suppose you wo n't believe me , " she said at last , " that this is the only time in my life it 's ever been right . " " How about your husband ? " " That was n't even anything at all . This way . " He turned his head and looked at her in the early light . " I believe you if you tell me it 's so , " he said . " I feel as if it was the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But it 's not the first time .... " " I 've done it with two men , " she said . " A lawyer , and a broker . " " I do n't want to know who they were . I 've never been exactly celibate myself . I 've gotten over a lot of ideas about women I used to have . I mean about chastity . " " But they do n't seem real . Nothing happened . They do n't count , do they , when they did n't mean anything ? " " I do n't know . . . . I guess anybody gets a part of you if you give it away . " 1 " But I never gave anything away . " He pressed her hand gently . They smoked in the silence . " No , three , " she said suddenly . " Another broker . " " You do n't have to tell me . " " But I want to tell you . I want everything to be clear and right . " " Everything will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth . " " Oh , I want to ! I want to tell you the truth . " " Good , " he said softly . There was another silence . " Does it feel at all different to you ? " she whispered . " Is n't it a little bit new for you too ? " " You 're a sweet kid , " he said . " I love you . " " Was it . . . was it better with your wife ? " " I do n't know . It was different . " " I 'm jealous of her , " she whispered . " You need n't be . It 's dead as hell . I was a bastard to her and it 's all washed up long ago . " " I would n't care if you were a bastard to me . I want you to be any way you want to me . " " I do n't want to bitch anyone ever any more . " " You would n't . You could n't hurt me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked down on her , and his hand picked up a lock of her brown hair and twisted it . " You want to stick around with me ? " he murmured . " I want to stick around with you all the time . " " You 've got lovely hair . I wish you 'd grow it out long . You do n't look like a woman , you look like a boy . Do you want to be a woman ? " " I want to be a woman . . . . " IN JULY they were living together . Everything about life had been changed . Hector worked at the Dispatch rewrite desk from two till ten in the evening ; he did n't want to go to bed for a few hours after that , and he slept all morning . On Betsy 's appointment pad in the Powers ' office a card was pinned that said , " Will not take appointments in A.M. " Only a few of the most popular models could afford to be choosy without suffering for it , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curly hair was not in fashion , either , and it was not quite long enough to do up . Mr. Powers said , pleasantly , " Mrs. Jayne , are you crazy ? The other hair-do just suited your type . " But Betsy did not care . Nothing mattered . She was keyed to highest tension , her thoughts were possessed , she was a new self . It was exactly as if all of this new feeling had been there all the time , waiting ; it felt that way ; as though this was the way she was meant to feel . Passionate , obsessed , insatiable ; voracious for the love that was the staff of her life and nourished on it ; giving herself from her depths , from her bone and her blood , and receiving it again from the man that she must have . She fed upon his virility ; this was the way that women felt , and now she wanted more than anything in life to live as a woman . After Hector had left the apartment she would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or if there was none , she would move about the rooms absently , cleaning , straightening , bathing herself , dusting . If Hector had time to eat dinner comfortably he would telephone to her and she would walk over west in the long twilight of daylight saving time to eat with him at some restaurant off Broadway . The time seemed very empty when she was apart from him ; it was time to kill . At ten in the evening she would arrive at the Dispatch building and wait upstairs in the waiting-roomby the elevators , outside the city-room , until he came out to meet her . On a July night she was walking on West lorry-eighth Street looking in the windows of the restaurants , filled with hand-painted menu signs and live lobsters , dawdling to use up the extra minutes . She felt lonely and happy ; her loneliness was a kind little thing , an imitation of what she would feel if she were not going to see Hector in a quarter of an hour . She sang under her breath as she strolled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the people passing ; but now she lived in her dream and her heart sang all the time . . . " I ca n't live without you . . . . " A man hurrying by in a blue suit looked back over his shoulder at her , and then turned round and went back . He had no hat on his thick , curly hair . " Bets ! Hello , how are you ? " " Hello , Laudy , " she said . They shook hands . He was a young theatrical producer named Lauder Beam . " What on earth are you walking along here for at this time of night ? Not batty , are you , darling ? I never sec you anywhere any more . You 've desertedus , " he said . " I 'm on my way to meet my beau , " she said , looking at him with a face bemused and happy . " Beau , hni ? " " I 'm in love , " she said . She wanted to tell him , to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's why I never go anywhere any more . I do n't want to see anyone else . " He looked disconcerted . " Well , " he said . " Happy , hm ? " " I 'm terribly , terribly , divinely happy . " He looked embarrassed but kindly too . " I 've never felt like that . Retiring from the world stuff . The world forgetting , by the world forgot . " " That 's it , " she said . " That 's how it feels . " " That was a quote . Betsy . . . . Can I take you anywhere ? " " Oh , no . Thank you . " " Good luck , " he said . " I hope it all turns out fine . "  |p355She  gave him an absent-minded , dazzling smile and he turned and hurrieddown the street again . She continued on , and around the corner and down Broadway , crowded and noisy and full of flashing lights . She crossed . Hector came out with a reporter named John Hannon and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short , stocky man who talked a lot , and they all walked up Broadway and up Fifty-second Street to a speakeasy , where Hannon was meeting his girl . She was a blue-eyed brunettewho looked gentle and domestic ; she and Hannon held hands on top of the table . They ordered four whiskies . The brunette was with Hannon and Betsy was with Hector . The two men talked about Walker and told the girls cracks that had been got off in the city-room and about the new man on the desk from Cincinnati . The brunette had a very soft , low voice and Betsy saw she loved Hannon and it made her like the girl . It was nice , relaxed and kind , unlike any New York life Betsy had ever known before . Betsy had her back to the smoky room . Somebody put a hand on her shoulder and said , " Hello , beautiful . " She looked up at a man named Jock Hamilton , whom she had seen several times at parties on Long Island . He looked tight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , " he said . " How 's Catherine ? " Hector and Hannon stood up . They stood with grave shut faces looking Jock Hamilton up and down . " Oh . . . " she said . " Mr. Hamilton . Mr. Connolly , Mr. Hannon . " " Let me tell you you 've got one of the most beautiful girls in New York with you , " Jock exclaimed . His large handsome eyes shone . The two men stood still and did not speak . Jock Hamilton looked at all their faces . " Got to be running along , " he cried . " Got the night before me ! " He went out through the curtained doorway . " Who was that son-of-a-bitch ? " Hector asked . The two men sat down slowly , warily . " A man I used to see around . An actor . " " You seem to have known some of the God damnedest bastards , " Hector said . His big , white , Irish face glanced angrily from left to right . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks like a ham , " Hannon said . " I wish I 'd taken a crack at that fat face while I had a chance . " Hector was restless ; he did not seem to be sitting all the way down in his chair . Betsy looked at him pleadingly . " He did n't do anything to you , " the brunette said softly . She laughed , a reasonable , womanly , healing laugh . " What in hell did he mean kissing you ? " " Darling , everybody does things like that in New York . Do n't they ? " she appealed to Hannon . " Yeah , they do . " " I do n't like it . I do n't like to sit here with my finger up my nose taking it . " " It does n't mean anything . "  |p356The  brunette talked softly , soothingly ; Hannon was practical and dismissedmatters ; Betsy kept looking at the large , pale , furious face she loved . " Okay , " he said at last . " You boys win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " He put one hand on his hip and ogled Hannon . " I think it 's just too wonderful , your New York . Do you suppose anyone will take a fancy to me ? " " You do n't have to see people you do n't like , " the brunette said gently . " You can just stay around with the people you like . " She looked at Hannon and smiled . Her dark blue eyes were beautiful . " You tired , sweet ? " Ilannon asked her . " Want to go home ? " " Not unless you want to . It 's only midnight . " They were such nice people and Betsy liked them . They were like people in a small town , Annestown or Hampton . There was something about being in love with Hector that made her like people like Hannon and the brunette . They got up in a little while and said good-bye and left . Hector was on his fourth drink . She put out her hand palm up on the table-cloth . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the fingers tapped her palm restlessly . " What 's the matter , my darling ? " " Son-of-a-bitch drove me nuts . Sorry . " His fingers tapped her palm as if it had been the top of a desk . " Let 's go somewhere else . " When he was tired from work , and when he was a little tight , he never wanted to rest . They went out and walked fast up Fifth Avenue . Betsy held his arm . They did not linger to look in the shop-windows as they often did . Hector did not even glance at the displays of expensive men 's clothes . Generally he liked to stand and look over each item and talk about them ; clothes were one of his obsessions and he liked to talk for hours about good leather and good tweed and the right cut for lapels . His interest went oddly with his tough manner and his bold , pale face . At Fifty-eighth Street they boarded a bus and climbed on top and rode uptown . Although he did not talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head back on it , feeling faint with love for him and a longing that she did not quite understand . They got out and walked again , and went to a Cuban speakeasy in lower Harlem . Hector knew how to drink tequila with salt and lemon and he was proud of his technique . They danced to the rowdy rumba band . " You really can dance , " he said finally , looking down at her and smiling . The relief she felt was so strong that her heart skipped a beat . " So can you . " " We 're hot . Look at that little piece over there . Look at her shake . I bet you the tarbrush did a good half of the work there . " They sat in the noisy smoky place and looked at all the flamboyant , screaming , dark-eyed dancers , who drew apart and shook their hips , then snatched back to each other . " What filth , " he said . " What foulness . They ought n't to allow stuff like that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought you liked Cuban music . I thought you liked this kind of thing . Flow do you mean , filth ? "  |p357He  shook the salt-shaker , making a little pile of salt before him on the table . " I get funny sometimes , " he said . " Do n't mind me . You 've got a pure mind , have n't you ? I 've got a dirty mind . Do n't forget I was a Catholic once . I 've got a lot of it in me . Not that I 've been to confession for years and years . " He rested his head on his hand . " Let 's go home , " she said . " Do n't feel bad . " " I 've bitched everything I ever did , " he said . " My mother considers me as dead , you know . Because of the Church . To say nothing of some of the other pretty things I 've done . I 'll tell you this much , " he said , raising his voice roughly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is kind and decent and good , because you were sheltered . I 've seen everything . Did you know I came damned near being a Party member once ? Me , that was once a Catholic . Oh , yes , I 've been around and I know all about that stuff . You better go away and give me a wide berth . I 'm bad . No wonder the society people spit on me . I 'd spit on me . I 've done everything . Do you want me to tell you something I 've done ? " " If you want to . " " I 've slept with a Negress . Why do n't you get up and walk off ? What are you sitting here for ? " Her eyes were full of tears . " All I know is that I love you with all my heart , " she said . He lifted his other hand and buried his whole face . " And furthermore I ca n't take it , " he said , sitting up straighter . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very assiduous in holding the doors open for her as they passed out of the place . They walked downtown from Harlem through Central Park in the night . The towers rose from the south and hung the sky with spangles . They walked arm in arm , and near Seventy-second Street , alone on the dark blank path , Hector pulled Betsy around to him and kissed her . " I do n't mean to make you unhappy , " he said . " Jesus knows I do n't mean that . " " You do n't . You do n't . " " Let 's sit down here . I want to sit on a park bench with my girl . Like this ? " " I love it . " " We might be sitting on a park bench in Paris , " he said . " I feel like this is the way it would be . The air smelling nice and dirty at the same time . I 've always wanted to go to Paris . Would you like to go to Paris , sweet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassed . " You 're always so ashamed of feeling sentimental . " " You 're getting me over it , I 'll say that . Well , I 'll settle for New York . I 'm getting to like this place . " " I love it . Do n't you think it 's wonderful ? It 's got everything . "  | " Maybe it has , maybe it has . I 'm a suspicious bastard . Sometimes I think I 've got paranoia . " " I thought that was insane . " " I 'm not any too sensible sometimes . Sometimes I 've suspected my own mother of things . . . . Make me have some sense , will you ? Make me keep on enjoying life the way I do now . " She rubbed her check against his . " You 're true to me , are n't you ? " he asked . " I 've never looked at one person since I met you . " " You have n't had time , baby . You be true to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . I swear it . I belong to you . " " That 's what I want . " " Do n't you know I belong to you ? " " I guess maybe I do . If you say so . You just keep telling me the truth , will you ? It 's the only thing I still believe in , telling the truth . " Her head pressed against his coat . " I never met anybody before like you , " she said . Week after week through the summer passed and they were happy discoveringabout each other and making new habits together . A sort of cult grew up with them ; he was man , she was woman ; he was to dominate , she was to give way . Part of the time it was a little game that they played . When they shopped for food she would carry the packages . " Woman 's work , " they called it , smiling at each other . Part of the time it was somethingpassionate , a deep obbligato to their lovemaking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female . As a basis for living it grew along with the piling days in which they had lived together . Hector had Wednesday off each week . They had a special way of living on Wednesdays . He used to lie in bed after they woke up , and doze while she got their breakfast in the little kitchen . They ate the things they liked best , and like married people they had their little habits : English muffins , and orange marmalade , and black Guatemala coffee . Betsy had introduced Hector to Guatemala coffee . He had an odd manner when anything new was introduced to him : he was curious and learned all about it in a few minutes , he seemed to master it and make it part of his information ; at the same time he was somehow truculent , as though he did not like it that there was anything new for another person to show him . And afterwards he did not like to be reminded that he had not always known about it . It was after one o'clock one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin , brown silk dressing-gown . She had the breakfast spread on a table before the sofa that faced the windows . The windows were open and the yellow curtains blew inward on a breeze that was hot and carried the sounds of the sunny city , the sound of hammering and the sound of radios . The terra-cotta head of Betsy stood on the top of the bookcase , the chin tilted back , the hair swept from the ears ; against the pale gray walls it looked adventurous and triumphant . They drank their orange juice curled up on the sofa side by side , and lit cigarettes to finish their coffee with ,  | " I love the way the first cigarette knocks you , do n't you ? " She put her legs up over the arm of the sofa and leaned back against his shoulder and watched the smoke rise from her cigarette and run out of the window . " How would you like to go to the movies ? " " No . " " How would you like to stay right here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice , inexpensive , easily pleased girl . " He turned his head and kissed her cheek . " We 'll just sit around , and we can get dinner here , and drink some of the brandy . " " Are you ashamed of me ? " She sat up and twisted around to look at him . " Well , are you ? Or am I kind of a gigolo you keep hidden . A fancy man you keep in his place . " " Are you insane ? You 're being funny . " " Partly .... You never write your mother anything about me , do you ? " " How could I ? Dear Mother , I am living in sin with a man . His name is Hector Connolly . " " All right , all right , all right . Skip it . " " I do n't want to skip it . Do n't you know I feel like saying my prayers out of thankfulness every time I look at you ? " " Did you write your mother about the other men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be this way . I told you , I never lived with any of them . " " One night stands , eh ? " " Hector , do n't . " " How many of them did you say there were ? " " Three . " " How am I compared with them ? How do you rate me ? " " Hector , do n't spoil everything . Nobody ever meant anything to me at all until I met you . I ca n't remember anything about them . " " Suppose I went away a couple of nights ? Suppose you could remember anything about me ? " " If I ca n't have you I do n't want anything , ever . " He pulled her into his lap and held her . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I do n't know why I have to hurt you . To show myselfyou really do love me , I suppose . The itch to dominate . Like I had to practically kill my wife . " " Do n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes me jealous . She 's not your wife now . I 'm your wife . " " I used to get so drunk . Christ , how drunk . I 'll tell you something . I threw her down a flight of stairs once . It broke one of her teeth . Like somethinga drunken Irishman in a tenement would do , is n't it ? Well , I 'm Irish . We do n't like feeling anybody 's out to destroy us . You 'd better clear out . You want me to throw you down some stairs ? " " She must have done something wrong . You could n't hurt somebody unless they hurt you . You could n't hurt me . I love you too much . "  | " She did n't do anything wrong . She was just being her . Just Baby Cornelius , the sweet little blonde thing with a lot of money and been to the best schools . She went to school in Switzerland , too . She just trudged along after me , picking me up when I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Then she 'd give me something . She could n't think of anything else to do . She gave me this dressing-gown . Got it at Sulka 's . " " She should have known better than just to buy things . " " Do n't criticize her , God damn it . I feel loyal as hell to her . She got God 's dirtiest deal . I do n't see how she stuck as long as she did . " Betsy was silent . " She was just as good family as you are , you know that ? Not only rich . She was a beautiful girl before I went to work on her . She got kind of battered . But they 'll fix her up , now they 've got her back , Elizabeth Arden and a trip to Paris . " " Why did n't she stick ? " " Oh . . . I told you she took a beating . She was n't brought up to live in a tenement with a drunken Irishman . No , that 's not it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl she knew . We were lying on Baby 's bed . What the hell . " " I 'd take it if you were untrue to me . It would kill me , but I would n't leave you . " " I was n't untrue to her . Only that one time . But I wanted to be . I used to want to be ; all those damned smooth babes ; loose , too ; loose . But I never was , just that once . But that mattered to her . She never looked at anybody , even after I 'd paste her one and go off drunk , maybe . She got thin , and her eyes got bigger and bigger . It was n't any good with her any more . But I did n't . I only wanted to . I 'm not trying to justify myself . I did do it , and I 'll tell you who it was . That bitch Evelyn Swift your friend Mrs. Starr asked me about . She was quite a job ; tall . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good anyway and nobody was happy ever . Poor little Baby Cornelius , that married that big no-good of a mucker . Poor Baby . " He got up and lit himself another cigarette and went over to the window . The sill carne to his hips and he leaned out on his elbows ; his shoulders made a big dark shape against the light . The quality of the day had imperceptiblychanged to afternoon ; it was afternoon sunshine and the sound of hammering was an afternoon sound . After a while he turned on his elbow and leaned there , looking at Betsy . He was smiling now . " What 's the matter with you ? " " It makes me unhappy when you 're so unhappy . " " I do n't want any more unhappy women around . " " All right , darling . " " You are a good girl , are n't you ? Do just what I tell you to . You know what I want ? " " What ? " " I want a happy home . I want a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not to be the way I 've always been any more . I want a girl that'sp361a fine hearty piece , begorra , and causes me no whit of worry in the world . " " That 's me . You 've got me tied up and delivered . " " Have I so ? " " I want that too , " she said . " A happy home . I want something solid . I 've never had anything . . . solid . We 've got it , have n't we ? " " Let 's see , " he said , coming to her . " Let 's experiment around and see how solid . " She got up and put her arms around him . They left the breakfast dishes on the table and walked through the room entwined . Hector stopped in front of the head of Betsy . It was now in full sun . " I do n't like that girl , " he said . " You do n't ? Why not ? " " She looks too damned cocky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like this girl better . She 's getting awfully big and beautiful , " he murmured . " Her hair is getting awfully long . She 's growing up to be a woman . " " You 're a man and I 'm a woman . " In the evening he stood in the doorway and watched her cook their dinner ; the pots on the little stove steaming , the yellow lights falling on her flushed , concentrated face . They had soup and chicken and salad and cheese , and a bottle of red Italian wine . Afterwards she washed the dishes and he stood in the doorway again and made personal remarks in a teasing voice . They went into the living-room and sat on the sofa together again and Betsy brought out a portfolio of pictures of her fancily and showed them all to him . He asked questions intently and seemed fascinated by the smallest autobiographical facts concerning them ; but he also seemed angry that she was telling him anything that he did not already know . He took his billfold out of his inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'd love to ! I did n't know you had a picture . " He passed over a small snapshot of a woman standing in the doorway of a frame house . Her arms were folded and her hair pulled back . Her face was thin and serious . " She 's a beautiful , good woman , " he said defensively . " She 's had a lot to endure . " " I think she 's lovely . I wish I could meet her . " " She 's not speaking to her oldest son . But she 'd like you . " All at once it seemed as if her heart would break . " Oh , darling , darling . I love you so . " But the day after , when Betsy met Hector in a restaurant off Broadway for dinner , he came in hurriedly and did not look directly at her ; he tapped with his fingers on the table and kept looking around the room . " What 's the matter ? " " Nothing . " They had clams first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I say . . . . Why did you say you liked the way newspapermentalked ? "  | " What ? " " At Mrs. Starr 's , " he said impatiently . He still would not look at her . " You said you just loved the way newspapermen talked . " It was his shrill , bitter falsetto . Her heart was beating thickly , heavily . She was glad he could not see it , pounding there inside her . " I do n't know why . I just said it .... " " Did you mean you liked the way Don Garrett talked ? " " What are you talking about ? " she said . Now he turned his eyes and looked directly at her . He leaned forward on the table . " All I want is for you to tell me the truth , baby , " he said . " God help me , I would n't do anything to you . I just want the truth . If you really love me you 'll tell me the truth . Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The moment was hideously threatening . She had the feeling that in anothersecond he would get up and walk out of the restaurant , away from her , and she would never , never see him again . " There 's a girl up on the seventh floor who works for Lemmon . She comes down sometimes and sits around and bulls . She told me she 'd seen me with you , did I know you very well ? . . . " His voice went into falsetto again . Then it dropped . " I said I saw a lot of you , and she said you must be quite a girl . She 'd understood you were a girl of Don Garrett 's . Sure , quite a heavy girl , Don Garrett was supposed to be sleeping with you . " They both stared silent and stricken at each other . " All I want is the truth . I can take it . You do n't think I 'm a sissy , do you ? Do you think you have to feed me crap ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " she said . " I swear to you it 's not true . " " You do ? " " People say such things , " she cried . " That 's one thing about New York . If you 're seen with anyone you 're supposed to be sleeping with them . People say it about everyone . When they do n't know anything about it . " " Do they know anything about you ? " " I swear I did n't . Oh , God .... " " What 's the matter ? " " You do n't know what it does to me to see you looking at me that way . " He looked down , and picked up a clam on the little fork . Then he let the fork drop . " I ca n't eat , " he said . " Let 's go somewhere and get a drink . " They walked miserably along the sidewalk in the deepening city twilight . After a few blocks she took his arm . He clipped hers to him with his elbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " I 'll tell you one thing , my friend . I 'm in love with you . It 's got to be love if it makes you feel like shooting your lunch . " " Do n't let people take you away from me . Everybody tries to get people for themselves . Everybody 's got a knife in everybody else . " " I thought you liked this place . " " I guess people would try to get you anywhere . "  |p363He  squeezed her arm . " I wish we could go home now , " he said . " I do n't know what 's the matter with me . I feel lousy . Come on in here , let 's get a drink . " They sat , between seven and eight , at a little table in a cellar crowded with noisy people , and drank from glasses of whisky and soda . Across the table their fingers held each other 's . His face was very white and hers was flushed . She cried a little , but no one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they whispered to each other . In September they went to their first party together . It was a big party given in a penthouse by a rich , elderly art collector , and Betsy received an engraved invitation . Over Hector 's uncertain protests she telephoned the collector 's secretary and asked if she might bring Mr. Connolly . A pause . " Yes , Mrs. Jayne , Mr. Schwartschild says he would be very glad . . . . " " Is this some kind of a kike party ? " " Oh , no . He 's a non-Jew Jew . A Hellenized Jew . " " Where do you learn words like that ? " " It will be very big and all sorts of famous people . " " How do you know all these damned people ? Do you know a lot of Jews ? It seems so queer that you were going around living before this summer . I ca n't ever catch up with your life , " he said , complaining . They got all dressed up for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put on a dress made of white lace with a little frill that stood out around her hips like a lace paper . Her hair was curly from the hot bath and she pinned it into a roll around the back of her neck . She stood up from the dressing-table and looked at Hector in his dinner-jacket . They moved forward and embraced each other to cover their faces . " You look beautiful , " she whispered in his ear . They went in a taxicab ; they had never been to a party before . The separation to the dressing-rooms , the meeting in the long hallway , the receivingline and the introduction to the white-haired little man with a ribbonin his lapel ; dancing together to the smooth , swooping music : these were all new and entirely different from anything in the past . " That was the Legion of Honor , " he said . " In the old boy 's buttonhole . " " He 's nice . He 's a dear old man . " Hector kept smiling and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched Hector standing with the other men beside the orchestra , so unlike them , so big , so powerful and so defenseless . He came back to her in a minute . " You do n't mind if I ca n't leave you alone , do you ? " But she knew he was shy , and it wrenched her heart that he should be liking the music , and wearing that pleased , vulnerable look . When she was alone with him he was bigger than she , and tougher and stronger and harder ; but here he was not so sure as she . They walked along a terrace that looked out over the southern stretch of Manhattan , the whole great splash of night and lights . The terrace was lined with little tables where people sat and drank and chattered , in theirp364beautiful clothes , their jewels ; their faces catching the light as they turned to say a word , their hair smooth and shining . A girl with yellow hair reached out and caught the frill of Betsy 's dress . " Hello , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another of Powers ' girls , a tiny creature not over five feet tall , with the hips of a doll and a doll 's pretty face . Her name was Judy Elliott , and she introduced the man that she was with as Henry Hunter and said that he was an architect . He was a big man as tall as Hector ; they shook hands with each other and all sat down . There was champagne to drink , brought around constantly on trays . Everyone at the party seemed to Betsy to look pleased . It was the end of the summer ; the beginning of the New York winter . Hector danced with Judy , and Betsy with Hunter , and then they exchangedagain , and then ( lector and Betsy talked to some other people in a small panelled room with French furniture , and then they danced . By half past two they were with Judy and Hunter again on the terrace . Hunter was a serious young man . He leaned on his elbows and talked to Hector about Frank Lloyd Wright , pausing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was interested and absorbed : set , alert , and a little angry , but Betsy could see that he liked Hunter and it gave her a strange , fond pleasure . " I 've had all the champagne I can drink , " Judy said . She laid her hand flat on her little waist . " If I eat anything , if I drink anything , you can see it . Everything makes a bulge . " " Why do n't you come back and sit around ? " Betsy said . " Let 's sit around and talk at home . " They all drove downtown together in a taxi ; they were like old friends . It was all taken for granted . Hector unlocked the door to the apartment with his key ; it seemed quite natural . He switched on the lamps while Betsy got the glasses and the whisky . They sat on the sofa and on the neighboring chairs and talked . Only Betsy sat back peacefully in the corner of the sofa and looked at Hector , in his dress-shirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the oddest sense of completion . She felt calm and satisfied ; she felt in absolute pitch with her life . It was a peak , ultimate and happy , of contentment . He was talking about the Chrysler Building , and then quite suddenly he finished what he was saying and his eyes met Betsy 's . They smiled across at each other . When the others had departed , Hector closed the door and walked back to Betsy , who stood at the window watching him . They took each other 's hands and stood face to face . " This is the best of all , " he said . " This is the happiest in my whole life . " " I looked at you and there you were . " " You looked so absolutely right , as if you belonged there . " " I do belong here . "   " Do n't you say it . I 'm the one to say it . Will you marry me ? " " It 's the only thing in the world I want . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night fading from the city . " That little girl was so jealous , " he said . " Anybody would be jealous of you , the way you look . Proud , and sure , and strong . " " They knew we have everything . " " You looked like a wife . You looked like my wife . " " I love to have people see that I belong to you . I never felt like that before . I always wanted to feel that I just belonged to myself . When I was living with Willy it always felt uncomfortable . I was his wife and I did n't feel like his wife and it irritated me to realize people thought of me as his wife . " " Because it was n't right . " " Nothing was ever right . You are the only one . " " When are you going to get a divorce ? " " When shall I ? " " Right away , darling . Quick . Go to Reno . " " Six whole weeks . " " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " THE LEASE on Betsy 's apartment ran out the first of October and they decided that she would leave for Nevada then . There was not much time before the first . The furniture would have to be stored , and things had to be packed . She wrote to her mother that she was going to Reno  --  although she had been separated so long that her marriage seemed unreal , now she felt an instinct to declare her plans  --  and she told Mr. Powers that she was going away . She wrote a letter to Willy at the last address she had for him , and told him that she was going to get the divorce now . The apartment became a confusion of packing boxes ; she took down the curtains to pack them and the windows stood bare and rectangular at the end of the room . She was busy packing her clothes the night before the movers were to come . Hector got home a few minutes after ten . It was a chilly evening and Betsy had thrown a lot of trash into the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fire there during the summer . Hector came in and i lirew his gray hat down on the littered table and went over to the blaze , holding his hands out to it . " I 'll make a drink for you . " " Cosy home life . " " What 's the matter ? " " Oh , nothing . I 'm tired . " " Tell me what 's the matter . "   Everything was ending , everything was beginning ; everything was on a hair-trigger . " Oh , crap . Just let me alone . I 'll get over it . " " I ca n't do anything till I know . " " Every time that bitch passes me she has a gleam in her eye . She thinks she 's got something on me . " Betsy sat down on the armchair , stripped of its slipcover , by the side of the fire . She looked into the blaze . " Has she got something on me ? " he asked . " People are so cruel . People ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . " " Has she got anything on me ? " Betsy pushed her hair back from her forehead . She looked tired . " Do n't you know I 'm all yours ? " " Answer inc . " Quite suddenly she put her head down in her hands and began to cry . He did not touch her . " Quit bawling . It 's true about Don Garrett , is n't it ? " " Nobody ever took anything from me . I never gave any of myself away . " " It 's true , is n't it ? " " You do n't understand . I was a different person then . It did n't mean anything , any more than if 1 'd kissed him .... " " You do n't need to go into that . So it 's true . " " Do n't you see I could n't tell you ? " " Why did you lie to me ? " " I could n't tell you . I could n't lose you . I 'd put everything I had into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's ever mattered . " " Did n't I tell you all I wanted was the truth ? " " I know . Do n't think I have n't gone through hell . Sometimes I felt I could n't stand it . I wanted you to know . But 1 could n't lose you . " " Now , let 's keep this very , very clear . You started off lying to me the night you met me . Remember ? " I wish you could understand . . . . It felt true . I did n't feel as if that were anything but the truth . I felt so young , and in love for the first time , and kind of untouched . I did n't say anything that did n't feel true . I swear it . " " Let 's omit about how you felt . " He sat down in the chair opposite her and leaned forward with his elbows on his knees . " I think we 'll stick to the truth for a change . There 's a lot we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she cried frantically , " I did n't know it to tell you , the night I met you . I swear to you I 'd forgotten it . It was only that horrible night in the restaurant when you mentioned his name that I remembered , and then I could n't tell you . " " I can see how convenient such a short memory would be . I think you 're going to have to give your memory a little exercise . Now . You get to work . Who else ? " He did not lock especially angry . He had the intent look that he woreP367when he was bent on gathering information . His big face was dead white . He did not take his eyes from her face . She glanced wildly around the room . " That head . The man who did it of me . It was a long time ago , before I married Willy . . . long , long ago . " " What was his name ? " " You should n't make me tell names . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend much time on what 's nice . You 're going to make a clean breast of it if I have to spend a year making you do it . I 'm going to have the truth out of you . What was his name ? " " Benson Levy .... " " Who else ? " " I ca n't think of anybody else . That 's all . I swear it . " " You 're good at swearing to the truth , are n't you ? Who else ? Think . " " You 're torturing me ! " He lit a cigarette quietly . His hand shook . But his voice was not angry . He leaned forward again . " What do you think you 're doing to me ? . . . Think , now . This is n't going to stop until you 've told me the whole truth , about everything . You 'd better start remembering . " " Oh darling ! " She leaned across and held out her hands to him . He did not stir . " What does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I could never look at another man but you . I did those things in the past when I did n't know anything , and they did n't mean anything to me , anything at all . I know I was horrible and it was wrong and I could kill myself for it now . But I did n't mean anything then . That 's true . Everybody I knew did that way . Ca n't we just put it behind us and forget it , both of us ? I did n't know you then . If I 'd known there would ever be you I could n't have . " " I was ready to take a blanket statement about your past once . I would have accepted anything you said , I was so in love with you . But it 's too late now . Even you must see that . You 've lied to me , and lied , and lied , and now you 've got to go back and tell me every single thing . " " Are n't you in love with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to marry me any more ? " He looked at her . " Who are you to talk about marriage ? " he said . " You do n't understand ! I did n't think I was ever going to be in love like this . You see . . . oh God , it 's so long ago . . . . I was in love when I was about eighteen and . . . " " We 'll skip the reasons till later , if you please . We 're getting facts right now . Who else ? " " I ca n't remember . " " Well , remember . We 've got all night . We 've got forever , if it takes you that long . I 'm going to get the truth . " At six o'clock in the morning they were still sitting there , on either side of the dead , the ruined fire . The hearth was scattered with cigarette butts . The whisky bottle stood on the floor beside the glass , by Hector 's chair.  | He was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face as white as paper . Betsy drooped sidewise in her chair and her face was congested with weep-ing . You do n't even remember this guy 's name , " he remarked . The lamp behindBetsy 's chair still burned in the gray daylight of the room . " I told you . " " Not him . The one we 're talking about . Did you ever know his name ? " " Of course ! But it was so long ago . . . . I met him at a cocktail party at a girl 's , Mary Dawson 's , and he asked me up for a drink a little while afterwards , and I went and there were some other people . And they went away , and he played the piano , and --  " " We 'll come to the case-histories another time ; later . Another one of these instructive evenings we 're going to have . Unfortunately I have to take time off to work . I 'm going to bed as soon as you decide to tell me this man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited , smoking a cigarette from his third pack . Outside the noises of traffic began to take hold ; the New York day was beginning . After a while he got up and threw his butt into the fireplace . She lifted her face . " Where are you going ? " " To bed . What 's it to you ? " " Oh , my darling . . . . You look so tired . I love you so terribly and I 'm going through hell .... " " Are you ? Personally , the only thing I want to do is puke . " She followed him into the bedroom . He would not look at her . He flung himself into bed . She knelt down by the side of the bed , looking at his face , his closed eyes . " Darling . . . may I come to bed too ? " He did not open his eyes . " If you do n't mind , " he said , " I wish you 'd stay out of this room . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tell me just one thing , " she whispered . " What do you want me to do ? The movers are coming at noon . What do you want me to do ? " Now he looked at her , coldly . " Want you to do ? Why , just keep on going . Keep on remembering , if you will , please . " " But I 'm not to go to Reno ? " " Naturally not . " " What do you want me to do ? Go away ? " " Oh , no . Oh , no . None of that . You 're not going sneaking back to mother . You 're not going to get to whitewash your memory so the holes do n't show . You 're not quitting till you 've finished . " " What are we going to do ? " " Do ? We 'll have to go somewhere . Somewhere where we can continue our researches . Go to a hotel . " P369He shut his eyes and turned over , away from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand lightly on his warm shoulder , he wrenched it away . She got up and went into the living-room and lay down on the sofa in her clothes . When he got up the movers were in the apartment . She had not let them go into the bedroom , and she had cooked a breakfast for Hector and saved out china for him to eat it from . He walked into the living-room , dressed . She looked desperately at him but he avoided her face . A mover was packingglass in a barrel . " Here 's your breakfast . . . . " " No , thank you . I 'm going out for my breakfast . " He looked round the apartment as if he had never seen it before . His eye rested on the terra-cotta head . He walked over and picked it up , balancingthe heavy thing in his hand as if it were a paper-weight . " This anything you want ? " " No . Oh , no .... " He crossed the room and tossed the head into the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ashes and the old cigarette-butts . " If you do n't mind , " he said . " Of course not . . . . " " It was a pretty thought of yours to keep it here all this time , " he said . " Nice for me . " He went over and opened the door . " You can call me around ten , " he said . " Maybe I 'll know where to tell you to go . " " That 's all , " she said . " That really is all . " It was three o'clock in the morning . They sat in the large , high-ceilinged , hotel bedroom . A door stood open into a smaller bedroom . The rooms were old-fashioned , with brass double bedsteads and big pink armchairs with lace antimacassars . The bath to each room was up a step , with marble washstands and tubs that stood on legs . Here there was no fireplace to sit by , so they sat facing each other across the room ; all the ashtrays were choked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emptied them in the bathroom . Then she would come back and sit down again in her chair , and look at him with her tear-streaked face , steadily . He held a glass in his hand , filled with whisky and water and ice , and most of the time he regarded the glass and jingled it gently . " Now think . That really is all ? " " That really is all . He sighed and took a sip from the glass . " Now . We enter another phase of our research . You 're a very interesting case , did you know that ? I should like very , very much to understand you . The inquiring mind , you know . Now . Could you explain to me in what way you are any different from an ordinary pushover ? " " Oh , God . . . . Ca n't we rest ? "   " I 'm afraid rest is a stranger to me just at present . We have a lot of work to do . Answer my question . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hair . " It did n't feel like that . . . . I was n't a pushover . Ca n't you see ? I always felt like a boy . Liz used to say . . . . It 's so hard to make you see . I was n't being pushed around . Anything I did I did because I wanted to . " " Interesting . I thought you said you did n't want to do . . . all that . " " I meant it did n't mean anything to me . It did n't take anything away from me . Young men go around and have different girls . . . . I felt like a young man . " " Morals did n't enter into it , of course ? " " But do n't you see ? Everyone I knew did it . Morals about that were supposedto be old-fashioned . Besides it was supposed to be bad for you not to . People get inhibitions . . . . " " All , yes . The Freudian angle . Your husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't care . He had lots of girls himself . I mean , he was n't grim about that kind of thing . It did n't mean much to him either . " " You 've known such nice people . You mentioned Mrs. Starr a minute ago . I am to understand that your kind of life was not much different from what she was used to . Right ? " " Oh , yes ! She lived with Starr for ages before they were married . " " I was n't speaking of living together , exactly . " " Well , yes , I know she had a lot of beaux . " " You say it meant nothing to you and you had no sense of immorality , and yet I notice you are fond of euphemisms in referring to the past . Now . Did anybody , ever  --  besides this saintlike character you seem to have married  --  didanybody ever ask you to marry them ? " She stared at him . " Yes . Lots of people . " " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She mentioned four or five names . " They were all people who were  --  as you put it  --  beaux ? " " No . Some of them were and some of them were n't . " " Why did n't you snap up one of them instead of working on me ? " " But , do n't you sec .... I did n't want to be married . I wanted to be free . " " What made you set your cap for me ? Were you getting scared by that time ? " " No ! No ! You 've got it all wrong . I fell in love with you . I 'd never felt anything like it in my life . I felt all reborn . It was like being a young girl . " He drank from his glass . " I wonder how long it 's going to take me to break down that story . " " You ca n't break it down because it 's true . Do n't you know it ? Do n't you know you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wonder why I could n't realize you were a pushover on the basis of our own history , " he said.  | " But I 'm not a pushover ! " " What are you ? " " I wish I could make you see . I always wanted to be glamorous . I used to want to be kind of like Iris March in The Green Hat . I wanted to be a grande amoureuse . Everybody thought it was divine to be like that . Nobody thought it was awful . " " Go on . " " It did n't keep people from getting married if they wanted to . That was all Victorian , that about marrying virgins . Willy did n't care a bit . Liz marriedHoratio Starr . People asked me to marry them . I never heard anybody criticize anybody for having lots of beaux . " " Think what you 're saying . Anybody ? " " Well , not the kind of people that were . . . smooth . Glamorous . Kind of New Yorkers . " " You know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " she whispered , trembling . " I used to think New York was a cesspool . You got in your licks and got me believing maybe I was wrong , maybe it was a good clean place like anywhere else . I 've been an easy pupil , have n't I ? A quick study . It 's quite interesting to find I was right on nay own observations . And you know what I think of you ? " " What . . . " " I think you are a cretin , to put it kindly ; the sort of poor half-witted girl who does it for a quarter . Hell , no ; I take that back . Those girls are earning their living . You have n't even got that . " " You hate me so .... " " Or have you ? How about that ? Have you taken money for it ? " " Of course not ! " " Now you think . All that money you 've got salted away in the savings bank . You make it all ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Except some money that was made for me in the market . " " Now what would made for you ' mean ? " She pressed her fingers into her eyeballs . She told him of the system Liz had explained to her years ago ; the imaginary capital that earned real 1 I money . " Only one man ever did it for me , though . " " What was his name ? " " Curtis Bright . " " Could n't you ever get anyone else to do it for you ? " " I never tried . I did n't ask him to ; he just gave it to me for a present . " He got up and went over to the bureau where the whisky bottle and the pitcher of water and the ice bowl stood . The bowl was full of water now ; he fished in it with his fingers and put the slivers of ice that floated on the surface into his glass . The whisky gurgled as he poured it out . There was I ' 1 only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he dashed it into his drink and went into the bathroom and filled up the glass . Then he carne back and sat down and put the glass on the floor beside him . " Why did you lie to me ? " " I told you ! I could n't lose you , and you were different from anyone I 'd ever known . I saw you cared about things like that . It meant something terribly important to you . " " You were right about that . Why did you bother to lie to me the first night you met me ? You did n't know anything about me then . " " I did n't feel as if I was lying . It felt true . I felt so young , and untouched . I could n't have told you everything then . It would n't have been true . I did n't feel as if ... " " You told me three . Remember ? Why did you tell me anything if you felt so untouched ? " " I do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so confused . It was like the life of another person , that she was trying to explain without understanding . That first night , had it been a sort of token confession ? Fallingin love with him so overwhelmingly , had she had an instinct that he would want to know what other men never bothered to ask ? She did n't know . She could not remember . It was long ago . She had never been able to live except in the moment . He sighed . " And you did n't feel like a prostitute ? " " No ! I never did . I felt . . . young , and adventurous . " " You thought of yourself as a perfectly good woman ? " " I was n't a woman at all . I never thought of myself as a woman . " " You were able to feel perfectly self-respecting . " " Yes . " " And you were going to let me go on and marry you like a poor little sucker , and never tell me . " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " She put her face in her hands . " Tell me why you wanted to marry me ? Were you getting scared ? " " I told you that was n't true ! " She threw her head back . " I was married already . I 'm married now . It was n't marriage I wanted . " " What did you want ? What was in the back of your mind that first night ? " " Nothing was in the back of my mind ! I fell in love . Completely . It was the coup de f oudre . " " If you do n't mind , " he said , " I 'd rather you did n't speak French . It makes me think about where you probably picked it up . " She began to cry again , softly . Already the steam was pounding in the radiators . The light came in around the drawn shades . Someone went down the hotel corridor outside , and a door slammed ; there was the sound of water being run in a tub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Go to bed . I do n't want to look at your lying face . "  | " I 've told you everything . Do n't you believe me ? " He gave her a long look . " Go away , " he said , sighing . Near noon she crept into his room again . The bed was empty , and the shades were up . It was a beautiful , clear , brilliant October day ; the sky above the low downtown buildings was blazing blue . He stood in front of the mirror in the bathroom brushing his pale , thick hair , fully dressed . She looked at his big shoulders in the warm , brown worsted suit ; his clean white shirt and the necktie knotted snugly under the flesh of his chin ; the scrubbed , shiny look of his white cheeks , freshly shaved . He laid down the brushes and came out into the bedroom . He went to the bureau and put the money that lay there into his pockets , the watch with its chain and small gold knife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuck it in his breast-pocket , glancing into the mirror . He ignored Betsy . The remains of breakfast stood on a table by the window . A newspaper lay , open , on the floor . He picked it up and folded it and thrust it into his outer coat pocket . He took his felt hat from the top of the chiffonier and put it on the back of his head . He looked around the room as if seeing whether he had forgotten anything . Then he walked over to Betsy , near the doorway to her room . She put out her hand and touched the woollen stuff of his sleeve . He smelled of shaving-soap and orange-juice . " I 've got to leave you , " he said , gently . " Can I . . . can I meet you tonight ? " " You do n't understand . I 'm leaving you . For good . " She began to cry , and stretched out her arms blindly to him . He did not shake her off ; he stood still , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smooth shaved sides of his neck . " Do n't you see that I 've got to leave you ? " " I love you so . . . . " " It 's no good . " " I have n't got any life . If you go everything 's gone . " " You can just go on where you left off when you met me . " " No ! " The tears streamed from her wide-open eyes . " Never , I 'll never go back . I never could . " He patted her shoulder gently . " I hope you do n't , " he said . " But it 's none of my business any more . " She watched him cross the room and go out ; the door closed . She began to walk rapidly around the room . She touched the things lying on the bureau ; she passed the closet and went back and put her hand on the sleeves of the suits that hung there ; she went into the bathroom where the light still burned , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bath that had been taken there . Then she went back and looked at the suits hanging side by side : the gray , the blue , the dinner-jacket , the bright brown tweed that made him look so very pale.  |p374His  things were all here . He would have to come to take them away . She sat down in the armchair by the window in front of the ruins of his breakfast . She sat up straight , rigid , and looked out of the window at the brilliant midday . At half-past six the telephone rang on the stand beside the bed . The room was full of evening . She was lying on the bed , and stretched out one hand and took up the receiver . " Do yop want to meet me in about an hour for dinner ? " His voice was very far away . " I 'll wait for you at Luigi 's . " " Hector ! Yes , darling , of course . I 'll be there in an hour .... " She leapt up and ran into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their old corner table in the bar , in the reddish half-light , close together , holding each other 's hands tightly . There were very few other people . The bartender moved about behind the bar , against a background of rows of polished glasses and bottles of liquor : many kinds of whisky and gin , and strangely shaped bottles of things like Strega , Kiimmel , and Fiori d'Alpini . " I could n't leave you , " he said . " I could n't do it . I kept feeling as if I was going to die . Larkin asked me if I was sick . I said I was sick . He let me take the night off . " " I thought I was going to die too . " Two generous glasses , Martini cocktails , stood side by side before them . A glass bowl was filled with peanuts , and they both kept reaching for them . The salt stuck to their fingers . " When I thought I 'd never have a cocktail with you again . . . I kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there must be something that could be done . I kept thinking how young you are . I kept thinking of all the ghastly people you 've known . I kept thinking about the way your face looks ; you look innocent , did you know it , darling ? And then I kept thinking about . . . everything else . It went round and round . But I think I got everything straightened out . 1 think there 's just a chance . " Their fingers pressed and pressed . Their white faces looked at each other with longing , with agony , with tenderness . " Do you really Iove me ? " he said . " I really love you . " " I figured it out . . . . I do n't have to leave you , on one condition . Can you take it ? Can you make yourself over ? How do you feel about it ? Do you want to regenerate yourself ? " " I 'd do anything . Anything . " " Could you live for three years without anybody , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want ? Could you make yourself a new past that would be good ? It would n't be easy , you know . It would be hell , for both of us . " " I could do anything . If you were at the end of it . " " It would have to be without any promises , even . All I can say , is that I want the real you with all my heart and all my mind . I want the good you.  |p375I  want a strong , pure woman that loves me and has gone through hell to get me . I would n't even promise- to be true to you . 1 would n't belong to you , nor you to me . Whatever way you lived would be because you wanted to live that way , for its own sake . " " Could n't we ever be together ? " " No . " " I could do it . I will do it . I want to . I want to be good . " Life and the cold bitter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her face was lifted . She would live somewhere , alone , up bare flights of stairs : strictly , strongly , sustained by a great faith . There would be nothing soft . Life would be like pure cold water and plain meat . Life would be like climbing a high bare hill to the top where a light burned and great music would begin to play . " I kept thinking about my wife . I know it hurts you for me to call her that , but she is my wife . I kept thinking of all I 've done to her . I 've got such a load of guilt . I 'm not a Catholic any more ; you know there 's no divorce . You 'd have to be better than she was . You 'd have to make me feel I was n't descending to anyone less good than she was . You 'd have to be better , and finer , than she . Is it worth it to you ? " " Yes . " " You could be the finest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . There ca n't be any promises . But if you cared enough , and if you were strong enough  --  there could be something great . Do you feel it ? There could be a marriage so great that it would be greater than anything , than any wrong . " Their faces , side by side , looked through the dim atmosphere of the place they were in , and beyond it . A man came in and hurried through the bar to the door that went into the dining-room . He glanced at them as he passed ; a small , blond man . " Hector .... " " What ? " They looked at each other aghast . " That man ? " " No . Somebody that looked like him . " " Who ? " " An Englishman . Stephen Ebery . " " You did n't remember ? " " I did n't remember . I ca n't understand why I did n't remember . Oh , God , it 's so horrible . It was just buried . I 've tried so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . You 've got to believe me . I do n't know what 's the matter with me . " He held her hand tightly . " I believe you , " he said . " I believe you 're sincere . It 's all buried . In a way it makes me believe you never were that kind of woman . It was just the people you 've always known , and you were so young . In a way it makes me trust you . You could n't have wanted to produce that , just now , after everything . I believe you really want to tell me truth . "  | " I want to tell the truth . I want to be good . I will be . " The bartender came around the bar with two more Martinis and set them down , big and dripping , in front of them . " We ca n't begin the new life yet , " Hector said . He looked down into his drink . " We 've got to get everything out first . You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to tell me . We 've got to work , before anything else . " " How will I know , " she whispered . " How will I ever know that I 've got it all out ? " " I do n't know , " he said helplessly . " I ca n't tell you . You 'll just have to know . " After they had eaten a little they walked downtown through the October night , arm in arm , from uptown to far downtown where the hotel was . They walked very fast ; the traffic swept past them and the lights on the avenue changed from red to green and to red , but they were deaf and blind . Their faces were white and tired and exalted . Now , again , they had dinner together every night , and every night they met at ten and walked downtown to the hotel for another night like the others . Betsy did not report back for work . She paid for her hotel room out of the money she began to take from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a bench in Washington Square , reliving the past that was like a nightmare to her , trying to recall it month by month and combingher memory for voices , faces , scenes . She was tortured by self-distrust . It was agony to lift herself back out of the present into days that had once seemed so bright and were now made hideous . For dinner they went to all the places that were now so dear , so nostalgic of their summer , and tried to laugh and talk of other things , but their eyes would meet and their fingers would reach for each other 's and they would look at each other in silence , in misery and sadness . Once on a Wednesday they ran into John Hannon and his girl , the brunette , having dinner , and joined them . There sat the others , so comfortable and contented together ; happy lovers . They all joked and smiled , and after dinner , they went back to the apartment where Hannon and the girl lived . They drank highballs and talked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heaven . They left about eleven and began their long walk downtown . " I was proud of you , darling , " he said . " You kept your chin up . You did n't let them sec anything was wrong . That 's the way I love you . You 're a strong , good woman . " She looked up at him speechlessly . Her eyes were full of tears . They would sit all night in Hector 's room with the whisky and the cigarettes , doing what they called " working . " That strange October went slowly by , and near the end a night came when Hector said , in the early hours , " I think you 've got it all . " " How can I know ... " " I guess you could n't know . You ca n't trust yourself any more . I 'll do itP377for you . I believe you 've got it all out . And if you have n't , you can tell me . I do n't think there 's any use going on like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get done . " " What ? " " You 've got to go out to Reno and divorce Jayne . That 's got to be . done so you can start clean . There must n't be any leftovers . There 's something else too . You 've got to send Bright back his money . " " He 'll think I 'm crazy . I have n't seen him for two or three years . " " You 've got to do it . " " I will . I 'll do it tomorrow . I 'll get a ticket and leave right away . Oh , I want to start fresh ! " He set down the drink he held and leaned forward on his elbows . " Or do you ? " he said . " Maybe you 'd rather hang on to that dough . Maybe you do n't like to disturb Bright 's fond memories of you . " " Hector . . . that 's not true ! " " Maybe you hate to destroy that nice , sordid , slimy little episode . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't understand . It was perfectly clean and friendly and decent . " " Oh , it was , was it ? " " You make everything filthy ! " she cried . " When lots of the times were perfectly self-respecting and . . . fun  --  I mean they seemed so then . " His face was heavy and contemptuous . " Do n't you criticize me . Do n't you dare . Who are you to judge anyone ? You bitch . " He got up and came to her in one step . He struck her across the face as she sat there , and struck her again , knocking the chair over ; she fell inside its arms . He walked away to the window and ran up the shade on the night . She got up and righted the chair and sat down in it . Her face was turned towards his back framed in the window . She waited . " You ca n't take it , can you ? " he said without turning around . " I can take anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice . He whirled around on his heel and looked at her . " That 's just a taste , " he said . " Of what you 've got coming to you . Mywife had to take a hell of a lot worse than that . And she did n't deserve anyof it . I 'd have to break your head to show you what I think of you . " She waited . " Stop looking saintly , " he said . " You bitch . You ought to be down on your knees . " She slipped out of the chair and knelt by it without taking her eyes from his face . " Please forgive me . . . . " " Oh for Christ 's sake get up . " She got back into the chair . " If you knew what it 's like to look at that lying , half-witted face . " He walked with hard , quick steps to the place on the floor where he had left his full drink , picked it up , and threw the contents in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her suit and wiped the water and the whisky away . He came to her and struck her . All at once he turned away and went and lay down on the bed , face down , silent . " Darling . . . poor darling . . . . Forgive me . . . " she murmured . She sat on the edge of the bed and laid her hand on his shoulder . He reached out and pulled her down beside him . " Christ . . . I ca n't bear to hurt you . . . . And I hurt her again and again and it was n't like this . Why ca n't I hurt you without hurting myself ? " " I swear to you I can take it . " " I know you can . Oh , Betsy . . . . " He groaned . " I love you so much . " He held her to him and kissed her eyes and her mouth . " We must n't do this . . . . You said we must n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge , " he murmured . " You let me say what we can do . " " Yes . " The day she left they had breakfast together in a small , dark , oakpanelledtearoom near the hotel , full of middle-aged women having lunch . They ate their eggs and drank their coffee , and reached for each other 's hands . They would look up from the food and smile encouragingly at each other . " How are you going to spend the time ? " he asked . " Writing to you , and  --  working , and trying to be what you want . " " You 're such a good woman . " " Do n't say that yet . How are you going to spend the time ? " " I 've got to work on that book . Our summer put the quietus on that . " " I 'm sorry , darling . " " Do n't be . I would n't swap our summer for anything in the world .  --  I 'm going to miss you so . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too ? " " I 'm not going to be able to help it . " They went out into the clear sunshine of late October , and arm in arm they walked back to the hotel . Children were zig-zagging and whizzing down the sidewalk on roller-skates . Women pushed baby-carriages peacefullyin the sunshine . They stopped , in front of the hotel , and he took his hat off . " Goodbye . " " Goodbye . " " Come back to me , darling . " " I 'll come back to you soon . " He kissed her with his hat in his hand , and then they turned the fine sightlessexaltation of their faces in opposite directions . At her back she could hear the sound of his heels striking the pavement as he walked away from her towards his work . P379TOWARDS NIGHT , in upper New York State , it came onto snow . The train rushed pell-mell , streaming through the strange , darkening country , and from time to time a dash of its smoke would whirl past . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ train went by . The land was black , bleak ; against this background the sparse snow tumbled down softly . It was only the first of November ; to have snow fall now was a kind of miracle , an act of blessing the world . Close to the train the snow whirled in eddies and clung for a moment in soft clods to the windowpanes . It was almost like Christmas . Leda sat curled up on the seat in the compartment , pressing her face to the unclouded double window . She had turned out the light . She was clothed in invisibility , a being enclosed in a small , warm place , a disembodiedheart , a mind , a pair of eyes . Above the deep and steady roar of the train she seemed to hear music : over the simple bare country , falling with the snow from the dark sky , like the sound of pealing bells . The lights in the little houses seemed to go on in a great silence , as though of themselves ; the snow fell silently from heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child 's surprise and delight . She stretched out her hand to feel for the light switch , withdrew it and looked again at the scene beyond the window . Then she reached again and turned on the light . She rummaged in her leather purse for a silver pencil and a shagreen notebook . She looked all around the little room . Why did it give her such joy and such release to be here in this box that moved ? The fixtures of the room  --  the mirror , the cloth of the chairs , the shining artificial woodwork that reflected light  --  seemed so comfortable , so secret and snug . She kept her legs tucked under her . From the notebook she tore a page that listed New York engagements , and tossed the crumpled ball into the metal spittoon . Then she began to write . The wind sweeps slowly , like a long curved knife , Along the darkened edges of the hills . She drew a line through the words . It was beginning again , the secret , unique pleasure that came with being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . Le ciel est noir , la terre est blanche . Cloches , carrillonez gaiement ! If she could only write something that held the peace , the lovely hush of that . . . She had not felt like poetry for a long , long time ; almost never in all the years since she had been married . Too many people , too much to learn , to possess , to win ; and underneath , the fundamental premise of her position all wrong . Now the lessons , she thought , were long ago learned , the battles won , and with mastery came the shrinking to absolute unimportanceof what had been mastered . Now she was free . She was moving fast through space to the freedom that was what she wanted . Marriage to James March had been worse than stupid , worse than empty . It had been not merely his stolidity , his monotony , his unassailable basic conventionality , the other unbearable characteristics that were his , that had made marriage to him seem impossible to Leda . What alarmed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to herself placed in relation to him ; his character was altering hers , her own special private nature . With horror she observed herself as she screamed at him sometimes when his heavy good nature was unbearable . He made her irritable , angry , bitter , caustic ; she would not let herself become those things . She would not let him change Leda March . It was all very well to know that she was stronger than he . Living with him subtly altered her ; she would not be altered . She seemed to feel herselfbecoming , not only the things in reaction to him , but like him ; stolid , monotonous , conventional . The life they lived , so correct , so the model of well-to-do young married people of position in New York , was not good enough . There was no time to waste on such a life . Where had her special nature gone ? Where was the sensitivity , the awareness , the strange delicate life lived alone that once she had had ? Those were the real Leda March @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had felt panic for fear that she had lost them and had become entirely Mrs. James March and all that Mrs. James March meant . It was so thankful , it was like a vindication , to find that the secret waters still ran underneath . This was her true self , and it had not been dried up . With the beginning of freedom , already , now , there had come the old and precious tremor ; the chiming of words in her head like little bells ; the appearance of things laid bare from their material aspect to a kind of purity , clear and breath-taking . Words meant more than their meaning , they could be tasted and smelt , a snowflake melting on the tongue , the smell of snow in the night. 11 tremble dans la paille. fraiche Cc pauvre petit enfant Jesus ; Et , pour l'echauffer clans sa creche , L'Cne et le boeuf soufflent dessus . Christmas was more than six weeks away , but Christmas was in the air she breathed . The peace , the joyfulness , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pealing of bells : they were Christmas and they were in this moment . The door that connected the two compartments opened and Miss Lovejoylooked in . " Am I disturbing you , Mrs. March ? " " No ... " " Treat is all tucked in his bed . "  |p381It  was an actual shock to realize that she had a child . For a little while she had been disembodied ; no tie had held " her to a living human . She got up and went into the other compartment ; Miss Lovejoy held the door open for her and then passed into Leda 's compartment and closed the door . The little boy lay in the lower of the two made-up berths . His cheeks were red and his dark hair lay flat on his forehead in a bang . Along the two window-sills ran a line of small automobiles . " Mummy , read me the farm book . " Leda sat down on the plush chair pulled up beside the bed . " You must be sick of the farm book . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the farm book . " " No . I 'll tell you about when I was a little girl in Hampton and it would snow . Did you sec the snow falling outside ? It 's coming down very slowly . Big fat flakes . Do you know what they are ? Mother Goose is shaking out her feather comfortable for the winter . " " I saw it . " " When I was a little girl , there would be lots and lots of snow , and I would go out in the morning and the snow would be drifted all over the tops of the fences so that I could walk right over them on snowshoes . They were snowshoes like what the Indians used to wear . I would walk on them back into the woods and it was all quiet and you could see the tiny tracks that animals had made over the top of the snow . " " What kind of animals ? " " Rabbits . And mice . And birds like quail and grouse . And all the big spruce trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green branches bent way down , and suddenly , with everything all quiet , the snow would drop off one of the trees into the snow underneath . It made a thud . And then it would all be quiet again . And I would walk in the woods in my snowshoes and it made a track behind me zig-zagging like this . " Leda spread her hands and moved them one before the other . " Mummy . " " What , darling ? " " Mummy , I do n't want to hear about the snow . " " Darling , you must think about it and try to hear how the snow sounded falling off the trees . Do n't you remember the snow last winter  --  how beautifulit was at Grandma March 's ? How you and I went out in the morning and made a picture on the front lawn where it was all untouched , by walking on it with our feet ? " " I went coasting on a sled . Can I go coasting on a sled out West , Mummy ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West , darling . But you can ride a pony . " " Can I have a cowboy suit ? " " Yes , darling . " " Yip-peeeec ! Mummy , " he said in a small , pleading voice . " Mummy , read me the farm book . " She looked at his eyes , that were shaped so much like hers ; he blinked and wriggled under the covers . She picked up the large , flat book that lay , waiting , on the foot of the bed . She began to read . " We put our seven puppies in a big basket . They wanted to get out . They were too small to climb over the top of the basket . They wanted to run and play . Would you like to play with them ? They  --  ' " " Yes , " whispered the little boy. "  --  They would climb all over you if you would lie on the grass . They would lick your face and hands . The picture shows one of the puppies when he got older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy is . See how happy the puppy is . They like to play together . The boy runs . The puppy runs after him . Then the puppy runs and the boy tries to catch him . ' " Treat lay quite still with his face turned to her and his eyes shining . When Miss Lovejoy came back into the compartment , Leda put down the book and kissed Treat 's cheek and stood up . " Come along , Treat , " the governess said . " Bedlington . " " I 'm going into the lounge car , " Leda said . " You may sit in my room in just a minute . " " Thank you very much . " " Good night , darling . " " Good night , Mummy . " Leda closed the door between the rooms and stood still in hers , her head thrown back , trying to recapture the thing she had felt before . But people had gotten between her and the feeling . Miss Lovejoy had to sit somewhere while Treat went to sleep . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air . She picked up her mink coat and flung it over her shoulders and went out . She walked , balancing against the rocking of the train , down several cars to the lounge . Between the cars the air was very cold . She glanced at the men and the one or two women in the lounge car and went and sat in an empty booth near the far end . A steward came and she ordered a glass of 3.2 beer and lit a cigarette . Treat was a disappointment to her . When he was a little baby she had envisioned a secret , delicate understanding that would be between them . The perceptions of her own childhood were still clear and separate to her . She would never be practical and grown-up with him . She would be able to feel the things that he was feeling and they would communicate instinctively . The things in his world that nobody else would understand she would understand . He would gain by it and she would gain  --  regain the thinking of a child . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the practical one . He liked animals , and running and shouting , and his supper . He did n't like fairy stories and he did n't like to play alone and when she spoke about the feelings about nature that had been so acute to her and still were , he stared at her uncomfortably and was bored . He did not seem to her to be her own child . He was James 's child . She had not given up . Treat might change . What she wanted was a sympathybetween them that was neither mother-love on her part nor depend/ence on his , but a kind of sharing of experience . . . and that might still cone . He was James 's child and he seemed to respond naturally to James , but now James would not come often into his life . In the separation agreementarranging the disposal of property , she had kept the custody of Treat .  --  the said party of the second part shall have the right to visit the said child at the home or other place of abode of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . . . she wanted a sensitive , thoughtful boy , who read , and saw , and listened . She sighed and looked around the car . At the writing-desk at the end sat a young woman , writing . Leda 's eyes came back to her again . Her brown hair was parted in the middle and made into a small knot behind . She wore a dark suit and her face was tired and composed . The desk in front of her was strewn with sheets of writtenoverpaper . At that instant she looked up from her letter and their eyes met . They looked steadily at each other . " Hello . " " Is n't it Betsy Jekyll ? Yes , " Leda said , leaning forward across the table and smiling . Betsy gathered up her papers , took an envelope , and came over to the booth . They shook hands and Betsy slipped into the seat facing Leda . Leda was struck by the smile that came over Betsy 's face ; it was calm and radiant , and seemed sent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again ! Have a beer . " They continued to smile , looking curiously into each other 's faces . " You 've changed . " " So have you . " " Where are you going ? " " To Reno ... " " So am I ... " Betsy folded the sheets of paper and stuck them into the envelope , licked the flap and sealed it . She put the envelope into her handbag . It was a queer experience , thus to be confronted in limbo with a face from long ago , Leda thought . It had a quality of significance and unreality , here , rushing through strange country in the night ; from different worlds they had come to the same microcosmic rocket-world and met . Ordinary circumstances were not present . Anything could be said . There need be no adjustment for either of them to the other 's surroundings . In more ways than one they had sloughed off their lives , being here . They were back , face to face , as they had been so long ago ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , and it would be interesting to know what that was . As the steward brought the second beer , Leda wondered if Betsy 's altered face meant that she had had , in her way , triumphs over life comparable to Leda 's triumphs . They were no longer the raw girls they had been . When she thought of her own past shyness , her old frustrations , what she had had to go through to conquer them and come to what she was now . . . ! She remembered the way Betsy had looked , eager , puppyish , undiscriminating . Now she looked as if she knew a secret , an answer.  | " Tell me , where have you been living ? " " In New York . " " So have I , is n't it strange ? You must tell me all about your family , and what you 've been doing , and your marriage . Do n't think I 'm inquisitive . After all , this is a sort of vacuum , is n't it ? Between two lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not attending so much to what was said as to each other 's new voice , new face ; clothes and gestures and little things that showed the women they had become . They kept smiling . Leda leaned forward on her elbows . " You must n't think me rude . But it 's all so interesting . Do n't answer if you 'd rather . . . . What are you going back to ? " " It 's all right . I 'd love to talk about it . I 'm going back to being in love . " " In love ! " Betsy smiled that strange , radiant smile . " It 's the only thing that matters in the world , " she said . " It 's like seeing a light . I guess religion is a substitute for it . " How strange that she should be saying this to me , Leda thought . Betsy was always one for spilling out her heart . She gives away all she knows . She 's really just the same . " For years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " I never knew anything . Now it 's all changed . I feel as if I 'd been saved . I can sort of see things and what they mean . " It was the way people must talk in experience meetings . ' Impossible to imagine making a confession like that . Humbling oneself . . . . Although Betsy did not look humble . She looked almost transfigured . This was a most extraordinary meeting . A conversation in a comet . " It must be wonderful to find something like that . " " Yes . It 's funny , I feel as if I must talk about it . I feel like telling people . I feel like telling them to keep the door open for it , no matter if they 've hewer believed they 'd be really in love . Because you never know when it may come . I did n't . I thought I 'd never be really in love . I did n't understand anything . " Is she saying this to me , Leda thought . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She does look as if she had a light burning in her . Have I a light burning in me ? When I was alone in the compartment looking out of the window  --  I had a light then . I wonder if I could ever really be in love . They stared at each other , faintly smiling . " How is Maizie ? " " I think she 's a little better . " " I did n't know she 'd been ill . " " She had a nervous breakdown . " " I 'm so sorry . " " Lambert 's been living abroad . " Why does she say that , Leda thought.  | " Do you remember what fun we used to have watching Maizie dress to go out with one of her beaux ? " Or does that sound condescending ? " Oh , yes . " " You know , " Leda said , putting a cigarette into her holder and lighting it , " I was an awfully shy child , and your family was the first thing that ever took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she wondered suddenly . ' Was it a kindness , after all ? I wonder what I should have been if I had stayed the way I was . I should have been a poet . " I was a horrid child , " she said . " I hated everyone because I thought everyone hated me . It takes a long time to prove to yourself that the bear behind the cellar door really is n't there . Once you 've learned it is n't , it 's easy enough to be quite a decent person . " Now I 'm talking extraordinarily , she thought . I wonder if she has the faintest idea what I mean . She 's so wrapped up in herself . " What are you going back to ? " Betsy said . Leda was surprised . She laughed . " Oh , nothing so dramatic , " she said . " I 'm not going to marry anybody . But I 've been wanting to do some writing .... " She has n't really changed much , Betsy thought . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she 's beautiful , but she wishes she had what I 've got . Everybody wants that really . She used to look like that when she stood in the doorway at home and Ma'am was playing the piano . How strange that I should turn out to be somebody that women like this envy . . . because of the thing I have . Blessed art thou among women . They came to Reno in the middle of a morning . The city was very low and all around the desert lay broad and fiat in the strong Western sunshine . The March luggage was stowed in a taxi and the governess got in . Leda stood smiling on the platform . Treat , in a blue coat and a little round blue cap with a visor , was hugging Betsy round the knees . " You come with us ! " " I ca n't , now , Treat . " " Will you come this afternoon ? " " You will come and see me often , . wo n't you ? " Leda said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we must have Thanksgiving dinner together . " " I 'll come and play with you soon , " Betsy said . Leda took the child 's hand and let him jump , before her , into the taxi . He sat very small between the two women , leaning forward and peering anxiously through the window . " Goodbye Betsy , goodbye Betsy , goodbye Betsy , " he called . " Goodbye Treat , goodbye Treat , goodbye Treat ! "
