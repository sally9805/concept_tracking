txt New signs of Congressional revolt against war programs suspected of taking emergency roads to " sociological " objectives appeared today . The Administration 's plan for using $300,000,000 of Federal funds to increase unemployment compensation to workers displaced by industry conversions to defense pro , duction was found to be definitely in trouble . As of today , checks within the House Ways and Means Committee disclosed , seventeen of its twenty-five members , despite mass pressure from labor groups for favorable votes , were ready  --  and so informed colleagues  --  to refuse even to report the program to the House for its consideration . This situation , it was asserted by members in position to know , developed not only from four days of public hearings before the committee , but from reactions to the program within the House itself . If any plan at all is reported out , it was predicted with apparent authority by key members of the Ways and Means body , it will be far different from the program submitted to Congress ? by President Roosevelt on the recommendation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Production Board . As in the case of the national civilian defense program , which ran into open House revolt last week because of artistic and physical fitness innovations , it is emphasized at the Capitol that no fault is being found with the general objective of 7noviding additional assistance for workers displaced in converting industries . But , it is argued , the method presented , with its proposed con- trol by the Social Security Board , would lead to a " federalization " of the State unemployment insurance systems and their $3,500,000,000 of reserves . The fact that there has been written into the pending legislation a clause which insists that the program is not a movement toward a uniform national system of unemployment insurance , and should not be so construed , has not altered the situation materially . Widespread belief persists and extends into the House itself , that this is " another sociological move . " Even though this may not be the avowed intent , it is argued in some quarters , it would be the effect , and that federalization of the State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once , to save what is left of them . This was the situation that House leaders found today , in the face of repeated and insistent denials by high Administration officials that federalization was the goal . Repeatedly , from within various segments of the House , there came proposals for converting the program into one of outright relief , for turning the $300,000,000 over to the WPA , and placing jurisdiction there . The principal admonition heard today was that the Social Security Board leave the direct unemployment insurance to the State agencies . One witness after another , from various States , have told the Ways and Means Committee that the State agencies.could handle the insurance job themselves . Although Paul V. , Administrator of the Federal Security Agency , said early in the hearings that it was a source of " deep concern " to him that , notwithstanding the $2,500,000,000 in their reserve funds , the present unemployment insurance systems had proved to be " inadequate , " the Ways and Means Committee has heard much testimony to the contrary since . , Today , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ briefs , the story of opposition was much the same . Thomas M. Quinn , representing the Indiana Chamber of Commerce , of Mr. 's own State , pronounced the compensation program " an old idea dressed up in new clothes , " and declared that " Indiana had to come to Washington to discover that the situation was bad back home . " Insisting that the Indiana unemployment compensation system could take care of its own displacement problems , Mr. Quinn concluded his testimony by pleading to the committee : " We wish to retain our State houses , our court houses and our city halls . " " Why struggle to find ways and means of giving the States $300 , - 000,000 which they do n't need and do n't want ? " asked Representative Sauthoff of Wisconsin , as he appeared as a witness on behalf of his State . Word came from Michigan that the Legislature was preparing to act next week on a measure which would increase the present compensation , $16 for eighteen weeks , to $20 for twenty weeks , to handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converison of the automobile industry . Walter J. Mackey , counsel for the Ohio Manufacturers Association , denounced the pending program as " camouflage for the real intention of its sponsors " and told the committee the responsibility for determining the adequacy of unemployment benefits " should rest with the State Legislatures , whose members are elected by the people of the several States and who are responsible to them . " " Under this bill , " Mr. Mackey said , " this right would be granted to one man or a group of men here in Washington . " Henry S. Beers , chairman of the Connecticut Unemployment Compensation Commission Advisory Council , asserted that the Administration 's plan " might be a Social Security Board attempt " to raise unemployment compensation standards generally . The real need , said Herschel G. Atkins of the Ohio Unemployment Compensation Commission , was for " more workers and not for unemployment relief measures . " Estimates by Ohio manufacturers in selected war industries , he told the committee , indicated that an additional 64,000 persons would be employed in that State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay-off of 9,000 . Charles L. Hoffman , representing the Minnesota Employers ' Association , said the objective of the bill appeared to him to be to " reward idleness , rather than encourage production . " As proposed by President Roosevelt , the program would provide benefits up to 60 per cent of average wages , with a maximum of $24 for twenty-six weeks . The committee , however , is considering a bill introduced by Representative Doughton of North Carolina , its chairman , proposing increases of 20 per cent above State unemployment compensation rates , which vary from $7 to $20 a week . Whether the situation of today is reversed before committee votes are taken ' on the program remained to be seen . Tonight , however , the committee plan was to bring the hearings to an early conclusion  --  next Tuesday , if possible ? to make its decision , and get to work on the new tax program . Monday will be Governors ' Day , when the Chief Executives of a number of States  --  Massachusetts , North Carolina , Minnesota and probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most of them , if not all , were expected to testify in opposition .
