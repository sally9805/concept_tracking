By a trenchant order Franklin Roosevelt averted a revolt in his own War Labor Board . <P> What had angered WLB members was : 1 ) they had no authority to make their decisions stick ; 2 ) they could not deal decisively with labor although they had powerful weapons to use against management . One member , insiders said , had his resignation written and ready to make public . Other members , public , labor and industry , were ready to follow suit . <P> The President , prodded by OWM Czar Jimmy Byrnes , last week acted swiftly to quell the uprising . To WLB , virtually toothless for 21 months , he handed a shiny , brand-new set of store teeth . Gazing at their new dentures in the mirror , WLB members clicked them contentedly , seemed to think them a perfect fit . <P> Uppers &; Lowers . WLB 's added powers were something new in the history of New Deal labor relations . Under Presidential decree , WLB now has the authority to withhold the dues of a recalcitrant union , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union benefits . The board can also recommend to the War Manpower Commission a change in the draft status of noncomplying union members . <P> At the same time , WLB got additional authority to deal with recalcitrant management . In addition to the power to recommend plant seizure , it can now virtually put a noncomplying employer out of business . Those who balk at WLB 's decisions may have their Government contracts torn up , their priorities canceled , their materials sent to other plants . <P> For such a sweeping grant of authority , WLB could mostly thank its four public members , Chairman William H. Davis , Wayne L. Morse , Frank P. Graham and George W. Taylor . Balance wheel between industry and labor members , they had fought consistently for added power . <P> Their argument : unless all unions and all employers were treated in like manner , wage stabilization was impossible . Out of more than 1,000 decisions , WLB has had to refer only seven to Franklin Roosevelt for executive action . But among these seven were its key decisions . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lewis , or management , notably Montgomery Ward and U.S. Gypsum , was able to defy it , the board could command no respect , achieve no final success in holding down wages . <P> Click , Click , Click . . . . Pleased with its new teeth , WLB clicked them menacingly in several directions . It reopened the old Montgomery Ward case by summarily ordering the company to grant maintenance of union membership ; it denied maintenance of membership to the United Automobile Workers at Chrysler because of continued wildcat strikes . <P> This was only baring the incisors . WLB 's molars , as everybody knew , would get their big test on John L. Lewis . This week old John L. , his outsize hat in hand , appeared before WLB for the second time within a month . Reason : Pennsylvania anthracite operators had asked for a reopening of contract negotiations . Said the union , in a circular to its members : " The best way to cooperate ... is to continue to maintain maximum production of anthracite coal to meet the war and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
