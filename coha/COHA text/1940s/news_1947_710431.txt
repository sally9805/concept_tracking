txt Clark 's ' Submarine Safari ' : General Tells of ' 42 Exploit First Chapter of Series Recalls Dramatic Message Setting Off African Invasion ? Churchill Excited by Venture This is the first of six articles by Gen. Mark W. Clark telling of his secret submarine mission to North Africa in 1942 preparatory to the Allied invasion and of his dealings with Admiral Jean-Francois Darlan of France . By GEN . MARK WAYNE CLARK Copyright . 1947 , by Mark Wayne Clark . Distributed by North American Newspaper Alliance . By October of 1942 , the pressure of planning Torch Operation had become so great that all of us at Norfolk House in London were literally working day and night . We quit for sleep only when fatigue made further accurate work impossible . I finally told the staff that on Sundays , at least , everyone should stay away from the office until 10 A. M. Thus , the morning of Sunday the 17th , when I sauntered in , Brig . Gen. Alfred M. Gruenther was the only other officer visible . " There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ message was from Washington . It was addressed to Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower , but it was routine for communications of the highest priority to come to me as well at Norfolk House . This was our secret planning headquarters ? about two miles from Ike 's own office at 20 Grosvenor Square . Ike rarely came to Norfolk House , because his appearance  --  even incognito  --  might attract the attention of enemy agents , many of whom were then active in London . Ordinarily I went to see him at least three times a day , but there was a direct telephone line between his desk and mine , as well . Just as I was gulping through my copy of the , message , the phone rang . General Eisenhower was very brief . " Come up , " he said , " come right away , " and he hung up . I made quick time to Grosvenor Square and walked into Ike 's of // fice saying , " Well , when do I go ? " Ike said , " Probably pretty quick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cable from Gen. George C. Marshall had originated with Robert . D Murphy , then in Algiers as Counselor of Embassy on Special Missions to French Africa and principal figure in the on-the-spot political maneuvers of Torch  --  the code name for the North African operation . The cable said Gen. Charles Mast , then French commander in Algeria , and our highest and best French contact in North Africa , wanted an American delegation to come immediately to a highly secret rendezvous for conferences which would include an exchange of information . The cable stipulated a " senior general officer " as chief of the mission . There was an implication that Gen. Henri-Honor6 Giraud might attend the conference , although we knew that he was still in France . General Eisenhower handed me the whole job . The organization of the trip itself , selection of my supporting staff , and the widest sort of latitude on what I could say to the French , was my responsibility . But I was not to reveal to the French that Torch was an actuality ; only that North @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Situation To say too much could cost us lives . Saying too little would hurt our chances of French collaboration . Enemy discovery or capture of our group could mean irreparable damage to Torch as well as to ourselves . It seemed pretty important that Prime Minister Churchill should know what was going on and advise on the important steps about to be taken . Most week-ends leading up to the one of Oct. 17 , Ike and I had spent at Chequers , the country place England provides for her Prime Minister . We had , with difficulty , begged off this week-end for the simple reason that we had really come to dread the cost in lost sleep of the all-night inquisitions to which the tireless and keen mind of Mr. Churchill invariably subjected us . But fortunately , we knew he would be at Chequers now that we needed him in a hurry . I got on the secret phone to Chequers and was answered by Maj. Gen. Sir Hastings Ismay , the Prime Minister 's military aide . " Pug . I 've got something hot here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Ismay questioned . " Too hot to talk about on the phone . " " Wait a minute while I tell the Prime Minister , " he said . Then Mr. Churchill came on . " Pug tells me you have something hot . What is it ? " he asked . " This is a secret phone . " Too Big for Telephone I handed my instrument to Ike . " We ca n't talk about it here , " Ike replied . " It 's much too important for that . " " Very well , " said Mr. Churchill . " Come on down here . " " We have n't got time . " said Ike . " All right , " said the Prime Minlater a little formally , " is it sufficiently important for me to come back ? " Ike said " Yes , " and made date to meet him at 10 Downing Street late that afternoon . Almost immediately we went Into planning session . On a French chart of the North African coast We were pleased to spot a mark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longitude called for in the cable . I called together the group , fighters could be supplied . This chosen to accompany me , and for more than three hours talked out the details . as well as the imponderables , of our trip . We gave little thought to Admiral Jean-Francois Darien . Giraud was our choice for French leadership and that was that . If Darien had to be dealt with later for the sake of immobilizing the French Navy , we could handle him . We knew that a similar conference was being held in Washington , with President Roosevelt , Admiral William D. Leahy and General Marshall discussing the same questions . We also knew that , by this time , the Prime Minister and his political and military advisers were doing plenty of talking and thinking about what might be on our minds . Murphy 's cable stipulated that the general officer in charge of the mission should be accompanied by one man thoroughly familiar with the details of Torch Operation , one supply man , one Navy man and one political expert  --  the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gen. Lyman L. Lemnitzer , head of the Allied Force Plans Section ; Col. A. L. Hamblen , our shipping and supply expert ; Capt . Gerald Wright of the United States Navy , who had been our Navy liaison man since Torch was started , and Col. Julius C. Holmes , a former State Department officer who headed up our Civil Affairs Branch of the Torch plan . seemed to fill these specifications . Until late afternoon we were hashing over the details of our trip : We would fly to Gibraltar in two Flying Fortresses . The air people pointed out that there was danger in this . No B-17 had ever landed at the Gibraltar field , and we did not know if it could be done . The party would split into two planes , so that in the event mine was lost , General Lemnitzer could carry on for me . From Gibraltar we would be taken to the Algerian coast in a British submarine . The Cable was very specific as to how the final rendezvous would be made ; a latitude and longitude some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given . On the night of Oct. 21 our submarine was to surface off the position given ; a single , steady , white light would be exhibited from a seaward dormer window of the house if the coast were clear and , the landing should proceed . This ; light would not be visible from the land side . Unfortunately , nothing was said about what was to be done if we could riot make it by airplane and submarine in the short time granted  --  four days , and we immediately asked Washington to send a secret message to Murphy and his associates , urging them to set up an alternate time of rendezvous if we could not make the Oct. 21 date as specified . By the time General Eisenhower and I were ready to take off for No. 10 we were well briefed on the complex contents of the Murphy cable . It covered a lot more than just the details of the rendezvous . Murphy reported that when he had returned to Algiers from his visit to Washington he had been asked for a secret interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took place at an isolated spot outside of town to avoid German notice . Germans Goaded French The French said that both German and Japanese sources had reported the Allies were planning early military operations against Dakar , Casablanca , or both . The Germans were urging the French to take every precaution against this ; likewise giving indications that this could constitute a pretext for Axis occupation of French North Africa . " The Germans . " Murphy cabled , " appear determined to settle the Western Mediterranean issue during the coming weeks and will have the use of the Spanish mainland and of Spanish Morocco for this purpose . Gibraltar is under constant surveillance . In French opinion , definite action is not a question of weeks , but of days . " The French political situation s extremely delicate and collapse may be expected in as little as ten days . There is no question that the situation in French North Africa is moving fast . Information indicates the Axis has raised about 100,000 troops along the Tunisian frontier . " General Mast , by way of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the possibility that the French would be better satisfied with Torch if the operation would include the occupation of some part of Occupied France by the French Army so that French Resistance fighters could be supplied . This seemed to us impossible from the beginning and we eventually had to talk the French out of it as we talked them out of the supreme command in French North Africa . Murphy concluded : " Mast asserts we can gain entry practically without firing a shot through Giraud 's command . It is suggested that the United States supply an American submarine to pick up Giraud and his party at night on the French Mediterranean coast . " Brains Galore at No. 10 When General Eisenhower and I arrived at No. 10 , there was about as dazzling an array of Britain 's diplomatic , military and naval brains as I had yet seen . The Prime Minister , without knowing exactly what was on our minds , was as enthusiastic as a boy with a new electric train . When we read the cable , he broke into a big grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he kept saying . We discussed the implications of the trip at some length with Clement Attlee , Lord Louis Mountbatten , Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound and Sir Alan Brooke . Foreign Secretary Anthony Eden chimed in on the political phase . What Ike wanted was a specific British viewpoint on how much I could tell the French about Torch . We knew Giraud would want an important spot in the command set-up , and I offered , if it would help matters , to step down as deputy commander to Ike in favor of Giraud . That was rejected . At the end , we told Churchill , happy as a detective story fan , the more fantastic details of our plans for this secret rendezvous on which the fate of thousands of British , American and French soldiers and sailors might hang . Almost as an afterthought I asked the Prime Minister if we should wear civilian clothes or uniforms . " Do you have civvies ? " asked Mr. Churchill . " If you have , take them along . " I eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have made things just that much harder had we been picked up without uniforms on shore . Escorting me to the door , Mr. Churchill emphasized Britain 's entirely cooperative spirit . We ' would have the submarine , destroyer , amphibious airplanes and facilities at Gibraltar . He has an unaffected way of speaking in ringing phrases at important moments . " The entire resources of the British Commonwealth are at your disposal , " he said in parting . ' ' I want to assure you , once more , how important it will be to get this information and to cut down French resistance . You have my genuine support . " By this time Gen. Carl Spaatz had the two ** with especially selected pilots ready . The weather people said we had better not try a take-off until morning . We spent the night sleeping very little , but getting a lot of details and equipment together in a minimum of space and weight . Money in Canadian Gold Army Finance had scurried. around to get money  --  a thousand dollars in Canadian $5 and $10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a jam . This is the money of which a considerable part was lost when our small boats overturned in the surf later . We had no bribing to do , but at the end of the trip I had only four of the gold pieces I had carried , and purchased-them for souvenirs for General Eisenhower , Admiral of the Fleet Sir Andrew Browne Cunningham and Maj. Gen. Walter Bedell Smith ; the fourth I still carry for a luck piece . We got money belts for the whole party and divided up the gold pieces . I had some United States dollars along , too , but the whole amount was about $2,000 ? not the much larger sum mentioned in news dispatches . I had been scheduled to leave with General Eisenhower on the morning of the 18th for an inspection trip of United States forces training in Scotland . In order to attract no undue attention to my mission , General Eisenhower left on his journey as planned . It was not until dusk of the 18th that my four colleagues and I arrived at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northwest of London . I wore a lieutenant colonel 's insignia on my shoulders when I left London . Even most . of the people at headquarters thought I was on my way to join General Eisenhower in Scotland . The weather was bad on the evening of the 18th and precious hours slipped away while we all waited in tiny barracks , keeping out of sight of personnel so as to attract a minimum of attention . A Note for His Wife I was plenty keyed up and although I went to bed , I did n't sleep much . The most disturbing things were time elements and the - difficulty of communications ; not only with Murphy but through him to the French , who might already be on their way to the rendezvous . I was afraid that if we did not arrive on time , the French would feel badly let down and might question our good faith . I must admit I was also pretty worried about the personal safety of all of us . The whole deal could be a trick ; if we fell into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of more importance , would jeopardize the whole operation . I had left a Short note behind ' to be delivered to Mrs. Clark in the event I did not return . I had carefully gone over procedures With General Lemnitzer and Colonel Holmes for them to carry on and to do the job if one or more of us dropped out for any reason . A final cable had been received from Washington saying that " ' Agree ' ( a code name for myself ) , is to proceed at once with the mission . " But nothing was said to allay my gnawing fear that we could not make it in time . They called me about 6:30 A. M. We had some breakfast , climbed into the planes for a quick take-off . General Lemnitzer was carrying all the secretidocuments in a heavily weighted tube . I instructed the pilots that under no circumstances was either plane to land in Spain or Portugal . The base commander had had word of some German fighters along the coast . We did n't have an escort , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , the Red Gremlin , broke above the clouds and flew out of sight . of earth for three hours . By the time the overcast broke , there was nothing below but open sea . We sighted only one ship  --  a small sailing vessel somewhere off Portugal . Even before we had identified Gibraltar , Spitfires were shooting up to look us over . General Lemnitzer 's plane , the Boomerang , went in first and we were all relieved to see the big bomber make it safely on Gibraltar 's limited strip . One of the pilots had already climbed out of my plane when the British rushed up and motioned to everybody to stay inside . They explained the Gibraltar field was always under full observation by German agents in Spain . The runway is only about 300 yards from Spanish territory . Hush-Hush But for fl-29 's The arrival of two **  --  the first sent there  --  would give the Nazis enough to think about without their spotting high officers aboard . The British suggested we leave off our coats and hats ; a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to the plane ; we jumped swiftly into it and were whisked off to the Governor 's house . Here the Governor , Lieut . Gen. Sir Frank N. Mason-qzmacq#Farlane , and some British admirals , including Vice Admiral Collins and the commander of British submarines in the Mediterranean , Capt . Barney Fawkes , welcomed us . I asked my lour colleagues to stay in their rooms . The less seen of any of us on the Rock , the better . I conferred alone with General and his naval associates . I have hardly ever been less certain of the success of an operational mission in my life ; I needed support . but got little encouragement from the British . The Navy people were taking a rather dim view of this whole crazy American adventure . They talked of thick shore patrols , plenty of spotting planes and a French Navy and Air Force bolder than it had been before . What I needed was someone to Say " Okay , we 'll get you in there and get you out too ! " They talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . It has been decided by our two Governments and I do n't intend to call it off . " The most encouraging person I met at Gibraltar was Lieut . Norman Ambury Auchinleck Jewell ( we called him " Bill " later ) , commander of the submarine H. M. S. Seraph  --  one of the smaller and slower British undersea boats . He was described to me as " a fine youngster with plenty of experience in doing soundings along the North African coast . " A Reassuring Note When I asked to see him they brought in a handsome young man With plenty of self-confidence . I asked if he knew what this was all about . " All they told me was that I was to take some Americans some place and land them at night on the African coast , " he said . I explained some of the details . Jewell was pleasantly reassuring ? " I am sure we can get you in there - and get you off again . " He bucked up my confidence considerably . He told me he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-framed canvas canoes  --  on board . If we were to arrive at the rendezvous in daylight , and submerged , we would have to get going immediately . - At that : Lieutenant Jewell warned , considering the number of hours we would have to run submerged , at very slow speed , he was n't going to guarantee arrival on time . I had dispatched another message to Washington , via Lieutenant Colonel Eddy , our military representative in the international zone of Tangier , urgently requestingthat the reception party wait for us from 9 P. M. until dawn on the night of the 21st and that in the event we did not show up that night , we would attempt a landing on the night of the 22d . None of us took very well to the idea of lying close to shore in shallow water where planes could spot even a submerged sub . No Place For A Tall Man There was no time to lose . We wanted to leave Gibraltar in darkness , and did n't want to lose any of the night and its valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the submarine tender Maidstone , where we had a drink and dinner in Captain Fawkes ' cabin . The P-219 was tied up to the Maidstone . They were casting off her lines as we arrived aboard . I had never been aboard a submarine before . I realized very quickly that they were not made for a lanky man 6 feet 2 inches tall . All the while I was in the P-219 I had to bend over and watch my head . The officers ' quarters , which the submarine crew had hospitably given up to their passengers , was just a cubbyhole alongside the middle catwalk . When I went to the " head , " I had to literally crawl on all fours . The submarine crew , almost all youngsters , welcomed us cheerfully aboard . All they knew was that " We 're going on a screwy mission with some Americans . " While we were running on the surface that night , we passengers spent a lot of time on eeck . A British destroyer led us the first fifty miles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the charts , agreed we could n't possibly make the rendezvous if we had to run the entire trio under water . We decided to try , as much as possible , to stay on the surface where we could make ten or twelve knots , compared to only two or three submerged . We would be ready for a crash dive at any time if spotted by an enemy ship or plane . During our first afternoon , slipping smoothly along and sighting nothing , we had a detailed conference with our Commando of/leers on embarkation and landing procedures . General plans concerning signals and possible action ashore were closely gone over . The submarine would go as close to the beach as possible and survey it by periscope in daylight . Our radio was alert for word from Gibraltar , but apparently nothing had been received from Murphy on the matter of a secondary rendezvous . Later in the afternoon we played some bridge and at 9:30 P. M. , when it was fully dark again , Lieutenant Jewell stopped the submarine for a rehearsal of faltboat embarkation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capt . R. P. Livingstone launched their boat first , after practicing stepping into the frail and very tipsy craft on the dry deck . " rhey paddled noiselessly away and from a distance of several hundred yards they tried out the infra-red signal light . This light Can not be seen by the naked eye , but with a proper sort of glass It becomes a usable signal light . The light worked perfectly . Holmes and Livingstone returned to the submarine , with General Lemnitzer and Lieut . J. P. Foote trying the next trip . The general got pretty wet but they made it all right . Colonel Hamblen and Captain Wright made it OK as well . Capt . Godfrey B. ( Jumbo ) Courtney was my small boat pilot , and we tried it last . He was the expert on these boats and was in charge of instructing all of us . With small boat exercises corn- , plete , the submarine was quickly under way again . I managed to get some sleep this night , in spites of the stuffy interior of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were fob close to the North African shore to venture running on the surface again in daylight . There was still no word from Gibraltar . I fell back on another bridge game to pass some pretty worrisome hours , moving along at slow speed under the Mediterranean . Our submarine was a rather old type and by afternoon the air within it was warm and lifeless , leaving us inexperienced landsmen feeling pretty dopey.
