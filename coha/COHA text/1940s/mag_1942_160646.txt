Blimp-built Hermann Gring , who used to boast about how fast his Luftwaffe was going to flatten England , was walking on his heels last week . Increasingly it appeared that the bully boys of his Air Force were in no position to tangle with the R.A.F. on its vast sweeps across the Channel . While the Luftwaffe husbanded its strength , the R.A.F. slugged Nazi bases from Le Havre on up to the Baltic . They also reached 700 miles to Pilsen , Bohemia , where they bombed the huge Skoda works . <P> They slugged with a new pattern . Now , instead of dispersing each night over a vast area , they dropped almost all their eggs into one industrial basket . And now they came in repeated raids on the same target , re-Coventrizing their Coventries . <P> Most pulverizing British air attack since the R.A.F. punished the Baltic port of Lbeck in March occurred at another Baltic port , Rostock , 60 miles away . In one hour one night British airmen dropped the " greatest weight of bombs " ever delivered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were back again . The night after that , and the night after that , they were back yet again &; again . When they left they were certain that it would be a long time before Rostock , staggering under the weight of 800 tons of bombs , would function efficiently as a supply port for the Nazi armies in Norway , Finland and northern Russia . They were certain too that the Heinkel Airplane Works near by , to which they had given special attention , would be out of commission for months . <P> Everywhere-and the R.A.F. was striking out in daylight sweeps as well as in night bombings all over western Europe-there was a singular lack of opposition . A year ago it was heralded as a feat if three R.A.F. flyers scooted over Occupied France , but last week they were over the Continent by the hundreds . <P> Where was the opposition ? Where was the Luftwaffe ? Probably most of it was in Central Europe , ready to be thrown at Russia or the Middle East , or both . And yet the R.A.F. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Western Front . Said a well-informed R.A.F.man last week : " The number of fighters against us on the Western Front today is more than it was two or three months ago . We still retain against ourselves and Malta a greater number of fighters-both single and twin-engined-than are distributed on the whole Russian Front . " <P> Fighter pilots on sweeps noticed that German fighters avoided combat whenever possible , hanging on to flanks , hoping for stragglers with engine trouble . Luftwaffe fighters seemed to be under orders to fight only when necessary . The Nazis were apparently nursing their supplies and their flyers for an all-out assault on the Middle East and Russia . But with the R.A.F. hitting harder &; harder , it looked as if Gring would have to get off his heels and do some fancy toe dancing to prevent the British from wrecking Nazi plans , throwing Hitler 's timetable out of kilter again .
