txt Mayor La Guardia lashed out yesterday at the Citizens Budget Commission in a stinging rebuke for kits recommendation of a 10 per cent budget cut amounting to $76,000 , - 000 , and accused the organization of trying to reduce civil service salaries by 24 per cent so that its members could enjoy reduced real estate taxes . The Mayor , who has been frequently angered by the commission 's statements on the budget , replied to the organization 's letter of Sunday urging the cut . His answer was addressed to " The Citizens Budget Commission , Inc. ( a membership corporation ) , " and he called the organization " ignorant , " " bombastic , " " malicious " and " intellectually dishonest . " The Mayor said it was fantastic to imagine a 24 per cent cut in city services such as garbage collection and water supply . He accused the Citizens Budget Commission of issuing sensational statements regardless of truth , for the purpose of drumming up subscriptions for its work . He also challenged the commission to provide him with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agency would refuse to furnish the list . He criticized the commission 's arithmetic and offered to lend it a clerk from his office as an aide . LETTER TO GENERAL NOLAN The Mayor 's letter to General Nolan follows : General Dennis E. Nolan , Chairman , Citizens Budget Commission , Inc. ( a membership corporation ) , 51 East Forty-second Street , New York City . My Dear General : I have your letter of May 24 , 1941 , transmitting a letter expressing the views of 420 taxpayers in this city . I suppose it was sent at a time when your office believed that I was too busy to give it attention and that you could get away with it . Apparently-you did not hear my statement the other evening that I would give complete attention and action to everything concerning the city . First , I want to absolve the 420 taxpayers from any responsibility for the glaring misrepresentation and malice in the letter . In this instance , as in others , they are simply the innocent victims of the machinations of the hired men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you personally , general , as I know you are only the reputable front for the paid personnel of this corporation . To suggest a 10 per cent reduction in the total amount of the budget transcends ignorance and justifies the charge of malice and intellectual dishonesty . I know , as Mr. Riegelman Harold Riegelman , commission counsel informed me a long time ago , that sensational statements , regardless of truth and misrepresentation , are necessary from time to time , as Riegelman says , to " pep up your customers " and " get the jack . " But since your signers are reputable and splendid citizens and will immediately appreciate the glaring misrepresentations , I will now nail your damnable misrepresentations right on the nose . If you will provide me with the list of your contributors , which I know you will not , I will send a copy of this letter to all of them . Sees Filief Listed in Total The total amount of the expense budget is $667,000,000 . Here , as elsewhere in this letter , I shall use round figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likelihood includes relief . 1 . Now , then , the amount of $667,000,000 includes $136,000,00D for debt service . Debt service provides for the payment of principal , interest and amortization on the bonded indebtedness of the city . I repeat , a suggestion that 10 per cent can be reduced from this amount is not ignorance . Neither the - Legislature nor the Court of Appeals could authorize any reduction in this amount . The provision for interest , redemption and amortization for money borrowed , in addition to the moral obligation of honest men , is protected by the Constitution of the State of-New York and the Constitution of the United States . Therefore , reduce your suggested saving by $13,600,000. 2 . We have in the amount of the budget a total of ** for // MAYOR IS CAUSTIC IN REPLY ON BUDGET // pensions . These pensions are not a mere gratuity fixed by the Legislature , such as Army pensions , which could be changed by Congress at any time , but is a contractual obligation also protected by the Constitution of the State of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city have contributed . The pension can not be reduced , as any intelligently informed and slightly honest person would recognize . One of your paid - men in the office should know about this because he was a member of the Constitutional Convention which submitted this very constitutional provision . So , now deduct an additional $3,300 , - 000 from the suggested saving . 3 . In the same total there is an item of $656,000 for rent paid to property owners in the City of New York . These rentals are fixed by signed and executed leases and a slight inquiry on my part indicated that none of the lessors are willing to reduce 10 per cent from the stipulated price and there is no way the city could do it without their consent . Therefore , deduct an additional $66,000. 4 . In the sum total , two items , judgment and claims against the city and workmen 's compensation paid to injured employes of the city , amount to a total of nearly $3,000,000 . Until the constitution of the State of New York is changed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it must pay compensation for injured workmen in accordance with the law of the State of New York . So now deduct another $300,000 . More Policemen Needed 5 . In the total submitted by you there is an item of $58,000,000 for lie Police Department , exclusive of pensions . If the salaried employes of your organization were rendering any useful service the membership who pay them would know that we need more men in the Police Department , not less . This condition is so obvious that it requires no explanation at this time . In all likelihood we will have to provide additional funds in the coming fiscal year for the Police Department . As to the salaries of the personnel of the Police Department , I will take that up later . So here is another $5,800,000 that you can deduct from your fake estimate . Next , the Fire Department , also included in your total , amounts to $35,000,000 in round figures . Even with normal conditions we have several hundred vacancies in the Fire Department right now . These vacancies will have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are , if anything should happen there will be a decided increase in the budget of the Fire Department . Apparently your office has been too lazy or too indifferent or too malicious even to read my budget message on this point . Therefore here is another $3,500,000 out of the estimated savings that you wanted . 7 . Hospitals total $32,000,000 . Now here I will leave it to any group of members who signed your letter if it is not true that the hospitals will be unable , with the increasing cost of food , supplies , drugs and medicine ana with the scarcity of nurses and interns , to get along on the amount already appropriated . I warned about this in my budget message . Even without an acute emergency , under present conditions we are facing a deficit in the hospital appropriation . So another $3,200,000 has to be deducted from your suggested savings . 8 . We have an appropriation of $15,000.000 for charitable institutions , including private hospitals . This money is used to pay for the maintenance and keep of city charges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children . Every one of these institutions is facing increased costs and is bringing pressure to bear on the city for additional allowances for each case . At this very time there are gentlemen who signed your letter who belong to committees who are asking for increased allowances for city cases in private hospitals . There can not be a penny deducted from this amount and , therefore , $1,500,000 that you estimated can-not be saved . No Reductions in Security 9 . In your total is included $38 , - 000,000 for various forms of social security , such as old-age assistance , aid  --  to the blind , veteran relief and aid to dependent children . Despite the increase in employment the old-age case load , which is the largest item here , is increasing and will continue to in- - crease . The allowances are at a minimum and with the threatened rise in the cost of living , any change must be upward and not downward . There is no prospect of a decrease in the case load and we can not refuse relief to those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which are already on a subsistence minimum . Any reduction here would require a change of regulations by the Federal as well as State authorities and they would not approve it and neither would I. So here is $3,800,000 that you can strike off your savings . 10 . Now we come to your fine , courageous suggestion of reducing relief allowances . We have already anticipated a reduction in the relief load and if a further reduction is realized the money will not be spent . Relief expenditures are based on actual case load and a reduction in case load automatically cancels the expenditure . That is beyond our control . Either people work or they do not work . The only way we could carry out your suggestion of making an additional saving is to reduce the relief allowance . The average allowance per month per family is $49 . This includes rent , light and household expenses in addition to food . I am sure that not one of the distinguished gentlemen who , signed the statement will recommend a reduction of this allowance . Having already reduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving could be by reducing the allowance , and so long as I am Mayor of the City of New York I will not reduce it to the point where children will starve . So , whatever amount you figured on saving here , ordinary decency will prompt you to strike it out . Gives a Little Mathematics Let me stop here and review your figures up to this point . You recommend a 10 per cent saving with " such adjustments as are needed . " Constitutionally , we can not reduce the debt service or pensions or rent or payment of judgments and claims . As a matter of readiness for possible crises no one would wish us to reduce police and fire protection . As a matter of humanity we can not , and I will not , reduce the authorizations for hospitals , public or private , for social security included in the expense budget , nor ( except as the case load drops ) for home relief . But when you total these items a little simple arithmetic will show you that you have removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to which you direct your recommendations . Another simple arithmetical calculation ? and if you experts can not make it , I will loan you a clerk  --  will show you that your , $76,000,000 savings must then be made on the balance , ' at a rate of reduction of some 24 per cent instead of 10 per cent . Any suggestion of reducing other City expenditures by 24 per cent is preposterous and ' you know it . The most violent protest would come from the property owners and taxpayers from whom you draw your support . Imagine reducing all the city 's services other than those listed in the preceding paragraph by onequarter ! What would happen to property values , not to speak of personal values ? Imagine cutting by 25 per cent education and street cleaning and garbage removal and the maintenance of streets and bridges and docks and our water supply system .. The Sanitation Department has been allowed $28,500,000 . Here , too , I have pared to the very bone and there can not be an additional penny deducted . We have already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacancies - and the authorized amount in the budget is the very rock bottom . I will submit that to any group of intelligent and honest citizens ' in this city . So here is $2,800,000 that you figured on that just can not be-saved . Now even your office will know that in the budget the provision for education amounted to a total of $156,000,000 ( round figures , including elementary and secondary schools and higher education ) . Any honest presentation of the city 's financial problem would recognize that the city has not the power to change existing schedules . I have already deducted every possible penny from school appropriations compatible with existing needs and taking into account reduced school population . As to the salaries where reductions might have been made through legislation , very little if any help was received from your organization except lip service when the Legislature was not in session . As to the salaries of classroom teachers generally I will include them in the discussion of salaries herein below . So strike off another $15,600,000 from your bombastic figure . Takes Up Salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe you have in mind , and that is a reduction in salaries . On another occasion I was confronted with a crisis and personally advocated salary reductions . Again , I imposed salary reductions , on employes and departments where the Mayor and the Board of Estimate had budgetary control . At this time I assume full responsibility for saying that I will not approve of reduction of city salaries . Did it occur to you that the very reason for your letter ? the increased burden of Federal taxation  --  is equally applicable to city employes , and that the plain meaning of the request is that your burden of Federal taxation should be cut down by placing a double burden upon the public employe ; first , the increased Federal taxation which he must bear in common with , you , and then a reduction of salary on top of that ? Did you remember that city salaries were fixed at a time when no Federal income tax was imposed upon city employes , and that now , for two years , they have paid such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you overlook entirely the rise in the cost of- living which confronts us , with no indication of any reduction but a strong probability of a further increase ? May I say incidentally that when our country is faced with danger , when it is necessary for our government to prepare for proper defense , , then everybody must cheerfully and willingly assume an additional tax burden . That is true all over the country and it is true on the part of city ' employes , who have not as yet squawked . I could continue indefinitely , taking item by item , to demonstrate not only your staff 's complete ignorance of conditions in the city as well as the budget . itself but absolute bad faith in the presentation of your ' appeal . . I welcome help : I want criticism ; Put I am not going to stand for any such demagoguery and bid faith because you happen to be short of money and are trying to drum up subscriptions . I say again , General , shame , shame , shame ! . Very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
