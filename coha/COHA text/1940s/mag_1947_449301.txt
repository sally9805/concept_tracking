When James began the first of the notebooks with his sketch of Confidence , he had completed more than twelve years of apprenticeship to his craft . Daisy Miller had come out in the Cornhill Magazine that slimmer ; and The Europeans had just been serialized by the Atlantic Monthly . But James 's best work was still to come , and his notebooks were to serve him well in his achievement of it . To read them is to see at once many different ways in which they helped him gain that saturation in his material which he always held to be the first requisite for viable art . London , January 27 , 1879 . ? A story upon some such situation as this . Henry Irving , the actor , broke with the Batemans and got rid of Isabel B. in order to get up Hamlet on a great scale , and replace poor Isabel by Ellen Terry , a much more brilliant attraction . Ellen Terry appears with immense ? clat and the thing is a great success . Isabel lapses into obscurity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falls ill , and that Irving is suddenly in want of a substitute . Casting about for one he bethinks himself of Isabel B. ? rejected and wounded , having witnessed the triumph of the other , and brooding over her wrong . Suppose then that , after a short struggle with her wounded pride , she responds to Irving 's appeal ? she sacrifices her resentment ? makes herself little ? and resumes the part in which Ellen T. has so completely effaced her . The sacrifice is an heroic one ? that Of a woman 's most passionate personal vanity . Explanation and revelation ? because she is secretly in love with the great actor . These circumstances might easily be changed ; the idea , otherwise arranged , would remain the special sort of sacrifice made by a woman ? and its motive . James 's continuing interest in situations dealing with the life of the theater found its fullest expression , a decade later , in The Tragic Muse ( 1890 ) and in the story " Nona Vincent " ( 1892 ) . London , February @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one says ? " Oh yes , the United States ? a country without a sovereign , without a court , without a nobility , without an army , without a church or a clergy , without a diplomatic service , without a picturesque peasantry , without palaces or castles , or country seats , or ruins , without a literature , without novels , without an Oxford or a Cambridge , without cathedrals or ivied churches , without latticed cottages or village ale-houses , without political society , without sport , without fox-hunting or country gentlemen , without an Epsom or an Ascot , an Eton or a Rugby . . il " ? James presently incorporated this passage , almost word for word , into his biography of Hawthorne ( 1879 ) , where lie made it constitute his well-known enumeration of " the items of high civilization , as it exists in other countries , which are absent from the texture of American life . " His one significant alteration was to drop " a picturesque peasantry " and to add " no museums , no pictures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more light on James than on Hawthorne , and that fact , as well as the rhetorical flourish that has given the passage its quotability , seems accounted for by its having originally been conceived in the terms of James 's own fiction . Brunswick Hotel , Boston , November 25 , 1881 . ? Here I am back in America ... after six years of absence , and likely while here to see and learn a great deal that ought not to become mere waste material . Here I am , da vero , and here I am likely to be for the next five months . I am glad I have come ? it was a wise thing to do . I needed to see again les miens , to revive my relations with them , and my sense of the consequences that these relations entail . Such relations , such consequences , are a part of one 's life , and the best life , the most complete , is the one that takes full account of such things . One can only do this by seeing one 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by entering into their lives . ' Apart from this I hold it was not necessary I should come to this country . I am 37 years old ho was actually 381 , I have made my choice , and God knows that I have now no time to waste . My choice is the old world ? my choke , my need , my life . There is no need for me today to argue about this ; it is an inestimable blessing to me , ? and a rare good fortune , that the problem was settled long ago , and that I have now nothing to do but to act on the settlement . My impressions here are exactly what I expected they would be , and I scarcely see the place , and feel the manners , the race , the tone of things , now that am on the spot , more vividly than I did while I was still in Europe . My work lies there ? and with his vast new world , je n'ai que faire . One ca n't do both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon to assume that terrible burden , and it seems hard that I should be . The burden is necessarily greater for an American ? for he must deal , more , or less , even if only by implication , with Europe ; whereas no European is obliged to deal in the least with America . No one dreams of calling him less complete for not doing so : ( I speak of course of people who do the sort of work that I do ; not of economists , of social science people . ) The painter of manners who neglects America is not thereby incomplete as yet ; but a hundred years hence ? fifty years hence perhaps ? he will doubtless be accounted so . My impressions of America , however , I shall , after all , not write here . I do n't need to write them ( at least not a propos of Boston ) ; I know too well what they are . In many ways they are extremely pleasant ; hut , Heaven forgive me ! I feel as if my time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had nothing better to do , I might indulge in a retrospect that would be interesting and even fruitful . . . . I could remember without effort with what an irresistible longing I turned to Europe , with what ardent yet timid hopes , with what indefinite yet inspiring intentions , I took leave of les miens . I recall perfectly the maturing of my little plan to get abroad again and remain for years , during the summer of 1875 ; the summer the latter part of which I spent in Cambridge . It came to me there on my return from New York where I had been spending a bright , cold , unremtinerative , uninteresting winter , finishing Roderick Hudson and writ ing for the Nation . ( It was these two tasks that kept me alive . ) I had returned from Europe the year before that , the beginning of September , ' 74 , sailing for Boston with Wendell Holmes and his wife as my fellow passengers . I had come back then to " try New York , " think- ing it my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow older , and not take for granted too much that Europe alone was possible ; especially as Europe for me then meant simply Italy , where I had had some very discouraged hours , and which , lovely and desirable though it was , did n't seem as a perma- ? nent residence , to lead to anything . I wanted something more active , and I came back and sought it in New York . I came back with a certain amount of scepticism , but with very loyal intentions , and extremely eager to be " interested . " As I say , I was interested but imperfectly , and I very soon decided what was the real issue of my experiment . It was by no means equally soon , however , that I perceived how I should be able to cross the Atlantic But the opportunity came to me at last ? it loomed before me one summer 's day , in Quincy St. The best thing I could imagine then was to go and take up my abode in Paris . I went ( sailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Paris with the idea . that I should spend several years there . This was not really what I wanted ; what I wanted was London ? and Paris was only a stopgap . But Lon. don appeared to me then impossible . I believed that I might arrive there in the fulness of years , but there were all sorts of obstacles to my attempting to live there then . I wonder greatly now , in the light of my present knowledge of England , that these obstacles should have seemed so large , so overwhelming and depressing as they did at that time . . . . I went to Paris , and lived for a year at 29 Rue de Luxembourg ( now Rue Cambon ) . I shall not attempt to write the history of that year ? further than to say that it was time by no means misspent . I learned to know Paris and French affairs much better than before . . . . In the spring , at Madame Turgenieff 's , I made the acquaintance of Paul Joukowsky . Non ragioniam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't speak of Ivan Turgenieff , most delightful and lovable of men , nor of Gustave Flaubert , whom I shall always be so glad to have known ; a powerful , serious , melancholy , manly , deeply corrupted , yet not corrupting , nature . There was something I greatly liked in him , and he was very kind to me . He was a head and shoulders above the others , the men I saw at his house on Sunday afternoons ? Zola , Goncourt , Daudet , etc . ( I mean as a man ? not as a talker , etc . ) I remember in especial one afternoon ( a weekday ) that I went to see him and found him alone . I sat with him a long time ; something led him to repeat to me a little poem of Th . Gautier 's ? Les Vieux Portraits ( what led him to repeat it was that we had been talking of French poets , and he had been expressing his preference for Theophile Gautier over Alfred de Musset ? il Pail plus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great deal to the Comedic Francaise ? though not so much as when I was in Paris in ' 72 . Then I went every night ? or almost . And I have been a great deal since . I may say that I know the Com &lie; Francais ? . Of course I saw a great deal of the little American " set " ? the American village encamped en plein Paris . They were all very kind , very friendly , hospitable , etc. ; they knew up to a certain point their Paris . But ineffably tiresome and unprofitable . Their society had become a kind of obligation , and it had much to do with my suddenly deciding to abandon my plans of indefinite residence , take flight to London and settle there as best I could . I remember well what a crime Mrs. S. made of my doing so ; and one or two other persons as to whom I was perfectly unconscious of having given them the right to judge my movements so intimately . Nothing is more characteristic of certain American women than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remember how Paris had , in a hundred ways , come to weary and displease me ; I could n't get out of the detestable American Paris . Then I hated the Boulevards , the horrible monotony of the new quarters . I saw , moreover , that I should be an eternal outsider . I went . to London in November , 1870 . . . . I do n't remember what suddenly brought me to the point of saying ? " Go to ; I will try London . " I think a letter from William had a good deal to do with it , in which he said , " Why do n't you ? ? That must be the place . " A single word from outside often moves one ( moves me at least ) more than the same word infinitely multiplied as a simple voice from within . I did try it , and it has succeeded beyond my most ardent hopes . As I think I wrote just now , I have become passionately fond of it ; it is an anchorage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a Boston hotel ? on a marble-topped table ! ? and conscious of a ferocious homesickness ? a homesickness which makes me think of the day when I shall next see the white cliffs of old England loom through their native fog , as one of the happiest of my life ! The history of the five years I have spent in London  --  a pledge , I suppose , of many future years ? is too long , and too full to write . I can only glance at it here . I took a lodging at 3 Bolton St. , Piccadilly ; and there I have remained till today ? there I have left my few cart lily possessions , to await my return . I have hived much there , felt much , thought much , learned much , produced much ; the little shabby furnished apartment ought to be sacred to me . I came to London gs a complete stranger , and today I know much too many people . J'y 811774 absolument comme chez moi . Such an experience is an education ? it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to speak adequately or justly of London . It is not a pleasant place ; it is not agreeable , or cheerful , or easy , or exempt from reproach . It is only magnificent . You can draw up a tremendous list of reasons why it should he insupportable . The fogs , the smoke , the dirt , the darkness , the wet , the distanc0 , the ugliness , the brutal size of the place , the horrible numerosity of society , the manner in which this senseless bigness is fatal to amenity , to convenience , to conversation , to good manners ? all this and much more you may . expatiate upon . You may call it dreary , heavy , stupid , dull , inhuman , vulgar at heart and tiresome in form . I have felt these things at times so strongly that I have said ? " Ah London , you too then are impossible ? " But these are occasional moods ; and for one who takes it as I take it , London is on the whole the most possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as a bachelor ; as one who has the passion of observation and whose business is the study of human life . It is the biggest aggregation of human life ? the most complete compendium of the world . The human race is better represented there than anywhere else , and if you learn to know your London you learn a great many things . February 9 , 1882 , IN Mt . Vernon St. , Boston . ? When I began to make these rather ineffectual rec. ords I had no idea that I should have in a few weeks to write such a tale of sadness as today . I came back from Washington on the 30th of last month ( reached Cambridge the next day ) , to field that I should never again see my dear mother . On Sunday , Jan. 29th , as Aunt Kate sat with her in the closing dusk ( she had been ill with an attack of bronchial ? asthma , but was apparently recovering happily ) , she passed away . It makes a great difference to me ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know how tenderly till I saw her lying in her shroud in that cold North Room , with a dreary snowstorm outside , and looking as sweet'and tranquil and noble as in life . . . . It is impossible for me to say ? to begin to say ? all that has gone down into the grave with her . She was our life , she was the hthise , she was the keystone of the arch . She held us all together , and without her we are scattered reeds . She was patience , she was wisdom , she was exquisite maternity . Her sweetness , her mildness , her great natural beneficence were unspeakable , and it is infinitely touching to me to write about her here as one that was . When I think of all that she had been , for years ? when I think of her hourly devotion to each and all of us ? and that when I went to Washington the last of December I gave her my last kiss , I heard her ' voice for the last time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being to register the extinction of such a life . But I can reflect , with perfect gladness , that her work was done ? her long patience had done its utmost . She had had heavy cares and sorrows , which she had borne without a murmur , and the weariness of age had come upon her . I would rather have lost her forever than see her begin to suffer as she would probably have been condemned to suffer , and I can think with a kind of holy joy of her being lifted now above all our pains and anxieties . Her death has given me a passionate belief in certain transcendent things ? the immanence of being as nobly created as hers ? the immortality of such a virtue as that ? the reunion of spirits in better conditions than these . She is no more of an angel today than she had al ' ways been ; but I ca n't believe that by the accident of her death all her unspeakable tenderness is lost to the beings she so dearly loved . She is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is but a form of her love . One can hear her voice in it one can feel , forever , the inextinguishable vibration of her devotion . I ca n't help feeling that in those last weeks I was not tender enough with her ? that I was blind to her sweetness and beneficence . One ca n't help wishing one had only known what was coming , so that one might have enveloped her with the softest affection . When I came back from Europe I was struck with her being worn and shrunken , and now I know that she was very weary . She went about her usual activities , but the burden of life had grown heavy for her , and she needed rest . There is something inexpressibly touching to are in the way in which , during these last years , she went on from year to year without it . If she could only have lived she should have had it , and it would have been a delight to see her have it . But she has it now , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11 , 1882. 188g. - The dramatic form seems to me the most beautiful thing possible ; the misery of the thing is that the baseness of the English-speaking stage affords no setting for it . How I am to reconcile this with the constant solicitation that presses upon me , both from within and from without , to get at work upon another novel , is more than I can say . It is surely the part of wisdom , however , not to begin another novel at once not to commit myself to a work of longue baldric . I must do short things , in such measure as I need , which will leave me intervals for dramatic work . I sty this rather glibly ? and yet I sometimes feel a woeful hunger to sit down to another novel . If I can only concentrate myself : this is the great lesson of life . I have hours of unspeakable reaction against my smallness of production ; my wretched habits of work ? or of un-work ; my levity , my vagueness of mind , my perpetual failure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look things in the face , to invent , to produce , in a word . I shall he 40 years old in April next ; it 's a horrible fact ! I believe however that I have learned how to work and thyt it is in moments of forced idleness , almost alone , that these melancholy reflections seize me . When I am really at work , I 'm happy , I feel strong , I see many opportunities ahead . It it the only thing that makes life endurable . I must make some great efforts during the next few years , however , if I wish not to have been on the whole a failure . I shall have been a failure unless I do something great ! James 's special concern for names , vividly shown in the notebooks , is also testified to elsewhere . In " Mora Montravers " ( 1009 ) , for example , one of Mr , and Mrs. Tree 's difficulties as they contemplate Mora 's marriage to Walter Puddick is their dislike ? and hers ? for his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a particularly revealing passage . James , she writes , was " pleased " by " the magic of ancient names , quaint or impressive , crabbed or melodious . These he would murmur over and over to himself in a low chant , finally creating characters to fit them , and sometimes whole families , with their domestic complications and matrimonial alliances , such as the Dymmes of Dymchurch , one of whom mar. tied a Sparkle , and was the mother of little Scintilla Dymme-Sparkle , subject of much mirth and many anecdotes . " Names left over from one story James would thriftily save for use in another . London , January 2 , 1884 . ? Names . Dain try ? Vandeleur ? Grunlus ? Christian names : Florimond ? Ambrose ? Mathias ? Surnames : Benyon ? Pinder ? Valiance ? Nugent ? Maze ? Dins ? Fiddler ? Higgs . Most of them are out of the Times of the above date . Very rich . ? Chancellor ? Ambient August 10 , 1885 . ? It is absolutely necessary that at this point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clear to myself . I have never yet become engaged in a novel in which , after I had begun to write and send off my MS. , the details had remained so vague . This is partly ? or indeed wholly ? owing to the fact that I have been so terribly preoccupied ? up to so lately ? with the unhappy Bostonians , born under an evil star . ' The subject of the Princess is magnificent , and if I can only give up my mind to it properly ? generously and trustfully ? the form will shape itself as successfully as the idea deserves . I have plunged in rather blindly , and got a good many characters on my hattds ; but these will fall into their places if I keep cool and think it out . Oh art , art , what difficulties are like thine ; but , at the same time , what consolation and encouragements , also , are like thine ? Without thee , for me , the world would be , indeed , a howling desert . The Princess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to conic ; but she will also give me joys too sacred to prate about . The Princess Casamassima appeared serially in the Atlantic Monthly ( September , 1885 ? October , 1886 ) . James hoped that it would prove " more popular " than The Bostonians , but at the beginning of 1888 , he wrote to Howells , who had hailed the Princess as his greatest novel so far : " I have entered upon evil days . . . . I am still staggering a good deal under the mysteriou.9 and ( to me ) inexplicable injury wrought ? apparently ? upon my situation by my two last novels , the Bostonians and the Princess , from which I expeeled so much and derived so little . They have reduced the desire , and the demand , for my productions to zero . . . . " ? These two books constituted James 's attempt to handle the Dickensian type of social novel . Into the Princess lie poured the distillation of his long observation of London 's streets , in an effort to suggest the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vast smug surface . ' ; His preface is one of his most eloquent defenses ofthenovel of intelligence , of the use of such " intense perceivers " as his tragic young hero , Hyacinth Robinson . August 22 , 1885 . ? One does nothing of value in art or literature unless one has some general ideas , and if one has a few such , constituting a motive and a support , those flippancies and vulgarities ( abusive reviews in newspapers ) are the last thing one troubles about . Florence , January le , 1887 . ? Hamilton ( V. L. 's brother ) told me a curious thing of Capt . Silsbee the Boston art-critic and Shelley-worshipper ; that is of a curious adventure of his . Miss Claremont Clairmont is the usuall form of the name , and the one used by James in his preface to The Aspern Papers , Byron 's ci-devant mistress ( the mother of Allegra ) , was living , until lately , here in Florence , at a great age , 80 or thereabouts , and with her lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 50 . Silsbee knew that they had interesting papers ? letters of Shelley 's and Byron 's ? he had known it for a long time and cherished the idea of getting hold of them . To this end he laid the plan of going to lodge with the Misses Claremont ? hoping that the old lady in view of her great age and failing condition would die while he was there , so that he might then put his hand upon the documents , which she hugged close in life . He carried out this scheme ? and things se passbrent as he had expected . The old woman did die ? and then he approached the younger one ? the old maid of 50 ? on the sub- . ject of his desires . Her answer was ? " I will give you all the letters if you marry me ! " H. says that Silsbee court encore . Certainly there is a little subject there : the picture of the two faded , queer , poor and discredited old English women ? living on into a strange generation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with these illustrious letters their most precious possession . ' Then the plot of the Shelley fanatic ? his watchings and waitings ? the way he couvers the treasure . The denouement need n't be the one related of poor Silsbee ; and at any rate the general situation is in itself a subject and a picture . It strikes me much . The interest would be in some price that the man has to pay ? that the old woman ? or the survivor ? sets upon the papers . His hesitations ? his struggle ? for he really would give almost anything . ? The Countess Gamba came in while I was there : her husband is a nephew of the Guiccioli ? and it was a propos of their having a lot of Byron 's letters of which they are rather illiberal and dangerous guardians , that H. told . me the above . They wo n't show them or publish any of them ? and the Countess was very angry once on H. 's representing to her that it was her duty ? especially to the English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Elle se fiche bien of the English public . She says the letters ? addressed in Italian to the Guiccioli ? are discreditable to Byroil ; and II . elicited from her that she had burned one of them ! The situation in James 's The Aspern Papers iS the one outlined in the first part of the note above , bvi Shelley has been disguised as an American poet , and Florence has become Venice . James added to the notebook sketch by suggesting strongly that the old lady , Juliana , schemed to make the seeker for Jeffrey Aspern 's papers marry the " younger one , " Tina , as the price of seeing them . After Juliana dies , Tina virtually offers him the relics if lie will marry her . He runs away , then wavers ? only to discover that Tina will not have him now that she realizes that he can not love her . The story ends with her destruction of the papers and his discomfited departure . Juliana is made a kind of symbol of what James , as his preface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age , and her constant masking of her eyes heightens the mystery which hangs about her in a time very different from that in which she was a poet 's mistress . Tina , whose transparent honesty borders on downright stupidity , supplies a sharp contrast , and in developing this James goes beyond the notebook to set up tension between the romantic charm of a " Byronic " world , and the simpler aspect of later American characters . James 's interest in names , already alluded to , is here profitably used to enhance his characterization and setting . Tina talks of the days when she and Juliana first came to Italy , and says that they led a " brilliant life . " " It was Miss Tina who judged it brilliant . . . . I asked her what people they had known and she said Oh very nice ones ? the Cavaliers Rambled and the Contessa Altemura , with whom they had had a great friendship ! Also English people ? the Churtons and the Goldies and Mrs. Stock-Stock , whom they had loved dearly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irony implicit in Tine 's magnifying into brilliance a society sadly inglorious in comparison with Juliana 's romantic past . Evan Charteris , in his John Sargent , tells the same story that James heard about Captain Silsbee , and also quotes Vernon Lee on that " typical American skip . others may be of varying kinds and degrees of shortness . I need n't go into all my reasons and urgencies over again here ; suffice it that they are cogent and complete . I must absolutely not tie my hands with promised novels if I wish to keep Ahem free for a genuine and sustained attack on the theatre . That is one cogent reason out of many ; but the artistic one would be enough even by itself . What I call the artistic one par excellence is simply the consideration that by doing short things I can do so many , touch so many subjects , break out in so many places , handle so many of the threads of life . However , I have threshed all this out ; it exists , in my mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? inspiration deep and clear . The upshot of all such reflections is that I have only to let myself go ! So I have said to myself all my life ? so I said to myself in the far-off days of my fermenting and passionate youth . Yet I have never fully done it . The sense of it ? of the need of it ? rolls over me at times with commanding force : it seems the formula of my salvation , of what remains to me of a future . I am in full possession of accumulated resources ? I have only to use them , to insist , to persist , to do something more ? to do much more ? than I have done . The way to do it ? to affirm one 's self sur la fin ? is to strike as many notes , deep , full and rapid , as one can . All life is  --  at my age , with all one 's artistic soul the record of it ? in one 's pocket , as it were . Go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rich and long St. Martin 's Summer . Try everything , do ' everything , render everything ? be an artist , be distinguished , to the last . One has one 's doubts and discouragements ? but they are only so many essential vibrations of one 's ideal . The field is still all round me , to he won ; it blooms with the flowers that are still to be plucked . But enough of the general , these things are the ambient air ; they are the breath of one 's artistic and even of one 's personal life . Strike , strike , again and again and again , at the special ; I have only to live and to work , to look and to feel , to gather , to note . My cadres all there ; continue , ah , continue , to fill them . London , Saturday , January 12 , 1895 . ?

It is therefore worth noting that the anecdote from which James started posited both that the children had been corrupted and that they were still being influenced by the apparitions of the dead servants . James is again explicit on this point in his preface , where he discusses the kind of ghost story he was attempting in his imagined treatment of demonic possession . He added his incisive formulation of how to create a sense of evil : " Only make the reader 's general vision of evil intense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own imagination , his own sympathy ( with the children ) and horror ( of their false friends ) will supply him quite sufficiently with all the particulars .

I have listened and considered and reflected , and the matter is transposed to a minor key . To accept the circumstances , in their extreme humility , and do the best I can in them : this is the moral of my present situation . They are the reverse of ideal ? but there is this great fact that for myself at least I may make them better . To take what there is , and use it , without waiting forever in vain for the preconceived ? to dig deep into the actual and get something out of that ? this doubtless is the right way to live . If I succeed a little I can easily ? I think ? succeed more . . . And if there is money in it that will greatly help : for all the profit that may come to me in this way will mean real freedom for one 's general artistic life : it all hangs together ( time , leisure , independence for " real literature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience of tout un ate de la vie ) . Therefore my plan is to try with a settled resolution ? that is , with a full determination to return repeat .. edly to the charge , overriding , annihilating , despising the boundless discouragements , disgusts , ecreuremeats . One should use such things ? grind them to powder . His proposal is that I shall make a play of the American , and there is no doubt a play in it . I must extract the simplest , strongest , baldest , most rudimentary , at once most humorous and most touching one , in a form whose main sown : shall be pure situation and pure point combined with pure brevity . Oh , how it . must not be too good and how Very bad it must be ! A moi , Scribe ; a. moi , Sardou , a moi , Denneryl ? Reduced to its simplest expression , and that reduction must be my play , The American is the history of a plain man who is at the same time a fine fellow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , being accepted by her people on acct. of his wealth , and is then thrown over ( by them ) , for a better match : after which he turns upon them to recover his betrothed ( they have bullied her out of it ) , through the possession of a family secret which is disgraceful to them , dangerous to them , and which he holds over them as an instrument of compulsion and vengeance . They are frightened ? they feel the screw : they dread exposure ; but in the novel the daughter is already lost to the hero ? she is swept away by the tragedy , takes refuge in a convent , breaks off her other threatened match , re . nounces the world , disappears . The hero , injured , outraged , resentful , feels the strong temptation to punish the Bellegardes , and for a day almost yields to it . Then he does the characteristically magnanimous thing ? the characteristically good-natured thing ? throws away his opportunity ? lets them " off " ? lets them go . In the play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the composition of The American , which he thought for a while of calling The Californian , James hoped to begin the realization of his dream of writing successfully for the theater . He worked out a four-act structure , but by providing a happy ending he produced a piece less substantial and less moving than his novel . His letters at the time are filled with excitement and expectation over this new venture , as is the journal of Alice James , who in an English sanitarium at this juncture was her brother 's close confidante . The American , with Edward Compton in the role of Christopher Newman , and his wife , Virginia Bale-man , in that of Claire de Cintrd , went through a promising tour in the provinces . It came to London in the autumn of 1891 for only a moderate success ? a two months ' run . By the time of that production James had also completed four other plays , Tenants , Disengaged , The , Album , and The Reprobate , though none of these reached the stage . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William James : " I feel at last as if I had found my real form , which I am capable of carrying far . " But as Granville-Barker has remarked , it was too bad that James knew as his model the French theater at one of its worst periods . Marine Hotel , Kingstown , Ireland , July 18 , 1891 . ? I must hammer away at the effort to do , sue . cessfully and triumphantly , a large number of very short things . I have done a dozen , lately , but it takes time and practice to get into the trick of it . I have never attempted before to deal with such extreme brevity . However , the extreme brevity is a necessary condition only for some of them
