Ten years ago Roy Thomas Hollis was in a Georgia chain gang . He had twice been convicted of robbery . He sweated with pick &; shovel " muscle crews " in tough camps , wore double chains , was lashed by a vicious warden . It was two years before he was classified as a trusty and unshackled . <P> ' One rainy day he told a guard , " I 'm going home . " The guard refused to believe him , laughed and called " Good luck ! " as he walked away . Roy Hollis rode a log down a creek to throw hounds off the scent , headed for his mother 's home in Rutledge ( pop . 600 ) . <P> People in Rutledge 's frame stores and cotton warehouses assumed that he had been paroled , congratulated him , seemed to take it for granted that he had mended his ways . He had . He went to work on a farm , married , fathered three handsome children . He became a leader in church and school affairs , never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wife of his past , and she stuck by him . But his fear of arrest never left him . Two years ago , he moved to Atlanta , where he went to work as a carpenter . <P> <P> Surrender . One day last month , while fitting shelves in an Atlanta lawyer 's office , he laid aside his hammer , turned and said to his boss : " Listen , mister . I 'm a fugitive from a Georgia chain gang . I have been for nine years . Now I want to do something about it . I owe it to my wife and children . " <P> Next day he surrendered . The state board of pardons and paroles held a hearing , watched curiously as dozens of the fugitive 's old friends from Rutledge crowded in , listened even more curiously to the tale they had to tell : <P> Three years after Roy Hollis arrived in Rutledge , 1,500 citizens of the town and county , impressed by his industry and honesty , had signed a petition asking the state pardon board to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will , the fugitive confessed . The petition was destroyed . In the years that followed , all Rutledge had protected him with silence . <P> Said the town 's chief of police : " I saw he was trying to make an honest living . The police at Madison , Ga . knew he was an escape*-we knew it-the sheriff knew it , but none of us would turn Roy in . He proved he was a worthwhile citizen . . . . " <P> This week the parole board agreed , sent Roy Thomas Hollis back into the world a free man . <P> * Southern colloquialism for " escaped prisoner . "
