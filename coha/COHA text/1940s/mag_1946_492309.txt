10 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 5 , 1946 learned to drink , gamble , swear in five languages and to handle himself in the no-holds-barred style of fighting . He was prepared , physically and mentally , for the battle for survival on the sidewalks of New York . " My life has been a battle ever since , " says Mr. Rosoff , " with the black eyes about evenly dist ributed . " The black eyes were not all physical . Some were verbal and some were financial . He bellowed and punched and bulldozed his way to millionaire status not once but several times . He beat down the contractors ' combine to get a toe hold in the subway-building business . He fought rock slides and quicksands and fires and flooded tunnels and impossible schedules . He bucked the transportation combine to break into that lucrative field . He battled opposing politicians and reformers indiscriminately . He hired experts to run his businesses , and jailbirds and thugs to protect them . He became a Kentucky colonel , a patron of the opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of bankers to such a degree that once he dined at the home of J. P. Morgan . The black eyes he took were just as spectacular . In 1937 he was named , but not indicted , in connection with the murder of a labor leader . His name was bandied about in several New York investigations which petered out . He went broke several times , notably as result of tackling al the stock market , ( ID ) certain underworld characters and politicians rougher than he , and ( cl certain genteel financiers who turned but shrewder and , in a velvety way , even tougher than he . After his initial experience in Park Row , Subway Sam slipped easily into the precarious existence of homeless street gamin in New York . When he had eight cents he could get a bed , a clean nightshirt and a breakfast of oatmeal , coffee and roll at the Newsboys ' Lodging House , an institution often visited by Horatio Alger in search of material . It may even be that Subway Sam saw him there in the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the event . There was also a place back of the World Building where a boy could fill up on beef stew for three cents . When he did not have eight cents , he slept in a doorway or on a warm sidewalk grating . Sometimes he did not have even three cents , though he peddled his papers industriously and added a side line of shining shoes . This was because he was a victim of the trapshooting habit . Unlike Ragged Dick , one of Alger 's literary heroes , Subway Sam never outgrew this vice . In his later heyday , he was often to be found at the biggest craps game in town , and legend has him losing as much as $40,000 in a night . He kept a home at Saratoga and would drop everything to spend each horse-racing season there . With his penchant for long shots , he was the bookmakers ' delight , but sometimes he was lucky . He bet Jim Dandy at 100 to 1 in the 1930 Travers Stakes against such champions as Gallant Fox and Whichone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $50,000 in June , 1927 , that Al Smith would get the Democratic nomination for President in 1928 . Perhaps the most important killing of his life , however , was the ten dollars he won in a newsboys ' and bootblacks ' craps game one night a couple of years after leading in New York . With this stake he hastened to the offices of the Union News Company to seek a job . It was exactly the amount needed for a deposit on a stock of magazines , candy , chewing gum , popcorn , cigars , cigarettes and chewing tobacco to hawk on the trains . It did not cover the uniform and fancy cap required for the job , but luck was still with him . The superintendent , a man named Merkle , took a liking to this loud , cocky boy , and advanced him the rest of the money . Thus Subway Sam became a candy butcher on the West Shore Railroad running up to the Adirondacks ; and thus , in true Alger fashion , he met a rich man who befriended him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tea importer and merchant . He first became interested in Subway Sam when he saw the boy hunched in a vacant seat , laboriously trying to spell out the headlines in a discarded paper . Alger 's books were in great vogue in this era and it had become fashionable for men of means to interest themselves in stray boys , but it would be unfair to ascribe the interest of Low , a man noted for many philanthropies , solely to this factor . He tried to teach Subway Sam how to dress and act in polite company , invited him to his home and his church , and taught him some of the workings of the higher reaches of business . Today a picture of Low still occupies a place of honor in the offices of Samuel R. Rosoff , Ltd. , and for years Subway Sam gave a job to any relative of Low who wanted one . When Subway Sam was eighteen , Low sent him to prep school , but Sam was so much bigger than the other boys in his elementary class that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eyes and quit . There is a legend that he can not read or write even today , and when he has a few drinks in him , some of his cronies will bait him by trying to get him to read something . The truth is that he can read and write after a fashion , but the bigger words baffle him . " What the hell , " says Rosoff . " I can always hire college graduates to do the pencil-and-paper work . " PHOTOGRAPHY BY VICTOR DE PALMA As a last resort , Low sent him to a logging camp he owned in the Adirondacks . He had to administer and take quite a number of black eyes before the tough loggers accepted him , but he stayed there for two years . Then he struck out on his own again . He went back to the lower Manhattan scenes of his newsboy days . He went back dressed in the fashion Low had taught him , with a touch of loudness and a tilt to his hat which were his own . The clothes caused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they called him " The Whitney " because , in his Russian accent and foghorn voice , he tried to talk like a gentleman . These jeers must have hurt him , for he did not fight back , but dropped these pretensions ; and thenceforward he was frankly , even boastfully , a roughneck . Having learned the use of heavy-construction machinery in the logging camp , he now decided to become a contractor . He paid a literate lad to con the small-print notices of contracts to be let , and brashly bid on them all . They scoffed at him when , on a shoestring , he landed a $150,000 job razing an old tabernacle in Herald Square . But he made close to $7000 on that job ; a fortune for a young man of twenty in 1902 . Onward and ? Downward H Egambled on odd contracts for several years , sometimes shooting for thousands , sometimes reduced to cellar-digging jobs . The only high light during that period was his salvaging the liner Batavia when she was wrecked on the rocks in the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , exactly fifteen years after , as a boy of ten , he had earned two shillings a week peeling potatoes in the galley of that same liner . But his first really big deal came in 1911 when he was twenty-nine . He heard that bids were open for a breakwater for the building of the Cape Cod Canal . Alger once wrote a book entitled Sam 's Chance , and How He Improved It . This was Subway Sam 's big chance , and here is how he improved it . He went up to the Cape Cod region with a suitcase full of liquor and $10,000 in small bills . By judicious use of both these inducements in that dry and dollar-conscious territory , he got options on 2,000,000 tons of crushed stone , and thus cornered the market on that necessity for the building of a breakwater . With this advantage , he was able to bid lower than anyone else , and thus won the contract . However , two big obstacles remained . One was that after buying up the options , he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had was an old scow named The Ark . Walking the streets trying to figure out a way to raise money , he saw a pawnshop with the name " Noah " emblazoned on the window . He went inside and convinced the pawnbroker that this apposition of names was a lucky omen ; that a Noah ought to take a chance on The Ark . The second difficulty was that rip tides swirled so viciously in the half moon where the breakwater was needed that no one had ever dared risk barges in there . Sam studied the tides and ran the barges on almost split-second schedule . He lost a couple , but built the breakwater and made $300,000 . This vast coup convinced Sam that he was now ready for the big leagues of construction and finance . He conceived a scheme for building a great concrete amusement pier at Long Branch , New Jersey , with a ship line linking it to New York , Atlantic City and Cape May . This required far more money and credit than Sam could command , and so , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Augustus Low , he approached a group of millionaire financiers . They promised to back him for a slice of the profits . Sam took the word of these gentlemen without bothering to ascertain whether they were financially interested in or vulnerable to pressure from certain railroads which would not like the threat of competition from his proposed ship line . He went blithely ahead , sinking all his own money and credit into the building of the pier and buying options on land . Then the plug was pulled on him . His backers backed out , the sheriff moved in , and Sam was bankrupt . This made him a wiser but not a sadder man . He took it as a grim joke on himself . He got hold of one of the handbills advertising the sheriff 's sale and had a picture taken of himself , shabby and unshaven as a tramp , with the handbill fastened to his chest . He eventually paid off his creditors and cleared himself of the bankruptcy stigma , but that picture still hangs as a reminder in his offices at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the peaceful Adirondacks to start all over again . He worked as a laborer in a construction gang until he had saved $100 . With this he bought a streak of rust which had been a railroad and sold the ties , spikes and other paraphernalia to farmers at a profit . With the resultant small stake he went to Albany , where he bought horses and mules , and sold them to contractors . While buying these animate from farmers , he discovered that there was a huge spread between what farmers got for their potatoes and what the produce brokers sold them for in New York . He thought he saw a chance to horn into this lucrative field by being a bit less greedy than the brokers  --  by paying the farmers a little more to ensure himself of a supply and selling in New York at a little less to ensure a market . He tried this with one carload of potatoes , and it worked . Then he sank all his meager capital into five carloads of potatoes and discovered that this was a business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somebody forced open the doors of his five carloads so that his potatoes arrived in New York frozen and worthless . Baffied , Subway Sam went back to the field he understood better , and speedily made a financial comeback by bagging the job of wrecking a powerhouse in Albany . Other contractors bid up to $50,000 for this job , because the specifications banned the use of dynamite , and piecemeal razing meant high labor costs . Sam bid one dollar . He did this because , when a friend read the specifications to him , he noted that they said nothing about other types of explosives . He put black powder in the piers , shored the building with timber , and on noon of the day after he got the contract , blew it down : He made close to $30,000 from the sale of the triaterialm This started him on seven years of comparative prosperity as a highway contractor with interesting political connections around Albany , but fate was not yet ready to give him a smooth path to the top of the ladder . A sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short on materials and overextended on iron-clad contracts . Soon a friend saw him trudging away from a completed job with a wheelbarrow containing a pick and a shovel . " What are you doing , Sam ? " be asked . " Moving my plant , " grinned Subway Sam . Once again he started all over on a small scale , keeping his eyes peeled for another break . He soon got two of them , but at this point Mn Rosoff 's observations on the subject of breaks may be of interest . " You got to have the brains and the steam and the breaks , " says Mr. Rosoff . If a man is not afraid of any man or thing , he can sometimes make the breaks for himself ; and sometimes be can make a record without a lot of brains . But you ca n't do without steam . You got to have that or you get nowhere . " He showed steam when , in 1920 , he heard that a strike had left New York 's garbage piled high . Sam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , convinced that to meet the union demands would make him lose money , sold his contract to Sam for a song . Sam then made a quick settlement with the union , instituted more efficient methods to compensate for the increased costs , and cleaned up , financially as well as literally . The story of the second break of this period may be apocryphal . Sometimes he denies it , sometimes he lets it ride . According to the story , he showed up one day in the sleepy town of Marlboro , on the Hudson River , and announced loudly that he was looking for a place to build a summer home . This naive approach naturally led the canny country folk to hike their asking prices . When Subway Sam finally picked out a piece of land right on the river , the owner demanded $27,500 . " Too much ! " boomed Sam . " I 'll give you seventeen thousand , five hundred . " They haggled and haggled in vain until Sam suggested they toss a coin to determine the price . Finally the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as he was out of sight , however , the farmer ran gleefully to tell his cronies how he had outsmarted this city slicker ; for even $17,500 was about twice what he normally would have valued that piece of land . The rural jollity was short-lived . The next day a crew of Sam 's men showed up with heavy equipment to scoop into the land . It contained the only worthwhile deposit of construction gravel for miles around . Had the owner realized this , the price would have been several times as much . There was , in effect , a third break which stemmed from the first of this series . To design and build two disposal plants involved in the garbage deal , Sam hired Arthur H. Diamant , a well-known engineer , who later was to be a great help to him in breaking into a bigger field . They are sharply contrasted individuals , and at first Diamant , a studious , fastidious sort of man , was dubious about working for Rosoff . Sam had grown fat , but not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his office on a hot summer day , he found Sam stripped to the waist , with his paunch overflowing onto the desk and a frosted glass in his hand . " Ho ! " roared Sam . " So you 're Diaxuantl Have a drink ! How much do you want to come to work for me ? " They made a deal , however , and today Diamant is vice-president and general manager of the Rosoff organization ; though they still somewhat baffle each other . One day , exposed to a typical Rosoff explosion of free-wheeling , gold-plated epithets , Diamant became insulted and got on his dignity . " What 's the matter ? " asked Sam in genuine surprise . " Did I say something ? " Another time , exasperated by Diamant 's calmness , he roared plaintively , " Dammit ! I ca n't tell from that cold face of yours what you 're thinking ! " Nevertheless , Diamant was at least an instrument for Rosoff 's entrance into the field which brought him fame , fortune and his sobriquet of Subway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts he was getting , he discovered that Diamant had ( Continued on Page .58 ) SUBWAY SAM ( Continued from Page Ill experience in the esoterics of estimating subway jobs . It may be that he knew this all along and that it was the main reason he hired Diamant . Just how far ahead he plans his coups is one of the few things Subway Sam keeps to himself . At any rate , in 1923 he had the gall to defy New York 's politico-contractor combine by bidding $4,600,000 for construction of about a half-mile section of subway under St. Nicholas Avenue , in New York . His bid was so low that he had to break the record for subway construction to keep from going broke . He broke the record , Though he was ignorant of book-style engineering , he had an instinctive eye for the fallacies in hackneyed methods and a flair for short cuts . He ran ramps into his subway excavations , so that trucks could unload equipment and materials and load dirt to be hauled away right at the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the traditional method of digging new holes in the street as the work moved on and relying on hoisting equipment . When a policeman handed six of his truck drivers summonses for overloading , Sam charged at him , roaring , " Put up yer dukes and fight like a man ! " The policeman arrested him , but Sam had learned some of the tricks of political infighting too . When the case got to court , the magistrate released Sam with a dainty warning , and dismissed the charges against the truck drivers . Sam finished the job so far , ahead of schedule that , even after paying off the backers to whom he had to go to be able to swing the deal , he made money . After that he bid on every subway job that came along , and , although at first he got only the tough ones the other contractors were leery of , he snagged $50,000,000 worth of contracts . The New York tabloids dubbed him " Subway Sam " and " The Subway King , " and he became a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subway Sam , backing Broadway shows , plunging on the horses , buying whole front rows at the theater and fights for his parties , dragging bevies of society folk from night club or opera to " see my subway , " fighting a subterranean fire in top hat and tails , bellowing defiance at City Hall , Tammany , the Republicans , the traction magnates and rival contractors indiscriminately  --  all this was right up the alley of the tabloid reporters and photographers . He threw a party for Irene Sordoni at the Arrowhead Inn , playhouse for Saratoga elite , and spectacular soirees for other stage and screen stars . He was noted at parties and luncheons with Jim Farley , Jock Whitney , Jack Dempsey , Jimmy Walker , Peggy Joyce , Al Jolson , Irvin S. Cobb . He was resplendent in pink shirts , the loudest waistcoats on Broadway , and $200 suits which he discarded after one or two wearings . He was a check grabber and always good for a touch . He kept open house at Saratoga and various New York hotel Suites @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in was a friend of his , and would slap him or her on the back and bellow , " Hello ! How the hell are you ? Glad to see you again ! ... Hey ! A drink for my pal ! " Such activities , however , played bob with his domestic life . His wife , Rose , whom he married during his early contracting days , did not care for this sort of super-whoopee . For a time she had been his partner and guardian of his finances to suchen extent that he sometimes referred to her as " The Rosie National Bank , " but now they began its drift apart , and today they live separately . They had two children , Stanley , now thirty-eight , who runs bis own cement business ; and Nathaniel , now thirty-five , who served in the Southwest Pacific as a captain of marines in the recent war . Subway Sam made peace with the political powers after his defiance of them to win his first subway contract made him a man to be reckoned with , He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tinted photo across which was scrawled : " To Sam Rosoff , with every good wish to a real friend for whom I have a high regard . James A. Farley . " When the Republicans came around with outstretched palms , he contributed to their campaigns too . " I 'm a member of Tammany Hall , " he said , " and proud of it . I 'm also a Republican , and proud of that too . " He joined the Elks , the Masons , the Bankers Club and the Longshoremen 's Club . He was just as diverse in his other benefactions . Born in the Jewish faith , he paid for remodeling St. Michael 's Episcopal Church , where Augustus Low had taken him as a youth , and for a time he served as a trustee of that church . He helped build the Church of the Blessed Sacrament , where the priest was a friend of his from his newsboy and young-contractor days . He sold $60,000 worth of tickets to a boxing show for the benefit of the Palestine Emergency Fund . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro children . He helped a young priest named Father Patrick Hayes organize the Greenwich Street Boys Club , and now keeps in his New York apartment a picture inscribed : " With sincere appreciation , P. Cardinal Hayes . " A member of the Park Avenue Synagogue , Rosoff has in his office a framed message from Pope Pius which refers to him as one who " accepts Jesus Christ . " When subway building was slack , he thrust his massive head and voice into other fields . He offered to finance and build a $100,000,000 tunnel for New York . He barged into the transit field , battling for bus-line franchises . When borough officials questioned his financial responsibility , he waved two brand-new $100,000 U.S. Treasury notes under their noses . When the same question was raised while be was trying to corral an immensely lucrative contract for disposal of Brooklyn 's refuse , he stalked into a hearing flanked by two armed guards who toted an iron box and a bulging bag . He opened these to display $1,000,000 in cash , which he offered to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to build $175,000,000 worth of subways in Moscow , Subway Sam was invited to bid on the job . He went to Moscow to look things over , but turned down the deal because the Soviet wanted to pay for it with bonds , which he considered too riskt A few months later he was practically wiped out in the collapse of New York 's Bank of the United States and the 1929 stock-market crash . Subway Sam 's amazing ability to produce comparatively huge sums on short notice has led to the belief in certain observant circles that in his biggest era he was really acting as a front man for a syndicate of politicians trying anonymously to grab gravy from their fellows , and bankers who did not care to have their names bandied about in the mud-slinging inevitable in political contracts . There are several strong indications of that , and the school which holds to that belief also weighs as evidence , perhaps too heavily , a reply Sam once made to Amster Spiro , then the ( Continued on Page 50 ) // ( Confirmed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hearst 's Journal-American . Spiro tried o advise Sam to tone down a bit in voice and manner . Sam eyed him benignly . " Listen , " he said , " you stick to your headlines . I know what . I 'm doing . Let me do my business my way . " The implicaticm taken from this is that his loudness and toughness were largely an act to help him in his role of front man for the soft-spoken boys . Subway Sam 's carefully nurtured reputation for toughness helped put him in an embarrassing position when , on the evening of February 19 , 1937 , a labor leader named R. Norman Redwood wasshot dead in Teaneck , Bergen County , New Jersey . According to County Prosecutor John J. Breslin later , the deed was done by " four or five hired killers , who probably did the whole job for $500 . " Such killings were not rare in the turbulent labor wars in New York during that period , and almost invariably the official investigations cracked up against a wall of anonymity . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a couple of hours that he wanted to question Samuel R. Rosoff . Redwood had been battling two rival labor leaders , Joe Fay and Jimmy Bove , who , eight years later , in 1945 , were sentenced to long prison terms for labor racketeering . Accusing them of lining their own pockets with graft from employers instead of fighting for increases in the pay envelopes of their followers , Redwood had been raiding Fay and Bove 's unions . In a show of strength , he called a strike of 1200 Rosoff workers on a sewer project and a 6th Avenue Subway job . If Redwood won , he would be on his way to smashing the lucrative power of Fay and Bove . Meanwhile , Subway Sam was caught in the middle of this brawl . It was in the lean days for big construction jobs , and if the strike threw him too far behind schedule , he might go broke again . Breslin said he wanted to question Rosoff because an aide of Redwood 's had made a statement to him accusing Rosoff of threatening Redwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aide said that Rosoff " jumped up and rushed across the room at Redwood , shook his hands under Redwood 's nose , gave him a shove and said , ' If this strike is called , I will have you killed . . . . Remember , Redwood , if you do anything like that , you are a dead man . You can tell that to the police . Tell them if you want to ! ' " Rosoff was in an Atlantic City hotel bar when , at one A.M. after the shooting , a telephone call from a New York newspaper informed him that Breslin WE CAPTURED HERMANN GOERING ( Lau r Iel are/ from PIrgr 15 ) the road . There was too great a possibility of mix-ups , accidents , fights or just plain getting lost to leave things to chance any longer . Our mission was to get Goering alive , if at all possible , and we wanted to get our hands on him . We left the reconnaissance platoon at the castle to maintain guard and prevent any Germans from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep Goering and whomever he might have with him , and we would have them all in one building . The general , Goering 's aide and the interpreter went first in the sedan . I followed in a jeep with a wanted him . He started for New York almost immediately . He went there in a remarkably roundabout way . The shortest way was up the length of New Jersey via the fast Shore Highway . But Rosoff sped west across New Jersey to Philadelphia , in a car driven by the bodyguard of Enoch L. Johnson , than Republican boss of Atlantic City . This enabled Rosoff to avoid going through Bergen County on his way to New York , and got him out of New Jersey as directly as possible . In Philadelphia he hired a taxicab . The shortest and best route from Philadelphia to New York is over Route No. 1 , which flows splendidly through New Jersey . Instead , the taxi made an elaborately roundabout trip , via Stroudsburg , Permsylvania , avoiding New Jersey soil . Ensconced in his New York apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to Bergen County for questioning . His chauffeur bodyguard , who did go over to talk to the authorities , was clapped into jail without bail for a period . " How do I know they wo n't do the same thing to me ? " Rosoff demanded of a roomful of newspaper reporters who sat sipping his Scotch . " They might put Me in the jug and keep me there for days and weeks . I 'm not going to sit in the jug for anybody . If they want to question me , let them come over here and do it . " He denied categorically that he had ( a ) anything to do with the killing , ( b ) threatened Redwood with killing , or ( c ) even quarreled with Redwood . He cited the fact that he and Redwood had drinks together the day before the murder , and pointed to a newspaper photograph showing Redwood and himself in a friendly pose after the alleged threats . The case was a nine-day sensation , but nothing much more came of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light machine gun . This gun , mounted on the dashboard in front of my seat , plus one rifle and three pistols , was the total armament of our task force . Our road led through a deep gorge for several miles and then came to a fairly large town . Few civilians were on the streets , but there were many soldiers in ragged but familiar uniforms  --  British and American . The German major stopped to telephone again . While we waited , we were surrounded by the soldiers , who turned out to be prisoners from a large PW camp outside the town . Their guards had gone of and left the prison camp open that morning , and the prisoners were now free to come and go as they pleased . Typhus had broken out , in one of the camps , and most of them were rant to be issued against Rosoff , but this was not of sufficient legal weight to force extradition from New York to New Jersey . He did not seek a grand-jury indictment , which would have forced Rosoff to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had some knowledge pertinent to the investigation , he did not have sufficient evidence for an indictment . The case remains unsolved to this day . After this affair , Subway Sam dropped from the public eye and prints for several years . He began to emerge again when , early in the war , he won a $45,705,000 contract to start building a third set of locks for the Panama Canal from one end , while Henry Kaiser started from the other . A change in the war picture caused the project to be held up after about 10 per cent of the work was done . Currently , Subway Sam is completing an $11,000,000 tunnel for an irrigation project in the state of Puebla , Mexico , and trying to arrange financing for a $50,000,000 industrial development in Northwestern Mexico . He lives in a three-room suite in the flashy Reforma Hotel in Mexico City , and in his spare time stages bull fights and prize fights for charity , and plays a leading role in Mexico City 's frenetic night life . But he maintains are apartment in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most fashionable and expensive sections of New York , and dreams of a comeback in the New York arena . On a visit recently to the scene of his greatest exploits , Mr. Rosoff gave the following formula for success : " A young man should n't look at the failures , and he must fear no man , no matter how big . And he must work . Sitting around is no good . " Or , as Horatio Alger put it , more succinctly , in one of his titles : Strive and Succeed . THE END
