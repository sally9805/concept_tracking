What You Can Believe About MVA By WESLEY PRICE HERE once were snakes in the Missouri Valley that gobbled like turkeys  --  or so explorers - Lewis and Clark were told in the year 1805 . They wasted no time checking the story . A more astonishing phenomenon confronted them  --  the rambunctious , mud-thickened Missouri River itself . In those days , 140 years ago , the Missouri was wilder than wild horses . It still is . In seasons of flood , the Missouri chews up factories and swallows farms whole . Everything swirls away  --  barns , houses , cattle , the fertile soil itself . Every five minutes the Missouri carries off the topsoil equivalent of a 100-acre farm when the river is in high flood . Every year 100,000,000 tons of good earth go down the river . That is n't dirt . That 's meat , bread , wool overcoats , leather shoes  --  everything grown to eat and wear . In dry years the river leaves the Great Plains to smother in dust . Corn withers . Livestock perishes . Thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 30 's , 300,000 persons fled the parched plains . Misery in the Dust Bowl cost Government agencies $1,246,000,000 in relief and emergency funds . Of this immense sum , little went to effect a permanent cure . If it had been spent for reservoirs , levees and soil conservation , the Missouri Valley today would be almost proof against floods and droughts . As bonuses , the tall dams would he generating hydroelectric power and feeding water into deep channels for river navigation . Men of the Missouri call their river a national problem , since all navigable streams are the concern of the Federal Government . Besides , they must look to the United States Treasury for money to build the dams . Yet the cry of state rights is raised whenever Federal action seems to threaten private water interests , and the river becomes a strictly local issue if voices are heard from seaboard states , offering counsel about the spending .

If it is guarded by expensive dams , the rest of the country will benefit too . And help finance the dams , too , in Federal taxes . Plenty of outsiders , so-called , are dipping oars into the muddy question of the Missouri . Some , like the national labor unions , exhort the Congress to create a Missouri Valley Authority . That would fix everything , they say ; we 'd never have another care . Many others , like the electric-power industry , echo irrigation farmers ' groans that a Missouri Valley Authority would rob us of our britches and our liberty . Leave the floods to the Army 's Corps of Engineers , they advise , and the droughts to the Bureau of Reclamation . Both are dam builders from away back . The violent disagreement stems from the fact that valley authorities  --  and many are proposed besides MVA  --  are Government agencies of extreme complexity . In theory , a valley authority is utterly simple . You start with a river basin , an evident unit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sensitive to plow furrows . Grass and trees , or their lack , affect the severity of the basin 's floods and droughts . It obviously needs unified control of its natural resources . A neat solution is to set up a new Government agency , tailor-made for the region  --  a valley authority . Complications arise when the powers and duties of a valley authority are defined . In the first place , a valley authority would be a Government corporation . Government corporations have been multiplying since the first World War , until we now have more than 100 of them . They can not be controlled directly by the people whose lives they affect . Control is indirect , through the power of Congress to suppress them entirely or rewrite their charters . If a corporate MVA were created by Congress , its duties would include flood control for the Missouri Valley , reclamation of public lands , irrigation projects and the promotion of navigation . That is only a beginning . As envisaged in proposed legislation , a Missouri Valley Authority would : Encourage agriculture based on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holdings to 160 acres ; provide low-cost fertilizer ; conserve water , soil , mineral and forest resources ; protect wild game ; generate hydroelectric power ; buy or build steam-electric plants and transmission lines . And develop recreation facilities ; plan for the disposal of war and defense factories to encourage industrial and business expansion ; foster interstate commerce ; strengthen the national defense and restore the declining water table . Finally , the proposed Missouri Valley Authority would give due regard in its planning to " such economic , social and cultural values " as might be affected by its own activities . That is n't the lot . But it 's enough to show how a simple idea  --  fitting a flood-drought-control agency to an afflicted valley  --  can evolve into an intricate plan to raise the standard of living in a whole region . Alongside unbounded hopes for an MVA 's benevolence are fears that it might become malignant . The hopes and fears are being fanned by veteran propagandists on both sides of the Missouri Valley question . Some of these public-opinion commandos are seasoned by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have little more than temporary office space , a stack of leaflets and a worrisome bill from the printer . There is a Friends of the Missouri Valley , backed by outlanders . Sarcastic Middle Westerners have offered to organize a Friends of the Connecticut Valley in retaliation . There are close to 100 leagues and institutes , committees , unions and impressively named associations fighting for or against a Missouri Valley Authority . There has been nothing quite like this since " ? I the great issues of prohibition and woman 's suffrage were hammered out . In those battles , too , there were uncounted leagues , committees and associations . When many propaganda flags snap in the breeze , Americans can take warning : somewhere the big wind of social change is blowing . Old-line Federal agencies are bending to the pressure for unified development of our natural resources by watersheds and regions , river systems and valleys . Unfortunately , they are organized by functions , instead of regions . Separate Federal agencies deal independently with our soil , our forests , our minerals and rivers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is the organization chart of the Federal Government too awkward for regional planning ? Does the Missouri Valley need an authority in the image of TVA ? All up and down the Missouri ( Continned on Page 24 ) June , 1943 . The valley , and the rest of the country , is in the throes of deciding who will control these floods , how , and for what subsidiary purposes . ( Continued front Page 22 ) River I heard pat answers to these questions . I got pat answers in the Tennessee Valley , too ; and in Washington and New York . If the question were as simple as milk for babies , the pat answer might do . MVA is n't simple . It prefigures a full set of authorities for the entire nation . If authorities take over planning and management of our natural resources , the executive branch of the United States Government is in for a major overhaul . Great chunks would be torn from the Department of Agriculture . The entire Department of the Interior might be razed  --  Bureau of Reclamation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mines  --  and a historic mass of law and judicial interpretation would become obsolete . Good , perhaps , or bad , but not simple . So far , the only authority in action is the Tennessee Valley Authority , created in 1933 . By direction of Congress , TVA has built a chain of huge multiple-purpose dams which subdue floods in the Tennessee River , make an inland waterway 650 miles long , and generate torrents of electricity . During the war , TVA power boosted aluminum production and sparked the atom-bomb factory at Oak Ridge , Tennessee . TVA also manufactures fertilizer under its charter , controls malaria , plants trees , inhibits soil erosion , does industrial research and builds parks . Almost everything that impinges on the well-being of the Tennessee Valley concerns TVA . To carry this work load , TVA has been granted unusual freedom . Laws which bind old-style Federal agencies have been loosened . TVA is not obliged , for instance , to let contracts when it builds a dam . TVA can do the building itself , and does . Nor must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engineer or firing a bad one . TVA hires and fires like a private corporation . So would an MVA . " Seven Li t t le TVA 's " HE authority system has been getting results in I the Tennessee Valley . In the seven states under TVA 's wing one hears happy chirping about barren farmland restored to green health , cheap electric power and cheap water transportation , new industries aiding regional prosperity . The first move to reproduce TVA came in 1937 , when President Roosevelt recommended to Congress creation of seven authorities , blanketing the nation . Public opinion was quickly frozen against the " Seven Little TVA 's , " and Roosevelt let the idea drop . In the years since , there has been a thaw , releasing a freshet of new authority bills in Congress . There is a Missouri Valley Authority bill , a Savannah Authority bill , another for the Ohio Valley , another for the Columbia , all introduced separately . Rep. John E. Rankin , of Mississippi , has outdone his colleagues with a bill proposing a national network @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are several alternatives to the independent authority system . Most likely rival is a confederation of the Army Corps of Engineers  --  navigation , flood control  --  the Bureau of Reclamation  --  irrigation  --  the Department of Agriculture  --  land use , soil conservation , and so on  --  and the Federal Power Commission plus representatives of all states concerned . Such a confederation is active now in the Missouri Valley as the Missouri Basin Inter-Agency Committee . It has a plan for harnessing the river . Congress has approved the plan and authorized an initial $400,000,000 , not yet appropriated . Nevertheless , MVA enthusiasts press on . They contend that this committee of agency chiefs , Army officers and state governors is unwieldy and much less efficient than TVA-style management . Anti-authority rebuttal questions the efficiency of authorities and the price to be paid for it . In the sweeping provisions of the MVA bill there is seen a loss of political and economic freedom . If authorities bestride the nation , it is said , the forty-eight states will founder ; we 'll have seven or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities , and somewhere in all of them the needle gets stuck on " superstate , superstate , superstate . " Parallels are drawn between valley authorities and foreign dictatorships . Stress is laid on the area over which an MVA would preside , truly enormous . The Missouri River Valley is larger than France , Italy and Spain combined . It includes parts of Minnesota , Iowa , Colorado and half of Kansas ; most of Montana , Wyoming , Missouri and the Dakotas , and all of Nebraska . This is an empire , and a rich one . ' Millions of sheep , cows , hogs and horses are raised here . It produces half of the nation 's breadstuffs , a third of our wool . Despite drought , despite floods and neglect of the soil , the basin 's 200,000,000 acres of crop and grazing land are among the.best we have . There is other wealth in the valley  --  timber , oil , copper , iron , zinc , manganese . In the upper end , 6'i per cent of the United States lignite and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's largest deposits of phosphate rock . The Pick Plan B UT the valley has troubles . Raw-material production overbalances processing and manufacture . Leather , wool and ores are shipped East to be made into shoes , cloth and metals . The valley 's finest crop follows  --  ambitious youngsters , seeking opportunities in industry outside the basin . Population of the Missouri Valley states has been slipping for twenty years , and the rate is quickening . Between 1940 and 1943 , 10 per cent of the valley 's people were sucked away by war factories . After the droughts of the 30 's , the Bureau of Reclamation began elaborate studies , looking toward one big plan for the Missouri River and all its tributaries . Every water possibility was examined  --  irrigation for arid lands , flood control for the lower valley , and what about migrating ducks ? The work dragged ; the plan was n't in shape to release for five years . The Missouri River would n't wait . In 1941 it flooded in its lower reaches . It flooded again in 1942 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories were swamped , thousands of tons of foodstuffs were destroyed and 2,250,000 acres were covered with brown water . Drenched and indignant , the people of the lower valley demanded action from Washington . Congress directed the Army 's Corps of Engineers to study the flood problem . The job was given to the Army 's division engineer at Omaha ; at that time Col. Lewis A. Pick , who has since become a major general , famed for building the Ledo Road into China . Pick studied data from previous Army surveys , embellished them , and submitted his report in less than three months . The Pick plan called for levees on both sides of the main stem of the Missouri from Sioux City to the mouth and twenty-two reservoirs . Ten of the dams , in the Missouri-Kansas area , had been authorized previously by Congress ; the war had prevented construction . To these , Pick added five darns on the main stem above Sioux City , five on the tributaries of the Republican River in Nebraska , one on the Yellowstone in Montana , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked for flood control . The Pick plan went further . It suggested multiple-purpose dams to provide navigation as well as flood control , and irrigation and hydroelectric power . Pick toured the valley , talking it up . An outstanding engineer , he is also a great handshaker , sanguine and persuasive . Boosters in the lower , eastern end of the valley quickly got behind his plan to shove it through Congress . The upper , western end of the valley was not satisfied with Pick 's cheery nod to irrigation . In the arid plains of Wyoming , and Montana , they put their trust in the Bureau of Reclamation . Suspicions of the Western irrigationists were inflamed when they discovered another bill in committee , besides the Pick plan . This one proposed deepening the six-foot navigation channel to nine feet from Sioux City down . Political leaders in the irrigation states roared like wounded tigers . The deep channel would call for more water downstream , they said , and vital irrigation projects would be drained dry . To prove it , they produced Reclamation statistics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figures , showing that there was plenty of water for everybody . Pro-Army senators were disputing with anti-Army state governors when the Bureau of Reclamation finally came through with its long-delayed plan This document was ( Continued on Page 124 ) WHAT YOU CAN BELIEVE ABOUT MVA 4f : Oil iirlAterl from Page 21 ) shaped by an assistant regional director , W. G. Sloan , of Billings , Montana , and became known as the Sloan plan . The Sloan plan called for ninety dams , compared to the Pick plan 's twenty-two . It proposed spending $1,257,700,000 ? almost twice the Army 's estimated $661,000,000 . The Army 's Pick plan was vague about irrigation , the amount of hydroelectric power to be generated and the possible revenues . The Sloan plan gave figures : seventeen power plants generating almost 4,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours of farm power annually , besides seasonal power for pumping water irrigation for 4,760,400 new acres , and supplemental water for 538,000 acres now inadequately supplied . The Pick plan , put together swiftly , gave no estimate of benefits , except that property worth $1,000,000,000 would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of research behind it , bristled with dollar signs . Annual benefits from irrigation , power and other improvements were totted up at $168,306,000 . Annual costs , in Reclamation figures , would be $65,413,000 . Benefits would exceed costs , therefore , 2.57 to 1 ; and that included amortization of the cost of the entire project over fifty years at 3 per cent . Before the Sloan plan came out , the Army engineers were being asked for more details . The Federal Power Commission said hydroelectric power possibilities should be studied in detail ; it needed a survey . Cost , $200,000 . The Department of Agriculture pointed out that the Pick plan could hardly be called complete without a program to prevent soil erosion and silting . Agriculture did n't have a program adequate for the entire basin , but it could be undertaken . Cost of execution , $350,000,000 . The Pick plan would permit Reclamation to build tributary dams , but it insisted that all main-stem dams must be built and operated by the Corps of Engineers . The Reclamation Bureau noted stiffly that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boulder , Grand Coulee and Shasta , the biggest in the world , Army engineers took the position that blank pages in the Pick plan , far from warranting criticism , were an advantage , The plan was flexible , easy to modify , a framework into which details could be fitted as time and research went on . Trouble was , the Army did n't want its plan modified by reclamationists . Upper valley leaders insisted on amending Army flood-control and navigation bills to guarantee irrigation first call on the water . The Army resisted . Such a rule , it was said , would make administration of navigation almost impossible . The dispute became heated . The National Reclamation Association took up the cudgels for irrigation , state rights and the Bureau of Reclamation . The Mississippi Valley Association fronted for navigation interests , flood control and the Corps of Engineers . After a time , partisans came to realize that here was a battle both sides could lose . Urgent pleas for a compromise poured into Washington from state governors and civic leaders . Sen. John H. Overton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the Army engineers all the best of it . But even he , franldy biased , lost patience . " I think we ought to have one boss for the whole project ! " he exclaimed . The same thought had occurred to others . The St. Louis Post-Dispatch , which had been supporting the Pick plan , came out with a full-page editorial calling for a Missouri Valley Authority . " The Missouri , " said the P-D , " is One Big River With One Big Problem . " The MVA editorial was published in May , 1944 . Some farm and labor groups rumbled approval . Factionists sensed the coming storm , and redoubled efforts to get Reclamation and Army engineers together . It was later than they knew ; in August a bill to create a Missouri Valley Authority was introduced by Sen. James E. Murray , of Montana . Then President Roosevelt recommended an MVA in a special message ; time seemed ripe . The threat of an authority abruptly cooled the **28;2462;TOOLONG quarrel . Reclamation and Army engineers met in October and announced agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , and divide the Missouri Valley between them . The following month , compromises were written into the Flood Control Act and the Rivers and Harbors Act , and passed by Congress . The Army had its nine-foot channel authorized . Rec* * * * * * * * * * KICKBACK : It 's not his ability to kick , but his ability to pull , that makes the mule such a valuable animal . ? 101115 * * * * * * * * * * lamationists got a special proviso putting irrigation first , navigation last , in use of water arising west of the 98th meridian . But these were details . The important fact was that the Missouri Valley had a big plan , written into law . Its sponsors hoped that the authority idea would now expire for lack of nourishment . And so it might have , if the contenders had settled their differences quietly , eight months sooner . The bickering had obscured merits of the Pick and Sloan plans , called attention to defects , and left an impression that some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better job for the valley . Instead of withering , the MVA idea shot out new leaves . Roosevelt , signing the legislation in which the Missouri compromise was embedded , frowned that it was " not to be interpreted as jeopardizing in any way the creation of a Missouri Valley Authority . " Senator Murray daubed a new coat of paint on his MVA bill , and reintroduced it in February , 1945 . MVA committees flourished in St. Louis , Omaha , Kansas City , Denver . MVA leaflets spilled from the presses . Pro-MVA editorials and news stories multiplied in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch and the St. Louis Star-Times- Labor got behind the MVA . Philip Murray , president of the CIO , appointed a national committee to support the Murray bill . The Missouri State Industrial Council , CIO , asked Congress for an MVA , claiming to speak for 200,000 unionists in the valley . The American Federation of Labor , with 1,000,000 members in the area , advocated an authority at its national convention . William Green called attention to the AFL 's longstanding endorsement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Co-operative Union of America  --  Farmers Union  --  supported an MVA with a hard-hitting publicity campaign . The independent Missouri Farmers Association asked for an MVA , denouncing the Army engineers in strong terms . These were the big wheels . Meshed with them were church , veterans ' and liberal political organizations ; some small businessmen , a few big ones , and a number of civic-minded intellectuals . The labor-farm-liberal coalition has weight and power , but the opposition is even stronger . Farm Bureau organizations and stockmen are anti-MVA . So are most of the governors and legislators in the basin , and most of the newspapers . Irrigation and navigation blocs , enemies before the Pick-Sloan compromise , now present a united front against a Missouri Valley Authority . Special interests are swinging punches , led by the contractors , barge-line operators and the nationally organized private power industry . Their associations adopt fiery resolutions , inspire other groups to do likewise , and produce crowds of witnesses for congressional committee hearings . Senator Murray 's second bill to create a Missouri Valley Authority ( S. 555 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year . A hostile subcommittee of the Committee on Commerce got first crack at it last spring . An Irrigation and Reclamation subcommittee , equally hostile , swung on S. 555 last fall and batted it to the Committee on Agriculture . The pro-authority coalition refuses to admit defeat . They are prepared to lob new MVA bills into Congress year after year . The late Sen. George W. Norris did just that for TVA , until opposition crumpled . Sheer persistence might clear the way for authorities all over the country , unless the authority idea were somehow blown to bits , once and for all . Anti-authority forces believe they have the dynamite : the charge that authorities are superstates , that they would clamp the steel hand of dictatorship on our national life . Proponents scoff at the superstate propaganda , and point to TVA . In seven TVA states , seven governors publicly affirm that freedom reigns , God bless America and the Tennessee Valley Authority . The opposition hints darkly that the governors speak under compulsion ; or , sure they 're happy , they rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illusory , because TVA Chairman David E. Lilienthal is too foxy to exert all his despotic powers . Possibilities for coercion can be read into the TVA Act , but they do n't emerge . TVA directors know well that they can be fired without ado , and TVA lacks the force essential to a superstate . It has no secret police , no private army , no courts of its own . It is the creature of Congress , which has amended the TVA Act five times . On its face , the authority system promises more democracy instead of less , because authority headquarters are in the home valley , instead of far-off Washington . Citizens who like to go gunning for bureaucrats can easily pot the ruffed authority species from their doorsteps . The long-tailed Washington bureaucrat is out of range . Federal manipulation of natural resources is directed from Washington by dozens of separate bureaus . They act ( Continued net Page 126 ) ( Continued from Page 124 ) under separate statutes , and beseech separate congressional committees for separate appropriations ; and the separate committees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ functions . Washington bureau chiefs , burdened wish forty-eight state duties , refer questions to their local men in the field . The fieldmen refer important decisions back to the policy makers in Washington . " Fieldmen can recommend , and they do , " says Glenn J. Talbott , president of the North Dakota Farmers Union . " They send papers into Washington ; they telephone , and sometimes they get on an eastbound train . But they never decide . " An authority would make high policy decisions in , say , Omaha , instead of Washington . It would supplant a multiplicity of Federal agencies or unify their efforts in the region . One agency , the MVA , would have one plan to control the water and promote agriculture and industry in one river basin , and there would be only one budget to justify to Congress . The CIO asserts that an MVA would make 100,000 jobs in construction of dams and related works , and 50,000 jobs lasting five years in manufacture of electrical appliances for homes and farms . It makes a case for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darns will make jobs , too  --  quite as many as an MVA . The emphasis given to huge multiple-purpose dams by the various Missouri-basin planners appalls soil conservationists . In their view , floods are mere symptoms of the valley 's real illness , soil erosion . Loosened by careless farming and overgrazing , the good earth is being washed into the rivers and out to sea at a frightening rate . Each year the land is a little sicker , a little bonier . It ca n't be cured by massive doses of concrete poured into main-stern dams . It needs careful doctoring to slow the water runoff and pin down the topsoil  --  terracing , contour plowing , new grass and trees , hundreds of thousands of farm ponds , and countless little dame in little brooks . Unless conservationists are brought to the front by regional planners , the entire basin may someday be stripped of its topsoil . It is feared that the big dams will be silted solid in about fifty years , at the present rate of erosion , although TVA studies indicate their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fabulous . breadbasket becomes a wasteland through faulty planning , the quarrels of today ' s special-interest groups will seem petty indeed . The Bureau of Reclamation , solemnly sprinkling arid upcountry acreage , will look ridiculous if the country 's richest valley lands slip away behind its back . It wo n't matter whether the Army 's na v - igab le channel is nine feet deep or nine hundred , if the denuded land produces nothing to load on the boats . The promises of MVA would n't matter either . Electric power ca n't be sold to abandoned farms , no matter how low the rates ; nor can an authority bring " cultural values " to an area inhabited by jack rabbits . None of the plans for the Missouri Valley gives soil conservation a place comparable to that given flood control , navigation , power or irrigation . The Murray bill gives conservation enough mention to ensure authority control , and it is assumed that an MVA would emulate TVA 's admirable land policy . The original Reclamation and Army plans skipped lightly over the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agriculture . After merging their plane , the Army engineers and Bureau of Reclamation led in forming the Missouri Basin Inter-Agency Committee . The Department of Agriculture was given a seat , to speak for conservation and land-use progra me . This belated recognition is regarded as inadequate in some quarters , notably by the Missouri Farmers Association . With 95,000 members , the association is fighting for an MVA , believing that an authority will do more for their acres than a setup in which Conservation is junior to the Army engineers . For more than a century the Army engineers have been toiling on our navigable rivers , deepening channels , rajaing levees and controlling floods . If an onset of authorities banishes them from river work , as it might , West Point would lose its best postgraduate training field , and the nation would mislay an unequaled body of experience . The Corps of Engineers knows more about the rivers of America than any other agency of Government . Sensitive to criticism , it has long struck an attitude : let no dogs bark at the Engineers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yelps are coming from the Missouri Farmers . The association is flatly opposed to the legislation which affirms Army control of the lower Missouri River . The farmers charge that Army plans will ruin one acre of good land for every acre protected , and that the Army has botched flood control in favor of navigation . Twenty years ago a general rain raised the level of the Missouri a few inches . Today the same rainfall raises it two to four feet . Farmers blame the increased flood menace on revetments and pilings , put in by the corps to narrow the channel for navigation . The Army proposes levees all the way down from Sioux City . From Kansas City down , the levees would be set far back , enclosing a mile-wide strip of rich land . Up where the valley is broad , many farmers are pro-levee . From Boonville down , a 200-mile stretch , farmers are opposed ; the levees would shut off half the bottoms , which are only two miles wide . Projected Army reservoirs will cover 900,000 acres of fertile land , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced from their homes to make way for the waters . State Auditor Forrest Smith says fourteen counties will be financially ruined . The acreage doomed to inundation is worth $18,000,000 annually in farm income , by association figures , more than twice the average annual loss from flood damage . Floods are cheaper , the Missouri farmers argue , than Army schemes for controlling them . These accusations against the Army engineers are also made against the Tennessee Valley Authority by antiMVA propagandists . Friends of the Army have indignantly accused TVA of flooding good land , uprooting families and spending more to cure floods than the floods cost . It now appears that water behind an Army dam is just as wet as water behind an authority dam . And no matter who builds the darn , or where , somebody is bound to get hurt . Army calculations minimize the predicted crop loss . Much land taken for reservoirs is rarely flooded . In ordinary years it is leased back to farmers . As for the acreage inside the levees , some of it would n't be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by stabilizing the channel and halting bank erosion and cutoffs . And 1,800,000 acres once subject to floods will be permanently protected . Solemn promise . Missouri farmers believe that some big dams could be dispensed with , some reservoirs made smaller , if flood control started in the creek forks with reforestation , contouring , terracing and small dame . It is more than likely that an authority would build the very dams and levees proposed by the Army , in the same places . The Missouri Farmers Association hopes not . " Whatever an MVA does , it ca n't be worse than the Army , " says H. E. Klinefelter , editor of the Missouri Farmer . " Besides , MVA would give us more electricity . " All will not be lost , conservation-wise , without an MVA . The farmers themselves , at popular elections , already have organized more than 220 soil-conservation districts , including some 300,000 farms , in the Missouri Valley . However , the actual conservation work goes slowly , Really to nail down all the farm rangeland in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going . That 's the estimate of Hugh H. Bennett , chief of the United States Soil Conservation Service . Bennett believes in unified treatment of watersheds , but he thinks unity can be achieved by good liaison work between existing agencies . His criticism of the MVA proposal is , simply , that it would duplicate existing programs , now in the hands of experienced men . TVA has long been striking the toesM of doom about soil erosion . Bennett hits the gong even harder . Somberly , he counts the acres on which our American civilization rests : 50,000,000 acres of once-fertile cropland now gullied and destroyed ; 100,000,000 acres of cropland seriously damaged , with half the topsoil gone ; another 100,000,000 visibly slipping . There remain only 460,000,000 acres of really good cropland , our national capital . All of it is subject to erosion , save 78,000,000 acres . " We could n't live on seventy-eight million acres , " says Bennett . " We would cease to be a vigorous nation . " The United States ca n't be regarded as a permanent country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like opulent Babylon , we , too , can vanish in the debris of a raddled soil . There are ominous signs . Because the rains hurry off ill-treated acreage without soaking in , there is an alarming drop in the water table . Springs and ponds are drying up all over the Missouri Valley . Old wells that once tapped water close to the surface are being deepened , ten feet in Kansas and Missouri , thirty feet in some parts of Iowa . Erosion is costing farmers at least $400,000,000 in direct losses every year . It is n't as spectacular as flood damage , but it 's much more expensive . Bennett puts the total annual bill of direct and indirect losses to the nation at $3,844,000,000 . The Farmers Union claims that an MVA would boom industry , wages and salaries , and quotes comparative statistics . In the TVA area , says the Union , the value of manufactured products increased 5 per cent between 1929 and 1939 , while the Missouri Valley states were showing a 30 per cent loss . The figures imply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would astonish the steelmakers of Pittsburgh . Besides , the union 's " TVA area " includes North Carolina and Virginia , none of whose industries are served by TVA . In the area it actually serves , cheap TVA power has contributed heavily to industrial expansion . But the contribution of self-starting private enterprise has not been small . Five of the dams in the TVA power network , for example , are owned by the Aluminum Company of America . An authority should improve the industrial climate in the Missouri Valley , but so should the Missouri Basin Inter-Agency Committee , properly administered . In any case , the Missouri Valley , thirteen times as large as the Tennessee , ca n't expect thirteen times as much hydroelectric power . It may get , in new installations , only hall as much as TVA . Rainfall and terrain make the Tennessee Valley a natural for power dams . The Missouri basin is not so well favored . TVA generated about 12,000,000,000 kilowatt-hours in fiscal 1945 . The Federal Power Commission estimates a 10,000,000,000 kw-h. potential for the Missouri basin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This may not be enough electricity to give the Missouri Valley an industrial boom , but it is more than enough to alarm the private power industry . The utilities are pushing their views with a vigor unknown since the days when utility propaganda was being planted in school textbooks . That practice died out in 1933 , with its originator , the discredited National Electric Light Association . Popular disapproval of ( Continued on Poke 128 ) ( Continued from Page 125 ) N.E.L.A. tactics was shared by many utility executives . For twelve yearsafter the demise of N.E.L.A. , the industry 's public relations lay moribund . Last summer a new organization was formed  --  the National Association of Electric Companies  --  to fend off Government power projects such as MVA . N.A.E.C. demands that the purposes of Government dams  --  flood control , irrigation , navigation or power  --  be clearly defined in the authorizing legislation . Private utilities have long complained that a phrase such as " for navigation , flood control and other purposes " is a tricky device for hanging a big power project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They say it is necessary because the Founding Fathers had never heard of hydroelectric power , and so neglected to reserve it in the Constitution . A Government dam built " for power and other purposes " would be a target for utility lawsuits . The effort to impede Government generation of power is mere skirmishing compared to the strife over who gets the Government electricity , once it is produced . The private utilities want to buy it at the dam site , wholesale , feed it into their transmission lines and sell it at retail . TVA built its own transmission lines and bought out existing networks . It can sell power to anyone , often sells to private utilities , and buys from them too . But TVA must give preference , under the acts to public and nonprofit agencies , such as municipally owned distribution systems , co-operatives , states and counties . The Bureau of Reclamation , like TVA , must give preference in power sales to municipalities and public bodies , under laws in effect since 1906 . Unlike TVA , Reclamation frequently sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utilities . The power industry naturally favors Reclamation . If the Missouri Valley must be dammed , the utilities prefer to see it done by an Army-Reclamation team , not an MVA . Under the Murray bill , MVA could run lines to villages or isolated farms any time the authority decided they were paying too much for private power or getting inadequate service . A coarse interpretation of " inadequate service " or remorseless judgments of retail rates would permit an MVA to parallel every private power line from Cut Bank , Montana , to St. Louis , Missouri . Such a policy would , of course , strangle private power in the Missouri Valley . Already the Government is producing 20 per cent of the nation 's power , and planning to produce more . If authorities cover the forty-eight states , it is likely that Government would have a monopoly on electric generation and the private power industry would no longer exist . If the American people want to place the generation of power in Government hands , it is their right to order that this be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should understand the issue clearly There can be no sidestepping of this ultimate meaning of the move to blanket the country with TVA 's . If carried out , it means the nationalization of electric power . It means , also , we shall be taking one step toward the socialization of American industry  --  a solid fact not to be confused with " socialist-plot " propaganda . The utilities ' liking for the Bureau of Reclamation is no hot passion . They object to Reclamation 's intention , under the Sloan plan , to crisscross the Missouri Valley with a grid of power-transmission lines . Sen. Josiah W. Bailey , of North Carolina , veteran defender of the private power business , tried to knock the Reclamation grid out of the 1944 legislation . He offered an amendment stipulating that all power generated at flood-control projects must be sold at the dams ; that the Government must not build transmission lines unless three years passed with no buyers in sight . Power dams are often far from markets . Long t ransm ission links are expensive . Small users , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big companies can . Thus the Bailey amendment would have given private utilities a virtual monopoly on Government power . The Bailey amendment was defeated in the Senate . The utilities still sizzle in the Reclamation grid , but quietly ; the MVA tire looks hotter . In their calmer moments utility spokesmen call attention to advantages of co-operation between Government and private power systems . The alternation of wet and dry seasons makes the output of hydroelectric dams erratic . The power flow can be firmed by cutting in steam plants  --  and private companies have the steam in plenty . They have , besides , big markets already wired and able to absorb the surges of Government juice- Private-power men hasten to add that any savings resulting from purchase of cheap Government electricity should he passed along to the ultimate consumer in tote , under the supervision of state power commissions or other regulatory bodies . The industry subscribes to Government regulation of business in the public interest , but protests , of course , against Government in business . All this sounds eminently reasonable . The truce-making possibilities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to me , " Maybe it would he a good thing to let the utilities buy power from the damn dams , They 'd quit squawking then , and let us have our authority . " Vain hope . Senator Murray knows that his Missouri Valley authority would be no authority at all without its own electric power , and the utilities know he knows it . They would n't even ask for a parley . Cheap and plentiful power is held out as a major inducement by MVA propagandists . If MVA sold power at TVA rates , they say , the people of the Missouri Valley would save more than $100,000,000 a year on their electric bill . But there is disagreement over the Missouri Valley 's power needs . Private companies report that their installed capacity in the area can generate more power than the market can take . Army engineers strung along with utility opinion at first . They intended to omit complete power units from Pick-plan dams " until the power market in the Missouri basin fully warrants their installation . " Sitting alongside a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their views . Now they are ready to follow FPC recommendations to take all the power the dams can give . The Bureau of Reclamation will cut in generators as quickly as possible . " Power-market studies throughout the basin have shown that markets will be available as fast as firm power is produced , " the bureau reports , " assuming that a reasonable length of time is required to place all the plants in operation . " This statement is conservative enough , since the construction of all the dams and the accumulation of all the water to fill them will take about twenty years . The cheap-power promise by authority campaigners ? " Look at TVA ! " ? has caused the private utilities to exhume accusations against TVA which were autopsied in 1938 by a **28;2492;TOOLONG investigation , and decently interred . It was said then , and is being repeated now , that TVA is a financial phony . It is alleged , for example , that TVA inflates bookkeeping charges against navigation and flood control , to minimize the true cost of producing power from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused of allocating only 40 per cent to power . The facts : TVA is now allocating 59.7 per cent of the entire investment to power , and allocated as high as 75 per cent during the wartime power boom . Commonest complaint is that TVA pays no taxes or interest charges on its capital funds , as electric companies must . Sometimes it is admitted that TVA pays something in lieu of taxes to states and counties , but these payments are described as mere tokens . The facts : TVA pays no taxes whatever to the Federal Government . TVA does make payments in lieu of taxes to counties and states ? $2,137,484 in the fiscal year 1945 , a " token " that exceeded by 55 per cent previous taxes on the power and reservoir properties , TVA pays interest at 1 to 2 - , , te2 ' per cent on $61,000,000 of bonds sold to the Treasury and RFC . TVA pays no interest on $668,000,000 appropriated for it by Congress  --  for all purposes : navigation , flood control , power , chemical production and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-invested in plant . TVA says all its income , not a fraction called " taxes " or " interest , " is Government property . Some utility propagandists try to make TVA look bad on its rate making by smuggling into the power-investment base $350,000,000 that TVA has invested in navigation and flood-control facilities , in chemical factories , general plant and unfinished construction . On this artificially swollen sum they proceed to figure interest at 6 per cent , which is more than twice the going interest rate on new utility-bond issues . The false balance sheet falsely indicates that TVA is in the red , deep . TVA propagandists put their best foot forward with reckonings which are true separately , according to TVA financial statements , but untrue when lumped together by confused well wishers . Here are three : 1 . TVA net income for 1945 , plus interest paid on outstanding bonds , represents a return of 4.8 per cent on the average net power investment . 2 . TVA net income , accruing wholly to the Federal Government , plus " in lieu " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 52.6 per cent tax on TVA 's operating revenues . ' : 3 . If TVA 's power investment were wholly financed by a public bond issue , instead of Government appropriations , TVA could maintain the properties , set aside reserves , pay 2 per cent interest and liquidate the bonds in sixty years . TVA could pay a 52.6 per cent tax , j or liquidate a bond issue , or pay 4.8 per ? cent interest  --  in a good year  --  but it has never claimed that it could do all three , or even two of these things simultaneously . Private utilities pay taxes equal to 23.8 per cent of revenues , on the average Stock dividends and older bond issues run their average finance charges up to 5 per cent , This 5 per cent is a profit , and the real point of collision between fanatics on both sides of the public-power question . Leftists hint that there is something mysteriously nasty about utility profits . Reactionaries imply that it is somehow immoral for the Government to develop natural resources , which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yet utilities can complain that TVA rates are not accurate yardsticks for measuring private utility rates , since TVA rate ( Continued on Pogo MO ) ( Confining from Pogo 128 ) making is largely based on GOvernment financing . It is popularly supposed that TVA rates are yardstick rates . Public-power advocates have been saying so for years . Chairman Lilienthal refers to TVA 's " yardstick rates " in his book , TVA  --  Democracyon the March , but he uses a qualifying phrase . " The yard-stick in its correct sense " William C. Fitts , Jr. , former general counsel for TVA , denies that TVA has ever claimed its rates were really yardsticks for measuring utility rates . " No such representation has ever been made ( by TVA ) , " Mr. Fitts writes in the Public Utilities Fortnightly . " On the contrary , it has been repeatedly pointed out that differences ( in costs ) do exist , and that allowances for those differences should be made in any attempt at rate comparison . " The yardstick debate is confused because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate at which TVA sells electric power to distributors  --  municipalities and the like . The other yardstick is the retail rate at which these distributors sell to the consuming public . TVA 's free Government financing does n't affect the finances or rate making of its retailers , except as it helps TVA to sell wholesale at a low price . TVA 's wholesale rate averages three and one half mills per kilowatt-hour , exactly the rate charged by Niagara Falls Power Company , a private utility paying full capital charges and taxes . Congressional investigators concluded seven years ago TVA was n't underselling the private power market by more than a mill or two , if at all . Generation of power for wholesale marketing yields comparatively small returns . The profitable end of the business is in transmission and retail sale . If there is a yardstick , it is a retail yardstick , and TVA 's financial structure is irrelevant . At retail the pertinent costs are those of TVA distributing agencies . TVA 's customers , mostly co-operatives and municipals , are exempt from Federal taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like TVA , make " in lieu " tax payments to local governments . The big difference is in financing . Where TVA got most of its money from the Treasury , the local retailers got most of theirs from the sale of revenue bonds in the market . Less than 10 per cent came from Federal grants . Yardstick or not , TVA claims some credit for the fact that private power is now sold , on the national average , more than a third cheaper than in pre-TVA days . The rate cutting was not all TVA 's doing by any means . There were other factors , marking what might be called the beginning of the true electrical age  --  installation by private industry of superefficient generating plants , a persistent sales-promotion campaign and a flood of cheap electrical appliances . TVA did prove spectacularly what progressives in the industry had long argued  --  that low prices send power sales and profits soaring . When the average United States rate was 5.52 cents per kilowatt-hour in 1933 , the average customer bought only 600 kw-h a year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rate nationally averages 3.47 cents per kw-h , the average customer burns 1186 kilowatt-hours , and the country is yelling for electric stoves , electric toasters and electric blankets . TVA distributors sell to householders at an average of 1.85 cents per kw-b , and the customers do everything with electricity except eat it , At TVA 's back door are the Alabama Power Company and the Georgia Power Company . They cried ruin when TVA set impossible rates a decade ago . Today these companies are flourishing despite taxes , interest payments and a rate schedule almost as low as TVA 's . Volume is way up , of course . On the MVA propaganda machine , soil-conservation goes roun d and round , and comes out music . Authority enemies could steal the issue and make a loud noise with it . But they do n't . Instead , they give scratchy playbacks of anti-TVA propaganda that an MVA would have great powers , affecting for good or ill the lives of 7,000,000 people living in an area that is one sixth of the United States . Authority that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menacingly when heaped up in one enormous pile as it is in the Murray bill . Top it off with a large measure of financial independence , a relaxation of congressional controls and a proviso that MVA can spread out of the Missouri Valley if its directors see fit . All that is in the Murray bill . It adds up to something tremendous . But it does n't add up to a superstate , " Russian communistic , " as it has been called , I " relentlessly authoritarian . . . sinister . . . Fascist . . . despotic . " Superstates can defy peoples and legislatures . TVA ca n't , nor could an MVA . If an authority goes bad , Congress can dig it out of its valley much quicker than that big mistake , prohibition , was dug out of the Constitution . The superstate skeleton has been rattled by seven state legislatures in the Missouri Valley in resolutions condemning the Murray bill . Eight of the ten governors are opposed to an MVA , professing fears that their state would atrophy under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Washington , many of whom echo superstate propaganda . Only two are on record as favoring an authority . Civic leaders in Kansas City are opposed to a Missouri Valley Authority ( Con linnet ! on Page 132 ) 132 THE SATIIIIIIINV EVENING POST 16 ( Continued from Page 1.111 ) in frank self-interest . Their long-sought deep channel in the Missouri River is safe at last in the Rivers and Harbors Act . It is noticed that MVA speakers promise much for soil conservation and cheap power , but seldom refer to navigation . In Kansas City they wonder who the directors of an MVA might be , and whether they would allot much money to navigation , which has already cost $300,000,000 , with meager results . The flag is being carried for Kansas City by her famed newspaper , the Star , and her able mayor , John B. Gage . Mayor Gage denounces MVA as a totalitarian socialist plot ( " Of course it would not have the power to create the militia " ) but he is not impressed with attacks on the Government corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good government owes much to its corporate shape . The Star 's interest in a navigable channel dates back a generation . Consequently , it looks on the Army engineers with an ever-fond eye . The Star defended the Pick plan against Western reclamationists and their appeal to state rights . Then it defended the Pick-Sloan compromise against the threat of an MVA . Since 1944 the Star has been smiting the authority idea without mercy . Last summer the newspaper sent a writer to the Tennessee Valley to examine TVA at first hand , the Star being mighty partial to old-fashioned look-see reporting . The writer was not swept off his feet by TVA , but he was favorably impressed , and told why in a series of articles , which the authority-hating Star faithfully published . Presently the uncompromising tone of Star editorials softened . From the concrete TVA experience , one lesson is worth considering in the bills for all river valleys , " said the Star . " The nub of the TVA success is its independent administration within the valley . The three board members are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free from the pulling and hauling and bumbling of bureaus back in Washington . " The Star threw out a suggestion : Let the President appoint a board representing industry , the Army engineers and affected Government bureaus , to carry out programs specifically authorized by Congress ; within limits give the board authority to act , and money to spend at its own discretion . The editorial was evidence of a shift in public opinion . Up the river from the Star is another influential newspaper , the Omaha World-Herald . It is firmly opposed to Murray 's MVA , but it , too , recognizes that regional administration is a strong point in the case for an authority . What the valley probably needs , says the phrase coining World-Herald , is an authority with a small a . There are many thoughtful people in the middle of the Missouri Valley who prefer a middle course . They might buy a small a authority . Meantime , a wait-and-see policy is paying unexpected dividends . An organization which was advertised last summer as bumbling , unwieldy and potentially quarrelsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ critics . Fast working , it already has $250 , - 000,000 worth of projects ready for the bulldozers , as soon as Congress turns loose the money . It has planed down rough spots in the Pick-Sloan plan , and settled question after knotty question without once running to Washington . This incredible harmony is widely attributed to the peacemaking talents of the committee chairman , Brig . Gen. R. C. Crawford . General Crawford is now in Washington as assistant to the Chief of Engineers . Replacing him on the Inter-Agency Committee is Major General Pick  --  Pick of the Ledo road , Pick the dreamer , the engineer , the author of the first plan for the Missouri Valley . He , too , is a peacemaker . Of course , he 'll have help . There 's always that Thing , outside in the dark : MVA . Just standing there , it scares up a lot of action .
