While Special Envoy Saburo Kurusu got ready in Washington to argue the U.S. into letting Japan have her way in the Pacific ( see p. 19 ) , Premier General Hideki Tojo and Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo told the world that Japan meant to have her way anyhow . <P> Japan , said Premier Tojo , expects : <P> 1 ) " Third Powers to refrain from obstructing the successful conclusion of the China affair which Japan has in view . " <P> 2 ) " Countries surrounding our Empire will not only refrain from presenting a direct military menace , but nullify such measures of hostile character as economic blockade and restore normal economic relations with Japan . " <P> Foreign Minister Togo bluntly declared that " there is naturally a limit to our conciliatory attitude . . . . There is no necessity of spending much time on negotiations hereafter . " <P> This tough talk was underlined by the House of Representatives ' approval of a 3,800,000,000 yen ( $874,000,000 ) extraordinary military budget . Thus Japan 's Tojo , Togo and Diet had thrust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were to be abandoned for any reason , would require a fearful loss of face and alibis which would have to be masterpieces of Japanese verbalism . The Japanese were still fooling themselves into believing that the U.S. could be made to back down .
