AUCHJST 22 , 1941.  --  This morning , at the A. grocer 's , somebody said very casually : " After all , we have been defeated ; what we should do now is to follow the Mar5chal . But there are ringleaders who stir the people , and everybody knows who is behind them . " Then , with my most innocent look , I answered , " You should listen to the English radio every day ; it constantly warns us to keep quiet and not to shed blood uselessly . " As if bitten by a snake , stunned by surprise , she remained open-mouthed , speechless . In fact , I had answered her insinuation about those who drive the French into revolt . It freed my mind and I had only spoken the truth . I had come to buy a bottle of wine that must last me ten days ? by German order . It is more than I need , but for those who work in the fields and who are accustomed to another diet , it is not very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : we see starvation coming when the trains loaded with foodstuffs go tip north . Poor Pt twin ! If you knew , or rather if he knew , liow I pity him . The more difficulty Hitler has in Russia , the more exacting his demands will be . How I envy England ! She can fight and give vent to her rage ; she will not be any more ruined than we who give every day four hundred million francs . And what a comfort to be able to act . Well , our t urn will come , perhaps . October 5 . ? The weather is perfect , without any sun or wind , very mild , with everything still in bloom , since no frost has conic yet to wither the flowers . Mlle P. calls on Inc every evening from eight to nine . She is very religious and says we must pray more than ever , that it will turn the scales . When a woman of such sound judgment and of so little emotion speaks with such conviction , you are tempted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it helps you . She has been editor of a women 's magazine and sometimes she had to make up for the mistakes of associate editors who were no small fry . She has spoken in public many times , but has never really enjoyed it . She has exactly my ideas about the war . She was more dejected over collaboration than I was , but she is finally resigned , as you resign yourself to bad weather . After having lost her home at . S. and all her belongings there , she lives here in a simplicity to which only mine is equal . The intrigues of the small town leave her almost indifferent , though she enjoys seeing the ridiculous side of them . She lives apparently without regret , sustained by a quiet hope which is like a little flame , faithful and persistent . October Q5 . ? You saw that three Germans were murdered ? Fifty French have been shot and a hundred more await the same fate . If I not have great pity ? and you know to what degree ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejoice over these measures that raise , between the Germans and us , an insuperable barrier . October 28 . ? I do not know whether I express myself well enough ; my thoughts are so confused sometimes . My mood has never been so uncertain ? one day full of hope , the morrow discouraged ; another clay , between the two . I can not help thinking of the burying of the troops of the Reich in the mud and snow , far from home and family , and I have to resist something like pity , as when you see on the side of the road a miserable creature left half crushed , dying in solitude . November 5 . ? Monsieur L. , the grocer , expects war between Japan and the United States next spring . He thinks that Japan will wait until Germany has finished up Russia and is able to lend her a hand . If it is so , I tremble for the United States ; they are strong but they are not a warlike nation , for which I congratulate them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proof been given that the Germans needed years to prepare for the crushing of Europe ? German mothers and wives are learning what it means to lose those they love . If they are forbidden to weep in public it can not he that their soul is not full of sorrow . It is not more victory they are waiting for , but the return of their clear ones ? and how many will be missing ! November 11 . ? We have been forbidden to celebrate this anniversary . Do they imagine that we feel like it ? We have prayed t his morning for the dead of the other war and this one . But this eleventh of November is more comforting than the one of last year . It is cold in Russia . Yesterday the radio spoke of our great generals , quoted the watchword of Joffre , recalled the Battle of the Marne . What in the world is happening ? Have we a right to speak of our past victories ? Are we also permitted to wish for more in the future ? I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weekly . In a recent issue they talk about a certain Lewis who is giving President Roosevelt plenty of trouble . He has won the support of five million fanatic trade-unionists . Roosevelt wants all-out help to England ; Lewis detests and denounces the English upper classes . Roosevelt wants to arm America immediately and Lewis claims that the workers should have the right to control the industries , and that the profits should be limited . The conclusion of the article was very striking , though perhaps lacking many points : " Fight between two philosophies , two policies , two men . " November 19 . ? They are stopped near Moscow , but for how long ? The whole of Europe has been condemned to hard labor . Millions of prisoners provide German factories with manpower . Something is taking place here that just breaks my poor heart with pity and indignation . All the statues of our great men ( La Fontaine , Mussel ' , Camille Desmoulins , not to mention others ) that have the ill luck to be made of bronze are sent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unfortunate La Fontaine ! He knew humankind so well that he would not be surprised . The Wolf and the Lamb are always among us . If I could prevent that sacrilegious destruction , I should not , because it stirs in people 's minds the feelings that will find a way to express themselves one clay . November 27 . ? The English radio gave an optimistic review of the general situation in Russia and Africa , and concluded : " What would be left to Hitler if be did not have Vichy ? " I suppose there was some irony in it . I hold that the Vichy government is a very small thing and that Hitler does not have to ask its permission if he wants this or that . The clauses of the Armistice are a mere scrap of paper . Let the United States remember that before they bear us any grudge . To tell the truth , Hitler does not cater to Vichy but to the French people ; French opinion , reduced to such miserable means of expression , can still manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defiance to the Germans in Paris or elsewhere , an act of sabotage ( and unfortunately they will multiply ) , and above all , that wall that . surrounds the German in France and shuts him off from people always and everywhere . It is clear enough that these people refuse collaboration ! Then the Germans will have to impose it upon them ; but the moment is coining when Hitler will count his soldiers . The services of repopulation , so efficiently trained beyond the Rhine , do not work , however , in the same rhythm as the blitzkrieg  - -   - -   in spite of the official warnings to men on leave . So they must not let France slip down into violence ; they must " talk " with Vichy . But the English and the Americans who stare at Vichy with hypnotized eyes , how mistaken they are ! Vichy is not France ; Vichy will not change France . Vichy had its time of usefulness and perhaps of grandeur when France was spilling herself over the roads in immense confusion . But since that time , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its own consciousness of what it wants to save and to be . There is not one Frenchman who in his own way has not groped out of the darkness of defeat toward the beacon of our tradition and our future . Everyone remembers something , loves something , more than anything else ; everyone longs for something . This multitude of wills , each one working by itself to express its preference and its hope , is now converging even though modern means of communication are lacking . Such unity was forged in the fifteenth century , and before . It is the mystery of the native soil and the sky that makes all these provinces into a unity ; at a given moment , something that everyone feels in his blood swells , overflows , and sweeps away all our discords and our differences like bits of straw . That is behind Vichy ; that , Vichy must keep in check . One time P ? tain embodied the country , he still was Verdun ; but since , everyone has lived his own Verdun . We no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ? You should have seen mc , awhile ago , trying a dance-step around the table . I went to B. yesterday and came back with a railway agent whose work takes him everywhere . Ile assured me that the chances of collaboration are dead . Everywhere people are ready to act when they are given the signal . And this morning , at the seven o'clock Mass , Mlle P. told me the impressions of her friend 's husband , who is in charge of the shipment of food between Paris and Marseille . The situation is more and more strained in the capital . The occupying forces are more and more hated . They are becoming like snarling dogs ? a bad sign among victors . Wagnerian serenity seems to he deserting them . Finally , the opinion is spreading that Hitler will have in Russia the same fate as Napoleon . Then , when I returned from Mass , realizing that I perhaps was not mistaken in my hopes , I could not resist my joy any longer and I have had to express it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that it may be true , that we are not mistaken ! I do not ask a victory in the Louis XIV style , with triumphal gates , but merely the failure of the Germans ' plans . People speak of Polish men enlisted in Africa ; their hatred is so great that it makes one fear for the inhabitants if they ever enter Germany . December 8 . ? I have room for only one more line . The world is on fire this time ; shall we have anything left to cat and a stone for our head ? December 14 . ? The battle will not be easy for the United States to win . One hundred million Japanese of complete sobriety , which makes strong men ; iron discipline , a perfect organization , the conviction that they fight for their existence ? that is more than they need to win success . But the others fight for their splendid share in the sun , and that will give them a courage that may reach heroism . January 11 , 1942 . ? The Swiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the end the speaker proved that when peace is re-established spiritual values should be dominant and that the world then would need France . I lost myself in his words and for a minute I saw my country ruling the world , all the dreams of her poets come true , according to the ideals of liberty , justice , and beauty . I am always amazed that words can inspire us so much , even when we neither see nor know the one who pronounces them . January 21 . ? Sept Jours has published an article about mobilization in the United States . It made a great stir . At the end the writer says : " The question is to know whether materialism , ' which has become the religion of the United States , has not weakened the human quality of the soldier , for , in an army , morale is more important than materiel . " You can see the commonplaces and simplifications of the journalists ; probably there is some truth in it . A letter from a German soldier in Russia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sustained by the will to fight , friendship , and that inner spring which is the very essence of the conqueror . " A private writing these words ! But I have a distrust of heroism , especially when it rises to these heights . Let us wait and see our young Germanic heroes in the delights of Capua after a secure conquest . Their virtue is obligation ; their discipline , obedience . January 26 . ? January is approaching its end ; the cold has been terrible . It will take some time before America can take the offensive . And if the Japanese came to terms with the Chinese we should all turn as yellow as daffodils ? including the Germans . Those who did not like England must recognize that she is paying for her mistakes . Heavens , what a situation ! Fought on every front , and without enough soldiers ! The British Lion is having a had time ; but nothing is lost as long as Russia has her adversary on the run . February 20 . ? Yesterday was market day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharp frost . Not a single basket of vegetables in the market . Impossible to pull them . But ? a most unusual thing ? a woman had brought two ducks and she settled herself down to sell them . If it had been less cold I should have stayed to the end to see who took them . They certainly must have brought more than one hundred francs each . Think of it : meat without a ration card ! Let us hope that the wheat is not going to freeze ! They are trying to get food to Greece ; everybody makes a great effort . They have evacuated nine thousand children from the country : one thousand are in Turkey , three thousand scattered in various places , and Switzerland , more admirable than ever , has taken the others . March 9.  --  If I must leave this world before seeing you again , think that you have only missed seeing an old face and an old body , and that my soul keeps living in you . I called on the J 's . We spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody but you that I was amused , entirely within myself . Imagine their indignation : France had stopped fighting ; she had no choice and had to obey and work for the victors ; but at least it was not war , and those who have chosen to fight on attack her . I do know that there are innocent victims , but their death will not be useless . I understand , perhaps better than those who are so indignant , in what a position France is going to find herself ; but that position is not caused by the English : war made it inevitable . This morning again they announced another bombing . I wish I could know whether I would feel the same if S. were a military objective . It seems to me I should , because those destructions mean that the fight has been resumed ; there is something in them that gives courage and hope . And anyway , how would you explain , otherwise , the cheers and the acclamations of the Parisian population on the arrival of the British planes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; that was hard on me . What a complexity of things ! In spite of the suffering the Armistice brought to me , I was relieved at the same time , as all the French were ; for it gave satisfaction to a very deep and animal instinct to see that bloodshed had ceased . But things have changed and we change . March 12. - Right now we are living through perhaps the most tragic time of the war . What is spring going to bring us ? Apprehension has overtaken me ; my friends in their turn try to cheer me up and it is my turn to be weak . I try to get the food I need ; usually I succeed with a little help . They bring me some cottage cheese once a week and some vegetables for soup . The dandelions are here ; I have them for dinner twice a week . One must help the women who pick them in the fields . It is true that anything edible can be sold . The Jerusalem artichokes that had been neglected for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , too . I hope you have all you need . The German authorities have done everything to convince us that the bombings of Billancourt were a cruel thing , inhumane indeed . The French have received orders to show indignation , but the French hate to do anything by order . A memorial service has been celebrated in Notre Dame for the victims . German officers have expressed their " sympathy " and their disapproval of that unexpected act of cruelty . One is a good Christian or not ! In Paris young men and even middle-aged men disappear mysteriously . Mothers and wives try to get an explanation from the German authorities . They are met by officers ( because the soldiers are becoming scarce ) who receive them with arrogance and irony : these men who have disappeared have been mobilized by compulsion for the Russian front . 2 March 20 . ? I have finally succeeded in tuning in on Boston Station These broadcasts are splendid and must not please the Germans too much . I see that they like France in America , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French . All the French worthy of the name accept the bombings of factories and wait for more , even though it means , alas ! more victims . But what can be done ? War goes on . The Renault factories are completely destroyed and others , the names of which escape me , and whose owner is quoted as saying : " All work is stopped , but if that is necessary to drive the Germans out of France I shall not complain . " France is magnificent in her fighting spirit . The Boston radio told us about SaintExupery , Maritain , and others who " are bringing the knowledge and appreciation of French thought to the Americans . " You can imagine how all that warms my heart . It is the only country from which I wish our liberty to come . I know that it will be freely given . Anyway , we shall have paid dearly enough for it , but what is that if we are free one day ? March 25 . ? Every evening at ten o'clock , I am quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard last night seemed to me so fortifying that I could not restrain my tears ( I am decidedly getting older ) . That great country at last sees the imperious motives that prevent the little one from showing its friendship , from following the impulse that carries its thought beyond the ocean , and from taking part at least now ? in the struggle that is being carried on to save liberty for the world . That impression is probably very sentimental and somewhat colored by illusion ; but it was so spontaneous that . I wanted to share it with you . March 27 . ? I want to write this to you immediately and thus double my joy in it : this morning the Swiss radio told us that President Roosevelt , after the formal promise by the French government not to cede any base to any country and not to send any supplies to General Rommel , was going to resume the food shipment to North Africa . Think what that means ! That great and generous country understands our position and the menace of a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the wheat has frozen in some areas ; in many places it is too late to start again . When I saw the blanket of snow melting in the sun and then the temperature drop during the night , I was afraid it would happen . People said : " Wheat does not freeze so easily . " In the years of prosperity , no ; but in years of disaster everything goes wrong , as if things , like people , were weakened in their power of resistance . April 7 . ? We went for a walk in the fields along the D. 1 have picked a bunch of mauve flowers ( I do not know their name ) and daisies . I like to watch them . They are tightly closed when I get up to hear the Swiss radio ; at ten o'clock these ladies begin to display their collar ( as our poet says ) ; then they show me their golden hearts until dusk comes . They do not receive orders from men ; for them night is night , and day is clay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 19 . ? Laval is back in power ; but I think that Petain , who is still called the " Chief of State , " has " remembered to save the furniture , " as they say when there is a fire . Darlan is still head of the three powers ? land , air , and navy ? under the control of the Marechal . I hope they will agree at least in the spirit of patriotism . Jean Nohain , formerly known under the name of Jaboune , does not spare his efforts over the radio . I am reminded of a tale he was telling us yesterday . Three little children were about to come to the earth , but they had heard such horrible stories about our world that they implored God not to let them come if they could not be given a place where life would be bearable . God who listens to the prayers of small children ( this is my personal addition ) glanced at our planet and felt embarrassed . Then He said : " I have found that there still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth is good , the inhabitants human , the lakes blue and the fields green . " And he had the three small children born on the soil of France . It is a pretty tale , is it not ? And told by Jean Nohain , you could believe it actually happened . He does not understand marriage without children ; he has four himself , and one can see how he loves them . How I prefer things like that to the broadcasts where you find real French thought is completely missing , by order ! April 30.  --  The country waits while working , which is the best way of waiting . They are sending out a call for wheat . Is it hidden or is it really lacking as some say ? However , he who is master of the hour pretends he had given us a recipe to avoid starvation . Probably the French did not apply it , or they thought the return of eight hundred thousand peasant . prisoners would work out better . It . will be hard to bridge the gap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have all I need . There are buckwheat pancakes for sale . The fastidious swallow them making expressive faces , but I like them as a substitute for a missing piece of bread . I am fortunate in that . I never was a great lover of delicate food . The United States has half broken with our country . In fact the so-called Free Zone is Just as much slave as the other ; even here the Germans come and go every clay . Until now 1 have been able to avoid seeing them . Every Friday evening , the Swiss radio gives an " international review . " The chief editor of the Journal de Genhe was the chosen speaker recently . He drew a picture of France that would bring tears from your eyes . I think he was speaking partly for America when he recalled all that makes our unfortunate position : the length of the occupation , the daily indemnity , the deduction Germany levies on our whole production ( 60 per cent on French production , 80 per cent on importations ) , the interruption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceaseless bombings , victims of every kind , without our having the profit or the relief of taking part in it . I should like to meet that man one day , to express to him my gratitude for his defense of our miserable country and for his disguised appeal to the compassion of those whose friendship is so precious to us ? so precious that , although we expect no shipment of food from the United States , our heart is distressed when they announce that our relations have again become strained . How could we bear our hardships ? It will be solitude , complete abandonment , if that country does not want to understand us . May 3 . ? They say that Hitler may have decided to stop shooting the hostages ; they may be sent to Germany and condemned to hard labor in every kind of job . If those rapacious people are not finally victorious , at least they will have done everything to make themselves known and liked as they deserve . The way he acts , one could believe that Hider is advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conies here every other week on a business trip . He speaks German very well and takes advantage of it . to talk to the Germans in occupation , all of them old and broken now , for the others are at the front . One of these interesting characters was telling Monsieur It . that their regime would end in murder , into which it already is walking knee-deep . Nobody is assured of saving his head , not even ( or rather especially not ) the chiefs . You may think it exaggerated , but the Parisians will have nothing to do with the air-raid shelters and they rush to the windows as soon as the air alarm is given . May 11 . ? How often I heard these remarks whose meaning is always the same : Germany can not win the last battle . A prisoner writes : " My cousin suffers from very serious internal disorders . " Another : " The bells are gone without hope of ever returning . " These two small sentences , very small , give us a very great hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken place a short time before the collapse of Germany . But nothing definite yet in the communiques ; Germany announces the loss of a position only when she has taken it back . May 14 . ? Never has there been so much celebrating , so much burning of incense to the memory of Jeanne d'Arc . It would be all very well to stick to our gratitude if there were not a flavor of submission to the enemy . To me there is only one enemy , against whom I wish we had a like heroine to oppose if these times could still produce such beings ! Boston gives us every night fifteen minutes of news ; they tell me nothing that I do not know since I have listened to other stations before ; but then comes another quarter of an hour of " political comments " that gives inc the greatest curiosity . I never feel sleepy until after that country has given her interpretation of world events ; I should rather say French events . France ! I feel at the same time proud and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar ? moved by that friendship which I can feel sincere , but sorry that the great United States has to blame us . Do n't Americans know that they can not ask the least thing from us without our being peremptorily forbidden to answer ? I notice that they are better informed than we are on what takes place in this martyred France . All the comments last night were about the victims who fall nearly every day , shot down by our masters . I did not realize that there were so many of them . In one week one hundred fifty hostages were executed . It is a small army that has paid with its life for France 's love of independence . Is the sorrow you feel when you lose your loved ones on the battlefield in any way comparable to your indignation and impotent fury ? Then , let those who give us understanding and friendship stop asking what we can not give ; let them be satisfied with our wishes and our hopes , which are immense . Last night , at seven , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation of his expose that was an appeal for peace ; though he admitted that the time , alas ! had not come yet . One sentence remains clearly in my mind : " There are peoples who take might for right . . . . " No possible ambiguity : the Pope is on the side of those whom injustice will always stir . At noon the Swiss radio quoted a sentence from Stalin to the Poles : " After the war , you will have your country greater than ever , organized according to President Roosevelt 's desires . . . . " Courage is not what the Poles need , nor the Belgians , nor the Dutch . But the strength and the courage of somebody bound in chains are useless . These days are dark ; the end is coming . We are bowed down by fear ; we do not dare to think seriously of the chances the world may have for liberation ; we dare not reckon what looked , even recently , like a possibility . Happy are those whom something prevents from thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not have suffered that terrible uncertainty . June 28 . ? Events are becoming more disturbing . The Saint John 's Day celebration ( they have re-established the feux de joie , never so badly named ) has not succeeded in making us forget our great cares ; I mean our workers sent to Germany . The occupying forces deprive us of raw material ; factories must be closed ; then unemployment ; so that the order of Hitler looks like something reasonable ; but in truth it is a horrible blackmail . To be obliged to accept that is the worst humiliation for French people . July 25.  --  I had an opportunity to speak to Doctor S. I asked him whether his confidence was still unimpaired . " Absolutely , " he said . " I consider all the present military drawbacks as things of little importance . Since Germany did not win the war in 1941 , she can not win it now . It is impossible for her to fight victoriously against England and the United States together , whose power increases each clay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and back home I could not help singing a little . As the neighbors had heard me , I told them why I felt so gay ? not that I have to give them reasons for my conduct ; but it is a good thing to spread these favorable impressions which live in everybody ? with moments of doubt , it is true , but not too long , fortunately . We suffer so many miseries that only the thought of a total deliverance one day can make them bearable . I notice how some have changed , since the result of collaboration has been to send workers to Germany , instead of the Germans leaving France ( as some na ? ve souls were expecting ) , and since the bombing of the Rhine has made the German population overflow on our soil ? and to these every honor is due . July 29 . ? I can not tell you more of the pretty things Nohain was giving us over the radio . The broadcast , " Children Singing , " has been suppressed . No reason was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gayety there . Probably we are not entitled to that hour when we could forget our position at a time when the nerves of our neighbors beyond the Rhine are strained to the breaking point ? strange position for victors . July 31 . ? At noon , Switzerland read us the Message from President Roosevelt on the occasion of their national clay , which is tomorrow . The message is a picture of the man : he congratulates the little country for all the good it has done for the victims of war . I was wondering ? queer idea ? how I should feel if the same words had come from Hitler . But God Himself can not make a circle a square , and that would be easier than to humanize Hitler . This very morning Bider was warning England , through the voice of his acolytes . He does not advise her to attempt the opening of a second front ; he wants her to realize how difficult the operation would be : " The English Army would not enter Berlin in triumph but in fetters . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning the air raids over Germany . They say that in Paris the inhabitants do not miss one occasion of jeering at the official decrees . For instance , the Jews must wear astar of yellow fabric showing the word " Jew " in black . So the Parisians have their clogs wear yellow collars with the name of the animal in black letters . How French that is , and how difficult for the Germans to understand , I suppose ! The other day I saw a woman with her two children . She was in tears ; her husband , who was a prisoner , had succeeded in escaping . He was captured , and because he is a Jew his case is clear ! How many tragedies of that kind ! They are engulfed in the immense one in which we are involved ; but those people suffer atrociously . August 7 . ? I cry to America in my distress . They tell us from Moscow that the situation is serious , very serious . Only one hope : that the United States , in their immense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ won thus far over the Russians . Never have we been so miserable . I do not speak of the privations that we bear without complaint ; I speak of the impossibility of reacting against the authority of the occupying forces . They send our workers to Germany , and , to make the servitude complete , they have just issued an order " allowing " the soldiers of our beautiful colonial army ? once under Weygand , ? to enlist for the eastern front " in order that France shall not keep aloof from that crusade against bolshevism , plague of civilized peoples . " In Paris and in the Occupied Zone , if a young man does not want to go , he has his food ration cards suppressed ; that always works . People from Cologne and other cities bombed by the English overflow to our country . These are allowed to have double ration cards and priority everywhere ; and you are requested not to show your disappointment if , when your turn has come , there is nothing left to be bought . When they reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indignation ? indignation that even I must repress ; caution requires that you remain impassible . The wife of an industrialist from the South was telling me that patriotism awakens in that region which I sometimes accused of passivity . There are priests who take it upon themselves to receive and place groups of young men from the Occupied Zone who prefer anything to the deportation to Germany . The farmers do all they can for these young people who had not studied to become farm hands . The same person also told me that the religious feeling is deepening , as a reaction against Nazi principles . Of course , all that gives pleasure and . refreshes your soul a little ; but I do not know whether the United States realizes clearly our situation : the Armistice does not exist any more ; you must obey or starve to death . I remember the bitter tears I shed the day when , for the first time , I saw the word " collaboration " printed in the press . It was that day that we really were defeated ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use today of our patriotism ? We must obey or see children die under the eyes of their mother ; for there is no longer a father at home . Prisoner of a new king , he has been sent to the enemy factory or to some fighting line . August 8 . ? Lately I was telling a peasant man ( about fifty years old ) that his difficulties would not always last . He answered in a tone that I can not express : " Sure ! And if it is the others who win ( and his finger was pointing at the ground , which made me think that he meant the Germans ) we shall have been well advised to get used to misery , because there will be nothing changed . " Is it not true ? Could he be more clear-minded ? And they all are like that . " Why , Madame , " an old peasant woman told me , " we want to remain French ; we , in the family , have always been French . " How much 1 like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that we all are brothers . August 14 . ? A landing of Allied troops ? Many wish it , but think of what a possible failure would mean ! A Jewish woman , belonging to a family that has been French for generations , listens to the American broadcasts that give her the courage to live . Imagine what she can expect ? she and her relatives ; in the Occupied Zone , they have been arrested ? women on one side , men on the other , and the children apart without identification papers or anything else that would permit their parents to recognize them one day . I simply should lose my reason in such circumstances ! When the broadcasts from Boston , speaking of France , separate her from her govern . ment and promise her , whatever the latter may do , their understanding , they are right : they reach the common man . I just came across M. ll. ' s son . He asked me whether you still were " over there . " " Let ' them ' come , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my heart , and I shall not be alone . " I had dinner last night with the M 's , X. Y. had met the former Minister , and reported his saying that the end was not near yet , but that all fear of seeing the Axis win the victory over the rest of the world should be dismissed . That cast on the company that air of satisfaction that no other cause can produce these clays . But really , is that hope justified , at a time when the Russians are pushed back , when the submarines , thicker than fish , are everywhere at the Allied ships ? even down the Saint Lawrence , the Japanese announce ? August 17 . ? Sometimes , when I read again one of the pages I have written to you , I remain surprised at what I have said . Not that I disavow it , heaven knows ! but because all that concerns France pours from me as my very breath , without my being conscious of it . This morning a peasant man told me that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bread from a piece of newspaper and involuntarily had begun to read . What he read was this : Hitler tells the world that the whole of Europe will soon be his and will help him , willing or not , with all its resources ; that the United States and England will have no power against it . And that man , who never reads the newspaper , had been struck by the air of truth of that article , and he was wondering what the future would be under these conditions . I tried to bring back the reassuring feeling that the words of X. Y. had given me . Of course , I " proved " to the peasant man that our press is under the orders of the victors , as are our food products and other things ; that such a view could be inspired by tire fear of defeat as well as by the hope of victory . Finally I reassured him , wondering myself to what extent I was right . France is in such misery that it hardly can be worse ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . August 31 . ? At last this is the end of August . Quick , quick , let the months pass by and let the dawn of our liberation come . I have stood the suffering of our defeat ; shall I stand the joy of our recovered liberty ? There are quite a few " young " ones of my age , here , who ask themselves that question , so completely has our miserable heart lost the habit of being content . An industrialist from Paris says that the Germans are going to empty the country like an eggshell ; no doubt of it ; but our soil , to which the soles of our shoes are stuck ( our wooden shoes ) , will be enough for us to make a new start with a fresh courage . September 3 . ? I suspect my grocer to be a collaborationist . The rations become more and more meager ( 1Q5 grams of oil , 200 of butter , 500 of sugar , 140 of something that contains N grams of coffee , and that is all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice , etc . When he hands me my share , instead of complaining I exclaim : " All that ! I who thought there would be nothing this month ! Row kind he ( Hitler ) is to us ! " The man does not know whether I am joking or not ; and his wife adds : " At least you understand things ; you know we can do nothing . " And I return the answer of the peasant : " Yes , Madame , let us get used to misery , because if that regime lasts , it will last also . " I feel that the logic irritates them . September 15 . ? The eleventh was the anniversary of the death of Guynemer , the famous French aviator ; the speaker of " our " radio , usually so sleepy , awoke to tell us about the hero ; indeed , that breath from France , for a few minutes , seemed so pure that we felt vivified . During the day we met with " Did you ' see ' Guynemer ? " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of our heart , rising at the first occasion . To the occupying forces , it was all Greek ; that has nothing to do with their mentality . There you have the only happiness we have left : to meet somebody who thinks like us . I went to the attorney 's the other day ; it did not take me long to see that he had my ideas ; then what an outburst of talk , always the same . He has Mein Kampf in the complete edition and lends it willingly , to give those who read it a foretaste of the amenities in store for them . We left each other with a transformed face . But a wind of hope is blowing these days , because of the halting of Boland in Egypt . D. the chimneyman , who had analyzed the situation so well at the time of the declaration of war from Japan to the United Stat es , is entirely confident about the final issue . It is among these people that you find the soundest views ; probably because they judge with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire these people who work with their hands , and whose clarity of vision no propaganda can ever obscure . They simply answer to the deceitful insinuations : Go ahead , keep on talking . But D. is not cautious enough ; at the hour of the foreign broadcast , his radio set , very selective and powerful , can be heard in full blast through the open window , on the National Road , without the least tuning clown ; his modest position protects him against suspicion , but he should think of his son and his son-in-law ready to fire for our liberation . September 20 . ? I return from the nine o'clock Mass ; soon we shall hardly see enough to go to church at that time since nine will be seven the whole winter long . The Germans , who wish us to keep the most execrable memory of their passage , do not neglect a thing to that result . Of course this is nothing beside the executions , the number of which is increasing . You heard about that bomb which exploded at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? es where 1 never went . Its colossal appearance was to please those gentlemen as a temple fit for their reunions . In short , the bomb made one dead and several wounded , for whom we shall have to pay . They expect a hard winter here . But what else can we do but suffer , when we can not defend ourselves . If countries , as individuals , grow through trial , ours will he immense , after the war . But we must learn how to suffer with profit .
