" The place resolved itself into a bare and dirty room , with a couple of windows , whereof a tenth part might be of glass , the remainder being stopped up with old copybooks and paper . . . . The walls were so stained and discoloured that it was impossible to tell whether they had ever been touched with paint or whitewash . ... <P> " As the students lay closely packed together , covered , for warmth 's sake , with their patched and ragged clothes , little could be distinguished but the sharp outlines of pale faces , over which the sombre light shed the same dull heavy colour . . . . " <P> - Dickens ' Nicholas Nickleby <P> The prosperous , picturesque Berkshire Mountain village of Lenox , Mass , is the last place anyone would be likely to look for a U.S. school even remotely suggestive of Dickens ' wretched Dotheboys Hall . Until the recent cold wave hit , few people in Lenox knew what was really going on inside the 44-room onetime private mansion which housed the tony ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school pipes froze and a plumber was called in . <P> He rushed out last week with an astonishing story . The place was a shambles . The floors were spattered with broken window panes and flakes of paint from the wall . The radiators and all 15 toilets were frozen . Down in the laundry room , the 22 students , blue-skinned , dirty , tattered and hungry , were huddled around a pot-bellied stove . One 13-year-old had a leg broken in two places . <P> Swiftly , the local board of health and a state building inspector condemned the school on 37 counts , sent the injured boy to a hospital , moved the others to homes and the Y.M.C.A. in nearby Pittsfield . <P> Career of a Schoolmaster . Head of Duncan School was suave , thick-set William Callaway Duncan , 53 , son of a onetime Georgia Senator . Educated at the University of Georgia , Columbia , Yale and Oxford , he made a name for himself ! in 26 years ( 1914-40 ) as head of Irving Lower School in Tarrytown , N.Y. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camp which he started at Newport , Vt. in 1916 . In 1940 , with money left him by his aunt , he struck out for himself , opened an expensive school near New Milford , Conn . The building shortly burned down . Then he moved his school into rented quarters in Great Barrington , Mass . The property was abruptly sold . <P> As his inheritance dwindled , Schoolmaster Duncan began to slip . Struggling to stay in business , he rented the mansion in Lenox for $200 a month from one Bene Virgilio . When the plumber walked in , Duncan was out of town ( for the fifth straight week ) on business . <P> " No Law Against It . " He had left the school in charge of furtive , soft-voiced John K. Wolcott , a 61-year-old chaplain-teacher . He had no help except a young teacher named Robert Newton . Last week the Reverend Mr. Wolcott , who has worked for Duncan for years but says he has not been paid since last spring , offered feeble excuses for the lack of sheets ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lack of heat ( " There 's no law you have to keep a school piping hot " ) , the single dining-study-play room ( " I do n't think there 's a law against it " ) . Even more puzzling was the stout defense of Duncan and his school which the older students , backed by their embarrassed parents , put up .
