Each has asked Congress for a scalpel , in the form of a reorganization bill , but most of them got something that looked more like a rubber dagger . Congressmen always shuddered at the idea of a President whacking at patronage with anything that would really cut . <P> When Harry Truman made the traditional demand last spring , the U.S. Government had grown more lumps and bumps than a tree toad-1,141 bureaus employing nearly 3,000,000 people . Despite these admitted tumors , and the fact that the new President did n't seem like the sort of surgeon who would tattoo the patient after operating , just for laughs , Congress spent seven months in alarmed concern . <P> But last week it finally took a deep breath , granted Harry Truman powers that it had regularly denied Wilson , Taft , Harding , Coolidge , Roosevelts I &; II .
