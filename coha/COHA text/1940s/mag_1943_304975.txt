" It is beautiful . I very much like the look of it , " said Lieut . General Alexander Archer Vandegrift , who just one year ago had led the first American attack against the Jap-held Solomon Islands . Now , back in the South Pacific , commanding the newly formed I Marine Amphibious Corps , he was making a shrewd observation on the success of the combined Army-Marine-Navy operations against Munda , once the strongest Jap base in the central Solo mons . <P> The beauty of Munda airfield on this August afternoon was not in the gutted , smoldering landscape . It was wholly due to the presence there of dirty , sour-smelling , bloodied American troops poking about in the smoky rubble looking for souvenirs . Among their souvenirs were 1,671 dead Japanese ( so far counted ) , sodden , mustard-colored bags of dusty , mustard-colored flesh ballooning n the humid sunlight , attracting only flies and burial squads . Soon to be souvenirs were isolated Jap units which had taken refuge in the slimy shadow of nearby man grove swamps . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly escaped , by barge or destroyer , in the artillery-haunted nights preceding Mun-da 's fall . <P> Final Offensive . The final offensive had begun five days previously , when encircling U.S. troops broke through Jap lines on the north and south . Flame throwers proved the answer to the Jap 's bombproof , duplex bunkers . Soldiers advanced under Jap guns and sprayed fire from two sides into the gun openings and eyeslits , scorching the Japs out . Ingenious mechanics improved on the tactic by affixing flame throwers to the light marine tanks . These blowtorched the path into Munda . In the last days little Jap resistance remained . The cumulative effect of the tremendous bombing and shelling to which Munda had been subjected won the day . <P> Cleanup . At week 's end on New Georgia only a small Jap detachment at Bai-roko Harbor was still to be done in , but victorious units from Munda moved for ward to help in the job . Army engineers and Navy Seabees prepared to restore the 4,000-ft . Munda airstrip , which would bring the U.S. just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Munda 's supplementary airstrip 17 miles away , huddled against the great cone of Kolombangara . That the Japs were determined to cling to Vila was evident when they once more took the impossible chance and sent down four ships with reinforcements . Intercepting the convoy at mid night in the Vella Gulf , the U.S. Navy , already operating north of Kolombangara , sank a cruiser , two destroyers and probably the remaining destroyer . <P> Outlook . Since General Vandegrift 's Marines made their frontal assault on Guadalcanal , the U.S. has learned much about island warfare . The new tactics are to surround the Jap bases in overwhelming force and in combined operation to squeeze the life out of them . Though the capture of Munda was somewhat behind schedule , the Japs were left no secondary retreats , would soon be cleaned up . Gen eral Vandegrift , with his spearhead of Amphibious Marines , looked forward to future operations conducted by " all of us , a highly cooperative team . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
