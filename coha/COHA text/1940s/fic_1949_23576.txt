The World Outside A Story by Howard Maier Illustrated by Frede Vidar T HE midget and the fat lady , the rubber man and the giant , the fire-eater and the tattooed man sat melancholy and unsmiling , each on his individual platform , staring down at the meagre crowd that wandered up and down the sawdust aisles . It was stifling hot within the narrow confines of the side-show tent . An acrid animal scent filled the air , but no animal stirred in the cages which lined the far wall . Occasionally a queer whimpering sound would come from the monkey cage . So pleading and importunate was this sound that those nearest the cage would stop in their tracks and lift their heads . At these moments even the children were quiet . To John Douglas , standing beside the glass water tank on his platform , the meaning of the importunate whimpering was quite clear . That morning Bella , the Rhesus monkey , had given birth to a baby . The baby had been born dead and the cage men had taken it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his circus life , John remembered , another monkey had given birth like this , late in the morning just before the afternoon performance . Then , too , the baby had been born dead but its birth was undiscovered and in the afternoon when the tent was filled with people the other monkeys in the cage had tried to wrest the dead babe from its mother . The townspeople had witnessed the terrible struggle that ensued and had protested through their mayor . And that night , he recalled , they had played to an empty tent . At the time it had happened he had paid it very little attention , for a wireman with top billing had nothing whatsoever to do with sideshow people or with animals . Then , five years ago , had come his accident and although nothing about him seemed different the bones of his left ankle would no longer adapt themselves to the stress of wire walking . Because he loved the circus but mostly because he knew no other life , he had devised his sideshow act- Now he ate at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never mentioned the life he had once led . And they , perhaps because they had forgotten or because it was so commonplace an occurrence , never mentioned it either . And yet at night in the upper berth of the swaying circus train he dreamed that he again walked the high wire and that he could hear the measured , rolling sound of the applause as it swept up past him to beat at the pinnacle of the big top above his head . As McGrady grunted his way up the ladder onto the platform , the prop-boys who had been lolling on the tarpaulin at the back of the tank got to their feet and began to test the air-pump . Stepping past John to the very front of the platform , McGrady said out of the corner of his mouth , " How 's it , boy ? How 'd you feel ? " John gave him a curt nod of his head . " Okay then , here we go . " McGrady picked up the leather hammer and beat repeatedly on the brass gong . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to shut out the sound , steeling his nerves against it , trying shifted and moved ; McGrady gesticulated ; but he heard nothing . Gone , gone , the panic whispered . He shook his head and it was over . M CGRADY 'S hand slapped his back ; the wooden spear was thrust into his hand . As he turned about a prop boy strapped the brass knuckles round his left hand . Slowly he mounted the ladder and let himself slip carefully down into the green water . The floodlights behind the tank went on . He could see perfectly all that the tank contained , but the world outside was only a diffused and wavering distortion . He paced once around the floor of the tank and took his stand in the corner . The slack of his hose was drawn up . Half-crouched , the spear at ready , he fixed his eyes on the spot on the Far side where the tank truck would spill its load . A cascade of water hit the emeraldsurface and , suddenly , the huge gray-white shape was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dorsal fin wavering , round evil eye fixed upon him . A piece of meat hit the surface of the water and began to sink slowly . The gray torpedo circled once , turned half-way on its back , and the piece of meat was gone . Now the shark was circling and circling , each time a bit lower and lower . John pressed himself tight into the tank corner . Breast high , the sharked rolled on its side , mouth open , razor teeth white , sharp . In it swept . He gave it the spear and felt the jolt run up his arm . The shark , still circling , went up above his head close to the surface . Now came the moment of total danger : he must move from one corner to another . Timing the circling sweeps , he started . The water pressed against his chest . The gray shape hurtled at him . He felt the jolt , the spear snap , the fish rebound , and the scrape and smash of the tail against his shoulder . He made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a level with his chest . Suddenly it came straight at him , sweeping upward . John smashed out with his left hand and the tearing contact ran through all his muscles . The shark was circling again on the surface above his head . He felt the drawup rope touch his shoulder . Never taking his eyes from the huge fish , he worked the rope down over his shoulders and up under his armpits . With slow smoothness he began to ascend . Halfway the long balance pole John could feel the weight of it against his own palms . A quick , beautifully executed run brought the figure out to the center of the tent , sent the wire gently swaying , and for an instant John could feel the wire as if it were biting across his own soles. , The hands high above sent the long pole tumbling end over end to the net far below . For a fleeting second the figure stood poised and then sprang in the air in a lightning about-face , landing on one foot , seeming to slip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into the dome . With infinite care and slowness the figure drew erect on the wire . The outburst of applause raced like a ring of fire round and round the dark tent . He 's got them , John thought in triumph , and his own body ached with a sense of achievement . The rest was nothing but perfect co-ordination and infinite patience . He turned away . Behind the flap all was bustle : the elephants were being massed : the chariots rolled into position . The Joeys were lining up for MAGAZINE their final walk-around . Here and there a grotesque clown face called to him . Behind him the band struck up again , but as he got further and further away its brassiness became more and more muted . As he dropped the last flap behind him , he had the impression of complete emptiness and stillness . The side-show tent was deserted , the platforms bare . Up near the entrance a light cast a circle of yellow . All else was shadow . Then his ear caught the soft whisper of padding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the heat , paced its narrow cage deep in the shadows . Suddenly , as if sensing his presence , the forlorn and importunate whimpering came again from the monkey cage . The padding stopped for an instant , then began again . j WIN crossed the tent to his platform and opened his locker . He ripped a banana from the hand he had purchased that morning , picked up a stick and made his way back to the monkey cage . It took a moment for his eyes to find her , a tiny soft gray figure drooping against the far bars , arms hanging , chin buried deep in the fur of its chest . He held the banana between the bars and softly called to her . She quivered and turned her head away . He called again . From either side the other monks glided up reaching for the fruit , but the rattle of the stick against the bars sent them scurrying . He called to her again . This time she lifted her head , but still she remained where she was . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the big cat settled down . Now the tent was completely quiet . Holding the banana thrust through the bars , he stood there . A minute passed , then another . Suddenly , for he had not seen her move , Bella was in front of him . Her little hands reached out and took the banana . He encouraged her , but she just crouched there , the banana clutched to her breast , her chin buried in her chest . He put his hand through the bars and disengaged the banana ; she allowed him to take it from her . He half-peeled it and gave it back . Delicately , she began to munch the fruit . John reached his fingers through and gently stroked the soft fur of her head .
