Harry Truman kept smiling , but his wife was tuckered out . Gamely they had pumped more than 1,200 hands of foreign diplomats , U.S. Cabinet officers , Congressmen and their wives . Last week 's annual White House diplomatic reception-the second since the war-was , as usual , peacock-splendid , stiff with protocol and hardly hilarious . <P> First to handshake his way past the Trumans in the white &; gold East Room was the dean of Washington 's diplomatic corps , Brazil 's Ambassador Carlos Martins , accompanied by his sculptress wife , Maria , and their handsome , 19-year-old daughter Nora . Portly Ambassador Martins bore up bravely in tight-fitting full-dress uniform of dark green , covered with gold-leaf embroidery , sword and medals . Said he : " One more pound and I have to get a new uniform . " <P> The arrival of Great Britain 's Lord Inverchapel and his lady caused a perceptible flurry . The Inverchapels were divorced in 1945 , remarried last August . This was their first appearance at an official White House reception since then . Inverchapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady wore an eye-filling strapless gown embroidered in silver sequins . <P> The Soviets sent along their naval attach , Rear Admiral Eugeni Georgievich Glinkov ( their new Ambassador has not yet arrived ) . But because of the U.S. 's part in the partition of Palestine , almost all the Arab League countries ' diplomats stayed away . <P> Anyone who wanted to dance could foot it to music by the red-coated U.S. Marine Corps band . The thirsty had to choose between tomato juice and two kinds of fruit punch ( both non-alcoholic ) . <P> Their official duties done , many of the White House 's guests slipped into sleek black limousines and were shuttled across Jackson Square to Decatur House , the gas-and candlelit mansion of Mrs. Marie Oge Truxton Beale , one of the capital 's omnipotent hostesses . <P> At Decatur House there was no music . But there was hot borsch , hot lobster pilaff , turkey and cheese sandwiches , orange sherbet , pastries and domestic champagne . No introductions were needed . It was a gathering of old friends. * <P> * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
