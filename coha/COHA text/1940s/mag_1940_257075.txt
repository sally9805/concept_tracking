Where the Sabine River divides Louisiana from Texas , 68,000 Regulars of the U. S. Army maneuvered last week . Their war game , unrolled under a hot sun , on russet roads of sand and clay , in air sweet with the odor of pine trees , was the biggest the U. S. Army had ever had . <P> The Army got a good look at Louisiana : moss , bats , and dark , stagnant pools in forests of oak and pine ; Negroes , staring wall-eyed from weather-grey shacks ; from shacks no better , poor whites whose grand pappies saw the Confederates run the Yanks off this same land ; a new oil find , 30 miles south of prosperous Alexandria ; cotton , corn , potatoes , rice where cane grew until Louisiana sugar prices went to pot . Yellow signs reading : TROOPS , KEEP OUT hung on fence posts and trees . These signs marked farms whose owners had refused the Army permission to cross their land . One officer , seeking such permission before the troops arrived , had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backwoods slattern , he inquired : " Madam , do n't you know that Louisiana is at war with Texas ? And do n't you want Louisiana to win the war ? " Said the lady of the house : " I sure do . Give me that paper to sign ! " <P> Mostly the natives liked what they saw of the Army in Alexandria , Dry Prong Natchitoches , along the dusty roads and at Camp Beauregard ( where at night the clustered , lighted tents were like an incandescent half-orange ) . Military police had little to do . As many soldiers went to drugstores for malted milks as to honky-tonks for beer . <P> They were just games , but they had the look , sound , smell of motorized war . They even had casualties : at week 's end , twelve dead , about 200 injured . Engines aground and aloft belched more noise and fumes than did the guns ( which fired blanks ) . There were agile , armored scout cars ( with four guns , two-way radio ) . Excellent medium and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans ' mighty 80-tonners ) rumbled up against 3 7 mm. anti-tank guns ( which can pierce 2-inch armor at 1,500 yards ) and smokepots ( devised to blind tank crews in grey , saccharine fog ) . Some of the tanks had names . Defense forces using smokepots and modernized French 75-mm. field guns captured Gypsy Rose Lee , Diamond Lil , Galloping Ghost , Suicide Kid in one skirmish . Along with a completely mechanized cavalry brigade , there was still horse cavalry . But even the horses were modernized . There were trucks to haul them on long marches ; some carried portable radio transmitters which the riders operated on horseback in the field . <P> But measured against the reality of World War II , last week 's game was more unreal than most such playing at soldiers . There was absurdly little Air Corps participation , practically no realistic anti-aircraft practice , no practice whatsoever with and against parachute troops-which the U. S. Army has not officially recognized . What useful training and new techniques the Army did pick up cost the taxpayers about $2,400,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . For last week 's game provided an excellent index of what the U. S. Army has , what it needs . <P> The U. S. could see ( and was told by Chief of Staff George Catlett Marshall ) that its Army could muster enough initial combat equipment for about 75,000 men . <P>
