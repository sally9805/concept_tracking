Since the war , bloodstained melodramas full of brutality and violence have been especially popular on the U.S. screen . Last week Britain 's Board of Film Censors sternly warned Hollywood-and producers elsewhere-to mop up the gore or have offending films scissored to bits and possibly banned outright . <P> Said Board Secretary A. T. L. Watkins : " . . . There are too many scenes of torture and novel means of killing . . . One or two blows in a fight should be sufficient .
