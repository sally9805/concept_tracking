Another great , " final " reorganization of the U.S. war effort began to emerge . In Washington 's high places , talk of an Economic High Command had turned from whether ? to how ? Even the men who are now top dog in their own fields , and must someday take orders from such a High Command , were ready to give up their prerogatives as the price of order , which is the price of victory . <P> One man who foresaw the need was handsome , silver-topped Paul Vories McNutt , who looked at his title of Manpower Tsar and found it meaningless . McNutt 's job was to mobilize the nation 's men &; women for war , get them into the most productive jobs , keep them there . But for all his glamorous title and vast task , he lacked the power . <P> When McNutt sent a man to the West Coast to stop pirating of workers by stabilizing wages , he ran head on into two other war agencies . Wage Boss William H. Davis ' man was there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was there with a third plan . The conference fell , with a loud , painful thump , among the three Government stools . <P> Now McNutt 's great worry was the nation 's impending manpower shortage , heading toward a crux in the fall . To cope with it he might have to order nonwar workers to switch to new jobs , might have to " freeze " war workers in their present jobs . But until the U.S. had a sensible wage policy , reducing inequalities from plant to plant and industry to industry , labor would never stand for " freezing . " And McNutt had no power over wages . Nor did Production Boss Donald Nelson , though he had all the responsibility for factory output . <P> Five Into One . Leon Henderson also foresaw the need and the inevitability . He had clashed with McNutt and Davis over wages , with Secretary of Agriculture Claude Wickard on farm prices . Economist Henderson well knew the unbalanced house-of-cards structure of the U.S. economy after two years of war strains and stresses . He had his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was willing to forget them , if somebody would lay down an over-all policy to which he could sensibly gear price control . <P> The nation had too many bosses . They got in each other 's way , stepped on each other 's toes , bumped and jostled like five men trying to get through a door at once . <P> In the five agencies lay the sections of a master pattern . The next step was a master hand who would put the jigsaw together . Once the nation had an Economic High Command-and a High Commander-the war effort might begin to make sense .
