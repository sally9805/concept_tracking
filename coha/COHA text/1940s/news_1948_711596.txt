Speaking at an American Legion dinner given by the outgoing national commander , James F. O'Neil , for the distinguished guests of the convention here , General Groves asserted that although the United States must continue to put forward the Baruch plan " we can not enter into any international agreement whereby we destroy our most powerful weapon until we are convinced of the good intentions of all the major powers . " General Groves ' statement sugb ssted that should Russia suddenly do an about-face on the United States plan to destroy atomic bombs and set up a system of international inspection on shared atomic energy secrets , this country would have to view the move with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , General Groves was equally forceful , attacking what he termed the unwillingness of the Atomic Energy Commission to permit its policies to stand public scrutiny . He referred to nonmilitary aspects . The AEC had made itself almost sacrosanct , he said , and while he did not " fear " the present five commissioners , whose terms expire in 1950 , ne did " fear the possibilities of developing an entrenched bureaucratic organization intent upon self-perpetuation and selfbenefit rather than solely upon the welfare of the United States . " Particularly do I fear this because of the wall of secrecy ; a wall behind which exists such a possibility of concealing unsound aims // or administration 7- even such a strong temptation to do so , " he declared . General Groves recommended that the public overcome its awe and feeling of ignorance about : atomic energy , and demand to understand its tremendous scientific and social potentialities and now they are being handled .

He was loudly applauded when he said that , knowing the industrial productivity of the nation , its capacity for sacrifice and the spirit of its fighting men , " I tell you I would be scared as hell to fight America . " The Kaiser and Hitler , Mr. Sullivan asserted , had underestimated America and Americans , adding , " We hope no other dictator will ever make the sathe mistake again . " Mrs. Lee W. Hutton , president of the American Legion Auxiliary , which , she said , now had 950,000 members in 12,500 communities , told the business session that " only an aroused America can halt the inroads of the Communists .

World @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between candidates and delegations - in the early hours of this morning and through the day have brought the battle for election of national commander to a point where for the first time since World War II a veteran of that war is making a strong bid for the prized post . A national commander receives $10,000 salary and $40,000 expenses for his year 's term . Veterans of the last war heavily , outnumber World War I Legionnaires . A coalition move , it was learned . will result in all but three of the original seven candidates for the office dropping out of the race when the election is held on Friday . S. Perry Brown of Beaumont . Tex. ? a 56-year-old veteran of both wars , is the favorite contender . but James Green of Omaha , Neb . a World War II veteran , is now Considered a real possibility to upset the Brown campaign . The third Legionnaire remaining in the fight is George Craig of Brazil . Ind. , another World War II man . The Legion 's fun-making got into stride today : Bands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel lobbies . Street antics became more , common , but stayed within bounds . Generally speaking. , the Legion was on its good behavior , a point worth noting in the light of the fact that the Legion has had no bids for next year from any city able to handle the huge conclave other than a reinvitation from Miami and a tentative offer from New York .
