Some time early last month a balloon floated silently in across Cape Flattery on Washington 's rainswept northern coast . The balloon , made of shellacked , parchment-like paper and bearing the rising sun of Japan , was a sizable object ( 33 ft. in diameter ) but nobody saw it , apparently . Eventually a 70-ft. fuse , connected to a small incendiary bomb on the inflammable paper bag , sputtered-and went out . The balloon drifted on across the Northwest . <P> Finally , unseen , unheard , it buckled gently into a heap near Kalispell , Mont. , 475 air miles east of the Pacific . Last week , after its discovery by two puzzled loggers , men of the FBI and the Army Air Forces went over it trying to figure out where it came from , and why . <P> Quaint as it appeared , the balloon was a practical and efficient affair . Inflated with hydrogen , it was capable of lifting 800 lbs . The FBI discovered that the Japanese had obligingly printed a good deal of information on the bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on Oct. 31 , at a Japanese factory . Japanese characters also revealed the number of hours spent in its manufacture , data regarding work shifts . <P> Like the small seaplane which dropped an incendiary bomb and started a forest fire in Oregon during 1942 , the balloon had presumably been launched from an offshore submarine . But why ? If it had carried men , where had they parachuted to earth ? Since the balloon was designed to destroy itself in the air , had other earlier balloons sailed in across the Northwest undetected ? <P> The FBI and the Air Forces , which sent a balloon expert , Major J. F. Bolgiano , west to Montana , were not alone in their speculation . Residents of Kalispell , who kept mum until week 's end at the Government 's request , were engaged in fascinated discussion about what odd people the Japanese are .
