THE KNOWN AND THE UNKNOWN A Story CHRISTOPHER LA FARGE i This is the sixth story in Mr. La Farge 's series , " East by Southwest . " These stories , their characters , and their happenings , are all entirely fictional . They grew from the observations and experiences of the author as a war correspondent in the southwest Pacific . If , happily , they seem true , it must be in the sense of a truth that illuminates rather than reports , for here there is no transcription of actual events. ? The Editors V AL DES NAouLts is near the north end of the island of Balade and , because that name is not easy for American mouths to pronounce , it is called VDN . I had to wait there for three days on my way home , and it rained almost continuously during that time . Such rain is not uncommon at that season and it turns the iron-red soil into a deep and liquid mud that is very slippery and stains your clothes beyond remedy of washing . Even during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than when the tropical sun pursues you , but of a damp , enervating heat that penetrates your bones and makes you feel a little feverish all the time , until you have been there long enough to have your blood thin out and accept it as the normal . The rain seems to stimulate the mosquitoes , though they are a mild pest there compared to some other places , and I remember that it drove the huge and ugly spiders indoors and that they got very busy in the little , unscreened shack I slept in . I used to leave my drab mosquito bar down and tucked into my cot to keepthem out of that at least . The shack had a concrete floor , and was roofed with Australian corrugated iron , on each section of which was thoughtfully stenciled , " Unfit for Drinking Water . " With a roof like that you never had to look out to see if it was raining : you merely listened . There were only two other men in the shack  --  a Signal Corps captain , from New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doriett , of the Air Transport Command which ran the encampment . VDN is a place you stop at in order to fly somewhere else as soon as possible . Normally it is not a sociable place . My first meal there was lunch . I slid downhill , waded through the mud of the road , and scrambled up the opposite slope to the officers ' mess shack . It was a small building , also with a concrete floor , wooden walls up to three feet , then open to the eaves above , though well screened . The roof was of a coarse thatch that overhung the walls far enough to prevent all but the most persistent gusts of wind from driving the rain into the room . It was furnished with two wooden tables which had benches along their sides . One table was for transients . The other was for the officers of this command . It was obvious quite soon that the food served at the transient table was considerably less varied than that served at the permanent table . But I noticed that an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauce was used at both tables , so their food must have been almost as tasteless as ours . It made me realize all over again how well the Navy feeds you . At lunch there were six officers who , like me , were waiting for a plane out . There were about twelve officers at the permanent table . Perhaps because of the rain , the heat , and the poor food we did n't say much . I talked a little to the Signal Corps officer , but he was hard to get going then and seemed immersed in his own thoughts . The few rather feeble attempts at starting conversation with the permanent officers fizzled out . I think this might have gone on during supper also if it had n't been for a short story by James Thurber . I spent the afternoon reading on my cot , for it was raining hard outside . Captain Lazard , the Signal Corps man , slept most of the time and wrote notes in a large bound notebook when he awoke . We went sliding and slipping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered for the meal as had appeared at lunch . But we had hardly begun to eat when we had six new arrivals . They were all Army pilots and very young , and they had just got in with three new Liberator bombers that they were flying to Australia . They evidently knew one another well and came in laughing and talking . " Ta-pocketa-pockcta , " said a dark-haired first lieutenant as he sat down , and the others all laughed . " Full strength in No. 3 turret , " said another in a stagy voice . " Commander Mitty will take over . " They were all seated now and asked to have the platter of meat passed along . " Well , Dr. Pritchard-Mitford , " said one , spearing an unappetizing-looking piece of dark-brown , overcooked meat , " I 'd diagnose this as streptothricosis , and should say that coreopsis has set in . " " You 'll need the new machine to breathe life into that one , " said a young second lieutenant . " If you can make it work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another . " Ta-pocketa-pockcta-queep , " said the dark-haired boy . " Walter Mitty , the undefeated , inscrutable to the last , " said another . They all laughed again . " What the hell sort of a guy can think up that sort of story ? " said one . " Yeah . God , it 's a good story . What sort of a bird is James Thurber , do you suppose ? " " God only knows . " " He 's a good sort , " I said . " You know him ? " asked the Second Lieutenant . " You know Thurber ? " asked another . " Very slightly , " I said . " I 've met him several times . But I 've heard a good deal about him . " " How the hell do you happen to know him ? " they asked . I told them and they asked me a lot of questions about Thurber . They had all just read " The Secret Life of Walter Mitty , " and they were full of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over their radio telephones on the flight down from Ile d'Edouard , which is a long hop from Balade over a lot of Pacific . But the point of all this is not what they said or I said . It is that , suddenly , the ice was broken . Instead of being just another transient waiting to get on a plane , I was someone with a name and a job . I introduced Captain Lazard to them , and he brightened up and joined in , and the first thing you knew we had all introduced ourselves and were talking and laughing , and it got to be contagious , so that the permanent staff chipped in to our talk . I do n't believe they had meant to be exclusive . They had simply been there so long , and had seen so many people go through whom they 'd probably never see again . We stayed talking till quite late , for there was no movie that night , and even if there had been it would have meant going over a mile in the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went back to our shack and the rest of them went to a bigger one nearby that was called the Hotel Vanderbilt . THE KNOWN AND It was raining much less hard the next morning after breakfast . When I had discovered that there would be no transport plane out that day ( though the three Liberators took off for Australia ) , I got my pad and pencil and sat down under the wide iron eaves of the Operations Building and started to make a drawing of the cook shack . It sat on the slope opposite me , among young naouli trees with their twisted white limbs , and a few scrubby pines with very long , soft clumps of needles . Like the mess shack , it was thatched , but it was open to the ground except for the inevitable screening . Over part of the thatch was a dull-orange tarpaulin and , with the deep red of the wet soil , it would have made a fine painting . Inevitably I attracted a small crowd . First there were two privates , then a sergeant joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporal came and stood to watch . For the most part they merely said how do you do and stood silent afterward . Finally one of the first lieutenants of that command , whose name was Phelan , came and stood beside me . He was a tall and attractive young man . The seated soldiers all rose . " Morning , " he said . " Sit down , boys . " " Good morning , " I said . " Here , Lieutenant , " said one of the privates who had been sitting on the base of the building next to me . " Sit here . " " No , no , " said Phelan . " Keep your seat . " " No , set down , " said the Private . " Yeah , set down , Lieutenant , " the others said . " O.K. , " he said . " Thanks , Buck . " He sat down then . I could see that the men liked him by the way they spoke to him and smiled at him , and because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother you ? " Phelan asked me . " Not a bit , " I said . " You get over that . You have to . " " Gosh , " he said . " You certainly would n't ever think that that ugly damn shack would look so good in a drawing , would you ? " " No , sir ! " said the Sergeant . " When the gent shows this at home they 'll all wish they was here . " They laughed . " Yes , sir , " said Phelan . " The romantic life of the tropics . Alone at last . " " This dump , " said the Sergeant . " I tell you , Lieutenant , " the Corporal said , " when you been here as long as I have you 'll learn to love it . The first ten months is the hardest . " They all laughed again . " I 'll have to get hold of that story by Thurber , " said Phelan . " Sounds swell . " " It is , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Building . " Lieutenant , " he said , " the Colonel wants to see you . " " O.K. , " said Phelan . He got up . " So long , " he said . " Send me a copy of the drawing , will you ? " " I 'll try to , " I said . " If it is n't a military secret , " " Could be , " he said . " By God , considering the food that issues out of it , it should be . Well , so long . I hope the old man does n't expect me to fly to-day . " He left us then . " Gosh , " I said , " Fly to-day ? " " Oh , " said the Sergeant , " you never know . It 's been worse than this . He takes that damn little pocket-size Cub of his up in all weathers . He 's a fine pilot . " " He 's a fine officer , " said another man . " We got a lot of good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't we 'd go nuts , I 'm telling you . " It began to rain pretty hard then so I left , to finish the drawing from memory in my little shack . Then I wrote up my notes and slept till lunchtime . There did n't seem to be anything else to do . During wars you get very good at sleeping and waiting . At lunch I fell into conversation with Major Doriett and Captain Lazard . For the most part they were talking of the radio installations at Ouan , on the northernmost tip of the island , some sixty miles from Val des Naoulis . They were good about answering my questions . It was all very different from the first day . After lunch I walked back to Operations Building with Doriett and sat on a bench there to read , while he disappeared into his partitioned office . After about half an hour he came out looking rather worried . He had one of those sallow complexions that never take a tan , and his thin oval face was commonly rather sad looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sadder lines . " Listen , Glenn , " he said to the Sergeant in the outer office . " Take the jeep and go down to the construction camp and see if they 've heard anything of Phelan , will you ? He may have gone there with the rain and all . Ask them to check on the radio . " " Yes , sir , " said the Sergeant . He put on his waterproof and left the building . " Something wrong ? " I said . " Oh , no , " he said . " It 's just that phoned to get Phelan , who ought to be back , and they do n't know a thing about him at the airfield . Probably nothing . They 've got the radio at the camp . Might as well make sure . " " Yes , " I said . " Did he go somewhere ? " " He had to go up to Ouan , " said Doriett . " He took his Cub plane . It was n't raining too hard then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short wave this morning . The Colonel wanted to check up . " " Rotten weather to fly , " I said . " Oh , well , " he said . " The road 's worse than the weather , up there . The showers are heavy , but you get a decent ceiling in between . Sorry it 's raining so hard . I 'd have rigged it for you and me to go fishing . " " Fishing ! " I said . " Boy ! Where ? " " In the lagoon , " said Doriett . " With old man Fish Fry . " " Who 's he ? " " Fish Fry ? He 's a black Kanaka , about a hundred years old , they say , and he has a boat there . What he does n't know about fishing you can put in your eye . " " Sounds wonderful , " I said . " Damn good fun , " said Doriett . " Maybe to-morrow . " I heard the phone ring in the office and Doriett went in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No word , " he said . " I do n't like it . I think I 'll go up the island and look for the guy . " " Yes , " I said . " Want to come along ? " " Very much . " " Get your coat then . It 'll be a tough ride if we hit the heavy rain again . " " Right , " I said , and I sloshed across to the shack for my raincoat and returned . By the time I got there Glenn was back and the jeep stood in front of Operations Building . The Major was standing in the doorway talking to Glenn . " When I get up to Pouneon , " he was saying , " I 'll try the phone from the Post Office there . It may be the line is O.K. from there to Ouan . " " Want I should get some guys to check the line from here ? " said the Sergeant . " Yes , " said Doriett . " Might as well . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zealand camp . Maybe they 'll know . Get Fiske to take the truck and some of the boys . " " Yes , sir , " said the Sergeant , and he saluted Doriett and went back into Operations Building . Doriett and I climbed into the jeep and we drove east . For a while the road was pretty awful and he had to keep all four wheels driving to get through the mud , but after about two miles we struck north into a hard road , and the driving was n't so bad , though even with the top up a lot of rain can blow into a jeep . The visibility was good enough in that light rain to let me see some of the country , which was very beautiful . It was rolling upland we went through , a fine grazing land of thick , high grass . Along the roadside grew wild flowers in profusion , one of which looked in its lavender excellence like an oversize vervain that had decided to bloom all the way up its stalk at once , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the daphne , only of many colors from white through yellow to a pale red . The pastures on our right ran up into grassy foothills of the mountains , and you could see the base of the red-rock mountains themselves , heavily timbered , but not their tops , which were lost in clouds . There were small grassy meadows here and there high up on the mountains . To our left lay the sea , but it was hard to get a good view of it . At one point the road rose onto the base of a high hill near the water , and looking back from there one could see the lagoon and the nearby coral reefs , though the barrier reef that parallels the whole shore line was out of sight in the rain . On the south slope of that hill , in a grove of pines and naoulis and what looked like a sort of acacia , was an encampment . On a fine day there must have been a wonderful view of the ocean . " That 's the New Zealanders ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good spot , " I said . " Not had , " he said . " They 're right near the lagoon . Fish Fry keeps his boat in a cove just below there . His huts are there too . His family makes a whole damn village of fishermen . " " Nice for the New Zealanders , " I said . " Yes , sir , " he said . " They 're great fishermen . " We drove on north for about thirty miles . Presently we began to go past big groves of tall and thick-foliaged trees planted in rows , and between them grew coffee bushes , four or five feet high , with shiny green leaves that were handsome in color . Beyond the coffee groves we came into an area of truck gardens , neatly laid out and large , and these gave way to scattered native huts , mostly thatched , and then we crossed a bridge over a calm and lovely stream that was deeply overhung by rank vegetation and masses of pale-blue and deep-purple flowers , and we climbed a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a pretty village , to my surprise . The houses were very French , of white and gray stucco , with hip roofs of slate , and the walls were often paneled into simple square designs . Some of the houses had corners cut off at a forty-five-degree angle and the cutoff , carried into the slope of the roof , made a pleasing pattern . They were all one storey high and had deep porches on one or two sides . Their grounds were neat and their gardens colorful and full of roses . Doriett stopped the car at the Post Office and we went into its bare , whitewashed lobby . He disappeared into an inner office after a few words in French with a native soldier on duty there , and I read all the French notices on the bulletin board . I do n't know why it is that taxes and rationing should suddenly seem very odd and quite amusing when you read about them in French in the southwest Pacific . I suppose it is partly becauseat that point none of it affects you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Doriett came out . He looked puzzled . " I got Ouan on the phone , " he said . " Phelan was there this morning , had lunch , and started back . Up there it is n't raining at all . Their radar is all O.K. again , and so is their radio . It was just the generator that went a little queer . Hell , Ouan 's only sixty miles from VDN . He ought to be back long ago . Hope to gosh he has n't got into trouble . " " It has n't been raining hard since lunch , " I said . " No , " he said . " But they tell me it rained like hell just before we got here . Well , no use to worry about it . We 'll start back and ask as we go . " He spoke lightly , but I could see that he was really worried and upset . " He 's a fine pilot , I understand , " I said . " Yes , " he said . " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish together with Fish Fry . " We went out and got in the jeep and started back for Val des Naoulis . It began to rain really hard after we 'd gone about five miles , and twenty miles on we picked up five very wet New Zealanders . They said they 'd seen no plane and were on their way back to their camp . Seven men in one jeep is a lot of men , and these New Zealanders were no pygmies . Doriett drove in the side road to their camp and let them off at their gate . " Hope you find your pline okye , " they said . " Much obliged for the ride . " " You 're welcome , " said Doriett . To the guards at the gate he said , " Have n't heard anything of our Cub plane around here , have you ? Lieutenant Phelan ? " " Du n no about anyone called Phelan , " said one of the guards . " But there was something about a pline down . What was that , Alfred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other guard . " You know that black old nigger has the boat at Bouni Cove ? " " Yes , " said Doriett . " The one they call Fish Fry ? " " That 's right , " said Alfred . " Fish Fry . Older than God , they say . He was up here a wile back and reported to the Captain that a small pline went down on the outer reef . Hit hard and blew right up . " " God ! " said Doriett . " What 's been done about it ? " " We sent two medicos out with Fish Fry , " said the guard . " They got out to it , but there was n't nothing left of it . Not a bloody thing . Only hits here and there . The chap was gone . They looked . Found a life jacket , but that was all . I expect the barracudas got to him pretty bloody quick . Hope it 's not one of your boys . " " Hope so , " said Doriett . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Captain phoned it through . The phone 's working again now . A cow fouled with the wire and busted it . That was all . " " Well . Thanks , " said Doriett . " Could I speak to the Captain ? " " Righto , " said Alfred . " Come right along . " Doriett got out and followed the New Zealander and they disappeared into a distant hut . I sat and waited . In about fifteen minutes Doriett came back . He looked white and drawn . " Thanks , " he said to the guard . " Okye , Maijor , " said the New Zealander . " Cheerio . " " So long , " said Doriett , and we drove off again . " I guess that was Phelan , " he said . The rest of the way back to camp Doriett did n't say one more word . He just drove very fast on that bad and slippery road . I knew it was silly to drive so fast , and was serving no possible good purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I felt oddly uncomfortable being with him , as one would feel at finding oneself in a stranger 's house when someone has just died there . Finally , in an absolute downpour of rain , we stopped at the gate to VDN camp . The guard came out of his but and peered at us . " Major ! " he said , " They been trying to get a hold a you . " " Yes , I know , " Doriett said . " Anything new ? " " No , sir , " said the guard . " They all seem to think that was a Cub that went down out there . Fish Fry he came down about half an hour ago with his grandson , the gray-haired one , and said he 'd been out with the New Zealand doctors . " " That 's right , " said Doriett . " I spoke to Captain Williams up there . " " Did they find him ? " the guard asked . " No , " said Doriett . He put the car into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward Operations Building . " Could n't it have been someone else ? " I asked . " No other Cub around here , " he said . At Operations Building we got out and went inside . The Sergeant and about a dozen other men were sitting there , looking glum . " The New Zealander telephoned , " said the Sergeant . " Anything new , sir ? " " Only what you 've heard , " said Doriett : " Has anyone checked with Donbouha ? " Donbouha is the big airfield one hundred miles to the south . " No , sir , " said the Sergeant . " The line 's out there too . But the north line is O.K. now . " " I 'll go down to the camp and try it on the short wave , " said the Major . He started to leave . " Thanks for taking me , " I said . " Oh , come along , " he said . " No , ' I 'll just be in the way . " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He gave me a small and rather shy smile , and I followed him out again to the jeep . While we were crawling and skidding down the road to the construction camp remembered that only this morning Lieutenant Phelan had sat beside me and talked cheerfully to me while I was drawing . It 's funny I should n't have thought of it before , but I had n't . And it made all this seem suddenly very close and real and awful . " Everyone seems to like Phelan a lot , " I said , almost without thinking . " They sure do , " said Doriett . " Gawd Almighty ! " It was addressed to nothing but the air and his thoughts . We turned in at the construction camp . Men were walking round in the deep mud and working on drains ( for it was just built ) , dressed only in a pair of trousers rolled up to the knees . The tents were provided with raised hoard floors and were therefore comparatively dry , but you could see that the floors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled up at a large tent which housed the radio . It was full of men , and they all looked at Doriett as he entered and then looked away again . I 've rarely seen a gloomier lot of faces . Doriett went at once to the Sergeant who sat at the sending apparatus . " Can you get through to Donbouha ? " he said . " I 'm trying now , sir , " said the Sergeant . " But every damned thing seems to have gone screwy to-day , and I ca n't get a response yet . I 'm trying though . " " Keep at it , " said Doriett . A young lieutenant came in then . He carried his boots in his hand and he scraped the mud off his bare feet at the door . " Heard anything , Major ? " he asked . " Nothing definite , " Doriett said . " Sounds like it was Phelan , " said the Lieutenant . " Did you see Fish Fry ? " " No . He around now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fetch him here , will you ? Take my cep . " " Sure will , " said the Lieutenant . He went out again and got into the jeep and put on his boots and drove off , looking quite happy , for he had something to do . We sat there for a while in absolute silence . From time to time the Sergeant , who wore earphones , sent messages on his telegraph key . Then he 'd listen . Finally he spoke . " That 's them , " he said . " Now I got them . " " Good , " said Doriett , and he got up and stood beside him . For a long time no one spoke , but they all watched the Sergeant . While we were waiting a very wet and bedraggled young man walked in , his clothes half torn off him , his trousers tattered , and his legs bleeding from a lot of long , deep scratches . It was Phelan . " Hello , " he said . " Here I am at last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Where in hell you been ? You all right ? " " I 'm damn wet and tired , Major , " said Phelan . " I 'm going to go and change my duds and get me some coffee . " " Damn all , " said Doriett , and he grinned at Phelan and at me and at the rest of the men . They were all grinning too . It was beginning to get dark now , but there was a naked electric light bulb in the tent that made all their faces look very white and happy . " What happened , son ? " " Oh , hell , " said Phelan . " I ran into a fine old rainstorm about halfway home and I guess I got off my course , and by gosh ! I looked ahead when a cloud opened up a minute and there was old Mont de Gaiac right spang ahead of me and me headed for her . I said to myself , This is no place to be , ' and I pulled her round . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the clouds shut in again and I set my baby down in that . Boy , I 'm telling you , Major , I just made it . But she never got a scratch . " " Jeepers , " said Doriett . " Yes , sir , " said Phelan . " Then I beat my way the hell nut of there on foot and through all those briars and brambles and I tore the hell out of my clothes and my skin . Look at me . I took three hours to hit the damn road . Got a lift in and here I am  --  and hungry ! " " I 'll take you back , " Doriett said . " The jeep ' 11 he here in a minute . " " I certainly do n't want to walk any farther to-day , " said Phelan . Just as he said this the jeep came tearing through the mud and stopped in a long skid near the tent and out hopped the Lieutenant . " He 's here , Major , " he shouted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's O.K. " " Yeah , I 'm here and O. K. , " said Phelan . " Holy Crow ! " said the Lieutenant . " You sure scared hell out of us . " " Scared hell out of myself , " said Phelan . " Come on , " said Doriett , and he started for the jeep . I followed him and so did Phelan and the Lieutenant , and we all got in Doriett started the engine . As he did so the Sergeant came to the door . " I got Donbouha , " he said . " it was one of their Cubs . " " Oh , " said Doriett . " Oh . yes . Too bad . Tell ' em we 'll try to find the guy when the rain lets up . " " Yes , sir , " said the Sergeant : " What 's all this ? " said Phelan . " Oh , some plane crashed on the Barrier Reef and blew up . I guess the poor guy got eaten by barracudas . " " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Du n no , " said the Major . " Some poor bastard from Donbouha . Boy , I sure am glad to see you again ! The boys were worried about you . " " You going right to the Hotel Vanderbilt first ? " asked the Lieutenant . " Yeah . I 've got to change my clothes , " said Phelan . " I 've got some whisky there , " said the Lieutenant . " I got it of those Liberafor boys last night . We 'll have a slug . " " No , " said Doriett . " We 'll stop by the Operations first . The boys 'll want to see Phelan . Then we 'll go there . " " O.K. , " said Phelan . " My God , did you think it was me on the reef ? " " Yes , " said Doriett . " Sure had us gloomy for a while . " " Well , it 's O.K. now , " said the Lieutenant . " Say , we might go fishing tomorrow if we have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea , " said the Major . I said nothing . I remembered it , though , as an epitaph for the unknown man that the barracudas had got to so bloody quick . SONG OF THE CHANCES OF WAR JOHN PUDNEY RINGING glass And drowning sailor .
