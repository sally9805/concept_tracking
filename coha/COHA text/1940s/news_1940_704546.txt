txt Modernizing the Elevated Good Use Might Be Made of the Roads , It Is Held , With a Few Changes To THIS EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Elevated railways in the city undoubtedly would win back much lost patronage by the use of light-weight , attractively streamlined and noiseless cars . Were some of the new cars open ones for Summer use more passengers would use the elevated facilities . As suggested by a recent correspondent of THE TIMES it would be impractical to connect the Ninth Avenue Elevated with the present Putnam division without a change of cars . A better suggestion would be for a New York , Westchester &; Putnam Railroad authority to buy up this line from the New York Central and operate it . This public agency then could put rapid transit cars on the Yonkers branch , electrify and double-track and eliminate the grade crossings on the main line between Van Cortlandt Park Junction and Brewster , the northern end of the line . Free transfers between the elevated and this authority could be issued for rides within the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be set for a joint ride on the elevated and the authority line . The New York Central might be asked to use the money received from the sale for further electrification of its Harlem Division above White Plains . It is impractical and unnecessary to connect the Harlem Division with the Second Avenue Elevated because of heavy freight and through passenger service and the existence of the defunct Boston &; Westchester line . The city section of this line is now to be run by the city . To eliminate the interference with street traffic and their ugliness , the writer believes the present elevated structures could be profitably and logically converted into a treed embankment type instead of the present pillar and column type . Provision on the remodeled structures could be made for four tracks instead of three and for the underpassing of the side streets . The street on either side of the embankment could be considerably widened . These changes could be made gradually as the finances of the city permitted . Some sections along the remodeled elevated routes could be set aside for public housing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use and the remainder for highclass business establishments . Given equal or superior equipment the elevateds are as fast as the subways and in addition have the advantage of natural light and fresh air . Modernization instead of destruction and building of substitute facilities is the answer to the elevated question . ROBERT C. EUSTACE . New York , Feb. 28 , 1940 . Repeal of State Law Urged Property Qualification for Town Office Regarded as Undemocratic TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : In the interest of forwarding the democratic process in this State , may I invite attention to the need for repealing Section 23 of the Town Law of New York State ? This provision , a hold-over from the days of property qualifications for voters , remains a vestige of landed aristocracy in local government . The substance of the provision is that only those who are owners of record of real property are eligible for elective town office and they must remain owners throughout the term of office . We have eliminated the poll tax and the personal property tax in this State ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ballot , proposed in New Jersey , will probably find little support in New York . But more than purely defensive measures are necessary . Democratic government must advance , and it can only do so by enlarging the scope of participation by its constituents . The worthy , intelligent and responsible citizen of a town should not be deprived of the privilege - of holding elective office because he does not own real estate . Such ownership never was and never will be any criterion of ability or responsibility for holding public office . It is a deterrent to the development of the democratic process in the local unit of government where it must be nurtured and preserved , the town . The property qualifications for holding public office in the towns of New York State ( Section 23 ) should be repealed . It is to be hoped that such action will soon be taken . HENRY EPSTEIN . Albany , N. Y. , Feb. 29 , 1940 . Defending Anthony 's Nose To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : We note with great interest your editorial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the efforts to save Anthony 's Nose from destruction in the collecting of traprock . We feel that you have made a real contribution to the cause of conservation of our natural resources for future generations in giving prominence to this move . The Izaak Walton League shared definitely in the efforts to save Bull Hill , otherwise known as Mount Taurus , and appreciates the difficulty in arousing public sentiment to realize the value of protecting such natural features .

In a dispatch from Tulsa the announcement is made that the U.S.S.R. has just purchased forty fast , mobile oil-drilling rigs at a cost of $2,000,000 . Paradoxically , , the same issue of the newspaper carried stories of efforts to raise money to help Finland . Do we want to strengthen Russia 's and Germany 's war machines at this time ? If we do not , why can not the State Department ask that company refrain from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked the airpl --  -- manufacturers and more recently thmolybdenum producers to refrain ? le we show our distaste for people who bomb civilians by refusing to sell them airplanes to do the bombing and materials for making bombs , then is it not faintly illogical to sell them gasoline to fuel those bombers and oil rigs to find the gasoline ?

Canal Tolls Defended Charged to Private Users They Would It Is Held , Help Ease Tax Burden To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The letter from Bernard Haldane in THE TIMES of Feb. 24 is a perfect example of the fallacious economic reasoning of the typical inland waterway advocate . He states that New York City 's trade with the West was secured by the opening up of the State Barge Canal in 1827 ; that when the railroads were built , and proved their superiority ( as to speed , at least ) to the canal , tolls were exacted . on goods moved by railroad , so as , in effect , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good work horse was starved in order to feed a white elephant . Further , that it was only when the railroads merged , and exerted their strength , that the tolls on goods moved by rail were removed . Regardless of the political justification ( i. e. , holding trade at the expense of Boston ) of levying the tolls in the first place , it is a question if they ever truly benefited city or State , since inevitably they were added to the rail cost of transportation which the shipper , had to pay . Had this purely arbitrary increased cost not been added , it is likely that goods to the consumer would . have been cheaper , more would have been sold and moved , and more business , work and wealth created in the State . The advocates of tolls on the barge canal want them because they believe that it is only fair that the private enterprises which get the tax-supported. benefits of the lower canal rates should help the State pay for those benefits . Some years ago the Commissioner of Public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved over the railroads all the freight that had moved over the canal in the preceding year , and had paid the regular rail rates for the service , the State would have saved . several hundred thousand dollars as compared with what it actually cost for carrying charges , maintenance , etc. , on the canal for the same year . When New York State has space to rent to private owners in the buildings it owns , it does not , nor should it , invite them to move in , rent free . Why , then , should it give its canal facilities free to private users ( at the expense of its taxpayers ) , especially when it has never been demonstrated that the savings accruing to the users are passed on through lowered prices to consumers ? May I remind Mr. Haldane that the railroads pay all their own costs , including right of way , track , bridges , and maintenance on them , and that in addition they pay heavy taxes on their properties and equipment to State , counties and cities for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the State . Tolls charged private users would in a measure make up this tax loss and help ease the heavy tax burden of the citizens . J. FILEDORA . West Brighton , S. I. , Feb. 28 , 1940 . More Library Funds Asked TO THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : This year the trustees of the New York Public Library , the Brooklyn Public Library and the Queens Borough Public Library are again asking for slight increase in appropriations to replenish depleted book stocks and to be able to grant increases to public library employes . As was brought out in the report of the Citizens Committee on the Status of Librarians of the Public Libraries of the City of New York , published in 1939 , the employes of the libraries have had no general salary increases since 1930 , enjoy no annual increments and are paid at a rate far lower than that of city employes of similar training and responsibilities . The people have demonstrated in the past that they fully support the adequate maintenance of the public libraries and equitable salaries for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell the Mayor and the Board of Estimate that they approve the budget requests of the trustees of the public libraries for the coming year , Which include $120 general salary increases and increased book appropriations ? $500,000 for Manhattan and Brooklyn and $100,008 for Queens .
