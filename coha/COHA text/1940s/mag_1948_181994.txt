The two men best qualified to measure Europe 's progress toward peace and economic health reported their finding to the U.S. last week in a glow of confidence . One was ECAdministrator Paul Hoffman , who was off on another round of talks in Europe , announcing " spectacular " results . Said Hoffman : " The complete recovery of Western Europe can be expected by 1952 even if the Soviet satellites continue to block trade between Eastern and Western Europe . " The other report came from General Lucius Clay , home on a 27-hour visit from his headquarters in Germany to make his first direct report to the U.S. people on the Battle for Berlin . <P> Facts &; Figures . Brisk and beaming at an early morning press conference , General Clay scattered the good news like bird shot . In Western Germany , he said , " there has been an almost unbelievable recovery . " The airlift into beleaguered Berlin , he said , now carried 5,000 tons of food and fuel a day during good weather and 3,000 " under very bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supplied through the winter ; besides , he had wangled 66 additional C-54s for the airlift ( see Armed Forces ) . <P> That night , in a speech broadcast from Manhattan , General Clay supplied more facts &; figures to explain his confidence . In the four months since the Allied currency reform was put into effect , he reported , the total production of Western Germany had risen a staggering 35% . Steel production was up from an annual rate of 2,500,000 to 7,000,000 tons ; coal , from 275,000 tons to more than 300,000 tons a day . Said Clay : " Everywhere labor and management have new hope , and soon Germany 's recovery will be felt in filling the trade vacuum which has existed in Western Europe . " <P> Stability &; Peace . Though Russia had attempted to snuff out these gains by clamping down on Berlin , " the Soviet planners , " said Clay , " failed to recognize our strength in the air . . . The airlift to Berlin is not a makeshift operation . It is a well organized , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentials for the people of Berlin indefinitely . . . Our airmen . . . have not wavered in bad weather ; nor in the face of contemptible threats . . . <P> " It is true that the airlift is expensive in terms of dollars . Measured in terms of prestige , measured in the courage which it has brought to millions of people who desire freedom , measured indeed in comparison to our expenditures for European assistance and to our expenditures for national defense , its cost is insignificant . It can , it must , be continued until there is a stability in Europe which assures peace . " General Clay did not try to guess when that time would come . But last week he thought he could see the light at the end of the tunnel . Said he : " There is no easy road to lasting peace . It can not come overnight . Nor can it be obtained by written agreements left to be interpreted by each participant in his own way . It can only come about when the free peoples of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own freedoms ; and that day is approaching rapidly . " <P> . . .
