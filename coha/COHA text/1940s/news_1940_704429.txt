txt Declaring that the country 's tax system had reached the point where it would topple over unless revision were speedily undertaken , Mayor La Guardia made a strong plea yesterday for centralization of the taxing power in the Federal Government , with rebates to the individual States in proportion to the amount of taxes they paid . Speaking at a luncheon meeting of the New York Board of Trade at the Hotel Astor , the Mayor devoted forty minutes to a review of the existing tax structure and his recommendations for its simplification . He stressed the tax barriers that have grown up between the States , and said this increasing trend must be checked in the interests of tLe country as a whole . He argued for a clear distinction between the tax sources tapped by the Federal Government and those tapped by the States , and an equally distinct separation between State and city sources . Application of these separations , he said , would relieve the taxpayer of his present harassment in reporting to a number of taxing units ; would equalize taxation between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of collecting taxes . Idea Called 15 Years Old " There is nothing original in this idea , " he said. , " It has been under discussion for fifteen years . There are three remedies suggested : first , a division of sources of taxation , which is not sufficient to meet the situation because the sources , after all , remain the same . Second , the proposal that the States collect taxes and credit a share to the Federal Government ? and we 'll certainly keep shy of that one . The third is that the Federal Government collect taxes and give credit on all these sources to the States . I urge a combination of the first and third methods , so that taxes which are purely local , such as admission taxes and club taxes , could be collected locally . " There was a time when customs and excise taxes sufficed for the expenses of the Federal Government ; in fact , on two occasions the national government distributed some of these funds to the States . ' But them days is gone forever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among the States , the Mayor pointed out that the fifteen States that had no income tax were certainly in a more advantageous position than the thirty-three that imposed such levies . Tobacco taxes were collected in twenty-six States , ranging from half a mill to two mills on each cigarette sold , he said . Taxes on alcohol showed similar incongruities , and the city 's stock transfer tax had resulted in driving brokerage transactions to Boston and Chicago , where no such impost was levied , he said . " Something must be done about this , " the Mayor declared .. " In 1932 the National Tax Association paid considerable attention to this problem , and Robert Murray Haig , Professor of Political Economy . at Columbia University , told the 1932 conference that ' all taxes may be assigned to the Federal Government , which will then proceed to subsidize the States . This is so radical a proposal that no one has dared to advance it . ' I do , today . But I. would not say ' subsidize , ' because the States ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that all taxes may be collected by the Federal Government , which would then allow credit to the States . " The Mayor said the mechanism for this operation was already ' established-by the 1926 Federal Inheritance Tax , which reads : " The tax imposed by this section shall be credited with the amount of any estate , inheritance , legacy or succession taxes actually paid to any State- or Territory or the District of Columbia , in respect of any property included in the gross estate . The credit allowed by this subdivision shall not exceed 80 per centum of the tax imposed by this section , and shall include only such taxes as were actually paid and credit therefor claimed within three years after the filing of the return required by Section 304 . " Principle Widely Applicable Mayor La Guardia said the same principle could be applied to tobacco , alcohol , income levies and other tax fields in which the cities and States now join with the Federal Government . " You wo n't hear this subject discussed by candidates , " the Mayor told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't please every one on taxation . All candidates will promise to reduce taxation , but we can actually bring relief by an intelligent , scientific system of taxation . " As ' a beginning the Mayor said distinctions might be set up between the taxing fields used by the city - and those used by New York State . He recalled that the State had taken away $12,000,000 of the $18,000,000 a year raised by , the city 's tax on utilities , and had also put a two-cent levy on each package of cigarettes after the city had laid a one-cent impost on cigarette sales to raise relief money . He ex -- pressed the hope that the Legislature would give close attention to this matter at its current session . The Board of Trade , with 500 members present at the luncheon , adopted a long resolution seeking modification of the Wagner act " to correct the labor strife which is now doing so much to retard the orderly processes of industrial and social improvement . " Although the United States Supreme Court had upheld the technical legality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said Congress was the proper agency to remove inequities in the law . The resolution asked for a fresh start on a labor code that would - afford equal protection to the rights of labor , employers-and the general public .
