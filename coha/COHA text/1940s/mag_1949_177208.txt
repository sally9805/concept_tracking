Oh , Mr. Trimingham ! Oh , Mr. Trimingham ! These Americans have made me mighty sore . <P> We 've done everything we know To relieve them of their dough , But the blighters seem to still have plenty more ! <P> The bittersweet words of Mr. Trimingham and Mr. Trott , a jingle attributed to a U.S. Navyman on duty in expensive Bermuda in World War II ( and sung to the tune of Mr. Gallagher and Mr. Shean ) , were being cheerfully chorused in Bermudian cabarets almost every night last week . In a crowded paradise almost 90% dependent on the money which tourists bring in , merchants and hotelkeepers were collecting their highest prices ever-while U.S. tourist traffic boomed along toward a record season . <P> During the week 640 pleasure-bent visitors arrived from New York aboard the luxury liner Queen of Bermuda , 1,323 more came in by Pan American clipper and other airliners . Confident that 60,000 tourists would flock this year to their shops and hotels , their pink beaches and hibiscus-hedged lanes , a few Bermudians had even given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> It now cost $12 to $28 a day , American plan , to stay at one of the bigger hotels in the Bermuda Hotel Assn. ( president : Sir Howard Trott ) . This was less than Miami or Nassau charge , but far more than people paid in Bermuda 's prewar horse &; buggy days . Some of the fanciest price-boosting had occurred along Hamilton 's staid Front and Queen Streets . Trimingham Bros , asked $24.24 for English flannel slacks that sold prewar for $9.60 . <P> The Bermudians were only following U.S. resort practices in charging what the traffic would bear . They also had to pay higher prices themselves for their imports from England . But there were some who suspected that automobiles and inflated prices were spoiling the old place . " They 're killing the golden goose , " growled an old U.S. visitor . " It costs us 150% more to live here than at home . " A warning came from H. J. ( " Jack " ) Tucker , manager of the Bank of Bermuda : " Tourists do n't need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indies real estate to the south , with a view to clearing out before the bust . But for the time being , with more &; more tourists ready to pay fancy prices , the Bermuda boom was on .
