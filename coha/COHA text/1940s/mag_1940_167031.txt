One afternoon last fortnight in Topeka , Kans. , a lamb-faced , inoffensive oilman was called to the telephone , invited to lunch at the White House with the President . Alfred Mossman Landon , titular chief of the Republican Party , came away worried . He had just issued a statement praising the President 's defense speech . Through the U. S. press blew high , windy talk of national unity . It was known that Mr. Roosevelt had offered Republican Frank Knox-for the second time-the Secretaryship of the Navy . It was reported that the Labor portfolio had been offered to New York City 's baggy , electric Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia . It was quite possible that Mr. Landon was next on the list . <P> Mousy Mr. Landon sniffed the smell of cat . If this kind of thing kept on , G. O. P. leadership would be captured by the New Deal . Mr. Landon gnawed over the situation with Ohio 's Favorite Son Robert A. Taft , in Topeka on tour . After five hours of hard discussion , Mr. Landon called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denounced coalition as a political trick . Feeling easier in his mind , he entrained for Chicago and the East . <P> At the White House Mr. Landon 's statement was digested . Presently Brigadier General Edwin M. ( " Pa " ) Watson . White House secretary , telephoned Topeka to call off the lunch . Mr. Landon was finally found in Chicago . He was told that the White House luncheon was off . Mr. Landon allegedly said he was n't hungry anyway . <P> The incident got an exceptionally bad press . Franklin Roosevelt read the papers over his breakfast coffee , grabbed the telephone , and himself called Mr. Landon . The Kansan , in a press conference , was at the peak of a denunciation of Term III . Everybody had muffed everything , said the President mellowly ; he always liked to eat lunch with Mr. Landon whenever he happened to pass through Washington . Mr. Landon , 835 miles away in Chicago , just gulped , then entrained for Washington . <P> Apprehensive Republicans steeled Alf Landon for the dangerous lunch . Collar askew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House , reappeared almost two hours later , said : " We talked of shoes and ships and sealing-wax , of cabbages and kings . " " Cabinets and kings ? " asked a reporter . Cabbages , said Mr. Landon . He went back to his hotel room , there dictated another vigorous blast against a Third Term . Mr. Roosevelt could have national unity , he said , if he would at once renounce Term III . This statement went big with all G. O. P. leaders , drew a laudatory press . <P> Mr. Roosevelt was irked . From the White House came harsh words : " The President regrets that he has no time , just now , to give to the preparation of political statements . He is too busily engaged with problems of far greater national importance . . . . " <P> Coalition in any political sense was dead . This seemed to be all right with everybody . The U. S. , impatient with politics , wanted not coalition but non-partisan unity behind a vast national effort to arm the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy was still possible ; a more likely possibility was that New York City 's Mayor LaGuardia would become Secretary of War , in place of Harry Woodring , who had vowed to stay until he was kicked out .
