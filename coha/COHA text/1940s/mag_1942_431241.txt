20  | Most people are in some sort of business , and most people make a great fuss over their own line . We do n't talk much about ours , but it is mighty important just the same . It keeps us on the job twentyfour hours a day , seven days a week , and no vacations . Our business is getting well . Who are " we " ? A million and more invalids in hospitals throughout the land . We are the people with tuberculosis , with cancer and strained hearts , with arthritis and anemia and serious digestive troubles . We are victims of accidents by tornado , flood , and the carelessness of man . We are convalescents from wasting pneumonia , scarlet fever , typhoid , and a thousand other bugs and growths and follies and poisons . To outsiders we are a grim lot . Week after week , month after month , and sometimes year after year our world is four walls and a window . Presumably we are in pain half the time , very low in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the time . We are supposed to be oppressed by fear of death and bitter with a sense of uselessness . Friends are resigned about invalids like us . " Poor Emma ! " they 'll say . " Still in that ghastly hospital . " Chances are that Emma does not deserve to be " poored . " Chances are that Emma , like most of us , is too busy getting well to fret over being sick . Busy how ? Well , there is routine , to start with . We are experts at it . We know to the second when the sun will set , when the Rocket will whistle at the Pearl Street grade , when Elmer Davis comes on , when the Army trainers fly over on exercises . That rumble-clatter at 9 P.M. is the town street sweeper . Each night at 11 : 10 a car stands five minutes at the corner with motor running and then moves off quietly ; it is the local patrol . The grass is mown Wednesday , the hedge clipped Thursday . Joe cuts hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water at 7 A.M. , breakfast at 8 : 15 , mail at 9:50 , milk at 10:55 , doctor at 11 , rest hour at 2 . It sounds deadly and would be if it were invariable . But it is n't . It is constantly breaking down , and when it does , it is like front-page news . The other evening we missed the rumble-clatter of the street sweeper at 9 P. M. What had happened ? The street-sweeping machine had got stuck in a ditch . Another evening nobody came at back-rub time . It turned out that all the nurses were down the hall pleading with an old lady . She had set out to eat a ball of yarn and already had swallowed several feet of it . Hospital employes are not supposed to discuss patients with other patients . Nurses and orderlies are cautious with newcomers ; but the lid soon flies off , and the newcomers join the inner circle . No other gossip is as lush as hospital gossip . Over a few invalid months I have learned more of human affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which doctor is sweet on what nurse and exactly when they were last seen together and where . I know a woman with only nine toes and another who screams at the sight of prunes . I have a good idea what hope looks like , and a man I meet in the bathroom now and then is all I care to see of despair . They tell me he has n't much the matter with him except a feeling that he 's in the way . Most of the gossip is cheerful ? indispensable in our business of getting well .  | It is cheering news to hear that young Mrs. Jones can have her baby after all . It is tonic to know that the man in 310 wears ski socks in bed . Surgeons find the oddest things in the most conservative stomachs ? a brass button labeled " JFD " in Mrs. Snodgrass ' , a buffalo nickel in Mr. Brown 's . Mrs. Snodgrass is mum about JFD . Mr. Brown claims he swallowed his nickel in ' 06 during the Frisco fire . He insists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until 1913 . The other day I had a visitor , her face awash with anxiety . " I ca n't stay but a minute , " she said . " Hospitals give me the willies . All these awful noises ! How can you bear it ? " Very few of us here mind the gurgles and groans any more than a riveter minds the racket . We 've all done our share of groaning , and a hospital is the perfect place in which to do it . Some noises are too interesting to be upsetting . I 'd miss it if the mad Russian in 330 stopped sounding like a train on a trestle every time he clears his throat . Every job has a knack to it , and the knack of staying in bed for six months or more is simple , like most knacks , once you get the hang of it . The first thing to do is to forget about everything you 're used to doing that ca n't be done in bed . Instead , here is a new world to conquer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The human mind is such a wondrous thing that four walls and a window can be more than enough . My walls are of brick ? thirty-six rows from top to bottom ? and the bricks came from a kiln south of here owned by a Mormon whose father had seven wives . My bed is in an alcove formed mainly of five windows . On four tables beside my bed are the tools of my business ? an atlas , a radio , a World Almanac , dozens of pencils and notebooks , bird guides , binoculars , novels and histories , a plant or two , a couple of goldfish ? the things all invalids collect . I am not going to pretend that I can look in my fifty-cent atlas and feel the taste of a mango in my mouth while the monsoon cools my brow . I 'm not a fellow who can put down a novel and imagine the room full of sperm whales , white rajahs , or luscious debutantes . Those goldfish never pay the slightest attention to me , though I bought them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I 'd write a book on our experiences . And yet you ca n't have my goldfish or  | my snake ashtray or my Mexican violet or anything else on my four tables . I am as tenaciously fond of each of them as I used to be fond ( and will be again ) of my old car , my Number Five iron , and a no-account bird dog named Princess They are my pals , companions of my business hours , which , as I have said . include all my hours . They are beside me on long excursions into the past ; they worry with me about Australia and Iceland , and they share my indignation when the liver comes in burned . I study some , read some , write some . I look out the windows . I know all about the little boy across the street , who for six months has been trying to learn how to crack a bull whip . Every week or so the whip backfires and bites off a pied of him , and he howls bloody murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days later he is out trying to crack again . There are birds outside my windows . Until a few months ago I thought all big birds were robins and all small birds were sparrows and what of it . Well . I have changed . I guess I have become what you might call a bird lover ? not a St. Francis or a John Kieran perhaps but an average enthusiast . I have knocked over more than one cup of coffee grabbing for my binoculars at mealtime . I wo n't easily forget the day I first laid eyes on a hairy woodpecker or an evening grosbeak . One sweet thing I see much of front my window is human devotion . Almost every day some young man tramps the walk below , back and forth , waiting : -a know what only time and doctors ? ; tell . There are old trampers , too , facia more serious consequences than babies Is there a certain way a man has of walking when he thinks about how he loves somebody and how he is afraid for that somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is an alikeness in the way these anxious people walk . HERE must be fifty men and women getting well long-term on this floor . I would like to tell you that all fifty of them are busy as bees with fifty different varieties of ingenious enterprise . Unfortunately , this is not the case . The ' proportion of progressive minds among invalids is as small as among well people Perhaps half a dozen have specialties . A fellow my age down the hall took up needlework last year and now gets good prices for what he makes . Close by me is a cattleman , who toils five hours a day on a vast chart of bloodlines . His son is to break down the pedigrees into exact mathematics and then draw up a breeding program that will produce nothing but top-price animals . The little man : r. 306 has become an expert magician ? h act worked out entirely on invalid time . Nothing is as bad for us whose business is getting well as your pity . Our main business ethic is not to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yo. : . We came here seriously ill , and we are getting well . We came here in various degrees of terror or uncertainty , and the strongest of us could not help suspecting that perhaps the sun was sinking , love dying , flowers fading , beauty and work and pleasure about over . We were bound to have such thoughts ; but now we know we are getting well ! So what of these dreary days of confinement by four walls and a window ? Is the path dreary to the foot of the rainbow ? THE END
