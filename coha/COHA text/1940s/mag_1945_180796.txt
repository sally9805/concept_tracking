Premier Kantaro Suzuki held another emergency meeting with his Cabinet , conferred with Japan 's elder statesmen , ex-Premiers Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma , Admiral Keisuke Okada , Prince Fumimaro Konoye , Koki Hirota , Generals Hideki Tojo and Kuniaki Koiso . He called on the Emperor Hirohito , bowed reverentially , and reported , according to Radio Tokyo , on a " general jurisdictional matter . " <P> The Premier and his ministers now held only shadow authority . And the Emperor seemed to be completely in the hands of the war lords . For the war lords hold the three key posts at court : Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal ( Marquis Kido , military puppet ) ; Grand Chamberlain to the Emperor ( Admiral Hisanori Fujita ) ; and Imperial Household Minister ( former Finance Minister Ishiwata , long a military stooge ) . They decide who is to have access to the Emperor , what he shall do , what documents he shall approve by affixing his seal . <P> There is no precedent in modern Japanese history for direct personal rule by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last month . What drove Japanese leaders to take this step is not certain . It may be that there is agitation in Japan-unrest and longing for peace . To unite the people for a resistance at home , it may have been necessary to invoke the Emperor 's personal prestige . <P> But this was a dangerous step for Japanese leaders to take , for it compromised the throne . Since the people have been told that the Emperor is ruling them personally , it would be difficult for Hirohito not to assume responsibility for defeat . Apparently the war lords were ready to drag the Emperor down with them . Hirohito would be finished , and so would the whole Imperial institution . The Japanese war lords could scarcely have reached this decision except from desperation .
