txt ' As Thousands Cheer ' It 's time to give the boys a hand when they take off for action . Our present sausage-grinder embarkation is not inspiring to troops or civilians . A rousing band with thousands cheering support to the men on their way in combat equipment is at least recogni- tion of their undertakings . How long would a John L. Lewis picket line last with 5,000 of these troops marching by on their way to war ? Our public recognition of what these boys are under .. taking is the strongest possible incentive to stay on our job here ? kill strikes , buy more war bonds and write more appropriate marching music to be carried overseas . Sailing need not follow closely enough to be helpful to the enemy . HENRY S. LIPPINCOTT . New York , Feb. 21 , 1944.
