COVER MAN By JACK ALEXANDER ORMAN ROCKWELL , whose series of paintings on the Four Freedoms will begin in the Post next week , discovered the Century of the Common Man a generation before the states-men did . This was appropriate enough , for great painters  --  and great novelists , poets and essayists ? have always jumped the gun on history while the political leaders were squatting back on their haunches awaiting an audible signal or a signifi-cantly planted boot . Intuition is a wonderful thing . Rockwell 's Century of the Common Man began in the early spring of 1916 when he was a skinny , twenty-one-year-old artist dabbling around a studio in New Rochelle , New York . He was worrying along blithely on fifty dollars a month which a boys ' magazine was paying him for drawing the cover of each issue , illustrating two stories and performing the duties of art editor . It was a thankless grind , and his studio mate , a cartoonist named Clyde Forsythe , kept telling him he ought to be aiming , instead , at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Post . " Gosh , the Post , " was all young Rockwell said at first . But the idea stuck in his mind like a bur and he soon began experimenting with sketches . They were pictures of unreal , glorified girls dawdling around with collar-ad men . The Post , Forsythe PHOTOGRAPHY BY R. F. GARLAND 16 advised him paternally , did n't use that kind of cover ; it wanted scenes showing real people in simple , everyday story situations . Forsythe was pretty well established as a newspaper artist and knew the ropes . Under the pseudonym of Vic , he was drawing a popular sports-page comic strip based upon the adventures of a ham prize fighter named Axel and his manager , Flooey ? Vic 's current strip , Joe finks , is its lineal descendant . Rockwell bowed to superior knowledge , and did two paintings on the subject he knew best  --  boys . He added a rough sketch of a third . Although scared at his own brashness , young Rockwell prepared cannily for his call in Philadelphia . He was , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fingers tangled in the string while untying a package . To avoid such a fiasco and also to impress the art editor , he had a harness maker build a big wooden case for his paintings . Except for the fact that it was covered with black oilcloth , the case might easily have been mistaken for a child 's casket . But it opened and shut easily , and had a simple latch . The then art editor , Walter H. Dower , received the paintings and the rough sketch with a look of mild amazement at Rockwell 's carrying case and took them into his private office . Rockwell , with his case across his knees , sat nervously and waited for the verdict , looking like one of his subsequent cover subjects . He glanced at the walls of the ante-room and saw hanging there originals by well-known Post artists . That gave him a sinking feeling . Two men , who , he later learned , were Irvin S. Cobb and Samuel G. Blythe , sauntered through the room and stopped . Rockwell stared at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lap . With exaggerated frowns , they walked around and around it . Just then Dower came out of his office and said he was buying both the paintings and wanted Rockwell to go ahead with the sketch idea . Further , he said , he had consulted George Horace Lorimer , the editor , and they had decided that they ought to have three more covers from the new artist . Dazed , Rockwell accepted a check Dower proffered and got up to leave . Cobb stopped him . " Young man , he said , pointing to the box , " is that a coffin ? " Rockwell mumbled that it was n't . " That 's good , " said Cobb . " We were afraid you had a body in it . " Cobb and Blythe laughed , and Dower laughed , and , the strain having been broken , Rockwell laughed too . When he got outside , he sent a dutiful telegram to Forsythe and went to Atlantic City and celebrated . The happy outcome of Rockwell 's self-introduction to the Post resulted in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the art editor , or his assistant , to any artist bringing his wares to the editorial offices . It was love at first sight between Rockwell and the Post , and today the affair is going as strongly as ever . The first Rockwell cover appeared on the Post of May 20 , 1916 , and his cover on the last Christmas number was the 216th . Editors and associate editors have come and gone in that time , and the present ones are as enthusiastic over Rockwell as their predecessors . iRockwell , for his part , has never wavered in his attachment to the Post and its traditions . He has ( Continued on Page 37 ' retained his pristine awe for it as an American institution and his wonderment over the fact that a kid artist could walk unheralded into its offices and have his talent immediately recognized . Year after year , he has gone on portraying the Common Man on this magazina.s jacket  --  and the Common Man 's wife , his children , his pastor , his doctor , his garage mechanic , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his dog and his neighbors . Rockwell 's Common Man was earthily American . He raised no clenched fist and carried no banner demanding anything , and he did n't incite anyone to riot . It is doubtful if the artist would have recognized the term " social significance " if someone had bellowed it at him from a platform . But social significance his covers bad , because his characters wore the natural dignity of the ordinary man who prefers to carry his own weight , if given the chance . The Four Freedoms Rockwell liked his characters and he painted them with sympathy and a decent humor , never with the stark distortion of his more arty contemporaries . " I guess I am a storyteller , " he says now , in discussing his work , " and although this may not be the highest form of art it is what I love to do . " Because Rockwell breathed affection into his paintings , they aroused affection in the heart of the beholder , and one was dull indeed who did not comprehend that the Common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Rockwell covers were obvious enough . Through the masterly indirection of the artist , the Common Man asked only his rights as an American and silently pledged his faith in the promise of his country and in the system under which he lived and raised his family . The Four Freedoms , which have hitherto been brought home to the people only in cold type , have been freshened by Rockwell with the warmth of feeling , the minute detail , the imagination and the fine draughtsmanship which have made American classics of his Post illustrations . And while the Freedoms are couched in the American idiom which Rockwell knows so well , they will have a universality of appeal which should strike fire among freedom-loving people everywhere . For Rockwell 's men are not Hollywood heroes , his girls are not Powers models and his boys are not flaxen-haired angels . They are real people , marked by the attritional processes of life , and they are faithfully rendered to the last wrinkle , callus , crow's-foot , shoulder stoop and irregular nose line . They are people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; who have hungered and have sometimes feasted ; who have spoken their minds in meeting and have prayed , in the confidence that their words were as important as those of a president or king ; who have kept alive in their hearts the hope of a constantly improving world . They are the masses . Some other professed spokesmen for them have used the cynical paintbrush or the strident larynx . Rockwell , with the sure perception of the great artist , has made their dreams sing by helping to make America conscious of its quiet strength , that strength which must mean so much to the postwar world . Post readers , writing in , often say , " He understands us , " and no interpreter could win higher praise . So true is the Rockwell portrayal that mention of his models is sometimes used in lieu of words themselves . Witness a New York Times reporter last December describing a fellow passenger in an Army plane thus , " A small private sitting behind me , who might have posed for one of Norman Rockwell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie Gillis come true ! Once a year or so , Rockwell leaves his home in Arlington , Vermont , and lectures at the Art Students ' League or the Illustrators ' Society in New York City . He is one of the few visiting lecturers who always talk to a packed gathering . As an artist unaffected by any current fad and intent only on straight portrayal of American life , he is something of a curiosity , but students sit at his feet solely to learn something about his remarkable technique . These visits are homecomings for Rockwell . He was horn and spent his childhood on Manhattan 's Upper West Side , where he was a choir boy at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine . He inherited artistic talent from his father , a cotton-goods merchant who was an amateur sketcher , and from his maternal grandfather , Thomas Hill , an English artist who emigrated to this country . Hill , who was fairly well known , specialized in portrayals of his clients ' favorite dogs or roosters , hair by hair and feather by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail may trace hack to his grandfather . In his paintings , Rockwell never fakes a detail . If a setting calls for a Colonial bedstead or footstool , he haunts auctions or antique shops until he gets what he wants . He gets his dog models from the nearest dog pound because , he says , the inmates have taken a beating from life and have character . He paints from live human models wearing clothing taken from a wardrobe of 200-odd costumes he keeps on hand . When traveling , he constantly adds to the wardrobe . In the collection is a battered hat he bought for two dollars from a guide who was taking him through Death Valley . It has appeared in four Post covers , to date . On the Trail of Old Clothes Rockwell says that a hat can not be aged artificially ; it needs plenty of sweat and sunlight . A few years ago , while in the vicinity of Hannibal , Missouri , preparing to illustrate special editions of Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn , he hailed a farmer who was plowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw in four dollars to boot . Eager to make money the easy way , but suspicious that he was dealing with a genial maniac , the farmer insisted on getting the four dollars in advance . Rockwell got out of his car and handed it over , and under a tree they silently detrotisered themselves and made the exchange . Rockwell drove away well satisfied ; he had added a superbly weather-beaten pair of pants to his collection . As a boy , Rockwell was always sketching , and when he was in his second year of high school he quit and entered the Art Students ' League , where he came under the tutelage of an eminent teacher , George Bridgeman . At seventeen , he was illustrating children 's books for a New York publishing firm and at eighteen he worked into the boys ' - magazine job he was holding down when he made his Post debut , in 1916 . A year after his first Post cover had appeared , the United States declared war on Germany , and Rockwell , outwardly an almost giddy lad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to enlist in the Navy . The ( Continued an Page 39 ) ( Continued from Page 37 ) recruiting office turned him down because he was eight pounds underweight . Overnight , the candidate gorged himself on an appalling diet of bananas , warm water and doughnuts , and applied again in the morning . He was accepted this time and shipped off to the navy yard at Charleston , South Carolina . Like most boys his age , Rockwell was anxious for action , but after he had made a casual drawing of a chief petty officer , his identity as a Post contributor was discovered . The commandant sent to New York for his brushes and materials , and installed Rockwell in the officers ' quarters . Rated a third-class varnisher and painter , Rockwell , against his will , became the commandant 's pet . When British or French admirals were visiting , Rockwell was summoned to the official dinner to sketch the visitors , and his work delighted everyone . In between drawing naval officers , he was permitted to paint Post covers , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an admiral 's . Rockwell , his Post covers and his impromptu drawings were the pride of the base . After a year of this sybaritic existence , Rockwell wangled an assignment to Queenstown , Ireland , where he was to paint insignia on American naval planes based there . The transport on which he was a passenger was stopped in mid-Atlantic by an American submarine , whose skipper , yelling from the conning tower , ordered the vessel to turn about and return to port . Rockwell never did learn the reason for this , but for a time suspected that the Charleston commandant had something to do with it . When news of the armistice arrived , Rockwell applied for his discharge and was told he would have to wait . " Unless , " his patron added , " you commit some crime and get a dishonorable discharge . Or you might get an inadaptability discharge , which would mean that you were too stupid to perform your duties . Of course , you would n't want that . " The officer was surprised when the young man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted an inadaptability discharge as a third-class varnisher and painter . He was mustered out on November fourteenth , one of the first members of the armed services to get out of uniform . " I was painting a cruiser captain at the time , " he says now , reminiscently . A Modern Interlude Rockwell 's Post covers up to this time had been mostly of boys . After the war , he painted old men for a time and gradually worked people of all ages into his paintings . He became so popular that the Post 's editors almost had to place an armed guard around him to fend off other patrons . Rockwell had the easygoing , carefree nature which is endemic among artists , and found it difficult to say no to anyone who sought his services . A result was that his Post cover schedule was irregular at times . Another difficulty was a yearning Rockwell had for turning out a magnum opus , a painting that would mark him for the ages . It is a dream that all artists have to face at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modernism , told him he ought to learn something about dynamic symmetry , and their arguments worried him . " If you do n't get on the modernist band wagon , you 're licked , " they kept telling him . Stewing and fretting , Rockwell packed up and went to Paris to seek refreshment of style at the feet of the moderns . He attended lectures and bought Picassos to hang in his studio for inspiration . On his return he set about applying what he had learned to Post covers . The dynamically symmetric results were nightmares . When Editor Lorimer examined the first new-Rockwell offerings he laid them aside and gave the artist a paternal lecture on the value of being one 's self , pointing out in passing that it was conceivably better to have one 's work displayed on the Post 's covers than to have it embalmed in art museums . Chastened , Rockwell agreed , and went back to being himself . He now refers to his temporary aberration as " my James Joyce-Gertrude Stein period . " What did most to get Rockwell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacation trip he made in 1930 . While visiting his old friend Clyde Forsythe in California , he met a Stanford girl named Mary Barstow . Three weeks later they were married . That was the fastest important job Rockwell ever completed . In his Post art work he hesitates to trust his own judgment , or anyone else 's , and a person who did n't understand the perfectionist instinct of the good artist would think he was VALENTINE FOR YOU By LALIA MITCHELL THORNTON I WANT to buy a valentine , A rose and vine And dove design . No winging planes , no couchont guns , No Japs , no Huns , Just like the ones I bought before you went to war , Before Sornor , Toulon , Dakar . shillyshallying . Periodically he comes down to Philadelphia to submit seven or eight rough pencil drawings of cover ideas , and bubbles with enthusiasm as he discusses them . If , say , four are approved for completion , he may discover , on the ride back to Vermont , that two are imperfectly conceived and telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may decide to abandon one or both of them . The calm that Mary Rockwell has brought into his home life does n't touch the nerve-racking routine of seeing a painting through to completion , except during the actual brushwork itself . When Rockwell is before his easel , she reads novels or biographies aloud to him , and this seems to aid him in concentrating . But somewhere along the route , Rockwell usually pulls up short with a terrible feeling that something is wrong with the picture . If Mrs. Rockwell ca n't supply the answer , a call is put in for their close friend , Mead Schaeffer , the artist who paints the Post 's striking covers on American men in the armed services . Rockwell and Schaeffer are neighbors , and they operate a Mutual-Admiration , Hand-Holding and Aid Society . When either gets into a jam over procedure , he calls in the other for consultation and comfort . If Schaeffer happens to be the trouble-shooter , his wife , Elizabeth , comes along , too , and the quartet solemnly pick the painting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who happens to be near by is summoned  --  the men planting apple trees in the yard , the grocery boy , the carpenter at work on a shed or any other Arlington friend , from the stationmaster to the general-store proprietor , who can spare half an hour . While the lay experts are wagging their heads and venturing opinions , Rockwell keeps up a low , miserable chant consisting mostly of " Oh , gosh , oh , gosh , what a palooka I turned out to be ! " His state of indecision sometimes persists for days . Meanwhile , he sleeps badly , tries out new approaches to his idea and restlessly hikes through the near-by Green Mountains , his reedy , 135-pound frame bent over like that of a mongoose flushing a cobra . Ultimately , the agony comes to an end with the dawning of a gentle inner light , and Rockwell has what he describes as " something I can sincerely paint . " He paints it and bundles the canvas off for Philadelphia . " Then , " he says , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rockwells live , with their three small boys , in a remodeled old frame farmhouse which has two front doors . Originally , the house was occupied by two bachelor brothers who did n't speak to each other and lived in separate halves of the dwelling . One was a steady drinker . He made his own applejack and had a specially low front stoop installed to guard him from tripping when coming home late . The other brother was a stern teetotaler . The Rockwells have enlarged their living room by knocking down the partitions . Rockwell 's studio is an abandoned sawmill a few hundred feet from the house . The grounds , 400 acres in all , lie between two mountains , and a trout stream gurgles noisily past the studio . From inside the studio , one of the peaks , Red Mountain , seems to be framed in the huge north-light window . The only livestock on the premises are a pair of ducks , which came with the house . There is a saying in Arlington that posing for Rockwell and Schaeffer is one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rarely necessary for either artist to look beyond the town 's boundaries for the right type . The reason rural Vermonters make such good models , Rockwell thinks , is that they are a proud breed who would die before trying to be like anyone else , and hence have an individuality unmarred by attempts at imitation . City people , on the other hand , are ridden by all sorts of strange inhibitions about appearance and tend thereby to lose their distinctiveness , he says . The Rockwells go to the village square dances and at one of them Rockwell spotted a youngster named Bob Buck . Buck straightway became the model for a Willie Gillis cover which was so popular that Rockwell made it into a series , Justice of the Peace Nip Noyes is a heavy-set man , whom he uses for doctors , judges and stout gentlemen of good digestion . Harvey McKee , another justice of the peace , and his wife , Jennie , have ap-peared on covers in innumerable roles , as has Walter C. Squiers , a building contractor . Dan Walsh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Rockwell , and occasionally poses as a Santa Claus , And so on and on , with most of the town participat-ing . Sometimes , too , Rockwell and ( Continued an Page 41 ) NEW CAR ? PERHAPS BY 1945 You 'll likely have new tires long before you have a new car . ... SO CARE FOR THE CAR YOU HAVE NOW ! ( Continued from Page 391 Schaeffer pose for each other or borrow each other 's children as models . For instance , on the Willie Gillis cover showing two girls spatting over identical photos they had received inscribed " Love , Willie , " the pert one in shorts was modeled by Schaeffer 's daughter . The Four Freedoms series has turned out to be one of the hardest jobs Rockwell ever tackled and he has lost ten pounds since July , when he began working on the idea . He has been at it steadily ever since , except for interludes in which he did two covers . The idea came to him at three o'clock one The mortars are going to fire 400 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires more than twenty . Frankly , I do n't think the weapons will stand the strain . ED . NOTE : The communiqu ? reported : " Allied fighters and bombers damaged Axis landing fields and supply lines . German aircraft counterattacked . " October 23 , 1942 . No sleep for the wicked . Last night , scores of men labored until the small hours of the morning , carrying forward the bombs for the completed pits . A complicated system of telephone wires was laid between the guns and to every command position . It was a strange night . The sky above the enemy lines was one immense opaque cloud through which jagged bolts of lightning ripped . Presently , the full moon broke through on the dreary waste . The whole desert was a sea of silver and the whole sky a dense blue-black curtain . It lent me a peculiar feeling of disembodiment , as if I floated rather than walked . It played strangely on my senses ; for how long I do not know . I was an earthbound spirit . . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? It comes to us all at times . When I look at the smiling faces around me and listen to the lighthearted nonsense of my friends , I wonder , Wilt you be here tomorrow ? Or you  --  or you ? And I know that these thoughts graze their minds too . We never talk of it . At no time during these preparations for what we know is to be one of the decisive battles of history have I noticed any of the customary thin-voiced conversation which borders fear . This thing ca n't go wrong . We know it ca n't  --  and because of this , the spirit of aggression is swelling in us like a dark , strong tide . We are the dogs of war , straining at the leash . The attack will be preluded by an artillery barrage of incredible ferocity . Four hundred guns can be brought to bear on our sector alone . Flying Fortresses will scour the enemy lines , dropping 4000-pounders wherever enemy gun flashes are visible . We outnumber the enemy two to one in tanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more heavy tanks than the enemy has tanks of all types . I looked at the faces round me . I did not see a man who was not grinning from ear to ear or slapping his neighbor 's back . I felt positively bloody minded . In his order of the day , the G.O.C. expressed his complete confidence in every man . " We are to pray , " he said , " that the God mighty in battle will be with us . " THE SATURDAY morning , when he awoke suddenly , gripped by a fear that people were saying , " Oh , yeah , the Four Freedoms , " without actually understanding their implications . He tried to get back to sleep , but without success , and at five he dressed and went to the studio , where he sketched trial approaches to the concepts . Later , still in a state of inner excitement , he telephoned Mead Schaeffer and got him excited too . The upshot of their discussion was a trip to Washington , where Rockwell tried like a demon to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconded him . For two days they were October 24 , 1942 . At dusk , our forces began to pour through the mine gap . Scores of vehicles laden with troops chugged silently out into the desert . So silently they ran that it seemed that they , too , were part of the great conspiracy . Soon we could advance no farther by truck , lest the enemy hear the dull roaring , and open fire . The mortar men debussed and carried their weapons forward to the gun pits . The infantry filed on ahead to take up their positions in readiness for the assault . At 21:40 hours to the second , a wide half-moon of flashes rent the night sky to the zenith . An instant later the first ear-splitting crash of that perfectly coordinated fire order tumbled from the sky . Backward and forward the guns flickered and flashed as battery after battery opened fire . For twenty minutes the mighty artillery concentration EVENING POST shunted from bureau to bureau and did n't succeed in raising the blood pressure of a single bureaucrat . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expedition was a flop and headed sadly for home . As the train neared Philadelphia , Rockwell 's face lighted up . " The Post , of course , " he said . " Why did n't I think of it before ? " It was the only time in Rockwell 's career that he did n't think of the Post first . If the Post 's rival had been another jade of a magazine , the editors would have been sore , but they did n't mind being second choice to a Government at work on a war . roared and hammered in deafening chorus . The sound of thousands of shells falling on the enemy was like the sound of a hailstorm on a city of corrugated iron or the rumble of ten thousand drums . It was appalling . During this interminable twenty minutes I sat tensed by the telephone , watching the hands creep slowly up my watch . Waiting for zero . I heard Lieutenant P , the mortarfire-control officer , shout into the phone , " Prepare to fire ! " Then the confused murmur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance . The word " Fire ! " shrieked in the earpiece . I heard myself yell " Fire ! " to my guns . With a hiss and a cloud of sparks , the first salvo leaped from the mortar batteries in what was to be the heaviest mortar barrage ever directed against any one position . At the same instant , a regiment of heavy machine guns began to add their shrill clamor to the now almost indescribable uproar . Half a million rounds was to pour from the muzzles before " Cease fire ! " In a few moments it was impossible to distinguish between the different weapons . It was simply an awful roaring which battered on eardrums protected by cotton wool and dinned in a shriller key over the phones . Sergeant T reported a near hit from enemy counterfire which , he said , caused casualties and damaged the pit . I heard his laughing voice say that the gun would remain in action . Two hours passed . The hideous cacophony had not ceased for an instant . I was tensed with nerves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear , listening to the shriek and crash of counterfire , smelling the reek of explosives , and covered with dust from close hits . Suddenly there were two sharp explosions on my right . Seemingly right on one of my guns . With dry mouth and pounding heart , I yelled into the mortar phone . " Are you all right , Corporal N ? " No answer . " Corporal N , for God 's sake , answer me ! What 's happened ? " I was answered . I heard a sound which will ring in my ears forever . The low groan of dying men . It must have been a direct hit . I realized it , but yet I could n't grasp it . I dropped the phone and rushed across to the mortar pit and , flinging myself down on the parapet , stared into the pit . The men looked at me with open mouths . They were unharmed . " Why the hell do n't you answer the phone ? " They shook their heads  --  they were all stone deaf from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
