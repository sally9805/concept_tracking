For a while last week , the long-awaited popular revolt seemed to be rising in Argentina . Opposition groups , disgusted with the militarists led by Colonel Juan Domingo Pern , were getting together under the name of Comando Unico ( Single Command ) . Their aim : to throw out all the barrack-room statesmen , set up a civilian government pledged to hold elections . <P> Counted on Comando Unico 's side were party politicians , exiles in Montevideo , important bodies of troops both in Buenos Aires and the provinces . The Navy steamed into the harbor . Communists , Socialists , Radicals were eager to pour their multitudes into the streets . Even the Catholic Church , which has favored authoritarianism on the clerical Franco model , was turning against the militarists . Several high clerics , many humble priests were warning good Catholics to shun them . <P> But the great revolt never came off . Erratic Lieut . Colonel Tomas Duco turned it into a comic-opera failure . Prematurely , he led his Third Infantry into the streets of Buenos Aires . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb of Lomas de Zamora , they set up machineguns and artillery . <P> Colonel Pern moved fast . His First Division marched out of Campo Mayo . His planes dropped flares , pinpointed Duco 's troops . There were ultimatums , negotiations . The " Single Command , " confused or suspicious , did not give the signal for general revolt . Duco was left alone . At last he surrendered , went to jail . <P> Cracked Front . Pern had won a victory . He quickly won another . The U.S. State Department was trying to form a united hemisphere front against the regime of Peron 's stooge , anti-U.S . Vice President Edelmiro Farrell ( who had forcibly replaced President Pedro Ramirez ) . U.S. Ambassador Norman Armour was instructed to " refrain from entering official relations " with Farrell . British Ambassador David Kelly got the same order . Latin nations were supposedly " consulting . " <P> Then Chile 's Ambassador , Conrado Ros Gallardo , presented a note which he " was most happy to deliver . " His Government declared that the Farrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hemisphere front was also a flop , cracked by a supposedly friendly , democratic country to which the U.S. had confidently looked for support . Cheering Argentine nationalists surrounded the Chilean Embassy , waited for other Latin nations to follow Chile 's example . Chileans waited for angry repercussion in their own country . <P> The U.S. had suffered a severe diplomatic defeat . The Argentine Government had shown real strength . Never , at week 's end , had the U.S. Pan-American policy been in sorer straits .
