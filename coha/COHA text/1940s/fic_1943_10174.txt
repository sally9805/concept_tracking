" " So now half your salary goes for postage on letters to the delicate-minded relatives , telling them they can either go to work or starve , it 's all one to you . " " How right you are , " said Spratt . They began to laugh again , and Elizabeth started telling him about Aunt Grace and her cups of tea . " My aunt would really be sorry to see the millennium arrive , for if there were no affliction there 'd be nobody for her to pester with good works .

" I like you , Elizabeth . " " I Tike you too , " she said . By this time they were spending their evenings together several tunes a week . It was characteristic of Spratt 's forthrighthabit of mind that several nights later , when they were having dinner again , he suddenly interrupted a pause in the convecrsation to say to her , " Elizabeth , may I ask you a personal question ? " " You can ask it , of course , " she returned , " though if it 's very personal I do n't promise to answer it . What do you want to know ' ? " " About your husband , " he said . Elizabeth looked down at the reflection of an overhead light on the surface of her coffee . " My husband was killed in the war , " she answered briefly . " Forgive me , wo n't you ? " said Spratt .

" I le leaned a trifle nearer her . " Well , this is n't an easy town to get around in , Elizabeth . You are Mrs. , and you wear a weddingring , but you live alone and I 've never heard you mentionyour husband . We 've been seeing a good deal of each other , and I 'd like to keep on seeing you , but I wanted to make sure . I 've had  --  well , " he said with a shrug , " one or two embarrassing experiences with unexpected husbands turning up . I hope this does n't make you angry , " he added .

But maybe I 've been a bit naive for Hollywood  --  and anyway , as you noticed , I 'm still reluctant to talk about it . " " Then we sha n't talk about it , " he said gently . " Thank you for understanding why I brought it up . " There was a pause . " Were you in the army ? " she asked . " For a little while . I never got across . " " And when did you come here ? " " In the first winter of the world 's hangover . " He spoke readily , evidently glad to turn the course of her attention . " Beforewe went into the war I had worked for an advertising agency in New York . We handled a lot of moving picture advertising , so after the war they sent me out to organize a branch office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studio publicity . " From there the talk went back to moving pictures . As he drove her home , Spratt said , " I 'd like to see you over the weekendif you can manage it . " " I can , easily . " " Good . Would you rather go dancing at a night club Saturdaynight or spend Sunday at a swimming pool ? " " Sunday , swimming . " " Terrific , so would I. I 've got to do a layout on one of my beauties , and I can do it either Saturday night or Sunday . So I 'll get rid of it Saturday night , and pick you up Sunday morning . I belong to a rather good country club and we 'll go there  --  swim , late lunch by the pool , get sunburnt in the afternoon . Right ? " " Splendid . " He stopped the car in front of her apartment house and went up with her . At her door Spratt said , " Elizabeth , about what came up at dinner . Do n't run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it . " " I do try to , Spratt , " she said in a low voice . " I 've been trying to for a long time now , but I ca n't always . Sometimes it  --  comes back . As if it had just happened yesterday . " " I think I understand . Though maybe I do n't  --  nothing 's easier than believing we understand experiences we 've never had . But the longer you live the more you find out that life consists mostly of getting used to things we do n't like . Keep trying . " " I will , Spratt . " I le went on , " You know , most of us , when we say happiness , mean the absence of change . And that 's just fighting the facts . Our lives are always changing in spite of anything we can do about it . Eventually , if we learn anything , we learn to take what happens and go on with it . " Ile stopped abruptly , half abashed . " Queer , my talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is  --  I wish I could offer you more consolation . " " Why , you have , " said Elizabeth.  | " Have I ? How ? " " By being you . It 's hard to explain . " " Thank you . " He took both her hands in his and gave them a hard grip . " You 're a swell girl , Elizabeth . " When she went into her room and turned on the light she felt a new elation . She had not seen this side of Spratt 's nature before . Finding it made her feel that for the first time since she came to California she had acquired , not another companion to amuse her leisure , but a friend who would be there when she needed him . The following Sunday , as they were driving home , after a brisk day of sun and water , she leaned back in the car , saying drowsily , " I 'll probably be asleep by eight o'clock tonight . I 'm so tired ! " " I am too , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . " " I 'd like to . But I thought you worked most of your week-ends . " " So I do , but that 's been because there was nobody interesting to play with . I work too hard . " " Are you just beginning to realize that ? " she asked . " Not exactly , but I 'm just beginning to admit it . Work can be like liquor sometimes , an escape from too much of one 's own company . " She glanced up , expecting him to go on , but Spratt remarked on the coloring of the desert hills in the sunset and said no more about himself . Remembering his remark later , however , she thought she should have expected it . She might have realizedlong ago that like so many other brilliant and ambitious men , Spratt was essentially lonely . Yet she had not realized it , and she was glad to do so now . She needed his friendship ; it was good to know that in spite of his self-assurance Spratt also had need of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not surprised . She ( lid not answer him at once . Spratt had given her so much , more than she knew until now , when she had to consider the possibility of letting him go . But she wanted to be fair , and in fairnessthere were matters that had to be explained . She explained them on an evening when they were in her apartment , Spratt listening with quiet attention while she spoke . She told him how she had loved Arthur , and how she had suffered at being told he was dead . " It ca n't be easy for you to hear this , " she said . " It 's easier now than it 'll ever be again , " he answered . " Go on . Elizabeth stood up . Moving around behind her chair she put her hands on the back of it and held it while she talked . " Spratt , you told me to take this out and face it . I 've tried to . I 've tried to be practical , to tell myself everything I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maybe Arthur was n't worth what I gave him , maybe nobody ever born could deserve so much . Maybe it was just a young girl 's infatuation , taking all the romantic heroes of her dreams and embodying them in the form of a handsome lover . I can say all this , I can accept it with the cool reasoning part of my mind , but beyondthat it does n't go . My emotions , my spirit  --  what the poets would call my heart  --  simply wo n't accept it . Because I had what I had . The simple truth is that for the year we were married Arthur gave me an experience of ecstasy . If he had lived I might have been disillusioned . But what I 'm trying to tell you is that I was n't disillusioned , and now I never will be . I ) o you understand what I 'm saying ? " " Yes . But you have n't said whether or not you want to marry me . " I do want to . But I 'm not sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't want to , say so . You 're too fine and honest to have anything less than the truth from me , or to let me have anything less than that from you . Spratt , when Arthur died something died in me . What I feel for you  --  it 's strange to call it love , because it 's so different . It 's not adora/tion that sees no faults . It 's thoughtful and realistic . I like you , I admire you , I have tremendous respect for you . I trust you completely . I 'd tell you anything . I know you 'll never fail me . But I ca n't give you what I gave Arthur , because I have n't got it to give . It 's just not there any more . " She looked across the room at him , listening steadily in the half-glow of a reading lamp some distance away . She con-cluded , " It would hurt me terribly to lose you . But it would be worse to know I had been less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who can give you what I ca n't , and if that 's what you want , please , please tell me so . " She heard a soft , smothered little sound from his direction , and saw to her amazement that Spratt was laughing . He stood up and came over to her . " My darling girl , you told me I was honest . I am , and I 'm going to prove it . If any woman offered me the sort of total worship you 're talking about , she 'd throw me into a panic . " I le put his hands on her shoulders and squeezed them as he continued , in comradely fashion . " Forgive me for laughing . I was n't laughing at you , but at the idea that anybody could possiblythink I might want to be adored like that , which you 'll have to admit is ridiculous . Elizabeth , if I may be brutally frank  --  if that 's what you were like when you were a young girl I 'm glad you got rid of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are . " Quite suddenly , she began to laugh too . This way of talking about marriage was so different from the shining rapture with which she and Arthur had talked about it . " Then you do want me , Spratt ? " " You bet I do . " " You 're not going to be sorry for what 's past ? " " I should say not . You see , Elizabeth , it 's really quite simple . I love you as you are . What you are must be the result of what 's happened to you before . If it had happened differently ,  |p56you  'd have been a different sort of woman now , and I should n't have loved you . It makes sense . " " You 're the only man I know , " said Elizabeth , " who always makes sense . " They were married soon after that . She had never had reason to be sorry . Spratt had been brilliantly successful in his work , they had their three children , their long unbroken affection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supreme importance to each other . It was a good life.  |p57IT  WAS a good life  --  then what was she doing here , curled up on the chaise-longue in a tight little knot of pain ? Elizabethsat up and looked around the room . A bar of sun had moved a little way across the rug . There on the table was her desk-calendar , open to the page for tomorrow , with " Kessler to dinner 7:30 " scribbled across the bottom . No more than half an hour had passed since she wrote it , but half an hour of her old torture had been enough to make her feel now that she had waked from an intolerable nightmare . But she had waked from it . Like its predecessors , this period of recollection had gone as abruptly as it had come . Elizabeth pushed a lock of hair off her forehead and reached for a cigarette . " What a fool I am , " she said , her eyes on the picture of Spratt that was standing on her desk . She had a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet , but it had been years since she had looked at it . She wanted Spratt there , Spratt whom she loved , her children 's father . Spratt and her children were what she lived for . They filled up her thoughts  --  except for these rare minutes of agony , minutes that were more cruel because they had to be borne in silence . She could tell Spratt anything on earth but this . She could mention Arthur to him without self-consciousness , as she did sometimes  --  " There was a man like Mr. So-and-so in the company Arthur worked for in Tulsa , one of those pseudointellectualswho bought first editions for no reason but to show them off . I remember one day Arthur said he . . . " Just as simply as that . And they would chuckle over Arthur 's wisecrackand go on talking . But no matter how seldom they oc/Burred , she could not tell Spratt that there ever did occur such experiences of black anguish as the one she had just passed through . And why in the world should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gone completely until the next time , if there ever should be a next time . By tomorrow she would have forgotten it . Already the fact that she had been powerless to escape it was making her ashamed of herself , and glad to ignoresuch absurdity . The air was growing chilly . The children should have come in from the pool by now , and she hoped they had hung up their suits properly . It was about time she went downstairs and got out the cocktail tray to have it ready when Spratt came in . The telephone rang again , and when she answered it she felt pleasure at the normal steadiness of her voice . Her caller greeted her cheerfully . " This is Irene Stern , Elizabeth . How are you ? " " Fine , never better . " " And Spratt ? " " Working himself to death and flourishing on it . " " Any news on the picture , or do I dare ask ? " " Good news , I hope . Anyway , a new writer who seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I do n't think so . He 's just off the boat . " " Oh dear . Spikka da Inglis ? " " Fairly well , I believe . They 're better at languages than we arc . " ' Hwy should be , ca n't go a hundred miles over there withoutneeding a new one . Elizabeth , I called to ask if it 's all right for Brian to stay for dinner with Peter . " " Irene , you 're an angel about that child , but are you sure it 's no trouble ? Brian takes half his meals with you as it is . " " It 's no trouble and I wish you 'd let him stay . He and Peter are upstairs getting starry-eyed over a new collection of bugs  --  Elizabeth , is it really necessary for the Scouts to encourage such a fearful interest in natural history ? Peter does nothing these days but mount insects . " " I know , Brian 's room looks like all I 've ever heard about delirium tremens . There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a recent craze , " said Irene Stern . " I remember Jimmy  --  " she was referring to her older son  --  " Jimmy was an enthusiastic Scout , but he never had this passion for creeping things . " Elizabeth began to laugh . " You 'd better send Brian home , Irene . He 'll be a distressing influence on Peter . " " But when they 're mounting bugs together they 're so happy . I ca n't bear to separate them . So let him stay for dinner , Elizabeth . We 'll bring him home by nine . " " All right then , and thank you for being so good to him . It 's been ages since I 've seen you  --  I 'm going to ring you one day this week for lunch . " " Do . I 'd love it . " They said goodby and Elizabeth put back the phone . She laughed to herself as she did so . Everything was back where it ought to be . Her friends , her children , the warm security @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she took up Spratt 's picture and kissed him through the glass . As she went downstairs she heard a babble of young voices and a sound of laughter . Dick and Cherry had evidently come indoors with their friends , and the four of them were making quite as much noise as might have been expected if they had been greeting one another after years of separation . " Does n't their energy ever give out ? " Elizabeth asked herselfit h fond wonder as she heard them . She glanced into the dining room to make sure the table had been set with two extra places , made ready the cocktail tray in the living room , and t hen went to the balcony that ran along the back of the house , to observe the state of affairs around the pool . The children had hung their suits and towels on the linep6o provided , leaving the place quite tidy after their swim . They were really very good about that , except now and then when they had something important on their minds and forgot to clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! They had gone into the back den , the windows of which opened on the balcony where she was standing , and she could hear them as they discussed something that must be excruciatingly funny , for the conversation seemed to consist less of words than of laughter . Not wanting to interrupt whatever it was they were enjoying so much , Elizabeth sat down in a deck-chair on the balcony to wait for the appearance of Spratt 's car in the driveway . The shadows of the lemon trees were like dark lace shawls lying on the grass . A little wind rumpled the surface of the pool and moved gently past her , bringing odors of damp grass , lemon blossoms , torn geranium leaves . The air was full of the twittering of birds making farewell to the sun as joyfully as the children were laughing within . Elizabeth leaned back , wrapped in a warm glow of pleasure . What a lucky woman she was , she reflected , and how much she had  --  a beautiful home , a husband who loved her , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , how foolish it was ever to remember anything else . It was good to have a few minutes alone , like this , to look at all of it and know she had a right to be proud because she had created it ; good to take pleasure in her children 's laughter and know they were so happy because of the love and security she had given them . No matter what might happen to them in the coming years they would have this to remember . She found herself laughing too , in echo of the four mirthful youngsters in the den . They were reading something , for she could hear the rustle of pages  --  no doubt those dusty old magazinesthey had brought in from Julia 's mother 's attic  --  and their voices came through the window to her , breathless with merriment.  | " Go on , Cherry  --  " it was Dick speaking  --  " what have you got now ? Read it . " " This one 's wonderful , " exclaimed Cherry . " Listen . " She read , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when t he earth shakes with the force of battle , a new future is beingborn . We make sacrifices gladly , for we know we shall be richly repaid with the glory of universal brotherhood . The world must be made safe for democracy ! In this magnificent hour  --  ' Another shout of laughter interrupted her . Cherry an-nounced , " That 's an advertisement for raisins ! " " I do n't believe it , " said Pudge . " It certainly is , here 's a picture of a loaf of raisin bread to go with it . " " Did they have to eat raisin bread to get universal brotherhood ? " Julia asked merrily . " Oh , I get it , " exclaimed Dick , as though looking over Cherry 's shoulder . " It 's easier to persuade the children to eat bread without butter if the bread has raisins in it . Butter is grease , grease makes explosives , and explosives make brotherhood . Very simple in that magnificent hour . Oh look , " he continued , with a sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than that . They were having a campaign to sell Liberty Bonds  --  " " What were Liberty Bonds ? " asked Julia . " Government bonds to pay for the war , like the War Bonds we buy now . Here 's a question-and-answer department , and somebody writes in to ask if it 's quite fair to sell long-term bonds to be paid for by future taxpayers . He asks , Is n't that making future generations pay for this generation 's war ? ' and the editor answers  --  this 'll kill you  --  he answers , Exactly so , and this is one of the best reasons for buying Liberty Bonds today . For the fruits of this war will be enjoyed by the generationsyet unborn . ' "  | " Jumping Jupiter ! " Pudge exclaimed as the four of them went off into another paroxysm of mirth . " Generations yet unborn ! " Cherry repeated . " That 's us . " " And are n't we enjoying the fruits of that war ! " said Julia . " Let me see that one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . " " If he is , " said Cherry , " I bet his face is red . Oh do look , here 's a beauty . A picture of a lot of babies , and the title is , The America of tomorrow , for whom the world is being made safe today . ' " " I bet every one of ' em 's in the army now , " said Dick . " Take a peek at this . A picture of a lot of soldiers ready to go abroad , and the line under it says , A payment on our debt to France . ' " " Any time France feels like making a payment on their debt to us , " said Cherry , " I 'm agreeable . " There was another sound of rustling pages , and she burst out laughing again . " Listen , everybody . One of our greatest aims in this war is the reconstructionof Europe on such a basis that future holocausts like this one will be impossible . Out of the world 's anguish must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democracy shall rule , where no tyrant and no group of bloodthirsty lunatics shall ever again have the power to plunge a whole continent  --  ' " The rest of her words were lost in a confusion of laughter . " For the love of Pete , " murmured Pudge , incredulously . " It 's right here in print , only you did n't let me finish and the last sentence is the funniest of all . Germany will be defeated , but their defeat will bring the German people one tremendousgain : it will mean for them the complete and final overt Brow of autocratic government . ' How do you like that ? " " I get it , " said fudge . " We were just fighting the Germans for their own good , were we ? Gee , when they look around they must he so grateful . " " I see by this paper , " said Julia , " that the International SundaySchool convention planned for 1916 has just been calledp63off because the delegates are too busy shooting each other to attend this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Cherry . " Do n't look now , dear . In Japan . " They began to laugh again . Pudge exclaimed , " Be quiet and let me read you something funnier than that . These editorials about the first air raid on an open city . It seems the Germans had things called Zeppelins  --  that 's a kind of blimp  --  and they sent some of these Zeppelins over Antwerp and dropped a few bombs , and here 's what the American papers were saying about it . The attack upon Antwerp , made without warning to its innocent population , is completely contrary to all rules of civilizedwarfare  --  ' " Rules ? " Dick interrupted mirthfully . " You 'd have thought it was a football game . " " Zeppelins have dropped bombs on an undefended city ! ' " Pudge continued reading with mock horror . " This is not only contrary to the laws of war , but can serve no legitimate military purpose  --  ' " What is a legitimate military purpose , " Dick inquired , " unless it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and let me read this . As those who were killed or injured by the bombs were women and male non-combatants , the airship attack was nothing but a plain act of savagery . This is not war , but murder ! ' " " Did you ever hear anything so naive ? " asked Cherry . " Was that first attack a bad one ? " asked Dick . " I was saving that for the last , " answered Pudge . " If you can believe it , that first air raid , that dastardly , bloodthirsty , savage raid that made everybody sit back and yell with horror  --  that raid killed ten people and wounded eleven . " " Holy smoke ! " exclaimed Dick , and the others joined in his derision . A moment later Dick added , " Here 's a swell sideangleon the air raids . It says the men in London were taking to wearing pajamas instead of nightshirts because when the blimps came over everybody ran out into the streets , and they wanted the neighbors to see them running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They chuckled joyfully . Cherry exclaimed , " I wish you 'd look at these recipes for war-meals . Freedom Meat Loaf , ' made out of peanuts and cornmeal . " " Peanuts do have Vitamin B in them , " suggested Julia . " They 'd never heard of Vitamin B , " Dick said scornfully . " They had to eat peanuts and call ' em meat because our brave allies were buying up all the meat with the money they borrowedand did n't pay back and never did intend to pay back . Do look at that headline  --  ' Every housewife who saves meat and flour in her home is bringing nearer the day of universal democracy ! ' " " Do you suppose they really believed all that ? " Cherry asked in wonder . Outside , on the balcony , Elizabeth lifted her hands from the arms of the chair and saw that each of the bright blue cushions was stained with a round spot of dampness where she had gripped them . On the other side of the window the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of laughter , gay , mocking , and terrible because it was so utterly innocent . Elizabeth stood up , her muscles tense with impulse . Then she stopped , standing motionless because she did not know what the impulse was . To do something to them  --  but what ? She could not walk in upon them white with anger and cry out , " Yes , we believed it ! You inhuman young wretches , we believed it ! " She could not say that because they were not inhuman , and they were not wretches ; they were young and well-bred and intelligent , and they would hear her with a pained bewilderment , and answer with the cool logic of their years , " Are n't you ashamed that you did , when you look at the world we 're living in ? "  |p65And  her son  --  who was seventeen and who did not look at all like Arthur , since he bore no more relationship to Arthur than to the policeman on the corner  --  her son would ask her , with the same cool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time ? " How strange it would be if she should try to tell them anything about Arthur . With what incomprehension they would hear her . Her children knew  --  that is , if anybody had asked them , they could have answered after a moment 's reflection  --  that their father was their mother 's second husband . She was not sure they had ever been told their mother 's first husband had lost his life in that war they were laughing at . If they had ever heard this , evidently they had forgotten about it . How fantastic it would seem to them if she broke now into their jolly chatter to say , " I know all about that war you find so absurd , and that sentimental nonsense that sent men out to die . I loved a man who died for it . " They would be shocked into uncomfortable silence . Or they might , as they had a right to do , stare at her and ask , " For what ? " This she could answer , for they had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own children , to give them the right not to believe in anything . They had told her , As clearly as they could tell her , the futility of his sacrifice . She remembered what he had said to her . " If we win this war , you 'll have your children . If we do n't , you wo n't want them . " Her children could answer her now , but as she stood within sound of their healthy , laughter-laden voices , Elizabeth knew that she could not answer them . Indoors the children came across some new monstrosity and broke into laughter again . Cherry finally gasped , " I tell you , my ribs hurt . I have n't had so much fun for ages . " " Oh boy , " exclaimed Pudge , " here 's another of these things . ' Today , filled with hope and trust , we proudly look upon our great army and our noble allies . Through their sacrifices we are moving toward the victory that will bring triumphant peace to all the world . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never worked before ! America is destined to be  --  ' "  --  the prize sucker of all time , " Dick finished the sentence for him , with sudden disgust . " Did you ever hear such tripe ? Could n't you throw up ? " " Well  --  we really ought not to laugh , " Julia admitted . " The poor things , they took it so seriously . " " If we do n't laugh , " said Dick , " we 'll all sit down and cry . We 've got the mess they made . " " Oh Dick , " Julia admonished him , " but really , this war is different ! " " Different ? Tell that to the Marines . Sure , the Marines who got stuck on Wake Island with a lot of popguns because the Japs were such good customers and they might have got their feelings hurt if we 'd fortified it . " " We 're a swell bunch of suckers , are n't we ? " said Cherry . " To get ourselves born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help it , " Dick remarked . " But I guess nobody who had anything to say about it would have picked out the twentieth century , any of it . " ( sherry gave a low ironic chuckle . " They 'll have an easy time remembering the twentieth century when they study it in the history books . A pre-war period , a war , an inter-war period , another war , a post-war period  --  " " Do n't say post-war too soon , you wishful thinker , " Pudge admonished her lazily . " I low do you know it wo n't be just the second inter-war period ? " " There was a shuffling sound as they began to restack the magazines , evidently concluding that these had provided as much amusement as they could afford . " This is a fine way for two fellows to be talking , " advised Julia , " who 'll probably be in the army this time next year . " " No , you do n't get it , Julia , " said Dick . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inter-war period is going to be a lot longer than this last one , why it 's got to ; by the time this war is over everything will be blown to powder and there 'll be nothing left to fight with .

We wo n't be disillusioned when it 's over because we have n't got any illusions . We know it 's all a bloody mess and we 're in it because our elders did n't have sense enough to keep us out of it . We 'll go into the army and they 'll train us to be killers whose businessit is to shoot other killers before they have a chance to shoot us first . And that 's that . " " But my Lord , Dick !

" " Mr. Wallace , " Cherry said wisely , " thinks we 're fighting to provide milk for the Chinese coolies . " Pudge chuckled at her . " Without even asking the coolies if they want any milk . " " You know , " said Cherry , " it 's really pathetic the way some of the propaganda leaders are trying to sell us on that idea of a brand-new world . Just get this over , and the Russians will love the Chinese and the Chinese will love the British and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still chuckling , " Just picture anybody actually loving the Italians . " " Oh , but they will , " Cherry assured him cynically . " Have n't you read some of these post-war planners ? Everybody is go- ing to get along with everybody else , even the Spaniards . " " The State Department , " Dick reminded her , " gets along beautifully with the Spaniards . " " Now that Chamberlain is dead , " said Cherry , " somebody really ought to send the State Department a lot of umbrellas for Christmas . Oh , it really does make you tired , does n't it ? Ever since I can remember , people have been talking about the next war , and nobody did anything about it except to go on selling the Japs and Germans things to blow us up with . And now that we 're in it they 're trying to hand us that same old fluff . " " I guess you 're right , " Julia admitted . " It 's  --  shivery , is n't it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if anybody believed it . " " Some people do believe it , Dick , " Pudge told him seriously . " Nobody our age , of course , but a lot of older people do . " " I do n't see how they can . They fell for it once , it doesn'tmake sense for anybody to fall for it twice . " " Well , does any of it make sense , I ask you ? " Dick retorted , " It does n't make sense except the way I said it the first time . The Japs and Germans say , We 're going to kill you and take what you 've got . ' We say , Like hell you are . ' So we get up and bang it out . We keep banging till they 're so slugnutty they have to let us alone . " " That 's not the way it turned out last time , " Julia reminded him . " No it did n't , " Dick agreed , " because last time everybody was so full of phony ideals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been reading , you 'd think the army was a lot of . social workers sent out to uplift the community . Those fellowsdid n't know what they were fighting for . No wonder they left everything in such a muddle . Nobody ever fought a war for any ideals . " " Why Dick , there are some ideals in this war ! " Julia protested . " You know , the Four Freedoms and all that . "  |p69Dick  was too polite to contradict her at once , but Cherry was not . " Oh Julia , " she said , " do n't be so sentimental . You do n't really believe anybody in the United States cares whether the Croatians and people like that have any Four Freedoms , any more than they care about us . Nobody fights for anything like that . They just pretend they do while it 's going on . " " She 's right , Julia , " Dick argued . " What they really fight about is property and power . They always talk pretty while it 's going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic . But as soon as a new war starts they say , Oh yes , we know , all the other wars were fought for crass reasons , but this one 's different , boys , this one 's different . ' " He became vehement . " Well , this one 's not different and I 'm thankful we know it . I 'm plenty tired of everybody pretending to believe what everybody knows is n't true . " " I wonder what your mother and father would say , " Julia suggested , " if they could hear you talk like that . " " Oh , they would n't mind , " said Cherry . " They 're very intelligentpeople , really . " " They 've got some old-fashioned ideas , " said Dick , " like everybody their age , but generally speaking they 're very liberalfor older people . They do n't go around being always shocked about things . " Outside , on the balcony , Elizabeth stood with her hands gripping the rail . She was thinking , " Every word they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 're our children and we taught them to think this way . Or at least , if we did n't teach them to be cynics , we did n't do anything to stop it . We ran away from the last war as fast as we could . In what Spratt called the world 's hangover , we did n't say anything but never again . ' And now there 's another war , and Dick will have to fight it  --  and listen to him ! Is that how they all feel ? If it is , t heir children will have to do it again . Oh my God , what have I told him ? What can I tell him now ? "  | Little as she liked to admit it , she knew she had been a coward and that she was still a coward . She had refused to face what was there , and she still lacked the courage to face it . Could she go into the house right now and say to Dick , " This war is a glorious crusade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till next year ? They will take you at seventeen . Oh yes , I know , thousands of men have already been killed , but go ahead . What are you waiting for ? It 's worth it . " No , she could not say it . If she believed this war was worth winning , that was what she ought to say , but the truth was that she simply did not believe it that much . That was what had held them all back during the accumulating horrors of the past twenty years . They knew what war was like , they could let anything happen in the world if only they could keep out of another . She need not blame herself , Elizabeth thought , as though she was the only one . She stood there on the balcony , epitomizing her country . Turning around , she walked into the house , entering through a hall so as to avoid meeting the children in the den . With the disappearance of the sun the air had grown chilly . A fire might be welcome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking at the darkness as it gathered swiftly over the lawn . A maid came in to turn on the lights . " Do n't you want me to draw those curtains too , Mrs. Herlong ? " she asked . Elizabeth turned . " Why yes , I 'd forgotten them . I 'll do this window . " She pulled the cord that drew the curtains together , and as the maid went out she turned from the window . How well-ordered everything looked , and was . Nothing had hap- . pened this afternoon . Nothing had happened except within herself . Everything that had made her feel so strong and happy as she drove home through the canyon was still there . A voice in the doorway startled her . " Say , mother , we 're getting famished . Is n't the boss home yet ? "  | " Not yet , Dick . He 's very busy these days , you know , on the new picture . " " I know , but I 'm starving . " " If the boss is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she promised . " It 's getting cold , Dick , will you light the fire ? " " Sure will . " Dick knelt down and applied a match to the gas rod under the logs . He glanced at the cocktail tray . " Want me to mix the Martinis ? " " I wish you would . " " Okay . " He went first to the door and called the others . " Want to come in here ? Fire going . " " In a minute , " Cherry called back . " Got to wash our hands first  --  those magazines were so awfully dusty . Is the boss in ? " " Not yet , but mother says we can have dinner at seventhirtyanyway . So hurry up . " The gas flame sparkled up to ignite the logs piled in the grate . Dick swished the gin and vermouth . Though he was not allowed to drink cocktails himself , he enjoyed the feeling of adulthood it gave him to play bartender . What a nice boy he was , Elizabeth thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a drink now ? " " I believe I would . I 'm a bit tired . " He poured it out for her , and watched while she tasted it . " How 's that ? " " Very good . You could get a job . " " I 'll be needing one if that physics guy gets much tougher .  - -  Oh hello there , " he said as Cherry and the two others came in . They greeted Elizabeth , and Julia said , " That fire looks wonderful . I wish we had those gas lightersat our house , they start the fire with no trouble at all . You have just everything here , Mrs. Herlong . " " Why thank you , Julia . " " This is the most comfortable house I was ever in . We 've been having such fun all afternoon . "  | " I 'm getting weak in the middle , " said Dick . " I wish you 'd ordered some crackers or something . " " I 'll have hors d'oeuvres tomorrow night . We 're having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the studio . " " We were all going to ride down to the beach tomorrow night , " said Dick . " It 'll be all right if Cherry and I leave right after dinner , wo n't it ? " " For Cherry , but I 'm afraid there 's another prospect for you. , , " For me ? What ? " he asked in alarm . Elizabeth gave him an urgent smile . It was a relief to turn her attention to her ordinary day-by-day affairs , to observe her children as normal healthy youngsters hungry for their dinner , to reach for a cigarette and have both Dick and Pudge strike matches for her . She accepted the light from Pudge , and smiled across it at Dick as he blew out the match he had struck . " Dick , our guest tomorrow night is a Mr. Kessler , from Germany . I 've never met him , but he 's working on the picture . " " Another refugee ? " inquired Cherry . " Yes , but you 'll both please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' if you have to call him anything . " " I get it , " said Dick , " but what have I got to do about him ? " " I lc has a daughter  --  " " Oh my Lord ! " " I 'm sorry , Dick , " Elizabeth continued with sympathy . " But the boss wants to talk pictures with Mr. Kessler after dinner , and you 'll have to take care of the girl . " Cherry and the two guests were already beginning to laugh at Dick 's woebegone face . Dick groaned . " Can she talk ? " " I do n't know , Dick , but there 's a musical show down-town  --  "  | " Mother , please ! Honestly , I  --  what does she look like ? " Elizabeth started to say " I 've never seen her , " when Cherry put in , " I bet I know . Two yellow braids around her head  --  " The others joined , " Maybe you could play some Wagner records for her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is sung in French . " " I bet she 's fat and has apple-cheeks . " " She 's probably intellectual . Lots of refugees are . " " Talk to her about food . They all like to cat . " " I ca n't talk to her about anything , " stormed Dick . " Mother , I 've got a date ! Why ca n't the boss tell Mr. Thingum to leave his daughter at home ? Why do I have to  --  and shut up , all of you . I think you 're being unsympathetic and awful . " " Dick , please be a good sport , " Elizabeth urged . " This does n't happen often . " " It does too . You remember that horrible girl from New York who was all teeth that I had to take out when her family had dinner here ? But this is worse . A foreigner who ca n't even talk except to say glub-glub ! " " I low do you know she ca n't talk ? Her father speaks Eng-lish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " pled Elizabeth . " She 'll probably have a very good time if you 'll let her . Remember she 's in a strange country , and most of those refugees have had some very unpleasant experiences . Ca n't you be sorry for them at all ? " " It 's easy to be sorry for refugees , " said Dick , " when you do n't have to put up with them . " Torn between a desire to laugh and tell him he need n't do it , and a realization that Mr. Kessler 's daughter must be taken care of somehow if he and Spratt were to have a chance to talkp74business , Elizabeth did not answer immediately . She was glad to hear the sound of a key in the front door . " There 's the boss , " said Cherry , getting up . " Now we can eat ! " Dick exclaimed as though glad to have something to rejoice about . He got up to pour a cocktail for his father . Spratt came in and greeted them all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make around the fire , " he remarked as Elizabeth took his coat and Dick gave him the Martini . " Where 's Brian ? " " Having dinner with Peter Stern . Cherry , go to the kitchen and tell them the boss is here . " " What have you been doing ? " asked Spratt . " Listening to the radio ? " " No , what 's going on ? " " The same , only worse . All hell 's loose in Russia . Come on upstairs wits me while I get cleaned up , " he invited Elizabeth . " Cherry , tell them I 'll be ready in fifteen minutes . " " Wait a minute , boss , " exclaimed Dick . " I 've got something important to ask you . Do I have to take that refugee girl on a date tomorrow night ? " " What refugee girl ? " " The one who 's coming here to dinner with her old man . Ca n't she , possibly  --  " Spratt drew a long breath and started to laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter , " he said , " is eight years old . " The four youngsters gave long simultaneous whistles . " Oh joy , oh rapture unconfined ! " sang Dick . " My life is renewed . I do n't have to ! Did you hear , everybody ? She 's eight years . old ! Why did n't you tell me ? What were you doing talking about Russia when all the time you knew that girl was eight years old ? Mc sitting up here dying and you 've got to bring up Russia ! " Elizabeth got out of the room ahead of Spratt and ran up the stairs . He followed her . When he came into his bedroomp75he found her crumpled up in his reading chair . She was laughinguncontrollably . Spratt stood watching her in amazement . " Elizabeth , what in the world is the matter with you ? " For a moment she could not answer . With an effort she caught her breath , saying , " N  --  nothing . Only I think  --  I think that for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Elizabeth , what  --  " " Please do n't pay any attention to me . I 'm behaving like a moron . But it is funny , Spratt . We 're sitting on the edge of a volcano dangling our legs over the crater , and Dick knows it  --  I 've just heard him talking , so grim and hard he frightened me , and in fifteen minutes nothing was important to him except that that German girl was eight years old and he did n't have to take her out . Oh , that resilience ! Did I ever have it , I wonder ? " She began to laugh again , this time more softly . Spratt shrugged , went into the bathroom and turned on the water . When he came out Elizabeth , having made herself be quiet , was wiping her eyes . Spratt stood over her , shaking his head in confusion . " Did anything happen this afternoon , Elizabeth ? You can tell me . " " Not a thing . I came home and got dressed for dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was time to get out the cocktails . " She stood up . " I 'm sorry for being so foolish , Spratt . But every now and then  --  well , maybe sometimes you 've got to laugh so you wo n't scream . " " All right , " said Spratt , " leave it at that . " He never pressed her for explanations , knowing if there was anything she intended to explain he would get it eventually without asking . " You 'd better go and do something to your face . You 've laughed and cried it streaky . " " All right , I will . " Slipping her hands into his , she stood up . " And thank you for being such a calm person . Most men would either have called me a fool or asked a thousand ques-tions. "  | With an expression of mingled sympathy and amusement , Spratt kissed her . " You 're not a fool . Incidentally , you look mighty well in that outfit . " " It 's the hostess-gown you gave me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliterate the tracks on her face . Spratt was waiting at the head of the stairs . She smiled at him reassuringly and they started down , and he smiled back . They went in to dinner with the others . " Oh boy , " said Dick as they sat down . " Shrimps to start with . I love ' em . " " So do I , " said Spratt , and ate the first one . " Quite a sauce , Elizabeth , " he observed . " A decent writer on that picture for a change , and a good dinner  --  " He grinned at his offspring . " What have the millionaires got that we have n't got ? " " Dyspepsia , " said Dick.  | AT HALF-PAST four the following afternoon , Spratt was winding up another conference with the new writer who had come from Germany . Spratt pushed his chair back from his desk and grinned at his colleague . " That 's all for the present , Kessler . We can go into more detail tonight after dinner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , Mr. Herlong . " The new writer smiled back , and though his heavy dark beard emphasized his foreignness to this American office and his customary dignity was such that his smile , unlike Spratt 's , could hardly be called a grin , he conveyedhis acknowledgment of the comradeship that springs up swiftly when two workers discover they can work together . " When you will read the synopsis  --  I am sorry , the treatment  --  you will forgive my awkwardness with the language ? " Spratt chuckled . " In the first place , your language is very rarely awkward , and in the second place I can get a dozen writers who know English grammar for one who can tell a story . I do n't mind saying , Kessler , you took a load off my shoulders in our conference yesterday . You understand stories  --  I wish you could tell me how to make all these English grammarwriters understand them . " " Perhaps it is only sometimes viewing situations as other people would view them , and not entirely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I supposed to tell that to the inhabitants of this egoriddencapital ? " Spratt laughed ruefully and shook his head . " Yes , Lydia ? " he said as his secretary came in.  | " The art department has sent down the sketches of the bedroom and living room sets . Do you want to see them now or are you and Mr. Kessler still in conference ? " She glanced toward Spratt 's visitor with the respect she gave anybody whose ideas came to the rescue of a befuddled script . Spratt 's visitor answered for him . " He wants to see the sketches , and we are no longer in conference , Miss Fraser . " He moved forward in his chair , placed his heavy hand on the head of his heavy cane , and pushed himself into a standing position . It was not an easy movement , but he accomplished it with the skill of long practice . Lydia opened the door for him . A clever girl , she managed to make it look like a gesture of deference instead of necessary aid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cane , and since he had only his right hand this made it impossible for him to open a door without pushing a chair toward it so he could sit down . Spratt had risen too , and walked over to the entrance . " Then I 'll pick you up at your office this evening , as close to six-thirty as I can , and we 'll go to my home for dinner . " " Thank you , Mr. Herlong . " He smiled courteously at Lydia . " And thank you , Miss Fraser . " Lydia went with him to the outer door of the bungalow , then returned to Spratt 's inner office with the set sketches in her hand . " A remarkable man , Kessler , " Spratt observed as he took the sketches . " Is n't he ? To sink into that script forty-eight hours and conic up with a solution . And him half dead , too . Did the Nazis beat him up , or was he in the war , or what ? " " I 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though you ca n't help wondering . Maybe nothing but an auto accident . " " I lc does manage to bow from the waist in spite of it . Do you suppose lie 's going to continue forever calling everybody around here Mr. and Miss ? " Spratt laughed a little , and shrugged . " Probably . Germans are very formal . Never mind . I like him . "  | " So do I , " said Lydia . Meanwhile the subject of their conversation walked to his own bungalow , which was conveniently located next door , since his power of walking was limited to very short distances . Explaining to his secretary that Mr. Herlong was to call for him later , he went through the reception room into his private office beyond . Alone , he glanced around the room with approval . It was furnished with only the necessities of his work  --  a desk with pencils and stacks of paper , a working-chair and an easy-chair , a case holding reference books , a typewriter that wrote only capital letters and required no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to operate such a machine with his one hand . Bare as the room was , he liked it , for it had wide windows bringing in abundant light , and giving a view of the vast hills beyond the studio lot . A mirror on the wall reflected the hills , producing an impression of space and peace . Space and peace , he reflected as he looked around ; this was what he wanted now , this was what they still had in America . The Americans took them both for granted . Even now there were some Americans who did not realize how precious they were , and how rare . This reflection came to him of itself whenever he looked around . It occurred to him now , but he paid hardly any attention to it ; he had another concern to occupy his attention . ' Tonight he was going to see Elizabeth . He was going into her home and see her there , surrounded by all the things she had ever wanted , and the prospect of it gave him a pleasure that was warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had all these things she would never know that he had given them to her. 1 le went over to the mirror on the wall and stood there looking at his reflection . It was not possible that she could recognize him . Between them lay not merely twenty-four years , but the wreckage made by that shell at Chateau-Thierry , which had destroyed him so terribly that it had taken one ofp8othe greatest surgeons in Germany five years to put together the semblance of a body that he now possessed . A makeshift that had been uncertain enough in normal times , this frame of his could hardly , after the effort to which it had been forced when he had to get out of Germany , be expected to last much longer . It was only because he was sure he could not last much longer that he was willing now to let himself see Elizabeth . Ile had never expected to see her again . In those frightful days in the German hospital , he had not wanted to . He had wanted her to be rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rid of himself . Even now he trembled when he remembered that slow , tortured rebuilding , insertion of metal strips to replace shatteredbones , stretching of shrunken muscles , inadequate food and inadequate anesthetics , his own screams and curses at the man who persisted in keeping him alive when he wanted to die . How that doctor had kept at him , with implacable hands that he himself could see only as instruments of horror , forcing into him the life he did not want , and slowly , through all of it , giving him against his will life that was really life  --  not mere physical existence , but a personality and a will , a re-creation so profound that it seemed quite natural , when he began to realize what was being given him , that along with all the rest he had a new name . Kessler  --  thank heaven , he had thought then , it was easy to say , for in those days the new language had seemed very difficult , though now it was so much his own that when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had half forgotten the old . The doctor 's name was not so easy . Jacoby . How he had dreaded that man at first ! He remembered Jacoby , in the days when he himself did not know a word of German , struggling through a scanty knowledge of English to make him understand what was being done to him , which he did not understand and hated Jacoby for doing , never dreaming then that he was meeting the greatest man he was ever to know in his life . He shivered with a cold gust of hate whenever he remembered how the Nazis had houndedp81that great man to his death for no crime but the unforgivable iniquity of having been born a Jew , and of being so rockbound in his own goodness that he was incapable of accepting the evil of mankind until it had crushed him beyond escape . There had been little he could do in his love for Jacoby 's memory , nothing but get to the United States while there was still time to save Jacoby 's child. his grief and rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terror lest he not be able to bring Jacoby 's little girl to safety , had been so great that not until he was on the westbound steamer did he realize that when he got to America he was probably going to see Elizabeth . Ile knew her husband 's name was Spratt Herlong and that he was employed by Vertex Studio , and in his own luggage was a contract signed in the Paris office of Vertex . He would be virtually sure to meetHerlong some day , and it might follow as a matter of course that he would meet Elizabeth . He went into his cabin and looked at himself a long time in the glass , as he was doing now . I f there was a chance of her knowing him he would break his contract and make a living as a translator , a clerk , anything that would provide little Margaret with three meals a day without destroying Elizabeth 's peace of mind . But a long scrutiny satisfied him that there was no chance of it . In no sense , except the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explosion at Chateau-Thierry , could he believe he had any trace of the Arthur Kittredge she had known. le was Erich Kessler , dear friend of the late Dr. Gustav Jacoby , author of books based on case-histories of Dr. Jacoby 's patients , and the change in his personality was as thorough as t he change in his name . No man who had endured what he had endured in body and spirit could have much left in common with a happy , arrogant youth who did not know what it was to want anything he could not get . He looked thoughtfully at his image in the glass . Crippled as he was , his appearance was not repulsive . One could see that in spite of his uncertain legs he had been meant for a tall man , and since his torso had to carry his weight the muscles there were powerfully developed . The effect was inevitably onesided , since his left sleeve had been empty so long , but his right arm was like that of an athlete , and the hand which for twenty years had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break a china cup between the thumb and fingers . His face had no visible trace of the wound there except a scar that went upward from beneath his beard in a thin curving line . His hair was still thick , gray like steel ; his beard was heavy too , and darker . He had let it grow with no thought of disguise , but to cover the scars that all Jacoby 's careful skin-grafting had not been able to eliminate . Now he was glad he had it and was so used to it , for in spite of having seen thousands of Hitler 's pictures most Americans still thought of Germans as being professors in dark beards . She would not know him , but he would know her , as readily as he had known the picture standing on Spratt Herlong 's desk . To be sure , he had been looking for it , but he would have recognized it anyway as Elizabeth . She had changed in those years , of course , but her alteration had been nothing more than the well-ordered development @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by anyone who had been as intimately acquainted with her as he had . Elizabeth had always known what she wanted out of life , because she was so eminently fit to have it . Physically and spiritually , she had wanted love , marriage , children , a home in which she would be no petted darling , but a versatile and devoted creator . From the beginning she had instinctively known herself capable of bringing all this into being , and so she had looked forward to it with the eagerness of those who have no doubt of their destiny . When lie met Spratt , and saw the pictures of Elizabeth in Spratt 's office , he felt that the change time had made in her appearance had been no more than the change one observes in the achievement of something of which one has seen the be/ginning . Now that he could think of her without the pain of the earlier years , he was glad he had been wise enough to step aside so that she could have it . He saw the pictures last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Spratt had been talking for some time about the script , and if Kessler 's attention had wandered it was no matter , since he was going to read the script tomorrow anyway . When Spratt had finished , and he himself had risen to leave , he glanced at the photograph on the desk , saying with the casualnessborn of years of self-command , " Your wife , Mr. Her-long ? " Spratt said , " Why yes , " taking up the picture and handing it to Kessler with the proud smile of a man showing his friend a treasure . " But that 's not very good of her  --  at least , I never did think those formal portraits were as good as candid shots , too smooth and pressed-out , if you get what I mean . " " Yes , I understand and agree with you . " Kessler was looking at her face . " But this is very charming . " " Oh yes , so it is , but this one on the wall looks more like her . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " Kessler followed Spratt and looked at the picture on the wall . " Yes , yes , " he said with involuntary eagerness , " that , I ; till sure , is more like her . " For it was like her , he knew that without having seen the original in so long . The picture had been taken somewhere outdoors , perhaps on a ranch . Either Elizabeth and her children did not know they were being photographed , or the photographerwas a genius at creating an unposed effect . Dressed in a sweater and skirt , her hair blowing , Elizabeth sat on a fence beyond which grew an orange tree ; a young girl leaned on the fence near by , while a tall youth who looked very much like Flizabeth was standing by the tree , pulling its branches forwardbetween his mother and sister so they could pick off the fruit , and a little boy , sitting on the ground in front of the fence , was already peeling the skin off an orange . By accident or design , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all four laughing . It was a group of healthy people who loved one another and were very happy about it . No wonder Spratt preferred it to the studio portrait on his desk . That was Elizabeth as she appeared to other people , her private life discreetly concealed behind a pleasant tranquillity of eyes and lips , but this was Spratt 's wife as he loved her . Looking at the group , the outsider from Germany knew more profoundly than he had ever known before how much he had given Elizabethwhen he had made up his mind to leave her free of his own wreckage . He glanced at Spratt , who was looking not at him but at the picture of his family , and for a moment he hated Spratt so fiercely that he could have killed him . But that passed quickly ; long discipline had steadied his emotions as much as his conduct , and after that moment of hatred he felt nothing but gladness that his gift to her had been as great as he had meant it to be . Today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go back to the days when he had realized he had to do this because he loved Elizabeth too much to do anything else . The first days after the battle were nothing but confusion , fever and pain . He was in a place where there were a lot of other men on other cots , and women with pale harassed faces trying to take care of them , but he could not understand anything that was being said or anything that was done . He was strapped up in bandages that were far from clean , and among the people around him was a man gaunt as an ascetic , who came over now and then and did various horrible things to him . He did not know then that in those closing days of the war in Germany there was not cloth enough for fresh bandages or soap enough to wash those that had been used , or drugs to relieve suffering , or that his attendantshad white faces and shaky hands because they were not getting enough to eat . Even when he began to discover this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had begun to discover also the extent of the damage these Germans had donep85to him . He had no doubt that he was going to die , and the only wish he was strong enough to make was that he might die quickly and get it over . Babbling in the only language he knew , he begged the gaunt cruel man to let him alone . At first the doctor seemed to be paying no attention , but one day his patient observed that he was talking , and after several repetitions the ungainly syllables acquired meaning . The doctor was saying , " Forgive me that I hurt you . " lIis accent was so thick as to be almost unintelligible , but the fact that he had any English at all gave a flash of hope to the mangled object on the cot . Any effort was torture , but if this fool of a doctor could be made to understand that a dying man wanted nothing more than to be left in peace , it was worth the effort . His own words were muffled because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get them out . " Listen to me . I am not one of your countrymen  --  you know that , do n't you ? My name is Arthur Kittredge . I am an American . Your enemy  --  do n't you get that ? I am going to die anyway . Why do n't you just let me do it ? " The doctor said something . Arthur did not understand it until it had been repeated several times , and when he finally caught the words they were not worth the trouble of listening , for all the doctor said was , " Quiet . You be quiet . " Arthur tried again , desperate with pain and weakness . " Do me a kindness . Give me something to finish it , wo n't you ?  --  Please listen  --  I 'm talking as plain as I can ! Finish it . That 's not much to ask , is it ? " Again the doctor said , " Quiet . " " If you do n't care about doing a kindness to me , do it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own men . Why should you let me fill up a bed when German soldiers are lying on the floor ? Or waste food on me when you have n't enough for your own ? Do n't keep me  --  " His words ended in a gasp of pain . But he still looked at thep86doctor , too weak to say any more but conscious enough to plead with his eyes . Whether or not the doctor had understood all his words , he had grasped enough to know what Arthur wanted . He shook his head . " No , " he said . " No . " Exhausted as he was , Arthur could see him groping for more words . Mustering all his strength , Arthur managed to say again , " I am going to die anyway . " " No , no . You are not going to die . " He spoke with a grim resolution that seemed to typify all Arthur had ever heard about the coldness of Germans and their inability to understand any reason why they might not always be right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he looked at the doctor with eyes that Jacoby told him later conveyed all his rage and disbelief . Arthur knew he was going to die and he wanted it over . But Jacoby 's thin face had no yielding in it . Jacoby left him then , but he came back later , and this time his bony hand brought up a German-English dictionary out of his frayed pocket . Even with this aid , his English was so poor that he could convey nothing but a repetition of his refusal . Alone in his prison of pain , Arthur thought , " At home they 'd shoot a dog that had been smashed by a truck . But this ca n't last much longer . It ca n't . If I had n't been so healthy it would be over by now . But good God , have these people no mercy at all ? I 'd shoot the most heartless Germanunder heaven before I 'd let him die a death like this . " He was glad Elizabeth could not see him . She would never know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her he was dead and she would think it had been quick and clean . " He never knew what hit him , " they would say to her , and at least it would be easier for her than if she had to know how long it had taken him to die . And of course he did have one thing to be thankful for  --  if that shell had to hit him , he could be glad it had done its work . He would be dead and done with , and would not have to go back to her a halfhumancaricature of what used to be her husband . Though thatp87wretch of a German doctor refused to shorten this last phase , though he might be beast enough to enjoy seeing one of his enemies get what was coming to him , even he could not indefinitelyprolong it . But at last Arthur discovered , with a revulsion that he could not have expressed if he had known the whole dictionary by heart , that this was exactly what the doctor meant to do to him . Jacoby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur had ceased trying to understand him . Ile had about given up trying to do the only thing that interested him , which was to refuse nourishment and get it over that way , for they fed him through a tube and he was too weak to resist . he hated the sight of the doctor with his gaunt face and thin cruel hands . But though he could not resist him , he did not have to listen to the man 's awkward manipulations of the English language and try to make sense out of them . However , the creature persisted , talking to him with many references to his dictionary . Unable to pronounce Arthur 's name , he called him Kitt . He kept telling him something , in a low , insistent voice . He kept at it so long that at last one day the words he had been hearing arranged themselves in Arthur 's mind and became an orderly sequence . Stripped of its grotesqueries and repetitions , what Arthur understood went like this : " You are not going to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not as you were . But you have your eyes , your hearing , the jaw will heal and there will be a hand . I think you will be able to sit upright . Walking I can not promise , but I will try . It will be long and hard . But work with me , Kitt , and I will work with you . Do you understand me ? You are not going to die . " Arthur made an inarticulate noise . He looked at the doctor 's steely blue eyes . They were fixed on him with a determination that made Arthur feel that this fellow was regarding him not as a man but as the subject of an inhuman experiment . Instead of letting him go , Jacoby was going to keep him conscious for years to come , simply to prove that he could do it . What was left of Arthur quivered with rage . " You brute , " he said , " you damned brute . " He continued with epithets worse than that . He had never been addicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so readily to his lips . But the words were there and he used them , and continued using them every time he saw the doctor . Later he asked Jacoby if he had understood anything of what he had been saying then . Jacoby smiled with the grim humor Arthur had learned to recognize . " Not the vocabulary . But I did not need the vocabulary to understand what you were saying to me , and just then I did not blame you . " But at that time Jacoby paid no attention to the protests . He simply left Arthur there to contemplate his shattered body and go wild with the prospect of being forced to live in it . There was nothing else Jacoby could do . He was working eighteen hours a day , on a pittance of food that in pre-war Germany would not have been thought enough for an idle old man . Besides , since he knew so little English and Arthur knew no German at all , he had to let Arthur go on believing what he believed . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this war had almost annihilated his faith in the human soul . There was no way for him to say that he too was on the edge of despair , searching desperately for some reason to believe that men could be saved from the evil they had wrought . Before the war , Jacoby had never doubted the essential worth of the spirit . Ile had not thought mankind was perfect or likely to become so , but he did respect his fellowmen because he thought that for the most part they deserved it . He had no patience with those contemptuous pessimists who shrugged at the human race as though they had looked it over and decided that it would never amount to much . To them he had been ac/customed to say , " Most people have a lot to put up with and most of them put up with it very well . I know some of them are fools and scoundrels , but there 's a lot of courage in the world , and a lot of quiet unostentatious nobility . People in general are all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the trouble to know them better . " That , expressed in homely language , was his faith in the fundamental value of life . He had believed in it . But that was in the pleasant days before the war . Then came the four years he had just lived through . The physical wrecks brought to him had been dreadful enough , but they were not the worst . Some of those he could heal and some he could not . But he had been appalled , sickened , and at last reduced almost to hopelessness as lie saw the disintegration of humanity . He had seen men turned into brutes incapable of any emotion but hate , he had seen it over and over , so often that he wondered why he should be trying to save their lives when they had nothing left that nude them fit to live . The fury and terror around him had come close to uprooting all the confidencehe had ever had in men 's being fundamentally better t han this . He wanted to believe they were . If this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destroyed themselves the better . It was very hard , in this last year of the war , to go on believing in anything . Arthur had been brought to him when he had begun to feel himself giving in to a brutal cynicism . ' When he examined Arthur , he suddenly felt that here was a man who could prove t he ultimate test , not of a human body to recover , but of human courage to overcome disaster . When this American realized what had been done to him his mind would be black with hate and horror , even if it had never been before . At first he had wondered if he had the right to prolong such a life as this . But after several of those examinations under which Arthur had screamed and cursed at him , Jacoby had convinced himself t hat with labor and patience he could guarantee that his patient would not be helpless . Arthur would have something to work with . If he could be made to use what he had , and with it regain any wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacoby promised himself that he would take it as meaning that humanity could do the same . As he worked with him , as he saw Arthur 's fury and despair , Arthur became to him a symbol of the world 's wreckage . If this shattered American could come back , there was hope . The damage of the war was done to the world as it was done to Arthur , but if Arthur could be made to go on , could be made to want to go on , there was a reason for living . By this time Jacoby was not sure that there was . But he was going to find out . Arthur still hated him . He had ceased to doubt that Jacoby meant exactly what he said : Jacoby was not going to let him die , but was going to restore as much as he could of what had been lost . That there was so much he could not restore made no difference to his eagerness . Much of the work was necessarilyexperimental . " But it 's the sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not often he finds a patient who simply ca n't be any worse off , no matter how many mistakes he makes . When he gets one like that he gives him the works . One man is better than a thousand guinea pigs . I can sec the reasoning . Only I never thought of its happening to me . " When he did have a chance to talk to Arthur again , Jacoby 's difficulty with the language was so great that he could tell him very little . But after many attempts he managed to say , " When you were begging me to let you alone , I was trying to make sure you would keep your right arm . Believe me , Kitt , if you had lost both arms , or if there had been blindness with all the rest , 1 should have done what you asked me . " Arthur said angrily , " Why do n't you do it now ? " Jacoby gave him a look of real surprise . " Do you still want me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a subject for vivisection. "  | " Kitt , do you still think that is what I am doing to you ? " " You know it is . " Jacoby shook his head . He fumbled for words . He said , " I watched you for many days . I fought a battle . I can not say it well . Perhaps in English I can not say it at all . You are a man , Kitt , but also you are mankind . You must live . You must want to live . You must  --  do you understand me ? " He spoke so intensely that he was almost fierce . " Kitt , " he exclaimed , " let us try ! " Though he did not realize it then , Arthur remembered later that his own resistance was gradually being worn away by the power of Jacoby 's determination . As time went on , he came to recognize the enthusiasm Jacoby was feeling . 1 lc had felt it himself when there was some almost impossible job to be tackled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " he knew what it meant to roll up his sleeves , saying that . What he did not realize at the time was that this was not what Jacoby was saying . Jacoby was saying to himself , " If he can do this , I can do anything . " The first time he began to understand that Jacoby was not merely a cold scientist was the day when Jacoby came to his bedside with a slip of paper and a pencil . " Kitt , if you will tell me  --  spell it slowly  --  the name of the woman you kept talking to when you were delirious  --  ? " Arthur groaned . His impulse was to grip Jacoby 's hand , but he could not do this . He could only say , " In God 's name , Jacoby , be merciful ! If you 've made up your mind to do this to me I ca n't stop you . But do n't do it to her . " Without looking at Arthur , Jacoby said , " I thought it mightbe possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arthur did not answer . After a pause Jacoby asked , " You do not want to tell me who she is ? " Arthur said , " She is my wife . " Jacoby turned his head toward the bed then , involuntarily.  |p92He  knew no words to speak and even if he had been using his own language there could have been nothing to say so eloquent as the pity he could not keep out of his eyes . He crumpled the slip of paper in his fist . There was a silence . At length Jacoby said , " Very well . " He turned and went away . But in the depth of his own despair Arthur felt a stir of astonished warmth . " My God , the man is a human being . There are some things even he ca n't take without a shudder . " After that , slowly but unmistakably , he began to discover that Jacoby wanted to be his friend . He began , dimly at first , through those days and nights of desolation , to grasp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are a man , but also you are mankind . " It was a hard realization , and at first he was doubtful that it had any meaning . " He can make me stay alive , " Arthur said to himself wearily . " But can he make me find any reason for doing it ? Can anybody ? I do n't believe it . " Jacoby came back to his bedside often . He never again mentioned the woman Arthur had called for in his delirium . But there was more work on the arm , more on the jaw ; the rest had to wait on the patient 's strength and the doctor 's opportunities . Arthur still had very little hope . Now that he understood Jacoby 's purpose , he tried to sympathize with it , but he found this hard to do . For after all , even after years of labor and pain , even with the highest success , what was the utmost Jacoby could give him ? Power to use his right arm ; power to sit up and write a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hobble from place to place with a crutch . Power to look on hopelessly while healthy men and women went ahead with their healthy affairs , doing useful work and enjoying the rewards of it . Not even Jacoby 's genius could restore him the sense of knowing he could take care of himself no matter what happened , the old happy forthrightness of being able to look the whole world in the face and tell it to get out of his way . Jacoby could never restore him his marriage . He could never give Elizabeth the children shep93wanted , or even the security and companionship she had had with him . Lying in a helpless huddle on his cot in the intervals of being fed and washed by strange hands , Arthur had nothing to do but look ahead into the sort of life-sentence he would be giving her if he let Jacoby communicate with her . No doubt he had been reported missing in action . When they found him , the Red Cross would have means of notifying Elizabeth he was still alive . After the war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it possible for him to go home , he would have to go . And then ? Elizabeth would offer him everything she had . She was too loyal , and she loved him too much , to dream of doing otherwise . She would work , and use everything she could earn for his support . She would spend her life nursing him , amusing him , taking care of him , himself a broken wreck of a creature who could give her nothing in return except a doglike gratitude . Her splendid vitality would be spent in a twilight of half-living until she was dry and withered like fruit that had been broken off the tree before it had had a chance to ripen . As he thought of it he knew more and more surely that no matter what would become of him , he could not let this happen to her . His decision was not entirely unselfish . Arthur was too clearheadedto imagine it was . Not only could he not do this to Elizabeth , but he could not do it to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to share it . IIe knew , almost as if he were with her , what she would suffer at being told of his death . But that would not last forever , though at the time she would undoubtedly think it was going to . She would pick up the broken pattern of her life and set about putting it together again . Elizabeth was young , vital , alert , and there would be another man who would find her as lovable as he had found her . She would have again the sort of mating she should have . He tried instinctively to clench his list with decision , and the pain that went like a bayonet-thrust into his shoulder , reminding him that he was not even able to make such a simple gesture , served to strengthen his resolve . When a man dies , he told himself , with more fierceness in his mind since there could be none in his body , it is like taking a teaspoonful of water out of a river . The water closes up , it is gone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Jacoby came in again , Arthur told him what he had decided to do . He had to speak slowly , repeating often and waiting until Jacoby 's intelligence had limped through to comprehension . The effort to make Jacoby understand took his attentionaway from the bleak import of what he was saying . " I will make you a promise , Jacoby , if you will do one thing for me . Do it , and come back and tell me you have done it . " " I understand you . Go ahead . " " When I was brought in here , you found the metal tag of identification ? And other things , maybe ? Take those to the International Red Cross . Tell them your stretcher-bearers brought in an American who died of his wounds . You do not know his name . But you took these objects from his body . You will sign a death certificate , or whatever you have to sign . The American army will take care of the rest . If you will do this , and bring me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I promise you that I will let you do whatever you please to me . But if you will not do it , I swear to you that I 'll make you do it because I 'll end my life as soon as I have a usable hand to do it with . " Deliberately , further to relieve his attention , he fixed his eyes on Jacoby 's eyes , tender as the eyes of a mother ; on Jacoby'sstrong , wise , gentle face ; and while he repeated his sentenceshe noticed again what a thin face it was , the skin showing the waxiness of malnutrition , and guessed as he had guessed beforethat this man was denying himself part of his own rations to provide more nourishment for the men he was trying to save . At last he said , slowly and carefully , " You understand me ? You will do what I ask , Jacoby ? "  |p95Jacoby  nodded . While he sought for his answer his right hand covered the right hand that could not yet be clenched , friendly across the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will do that . " It was all he could say , but by that time they had learned to do a good deal of communicating without language . Jacoby did not have a wife of his own . Until now his life had been too full of work and war to give him much chance to think of personal happiness . Later he was to find out what it meant to have a woman 's suffering mean more to him than his own . But he did not hesitate before Arthur 's request . Arthur con-tinued , " You will not communicate with my wife . You will not try to find her . " " I understand what you are saying . I will not try to find her . " " She will marry again , " Arthur said . " Another man will love her , she will have children , she will be happy . Do you get it , Jacoby ? She 's a splendid woman , I 'm going to get out of her way . Oh , you do n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm right . " Jacoby tried to answer . " You are  --  " he hesitated , reaching into his pocket for the dictionary he always carried now  --  " you are most completely right , Kitt . " He looked down at the bundle of bandages before him , and added , " I do under-stand . " " You  --  " Arthur 's voice broke in a sob , and the sob came from so deep that it sent points of pain through him and he had to wait till they subsided before he could go on  --  " you do n't understand . You never loved a woman . " Again the sob rushed up , and again he had to wait till the pain of it went down . " You never loved a woman , " he said , " enough to die for her . " Whether the barrier was language or experience , this time Jacoby did not try to answer . But he went and did what Arthur had asked him to do.  | JACOBY used one of the precious night hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a sort of shelf across Arthur 's cot , and set the dictionary up on it . " My English is so faulty , Kitt , and I have no time to improve it . Why do you not learn to talk to me ? " He read the first words aloud to him , slowly , so Arthur could begin to learn their pronunciation . While he was taking a hasty meal of turnips and potatoes Jacoby drew rough sketches of various objects in the room , writing their names beside them , and set the sheet up for Arthur to study during the day . Arthur blessed him for it . He was not yet able to push his thoughts forward into what he might be going to do with the future Jacoby was forcing upon him . This occupationwas enough for the present . He filled up his mind with German words to keep it from being filled up with thoughts of Elizabeth . When Jacoby came to see him he talked in simplesentences , proudly , and felt a childish delight when Jacoby and the nurses began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking back on those days , Jacoby said to him , " You did not know how you were encouraging me then . " Arthur answered , " Maybe you never knew how often I nearly gave up . " " Yes I did know , " said Jacoby , " but you did not give up . That is what I mean , Kitt . " To the very end , Jacoby sometimes called him Kitt . If anyoneasked why , he said , " Oh no , Herr Kessler 's first name is Erich . Calling him Kitt is an old bad habit of mine , from years back . " They were both so used to it they generally forgot it was anp97abbreviation of his old name . The new name was provided by Jacoby after Arthur had been moved to the hospital in Berlin , while he was convalescing from another of the surgical operations Jacoby inflicted upon him . He had been very ill and Jacoby had given him a blood transfusion . When he was better and tried to express his thanks Jacoby retorted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kitt  --  made of nothing but turnips and a carrot or two . But I have something else for you , more important . " He produced a document , offering it with an air of triumph . " Here is your birth certificate . " Arthur laughed at that . Birth certificates had not been important in the United States before the war . Ile had never had one . But Jacoby was a German and thought like a German , and to him his beloved Kitt 's physical welfare was no more essential than the records which the Germans demanded even in their most chaotic days . Jacoby explained , " Listen carefully , Kitt . From now on your name is Erich Kessler . I have lost sleep over wondering how you could identifyyourself , until one morning about three o'clock I found the solution . When I was a child , my parents knew a couple named Kessler . They had a son named Erich . While the boy was still a baby , the Kesslers went to the United States . They lived in a town called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Milwaukee . You have heard of it ? " Arthur nodded . " Yes . I grew up in a town called Chicago . They are very near each other . " " You have been to Milwaukee ? " " Frequently . " " That is good . While he was still a small child , Erich Kessler ( lied . I know that , because his mother and mine used to correspond . But there is no official record of that in this country , because the Kesslers stayed in the United States and were naturalized . For all I know they may be there to this day . " " Making beer , perhaps ? " " Why ? Do you know them ? "  | " Never heard of them . But I know Milwaukee . Go on , Jacoby . " " I have obtained Erich Kessler 's birth certificate . I have recorded that Erich  --  you  --  naturalized without his knowledgeor consent when his parents were naturalized , was drafted into the American army . The rest follows . You have returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now until you want to leave . " " I shall not want to leave , Jacoby . " " I hope not . But anyway , this makes you a German and at the same time takes care of your American accent . However , please listen to me and try to speak like me . Erich Kessler would have heard his parents speak German at home and would pronounce it better than you do . " " I 'll do my best . Correct me whenever you please . " Almost automatically , Jacoby was massaging the muscles of his patient 's right arm . " These are flabby , " he observed . " While you are lying in bed , for a few minutes at a time , clench your fist slowly and relax it slowly . Slowly , remember ? That wo n't tax your strength , and you must take care of this arm . You will need it . " " For a crutch ? " said the new-made Erich Kessler , with a note of his old bitterness . " I hope there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Remember , I 've promised nothing about your legs except to do the best I can with them . " " All right , all right , I know . A man is n't hoping for too much in this world when he hopes for a crutch , is he ? " Jacoby addressed him sternly . " My friend , until you can face what you 're up against now , you are n't fit to try to go further . " There was a long silence . At last the patient said , " I get it , Jacoby . And  --  ah  --  thank you . " Jacoby stood up . " Thank you , for not being angry with me . " " Oh , shut up , will you ? " He felt like changing the subject.  | " By the way , Jacoby , this Erich Kessler  --  me  --  am I a Jew like you ? " " No , why ? Were you a Jew at home ? " " No , that 's why I asked . I thought if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something about the religious rituals . But if I 'm not , then it 's not important . " Startling to remember now that there had been a time when one could say " It 's not important , " so carelessly , and then forget about it . There was nobody then to tell him that Erich Kessler 's not being a Jew was going to be so important later on that it would enable him to save Jacoby 's child . When he was up in a wheel-chair , he went to live with Jacoby . It was almost like living in a hospital . Jacoby had his own laboratory and surgery as part of the Berlin hospital . Patients came and went all day and half the night . There was still lack of food , drugs , trained assistants . Jacoby worked like a demon . Watching him work threw Kessler into dark periods of dismay at his own uselessness . When he spoke of this to Jacoby , he received one of the quiet , direct replies he had learned to expect from his friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of use in the world is ever useless for long . But that is a question you must answer for yourself . If I tried to answer it for you , I should be doing you an injury greater than any you have suffered . I should be telling you that it is no longer necessary for you to be responsible for your own conduct , and that is a crime I wo n't commit against anybody . " Still trembling from the storm that had shattered him , Kessler found this hard to take . Later on he blessed Jacoby for having made him take it , refusing to let him sink into the childish dependency which at first seemed so comfortable a cushion for his s tortured spirit . But since Jacoby did refuse , and his own bodily lassitude made his mind eager for activity , he had to search for a place he was capable of occupying . His first suggestionwas made timidly.  | " Jacoby , I do n't know a thing about medicine or surgery , but if there 's one thing I do know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do some of these routine analyses that take up so much of your time ? Blood-counts , and things like that ? " " Why not ? " Jacoby returned eagerly . " If you only knew how much I need a technician ! I 'll be back in a minute . " He hurried off , and came back with an armful of books which he dumped by the table he had rigged up to match the wheel-chair . " Start with this one . If you have trouble with the vocabulary let me know . " Kessler felt a tingle of returning vigor . This would not be much , but it would be something toward repaying Jacoby . The prospect of making any kind of return was an immeasurableimpetus . He went to work . He worked as hard as Jacoby would let him . Within a couple of weeks he was surprised to find his study interesting for its own sake . " I always thought I was burning up with curiosity about the universe , " he said to Jacoby , " but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know how glad I am you 're letting me do this . " Jacoby shrugged . " Where did you get the impression I was letting ' you do it ? I need you . One of these days , when the country is normal again , maybe I 'll be able to get enough technicians . But now  --  ! " Though at first Kessler undertook only the simplest routines in the laboratory , they absorbed all his energy . He was still far from strong . The work was new , his reports had to be made in a language he still found unwieldy , and learning to make one hand serve the purpose of two required a thousand adjustments . But it meant that he was back in the sphere of active men , doing something that needed to be done , and occupationrelieved him of leisure for brooding . Much of Jacoby 's practice at this time dealt with reconstruc/lion of wounded soldiers , and he got into the habit of coming to the laboratory for advice , at first to bolster his analyst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For as the embittered wreck Arthur Kittredge gradually turned into the confident scientist Erich Kessler , the youthful violence of the first changed to the gentle wisdom of a man who had sunk into the ultimate hopelessness and had come back . Arthur Kittredge had wanted to die ; Erich Kessler , after a long hard battle , wanted to live . Kessler wanted to live because at last he found other people more important than himself , and this came about because he found , at first to his own amazement , that he had something valuable to give them . While he still had to be carried to his wheel-chair and lifted out of it , his efforts to be of some use to Jacoby widened into his being of use to a great many others . As he progressed from elementary routines into tasks of more complexity , Kessler began to act as amanuensis for Jacoby as well as technician . He sat in a corner during Jacoby 's interviewswith his patients , taking notes of their symptoms . As he never said anything , his presence came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consulting-room . Then , gradually , he fell into the habit of letting the patients talk to him if they called when Jacoby was otherwise occupied . He began to learn how many others there were besides himself who had to recover from the impact that physical disability had made on their lives . Jacoby had profound wisdom for these people , but sometimes , looking at Jacoby 's healthy body , they did not believe it . When they looked at Kessler , still limp in his wheel-chair , they knew he knew what they were talking about . So they talked to him , bringing him their own experience of despair . As he listened to all these men and women who wanted to die he began to see with startling clearness how little reason many of them had ever had for wanting to live . They had never been interested in anything but their own sensations . In a world sick with confusion , they were aware of nothing but their personal despondency , and they angrily resisted being made aware of anything else . As he heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trivialities , crying out against a destiny that forced him to look beyondthese for a reason to stay alive . So many of these peoplecould expect far more bodily power than he could . So many of them could take a real step in the march of civilizationif they could first be persuaded to carry their own burdens . He tried to tell them this . Often he failed , for he learned that there were a great many men and women in the world who would literally rather die than admit that their own characters had room for improvement . But sometimes he succeeded , and when he succeededhe felt the ecstasy of creation . Even when he was allowed to stand up , with a crutch on his right side and Jacoby 's arm supporting him on the other , and he actually walked a couple of steps on legs that had been idle four years , his sense of triumph was not as great as when he had managed to convince another human being that there was no real defeat except that of giving up the battle . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would win it completely . By this time he had become reconciled to the knowledge that no matter how he fought there would be periods when he would sit alone in his room sobbing like a child that he could n't take it ; but he knew also that these periods were temporary , and that he could take it . Vhcn Germany had entered into a season of quiet that deceivedinnocent persons like himself and Jacoby into believing that it was recovering from the war , he got in touch with a private investigating agency and found out what had become of Elizabeth . lie was told that she was living in California , marriedand the mother of a son . The news hurt him a great deal more deeply than he had thought it would . Was it conceivable , he asked himself , that he had expected her to spend her life rememberinghim ? Yes , it was conceivable ; that was exactly what the primitive , possessive part of himself had wanted her to do ,  |p103and  now this part of himself was leaping up from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted her freedom . He tried to bury it again , though it was a long time before he succeeded in doing so . But during that time , pretending to himself that he had done so helped him go on about his business . This business had become writing case-histories of the patientswhose lives had come under his own and Jacoby 's care . Disguising their personal circumstances , he had drama enough for a thousand volumes . His only experience of writing had been in putting out technical pamphlets for the oil industry , but he had learned from this to say what he had to say plainly enough to be understood . Without any literary genius , he had learned to think clearly , and fortunately his present subject requiredclearness rather than rhetoric . His books were widely read in Germany before Hitler had the power to order them burnt , and two of them were bought for motion pictures by French studios . With his hospital consultationsand his writing , Kessler had more work than he could do . He was not as happy as he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the triumphant knowledge that he had built a worthwhilecareer on the ruins . In the meantime Jacoby had married a brilliant girl named Ricarda . Much younger than her husband , Ricarda was already showing a devotion to science equal to his , and after their marriagethey worked together . She and Jacoby were passionately in love . Though sometimes the sight of their happy marriage made Kessler feel like a pauper standing in the snow to look through a lighted window , he tried not to let them suspect it . They had been his friends before their marriage , and afterwards t hey remained so . I'hey knew there was an Austrian fanatic named Hitler , but beyond laughing at his bad German when they heard it on the radio they had been too busy to pay much attention to him . None of them had ever been interested in politics . It was easy to see now that they should have been . But they were not , and when they heard Hitler 's fantastic threats it did not occur to them to believe him . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was already full-grown and too strong to be escaped . They had tried to escape . But it was too late . They who had saved so many others could not save themselves . The force of evil closed around them so tight that at last it crushed even their gallant spirits . The Nazis succeeded in doing to Jacoby what the war had not been able to do : they destroyed his faith and with it his courage . So today the great Dr. Jacoby and his wife were only two more of Germany 's uncounted Jewish suicides . Kessler had not been able to save them , but through the connivanceof some of Jacoby 's friends who were risking their lives along with his to help him , he had managed to save their little girl . He got Margaret into France , her surname changed from Jacoby to Kessler on the passport , and a French representative of Vertex Studios met him at the frontier with tickets to Paris . Once in France , he discovered that the American studios were hiring writers , directors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be obtained in Washington , with a grimly gleeful " Thank you , Mr. Hitler ! " as the finest cinema talent of the Old World poured into Hollywood . It was not difficult for him to get an American contract . Two weeks after he left Ellis Island he was working in New York . A little while later he and Margaret came to California . As his own language returned to him , he taught her to speak English . She was a happy little girl now , going to school , though she had not forgotten Germany . He wished it had happened when she was younger . But he had learned not to look back . If a man was to keep any sanity in these times , the only view was forward . I le did not know what was going to become of Margaret . It was scarcely possible that his own overtaxed strength could hold out as long as she would need him . But he had learned too that though one only looked ahead , one did not need to tax his powers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the late sun on the hills beyond , glowing on the slopes while the folds between filled with purple shadow . Dry odors of dust and sagebrushblew in toward him . Around his bungalow were the friendly noises of the day 's end , doors closing , cars starting , voices calling " See you tomorrow ! " In a few minutes Spratt 1 Icrlong would come for him . Surprising , how simple it was now , to be about to see Elizabeth . He had expected never to see her again . He had made another life for himself without her . But now that the Nazis had smashed that life , taking away his work and his friends , forcing his frail powers to the effort of still another beginning , it did not seem too much to ask that at least he might find 1 ? lizabeth in happy possession of all he had made possible for her . When he had seen her , tranquil and assured as she was meant to be , he would know that he had accomplished something in his lifetime . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him completely . He wanted to see her now ; for a long time he could not have said that . Even as lately as ten years ago he would not have cared to undertake it . But there was such a thing as having moved beyond resentment , beyond envy , beyond any demand of his own ego . There was a certain austere happiness in having mastered himself so completely . A cold happiness it was , to be sure , and a lonely one , but at least it did mean peace.  | " THERE 'S the car , " said Elizabeth . " Remember , both of you , not to take any notice of his misfortunes . " Cherry laughed at her reproachfully . " Mother , we 're not savages ! We do n't stare at cripples . " " I know , dear , but sometimes the best of us give a little start when we see persons very different from ourselves . We do n't mean to . " Cherry and Dick promised to be models of good behavior . Elizabeth got up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the entry . She hoped Mr. Kessler would have a comfortableevening . Entertaining Spratt 's business associates was a duty they were all used to , and the older children adapted themselves to it well enough . Brian begged to be let off when there were strangers in to dine , so as usual he had had his dinner early and was now upstairs in his room pottering over his naturalhistory collections . Spratt opened the front door , saying , " 1 Icre we are , Kessler . And here 's my wife . Elizabeth , my friend Erich Kessler that you 've already heard so much about . " Elizabeth looked up with the smile that Spratt characterized as the masterpiece of the accomplished hostess , " not bright enough to look insincere , but not strained enough to look dutiful . Just in between , gracious . " Mr. Kessler 's physical handicaps had threatened to make this occasion difficult , but Elizabeth 's initial glance dispelled her apprehension . l le was badly crippled , but he did not appear resentful ; he faced the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fault he had to find with destiny had been got over long ago . As their eyes met Elizabeth was struck1p107with an impression that she had seen Mr. Kessler somewhere before . It also seemed to her that Mr. Kessler was looking at her with an unusual interest . His eyes went over her swiftly and inclusively , taking in her hair , her face , her dress , every detail of her as though it were important that he should know all about her as soon as possible . It was the way a man might have looked at a famous personage he had long been eager to meet , or a woman so astoundingly beautiful that he wanted to impressher forever upon his memory . Elizabeth was not famous , and while she was not ugly she was no ravishing beauty either . She thought it might mean that they really had seen each other somewhere , and he like herself was trying to identify the recollection . If her own sense of familiarity persisted she could ask him about it later on . All this was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an instant while her attention turned itself to its immediate concerns . She took in his appearance quickly : a big man of more powerful build than she had expected , bent over a heavy cane with a dependence that told her instantly that she should not expect him to shake hands ; iron-gray hair receding at the temples , a thick beard , a scar that rippled up his right cheek , dark eyes with a line of concentration between the eyebrows and crinkles of kindness at the outer corners , and a pleasant smile  --  what she could see of it between the whiskers  --  a very pleasant smile indeed . If he had any idea that this was not their first meeting he gave no evidence of it , for all he said to her was , " How do you do , Mrs. Herlong , " with the stateliness she had learned to expect from Europeans . Elizabeth indicated the room beyond . " Come in by the fire , Mr. Kessler . These are my children . " Dick was standing , with that mixture of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so eminently kissable just when they most resisted being kissed by their mothers . Cherry , with fewer years but more social graces thanp108Dick would acquire for another decade , sat smiling a welcome to the newcomer . Elizabeth introduced them , and again it seemed to her that Kessler was regarding them with an attentionextraordinary in a man who could hardly be supposed to have any interest in them . There was an alertness in the way he spoke to Dick and Cherry , as though he had decided in advance that he was going to be fond of them and hoped they would respond . He said , " Your father has told me a great deal about you , and has shown me your pictures . I am so glad to see you . " Dick , who had already said " How do you do , " tried to look pleasant without knowing what else to say , while Cherry , a shade too adept at social fibs , answered , " He has told us lots about you too , Mr. Kessler , " with such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got to warn Cherry about that sort of thing , if she is n't careful she 's going to be an intolerablegusher before she 's twenty . " Kessler appeared to be finding them the most attractive youngsters on earth . While she was offering him the chair she had intended for him , arrangedwith a little table at its side so he could set down his glass when the hors d'oeuvres appeared , she added to herself , " Spratt must have led him to expect a most remarkable pair of children , he really should n't  --  or is Mr. Kessler as charming as this with everybody ? " Spratt , evidently pleased at the good impression his offspring were making , crossed the room to the door leadingupstairs , explaining that Kessler had had time to wash up in his bungalow before leaving the lot , but he himself had not , and if they 'd forgive him he 'd go up and make himself presentable. " 1 ' 11 leave you with the family , Kessler , " he concluded . Kessler gave him a smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire . " Now we 'll have a cocktail . Dick , will you bartend ? " Dick would ; he was always glad of this to occupy him during his first minutes of encounter with a stranger . Everything becamequite as usual . Dick mixed the Martinis , and as the war had reduced the number of their servants Cherry brought inp109the hors d'oeuvres . " These are liver-paste , Mr. Kessler , and these are smoked salmon , and these thingumbobs on toothpicks  --  I do n't know what they are , something she made out of an old lampshade . " But as Elizabeth and Kessler picked up their glasses and their eyes met across them , she felt another twinge of familiarity . " I have met this man before , I know I have , and he knows it too . Or does n't he ? If he does n't , why is he looking at me like that ? Maybe it 's just because I keep looking at him  --  for pity 's sake , I do believe I 'm staring . Behave yourself , Elizabeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Have you ever been to the United States before , Mr. Kessler ? " He turned to her at once , and Elizabeth thought , " He 's as relieved as I am to have that look between us broken , or if he 's not , then I 'm letting my imagination go haywire . " Ile was answeringCherry , " Yes , Miss Herlong , but that was many years ago , long before this country was brightened by your existence . " " Say , that 's very good ! " Dick exclaimed with a grin . Elizabeth flashed him a teasing glance . " You will , Oscar . " They all laughed , and Dick said to Kessler , " You speak awfully well for a man who 's just been here once , and that so long ago . " " It has been three years since I left Germany . Besides , I have visited England and Scotland . We have more chance to practice foreign languages in Europe than you have here . " " Oh yes , of course you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We take French , and learn to say Have you seen the gardenof my grandmother 's cousin ? ' and then school is out for the summer and we forget it . At least , I always did . " Kessler continued talking with Dick and Cherry . He asked them what they liked to study at school , and what they wanted to do when they had finished , so that they loosened up their company manners and began to talk readily . Their experience with representatives of the picture business had been that mostpIIO of them were so engrossed by their work that they rarely attemptedany conversation about anything but the picture they were working on now or the one they had just finished , and they had been prepared to sit in polite boredom . They were surprised and delighted to have a guest who took an interest in their affairs . At first Elizabeth thought it was very good of him to do so , and she wished more of their visitors were like this ; then it occurred to her that Kessler was concentrating on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had drawn them out skilfully . Dick was telling him the rules of football , and Kessler had nothing to do but listen with the interested appearance of a foreigner who wanted to learn about a native institution . " Am I just seeing things that are n't here , " Elizabeth asked herself , " or is it on purpose that he has n't looked at me once since that curious tense moment across the cocktails ? " It seemed to her now that when their eyes had met and held each other so strangely it had been as though Kessler was about to say something , and at the last instant had caught himself back from saying it , grasping at Cherry 's questionas a means of saving himself . She did not understand what it was all about , but at any rate the dissertation on football had given him time to recover his equilibrium , and he now turned to her with a calmness that made her almost believe all this was merely an exaggeration of her fancy , saying , " Have n't you three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Elizabeth , " but Brian is only eleven , so he had his dinner early . " But she could not help asking , " How did you know there were three ? " " Mr. I lerlong told me , and showed me a picture of you all . Brian is n't asleep yet , is he ? " " I 'm sure he is n't . Do you want to meet him too ? " " I should like to very much , if it 's quite convenient . " Elizabeth laughed a little . " Mr. Kessler , you should know it 's never inconvenient for a mother to display her jewels . Dick , will you run up and get Brian ? "  | " Sure , but you 'd better warn Mr. Kessler that he 'll be all smeared with glue and bugs . Brian 's mounting butterflies , does it all day and night , and he 'll talk your ear off about them if you let him . " " I should like that . Tell him to bring his specimens down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands , " Cherry warned , but Kessler showed no dismay . He only said , " Then tell him to bring a few , and do n't make him brush his hair , or he 'll dislike me before he sees me. " l le and Dick exchanged a look of understanding . As Dick went out Kessler turned to Elizabeth . " I hope I 'm not upsetting a domestic arrangement , Mrs. Herlong , in asking that lie come in . But your two older children are so entertaining that I could n't help wanting to see the other . " " Are n't you nice ! " exclaimed Cherry . " Thank you for saying so , " answered Elizabeth . " Of course , their father and I think they arc , but we love having other people agree with us . " " I 'm sure other people do . You should be very proud , Mrs. Herlong . " He glanced around him . " When one sees a home like this , one knows who is responsible for it . I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are  --  I mean its atmosphere . It 's not by chance one achieves such confidenceand vitality . " He spoke sincerely , obviously meaning what he said . Elizabethfelt a glow of pleasure . It was like what she had felt when she sat on the balcony yesterday afternoon , before she heard the children talking in the den . She wondered what Kessler would say of them now if he had heard that conversation . She said , " I hardly know how to answer such a compliment , Mr. Kessler . Has it occurred to you that perhaps we have too much confidence , a good deal more than is justified by the world we live in ? " " Oh yes , " he replied instantly . " That 's true of nearly allpII2 Americans  --  at least , it seems true to anyone who comes to the United States from Europe . But surely , " he added smiling , " you ca n't hold yourself guilty when a man long surrounded by terror comes into your home and feels encouraged at the thought that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of living ? " His words made her feel better than she had felt all day . Now that the two of them seemed to be back on a normal basis from which a friendship could be started , it occurred to Elizabeth that perhaps Kessler , fresh from Nazi Germany but evidently not part of it , could tell Dick more clearly than she ever could something about the issues at stake in this war he was going to be asked to fight . Much as she loved Dick she could not disguisefrom herself the fact that he was more superficial than she would have liked him to be , so occupied with girls and footballthat he was glad to accept cliches that relieved him from being occupied with more troublesome matters . Dick was a nice boy , but mentally he was a rather lazy one , and neither she nor his father was quite capable of coping with him . Spratt was inclined to believe he would begin to take life seriously when the time came ; Elizabeth thought the time had come for it . Sometimes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents who had spent so many years being more indulgent than they should have been , or who at least had emphasized details of socially acceptable behavior at the expense of the much harder job of making a boy think for himself . Her thoughts were interrupted by the opening of the door from the hall . Spratt and Dick came in with Brian , who had a glass-topped box of specimens under his arm . " This is Mr. Kessler , Brian , " Spratt said . " He wanted to meet you so he could know the whole Herlong family . " " How do you do sir , " said Brian , all in one word , and held out his hand . Fortunately Kessler was sitting down instead of leaning on his cane , and so could give him a handshake . Brian stood uncertainly , one foot curled around the opposite ankle.  | " Your brother tells me you are interested in natural history , " said Kessler , " and I asked him to tell you I should like to see some of your specimens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian nodded . " Butterflies . Want to see them ? " " Look out , " warned Dick , and Cherry said simultaneously , " You do n't know what you 're getting into , Mr. Kessler . " Payingno attention to them , their guest already had his head close to Brian 's as they bent over the butterflies together . Dick poured a cocktail for his father , and saying , " You 'll need another one too , Mr. Kessler , if you let him get started , " he refilled Kessler 's glass . Kessler appeared to be deeply interested in Brian 's butterflies . Brian was chattering. " . . . that blue one is easy to get , they 're everywhere exceptwhere it 's too cold for them . The name is Lamp  --  Lampidessomething , I forget , but I 've got it written in my notebook . This is a monarch butterfly , they fly north in the summertime like birds . The copper and black one , you 've seen thousands like it , it 's a viceroy . " Spratt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he ? " he said under cover of the other dialogue . " Yes indeed . But we must n't let Brian wear him out . " " I think he likes it , " said Spratt . " One of these men who 's interested in everything . " Elizabeth glanced at Kessler , almost ready to believe that her impression of self-consciousness on his part had been mistaken . Certainly their exchange of remarks before Brian 's entrance had not suggested it . When the maid came in to announce dinner neither Kessler nor Brian heard her . They were deep in conversation , Brian sitting on the floor with his case in his hands , this time listening instead of talking. " . . . one of the ugliest objects in the world , but strangely fascinating , " Kessler was saying to him . " It looks like a man with his hands spread out , but they are tremendous hands , many times larger than his body . The first time you look at one you feel a cold shiver run down your spine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Spratt demanded . Brian started and turned his head . " The skeleton of a bat . Mr. Kessler says if we can get hold of a bat he 'll help me mount the skeleton . " " If your mother does n't mind , " Kessler amended . " Of course I do n't mind , " said Elizabeth . " But Brian , Mr. Kessler is a very busy man , and you must n't use up too much of his time . " " Mother , Mr. Kessler says I can come over to his house and we can take the bat apart there , and Peter can come too . He 's got time for it , have n't you , Mr. Kessler ? " " I should n't have offered if I had n't . Will you let him come , Mrs. Herlong ? " " Certainly , and it 's very good of you . Brian , we 're going in to dinner . Wo n't you move so Mr. Kessler can get up from his chair ? " Brian scrambled to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table ? " Recalling Brian 's usual eagerness to avoid company dinners , Elizabeth was astonished . Kessler had won him , evidently , as he had won the others . She let him come in , pausing to remind him in an undertone that he must n't monopolize Mr. Kessler 's attention . Brian nodded solemnly . As Kessler stood up , Brian watched the procedure with undisguised interest , for hitherto he had only seen him sitting down and had not been warned of all his new friend 's handicaps . Elizabeth felt a moment 's embarrassment , until she reminded herself that Kessler must have had to bear many stares from children and would understand that Brian did not know he was being rude . She was not sure she had been right in permitting Brian to bring a chair to the dinner table . Though she had planned the menu with special reference to his disability , Kessler might nevertheless be awkwardabout eating with one hand . But here she was immediately relieved . He was so skilful that she concluded he must have lost his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Kessler was a fine fellow , she reflected , and she was glad Brian liked him . Brian turned over in bed . " Mother , I just thought of something . Peter 's a Jew . " " So what ? " asked Elizabeth . " Mr. Kessler 's a German , and you know how they are about Jews . He said I could bring Peter , but I did n't tell him  --  " " If Mr. Kessler had approved of that sort of thing he 'd have stayed in Germany , Brian . " " Maybe Mr. Kessler 's a Jew , " Brian suggested hopefully . " Is he ? " " I do n't know , but you need n't worry about it . Ile 's not stupid enough for that foolishness . " " I guess not , " Brian said , relieved . " I sure do like him . " " So do I. " She reflected that Kessler 's enjoyment of a happy domestic scene might mean he was lonely in a strange country . " Brian , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much , let 's prove it by doing something for him . Let 's ask his little girl to bring some of her friends over ro go swimming . " " Oh , rats , " said Brian . One thing he could not understand about his big brother was Dick 's liking for girls . " Brian , suppose we had to pack up all of a sudden and go live in Germany . Would n't you be glad if other children made friends with you instead of making you play all by yourself ? " " Well  --  do we have to ? " " Not at all , and Mr. Kessler does n't have to help you with the bat , either . Come on , Brian , be a sport . We 'll have a good party with lots to eat , sherbet and one of those big cakes from Delhaven 's , and all you 'll have to do is be polite . You can ask Peter over and she can bring her own friends . " Brian sighed . " It 'll be awful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it this way . If you go over to Mr. Kessler'sand he helps you put a bat 's skeleton together , you can play with his little girl one afternoon by way of saying thank you . If you do n't go over there , you need n't do it . "  |p118Brian  mournfully considered the alternative . It was a struggle , but at last , after she had tried again to tell him the value of give-and-take in the world , he yielded . As she closed the door Elizabeth drew a long sigh of her own . " I do n't wonder so many parents let their children grow up to be monsters of selfishness , " she thought . " It 's so much easier . But then they grow up to grab , grab , grab , until they turn out to be fascists grabbing for the whole world . " She went into her own room . Glancing at the radio , she wondered what fresh disasters she would hear about if she turned it on , and did not turn it on . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some letters . " Maybe my children are pretty self-centered anyway , " she was thinking . " Oh , for pity 's sake , why should I be discontented with them ? They 're not malicious , disobedient , untruthful  --  they 're simply hard , and it 's the age they live in . We 've tried to make them a decent lot , Spratt and I. But no parents can contradict the age they live in , because they 're a product of the age themselves . " Elizabeth turned to the desk and began writingan order for some tools needed for the Victory garden . She had finished this and several other notes when she heard Dick and Cherry come in . Going to her doorway , she watched them scamper up the stairs , enjoying the healthy windblown look of them . " Did you have a good time ? " she asked . " Oh yes , " said Cherry . " The sea was just beautiful and we all had a hot clog and Dick ate two egg sandwiches besides . " " Meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give us but one hot clog apiece . " " I do n't know why you do n't kill yourself , " Elizabeth exclaimed . Dick said he felt fine , which he evidently did . They said good night , and Elizabeth went downstairs . Spratt and Kessler should be finishing up their conference by now if they expected to go to work in the morning . They did appear in a short time , Spratt saying he did n't know why Kessler insisted on taking a taxip119when he 'd be glad to drive him home . Shaking his head with good-natured insistence , Kessler said , " I 'm sure Mrs. Herlong will agree with me . I ca n't drive , but it 's one of my principles not to let my friends drive for me if I can help it . It may be convenient tonight , but there will be times when it is n't . Am I right , Mrs. Herlong ? " How sensible he was , Elizabeth thought , to accept his handicapsso frankly . " Yes , " she answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , in principle you 're quite right . " " Thank you . And now , since I do n't know where the telephoneis , will you stop arguing and call a cab for me , Mr. Herlong ? " Spratt chuckled and complied . Kessler turned back to Elizabeth . " Mrs. Herlong , " he said earnestly , " I ca n't tell you how happy you have made me . " It seemed a great deal to say in return for a pleasant evening , but he sounded as though he meant it . " We were all glad to have you , Mr. Kessler , " she answered . " You have quite won the hearts of the children . " " They are delightful , all three of them . What a joy it is to see a home like yours . Your mode of living is so clear that it leaves no room for doubts . No one who spent an hour here could go away asking , Are they happy ? Are they free ? Do they love each other ? ' The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Are we really like that ? Would you say it just to be pleasant ? " " Indeed not . You should be very proud of such an achieve-ment . " " It has n't been all mine . " She glanced at Spratt , who was returningfrom the telephone . " I 've had a great deal of co-operation . " Kessler 's eyes followed hers , then came back to her . " Yes , that is easily seen . I congratulate you both . " He was no longer unsure of himself with her , or if he was , pI20 she was too much concerned with what he was saying to observeit . " You told me tonight , " she answered thoughtfully , " that we had a great deal of confidence . Sometimes I 'm afraid my children have too much . Too much confidence in themselves , I mean , and too little in the intangible virtues . " " Do n't let that distress you . " Kessler glanced at Spratt and Elizabeth together . " Is n't adolescence the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't you remember ? " " Yes , " said Spratt with a short laugh , " I should n't like to go through the teens again . But sometimes I feel like Elizabeth  --  I seem to remember that we had a few beliefs in those days . This younger generation has never seen anything but disillu-sion . " " Our generation , " said Kessler , " began with expectations and underwent despair when the world did n't live up to them . Maybe it 's better to begin with nothing , because then when you do come to believe in the higher potentialities of humanity , it 's because they 've been proved to you . " " You almost frighten me , Mr. Kessler ! " Elizabeth exclaimed . " Because that means , does n't it , that it 's up to the older generation to prove them ? " " Could we ask for a better job ? " he inquired smiling . Elizabeth and Spratt both smiled back at him gratefully . Elizabeth wondered at their talking like this to a stranger . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From being a newcomeramong them , he had subtly changed into a friend who made her comfortable with the security of mutual understanding . Whatever memory he had stirred within her , it must be some old experience of peace . Since overhearing the children yesterday she had felt unsure of herself and of them , but now , hearing him speak , it was as though she had slipped back into some forgotten period of long ago when everything was safe and right . He was saying to them , " Your children can afford to be cynical about themselves because they do n't know how superior they are to most ofp121their fellowmen . They believe in the obvious because they 've found it good . When you see people deliberately clinging to a belief in abstractions they do n't know anything about , you can be pretty sure they need to do it , because everything they do know about is unsatisfactory . " " How cheering you are ! " exclaimed Spratt . Elizabeth was looking up at Kessler . She asked , " Mr. Kessler , have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment he looked down . She looked down with him , and saw his hand tighten on his cane . She was to learn that he did this often , making an unconscious gesture toward his physical means of support when his spirit felt undefended . But he hesitated only for a moment . His self-discipline had been learned in a long hard school . He answered , " Before tonight ? If we had , Mrs. Herlong , I ca n't believe I could have forgotten it . No , I am sure we have not . " He had looked up , and was regarding her steadily . Elizabeth did not know that letting his eyes meet hers just then was one of the hardest achievements he had ever accomplished in his life . He did it so well that she nearly believed him . " Maybe I 'm wrong , then , " she said . " But tonight , as soon as you came in , it seemed to me that I had seen you somewhere and I could n't think where it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and taking up the cigarette-box from the table , " you two saw each other at one of those big cocktail parties where you see hundreds of people and do n't get to know any of them . " " Very likely , " Kessler agreed readily , turning toward Spratt as though welcoming his suggestion . " I 've been forced against my will to attend several of those . Or possibly , " he added , " you saw me at the studio . You come there now and then , do n't you , Mrs. Herlong ? " He glanced at her an instant as he spoke her name , and then became occupied with watching Spratt blow smoke-rings . " You might have caught sight of me walking from my bungalow to a projection room  --  chance glimpses like that sometimes tease our memories unmercifully . " " I suppose it must have been something of the sort , " said Elizabeth . But she was still not satisfied . She continued , " But do you know , Mr. Kessler , when you came in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave me a sort of startled look , as though you knew me too . You did n't ? " " If I stared at you rudely , I hope you will forgive me , Mrs. Herlong . " He spoke lightly , almost humorously , as though it were a trifling matter . " I hope you will remember that I had been looking forward to meeting you , more eagerly than you realize . Attractive women have not been a great part of my life recently , or happy homes either . In the life of an exile they assume an importance that you do not understand , and I hope will never have to understand . " Elizabeth thought , " He protests too much , " but Spratt was agreeing , " Yes , I should think they would . Is that your taxi pulling up , Kessler ? " " I believe it is , " said Kessler . " Good night , and thank you ' both again . " Spratt walked out to the taxi with him . Elizabeth took a cigarette from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains of the fire . When Spratt came in she turned around . " Spratt , I do n't care what that man says . I have seen him beforetonight . " Spratt shrugged . " Wherever it was , you went there without me . I 've been with Kessler every day for the past couple of weeks , and it never entered my head I 'd seen him before . Probablya cocktail party , Elizabeth , or rambling about the studio . " " It was n't . I tell you , I knoll ) him . " " All right , all right , you know him . He does n't know you . He said so . I 'm going to sleep on my feet . We talked and talked , and did n't get a thing done . " " You did n't ? I 'm sorry . "  | " His mind was n't on his work . He kept bringing himself back from a great distance and repeating something he 'd said fifteen minutes ago . I never saw him like that , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose  --  working all evening after working all day never is a good idea . " Elizabeth laughed a little . " Maybe I 'm a moron . But I still have a notion that his mind was n't on his work because he was thinking about me . " Spratt was puzzled . " I do n't get it . If he thought he rememberedyou , would n't he have said so when you asked him ? " " Oh , I suppose he would . " She threw her cigarette into the fireplace . " Maybe he just reminds me of somebody else , and I 'll wake up in the middle of the night remembering who it is . " " Probably some fellow who kept a German delicatessen in Tulsa , " Spratt suggested . He yawned , and Elizabeth added , " Go on up to bed , darling . Would you like to have me bring you a highball ? " " I would indeed . Thanks . " Spratt was already in bed when she came up with the drink . He was tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Now that she had talked about it to him , her impression had begun to seem rather silly . Long after Spratt and Elizabeth were both asleep , Kessler sat up in his apartment , thinking about her . He had seen Elizabeth , he had been into her home among those she loved best , and now that it was over he wondered why he had gone . Had it made him any happier to do this ? He could hardly answer . He had seen what he wanted to see , Elizabeth the central figure of a happy home , and all he had said to her about it was true . But was he glad he had seen her there ? Certainly , at the beginning he had not been glad he had come . Though you prepared yourself for an event ahead , when it happened you found that you were not as ready as you thought . When he met Elizabeth at the door all his carefully rehearsed formality nearly went down before her . He had managed to get through those first minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close he had come to doing so . He had planned so many remarks to make to her , casual-sounding statements that would lead her to telling him all about herself , and he had not been able to make any of them . Thank heaven her children were not shy , and had chattered until he could recover a semblance of self-possession . And then , in spite of all his efforts , he had nearly given himselfaway at the end . " Have n't you and I met before ? " The question had come just when he had begun to feel at ease with ' her , and was talking to her like the friend he had dreamed of being when he went there . Its very frankness had taken him aback , leaving him no defense but a bare denial . He wondered if he had satisfied her . He could not be sure , but at least he had satisfied himself that though she might find him oddly familiar she had not suspected who he was . Now the part of wisdom would be to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was content with it . She had , perhaps , more than he could have given her if he had returned uninjured from the war . He would never have made Spratt " Ilerlong 's income , for he had not that flair for material success . As for the rest  --  hard as it was to admit , the rest was none of his business . Elizabeth and Spratt were husband and wife . Their marriage had endured for twenty years and he was not going to endanger it now . He had come here from Germany to save Margaret , not to bring trouble to Elizabeth. lie could say all this to himself , but all the time he knew he was not going to ignore Elizabeth because he had not the power to make himself do so . She was there ; he could see her whenever he pleased , and her children , who drew him nearly as strongly because they were hers . Spratt was the only one of them he would have been glad to ignore if he could , and he had to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he wanted to see Elizabeth again . Though he had left her such a little while ago , he already wanted it.  |p125Then  what could he do ? He could keep away from her for awhile , until their next meeting would seem a casual one . He could keep himself better in hand than he had tonight , and if she still thought him familiar he could persuade her his memory was blank of the subject . And if she ever needed him  --  if there was ever any support or advice or consolation that he could give her  --  it hardly seemed possible that there could be , but if she needed him , he would be there . After all , was it too much to ask ? He wondered if she would ever know what it was to be so vastly lonely as he was now . Her life was so strong and copious  --  if he asked now and then for a crumb from the table , an hour of her time , an occasional assurance that he was her friend and she trusted him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he did know that right or wrong , he was going to ask it.  | FOR several weeks Mr. Kessler did nothing about getting a bat for Brian , a reticence that both Spratt and Elizabeth admired . They had had experience of persons who wanted to ' move in on their lives and had started by trying to load the children with attentions . As they all liked Kessler she invited him to dinner again , and Spratt brought him in two or three times to have a drink on their way from the studio , so when Kessler had had time to be quite sure the Herlongs were acceptinghim as one of their friends he brought up the subject of the bat again , to Brian 's great delight . Two days later he telephoned that he had obtained the bat , and made a date for Brian to come to see him . It was very kind of him , Elizabeth thought , and she was glad to see her children 's increasing friendship with him . Kessler never patronized them , and he had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentioned the war unless somebody else brought it up , and when he did refer to national affairshe refrained admirably from making adverse criticisms of the President and from telling them what he thought Americans ought to do about anything . In fact , he listened to them a good deal more than he talked , though none of the children realized it . " He 's swell , " they said of him . Kessler said to Elizabeth , with a touch of wistfulness , " There is a great deal of you in all your children . " Occasionally she wondered why he seemed more interested in finding her characteristicsthan Spratt 's . He and Spratt were good friends and Spratt frequently said his work on the picture was proving invaluable . But when he came to their home it was primarily top127see her , a fact that Spratt observed with a sort of proud amusement . He liked other men to admire his wife . Brian and Peter Stern visited Kessler so often that Elizabeth was sometimes afraid they were going to be nuisances , though Kessler insisted they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she was not bad , so Elizabeth suggestedthe party . The next time Brian went to see Kessler she went by to get acquainted with Margaret . Kessler 's modest street-floor apartment was kept for him by a motherly woman who came in leading Margaret by the hand and telling her to speak nicely to the lady , which Margaret did . She was an intelligent-looking child , with big blue eyes and two fat pigtails , shyly polite ; as Elizabeth rarely had any trouble getting along with children , their acquaintance began without difficulty . Margaret had learned the English language very well . Oh yes , she said , she went to school and she was learning to swim , and when asked if she would like to have a party with her school friends she nodded eagerly . When they had got that far in their conversation Kessler came in , having left Brian and Peter blissfully occupied with the bones of the bat . " I 'm going to have a party ! " Margaret announced to him . Kessler looked down at her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've seen him somewhere , I know I have , " she thought . " Maybe he does n't remember , but I 'm sure of it . " However , she did not mention the subject , for Margaret was talking , and by the time they had arranged the date of the party and other details she felt it was time to go . On the way home she made up her mind that though he might think her foolish for persisting , the next time she happened to be alone with Mr. Kessler she was going to ask him to rack his brain and figure out where it was she had met him . There was no good reason why it should seem so important to her to remember , since it must have been a very casual meeting to have escaped her so thoroughly , but these occasional twinges of recollection teased her . Just for the instant when he had looked down at Margaret with a tender little smile , not only the expression of his face but his whole attitude had been so familiar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had known for years . Then it was gone , and now she could not remember at all . Since Margaret 's party was going to strain their already overtaxedproblem of household help , Spratt suggested that he bring Kessler over that evening , leaving him there while he drove Margaret and some of the other guests home , and then that he , Kessler , Elizabeth and the two older children go out for dinner . Elizabeth agreed gladly . She had managed to keep servantsso far , but she wanted to give them no grounds for complaint . The party went very well , for Margaret was not shy among friends of her own age . They played in the pool , gobbledsherbet and cake without noticing that war exigencies had made it impossible to get ice cream , and were happily tired when they were finally coaxed back into their clothes and their parents began to arrive to take them home . Margaret came over to Elizabeth . " Thank you for the party , Mrs. Herlong . We had a very good time . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you enjoyed it . We want you to come over often  --  tell your father I said so . " Margaret was evidently glad to hear this . " Thank you , I 'll tell him . Mrs. Herlong , may I pick one of those purple flowers on the fence ? " " Why of course . But the stems are strong  --  wait a minute and I 'll get a pair of scissors . " When she brought the scissors Margaret was waiting . " We can cut a lot of them if you like , " Elizabeth offered . " There must be thousands of blossoms here on the fence . " " The yellow ones are the same sort of flower as the purple ones , are n't they ? " " Yes , and the deep orange ones too . "  | " The dark ones have yellow centers . That 's pretty . What do you call them ? " " Lantana . " " Lantana , " Margaret repeated . " I 've seen a lot of them here , but I never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't they ? " She gathered the bouquet into her hands . " You must like flowers , " she suggested , looking around , " you have so many of them . " " I do like them . We used to have some beautiful beds there on the other side of the pool , before we put in the Victory garden . You enjoy flowers too , do n't you ? " " Oh yes . " Margaret nodded vigorously . " Do you like to put them under a microscope and sec how they 're made ? " " I do n't think I 've ever done that . Where do you have a microscope ? At school ? " " No , at home . My father shows them to Inc . I is knows all about flowers . We put lots of things under the microscope at home and we look at them . It 's fun . " " Your father certainly knows a lot . But he was some sort of doctor in Germany , was n't he ? " " Not exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my real father was a doctor . " " Your real father ? Is n't Mr. Kessler your father ? " " Oh no , " said Margaret , her blue eyes serious across the lantana . " My real father died . And my mother too , and I was very sick . That was a long time ago when I was little . But I remember being very sick , and before I was well we left the hospital , late one night , and we rode a long way in an automobilein the dark , and I started to cry . I do n't cry now , I 'm too big , but I was little then and I cried , and he  --  you know , my father , Mr. Kessler  --  he said he would give me something to put me to sleep so I would n't be so tired , and he did , and I went to sleep , and when I woke up he told me I was his little girl now . That 's how he got to be my father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not wanting to push Margaret into details of what might be a Nazi atrocity better forgotten , and which was none of her business anyway , Elizabeth went on , " I 'm sorry your real parents died . But is n't it fortunate you could get another father right away ? And such a fine father , too . You must love him very much , do n't you ? " " Yes , sometimes I do n't remember at all that he is n't my real father . I like him better than some girls like their fathers . He plays with me . " " You must have a lot of fun together . " Margaret nodded . She had begun to tell more details of their games when they caught sight of Kessler and Spratt walking down the driveway toward the back lawn . As she and Margaret went to meet them Elizabeth watched Kessler 's slow limp and the wise , kindly expression of his features , and thought what a battle such a man must have had to show no evidence of resentmenttoward life for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him better than some girls liked their fathers . She was a fortunate child to have such a guardian . Margaret had run ahead of her . As Elizabeth met them she was talking to Kessler . " We had the best time ! I can swim all the way across the pool , the short way , not the long way . And look , these are named lantana and they grow on the fence . " " I should have warned you , " Kessler said to Elizabeth , " that Margaret would demand a sample of anything she saw that was unfamiliar to her . Either she was born inquisitive or I 've infected her with my own curiosity . " " I like children who ask questions , " Spratt commented . " How are they going to learn anything if they do n't ? " " Margaret 's been telling me , " said Elizabeth , " how you encourageher with a microscope . " He laughed , and then said soberly , " I 'm glad she enjoys that . In these days  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what children are going to live through , but we can be prettyp131sure it wo n't all be pleasant . But nobody is utterly desolate if he 's learned to appreciate the world around him . " " That 's a good reason for knowing something about science , " Spratt approved . " Not that I know much about it myself . " He began to chuckle at a sudden recollection . " That reminds me  --  a couple of years ago when Elizabeth and I were in Chicago we went to the Field Museum of Natural History and looked at the dinosaur skeletons . I 'd never thought much about dinosaurs , but we were reading in the guidebook how these creatures had ruled the earth for a million years , which is a lot longer than human beings have ruled it , and all of a sudden I burst out laughing , because it occurred to me right there , Who the hell does Hitler think he is ? ' " " We laughed all the way back to the . hotel , " said Elizabeth . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I Title ' . was fundamentally funny . " The garden had grown chilly . Spratt gathered up Margaret and several others whom he had offered to take home , and Kesslersaid he would occupy himself with a book while Elizabeth changed for dinner . She went through the den , where Dick sat by a table agonizing over his lessons . I ) ick was evidently in the throes of struggle . His papers strewn on the floor and table , he sat holding his head between his fists , his hair wildly rumpled and his forehead wrinkled with anguish . Elizabeth paused at the door . " What 's the trouble , Dick ? " He groaned without looking up . " Mother , did you ever get through physics ? " " Not very gloriously , and I 'm afraid I 've forgotten most of it . " " I liked physics in high school . " With an effort Dick untangledhis hands from his hair . " I still like it , but every now and then you get a problem that simply will not make sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a fog . " I wish I could help you ! " Elizabeth exclaimed  | 2 " Oh , I 'll get it . It 's always the same . You ca n't do the problem  --  youtry everything and you ca n't make it , you go nuts , and then you see some tiny little detail you 've already seen a thousand times but you never noticed it , and there it is , clickclicklike a safe opening , and the answer is so simple you want to kick yourself around the block for not having seen it in the first place . " He laughed at himself . " Then when you go to school the next day you say , That third problem was a humdinger , was n't it ? ' and the dumbest guy in the class says , Why , that 's the only one of the whole bunch I could work . ' " Elizabeth laughed too . " I remember it used to be like that with Latin translations . Why do n't you stop till after dinner ? We 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a violent shake as though to stir up his brain . " Think I will . Evening paper come ? I 'll read the funnies . " " It should be here . I 'll see . " She went out to the front lawn , Dick following her . In front of the house Spratt and Kessler were shepherding the little girls into the car . Dick picked up the Hollywood Citizen-News from the grass and moodily began to open it . Black war-headlines went across the front page . Elizabeth glanced around , thinking how little Beverly Hills had the look of being in a country at war . The dancing flowers , the damp odor of grass , the noise of carpenters repairing the house across the street , all seemed so ordinary . Margaret , about to get into the car , paused and looked up at Kessler . " Why do you see those men hit with the hammers before you hear them ? " 1 lc smiled at her . " We always see things before we hear them , because the noise comes to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light-waves get to us faster . " Margaret frowned , puzzled . " I 'll explain it better when I get home after dinner , if you 're still awake  --  " Kessler had begun to say , when Dick shouted , " Holy Jerusalem ! "  |p133He  had shoved the paper untidily under his arm and was laughing at their astonished stares . " It 's that physics problem . It 's about sound-waves and I was figuring with the speed of light . Oh , such a dope , such a dope  --  thank you , Margaret ! " He was off into the house . Elizabeth explained what Dick was talking about . As the children drove off with Spratt she was wishing her own problemshad so ready a solution . That was why physics and mathematicswere such satisfying studies , the answer was there to be found , no matter how hard you had to look for it you knew it was there all the time , and when you found it there was no doubt of its being right . She waved goodby to the children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are you tired ? " he added . " Would n't you like to rest for a minute before going up to dress ? " " I 'm not really tired , just a bit breathless . But it might be pleasant to sit down for a minute or two . What shall we do ? " " It 's about time for a news broadcast . " " I 'm losing courage to listen to the radio , " Elizabeth confessed . " All it brings is news of more calamities . " For an instant Kessler did not reply . She had said nothing to him about her dread of Dick 's going away , but she saw him give a glance toward the house and suspected that he had guessed it . Leaning heavily on his cane , he turned back to her , saying , " Mrs. Herlong , will you forgive me if I tell you something ? " " Certainly . " Then , as she saw the gentle gravity of his eyes , she added , " If it 's a rebuke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , " answered Kessler , " you do . " He smiled , and went on . " Mrs. Herlong , talking about one 's personal troubles is unforgivableunless one has learned something from them that is worth passing on . You and your family are so kind about ignoringmy handicaps that I feel almost unkind to refer to them . But I have learned something from them . "  | " Yes , go on , " she said earnestly . " I know you 've had to face life in a way that I have n't . Tell me . " " It 's simply this , " said Kessler . " There is a rigorous joy in facing a battle even when you have very little chance of winningit . The worst experience on earth is n't tragedy that comes from outside . That may be dreadful , and it frequently is , but it 's almost pleasant compared with the experience of being ashamed of yourself . " Elizabeth lowered her eyes . They showed her his thick right hand grasping the cane , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than anyone else I know , " she said in a low voice , " because  --  well , you 've never said anything to me about your past life , and I 'm not asking you , but I know you are n't referring only to physical distress . Such a disaster as yours does n't just change your bodily powers , but everything else . You had to face spiritual tragedy as well , did n't you ? " " Yes , I did . " " And you did face it , " she went on . " Instead of becoming resentful and bitter , you became so wise and kind and understandingthat everyone who sees you feels the presence of a great man . You have suffered terribly , but you have no reason to be ashamed of yourself . " " Neither have you , Mrs. Herlong . " " I low do you know ? " " You have n't told me anything about your past life either , " he returned smiling . " But as soon as I came into your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mature and courageous woman . It 's impossible for anyone to live as long as you have  --  " " Forty-four years , " she said with a little laugh . " I 'm not sensitive about the passage of time . " " Very well , it 's impossible for anyone to live forty-four years without experiencing a good many unpleasant events , things you either have to face or run away from . When you meet a woman whose husband adores her , whose children are intelligentand uninhibited , whose domestic affairs run like invisiblep135clockwork , and who goes about with a serenity suggesting that all these things just happened that way  --  you can be sure that she achieved it by meeting each crisis as it came . Some people 's lives are like wastebaskets , so cluttered up that nobody can find anything there but trash that should have been disposed of long ago . " " I have tried to keep things clear , " she answered simply . " I ca n't say I 've always been successful . But looking back , I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your home that first evening , I told you that being there had made me very happy . Perhaps you thought I was too intense in what I said . But I had seen so much clutter , so much wretchedness that could have been avoided , that it did make me happy to see so much unobtrusive richness of living . I had hoped I should find you like that . " " You had hoped ? Why did you care what you 'd find ? " He bit his lip as though he had said too much . But he answered , " Was it too much to hope for ? I had left a continent full of torture and despair , for one thing ; for another , I liked and admired your husband , and he had shown me your photographs . You have a good life , Mrs. Herlong , because you have made it a good life . Do n't lose it now by being afraid . " " How can I help being afraid ? " she exclaimed . " Yes , I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand times . And I have worked for it . As you said , there are plenty of occasions in anybody 's experience when he 's tempted to sit down and quit trying . But when you do achieve a good life , when you feel that now at last you have what you want and can enjoy having it , and then when you see it about to be blown to pieces by circumstancesyou are n't responsible for and ca n't control  --  how can you help being afraid ? I 'm sick with fear . I look over it all  --  Spratt bothering about his pictures , Brian with his bats and bugs , Cherry excited about a party dress , Dick struggling with his lessons , and I think , How much longer ? ' I love them so , I 've been so proud to know I was important to them  --  but136 TOMORROW IS FOREVER I TOMORROW IS FOREVER 137p136now ! " She stopped . " Why on earth am I talking to you like this ? It 's the first time I 've been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk to anybody who 'd be more interested , " Kessler answered . " It 's good now and then to confess our fears . Of course you 're frightened . You see the war coming closer , you do n't know what it may bring  --  " " I do know , " she interrupted sharply . " I do n't live in a tower looking down on two conflicting ideologies ! Oh , it may be a noble struggle , fought for a better world , but I do n't see it that way and I ca n't . I do n't see it in terms of anything but my son . " " I wish to God there were something I could say to you , " he told her in a low voice . Elizabeth had clasped her hands and was moving them against each other restlessly . " I do n't know why I feel so much like talking to you . Maybe it 's just that if I do n't talk it out pretty soon I do n't know what will become of me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " he answered , with such simple sincerity that she could have no doubt of his sympathy . He hesitated an instant , then asked , " Can we sit down , Mrs. Herlong ? " " How stupid of me ! " she exclaimed . She hurried to lead the way to two deck chairs placed on the lawn , at the side of the house . Cherry had left a sweater on one of them , and Elizabeth put it on , for the evening chill was blowing in from the sea . " Ve are n't just courteous about not noticing your limitations , Mr. Kessler , " she remarked as they sat down , " we 're usually not even aware of them . " When he answered it was in a matter-of-fact voice . " This is one of the things I found hardest to get used to , " he said . " I mean , asking for a chair . I had always been so healthy that I was the one who had to be reminded not to expect too much of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not . " " Are you cold ? " asked Elizabeth . " No . What was it you wanted to tell me ? "  | " I 'm glad it 's getting dark , " said Elizabeth . " Talking in the dark is easier for some reason . It 's about the war , about feeling it coming close , about this unbearable sense of helplessness . I 've always thought of myself as a rather strong person , one who could take things as they came and go on somehow . But this time I feel beaten before I start . My husband is afraid of what we 're up against too , but he 's taking it much better than I am . You see , there 's a difference : when you do n't know what you 're facing , and when you do . " She heard Kessler move his cane against the grass , but he did not answer . She went on . " I ca n't tell him . In fact , I do n't want to tell him  --  why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had a tragedy of war before . And if it should happen again like that  --  when I say I 'd rather die than get another of those telegrams from the War Department , I 'm not speaking light Iv . " Kessler 's cane was poking at a tuft of grass . Nobody had turned on the lights in the rooms on this side of the house and it had grown dark outside . She could not see him , nor did she try to ; she could barely make out the end of the stick , restlessly attacking the grass , but she did not turn her eyes toward him as she continued . " Spratt is my second husband  --  you did n't know that , did you ? It 's not important in any personal sense between us , it never has been important and it would n't be now except that my first husband was killed in the last war . I loved him very much . Of course , now , looking back on it , it 's easy to say it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl with all my life before me , and as it happened I met Spratt and everythingturned out as you 've seen it . But at the time there was no way for me to look forward . When I remember it  --  " She stopped . After a moment Kessler asked , " Did you suffer so horribly ? " " I ca n't tell you what it was . It was n't anything anybodycould understand except somebody who had been through it.  | I had loved him so , and then all of a sudden he was dead . It was  --  anyway , I never went through anything like it before , and I never have again . Of course , it 's all over  --  I do n't even think of it very often , but now  --  " She stopped again . There was a silence that seemed to last a long time . At last Kessler said , in a voice so low she barely heard him , " Yes ? But now ? " " Do n't you understand ? I ca n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never would be anything else like that . It was over and done with . My world had been shot to pieces , and I picked up the pieces and made myself go on living , and I was rewarded more than I ever dreamed of expecting . But I ca n't do that another time . Even if I had the strength , it 's too late . I was twenty when I lost Arthur . God knows it was n't easy to go on then . But now I 'm forty-four . If my world is shot to pieces again , it stays that way . I ca n't go back and start over . And why should I be expected to ? Life ca n't be all beginnings and no fulfillment ! " As she broke off Kessler asked , " What is that exquisite scent that 's suddenly here all around us ? " " Night-blooming jasmine . Sometimes it blooms till late in the year . Are you listening to me ? " " If I had n't been listening I should n't have asked about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world so full of possibilities for pleasure , why should anyone have to say what you are saying to nme ? " " Yes , why should we ? " exclaimed Elizabeth . " Why should it be like this ? I do n't know and I 'm tired of asking . It 's too much to demand of us . It 's as though destiny were saying , The world is all broken up , start over and build a new one . Hurry and get it done so it will be all ready to be demolished again . We 'll give you just enough rest between strokes to make sure you 're quite conscious and sensitive to feel the next one . We wo n't start the next war until your firstborn son is just oldp139enough to be carried off . You thought you 'd felt the last limit of pain , but you may find that you have n't . If this happens , it will be worse . " " It would be worse ? " Kessler asked her . His voice seemed to have a thickness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes . Because before , there was only myself . If I had cracked , if I 'd ended my own life or had lived on like a useless shadow , it really would n't have mattered to anybody . But now it 's different . There are people who count on me . There 's Sprattoh , I know Spratt goes striding around the studio lot like the most self-sufficient creature alive . " " I have sometimes wondered , " said Kessler , " if you knew how much he depends on you . " " Yes , I know . There 's a lot between us that I sha n't discuss . Say I 'm his best friend and let it go at that . And there are the younger children . They need me so ranch more than they realize  --  if I were n't equal to it they 'd know then what they had lost . Do n't think I 'm trying to say I 'd be the only one who 'll be hurt by this war . Spratt loves Dick as much as I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the war will take away from them . But what I do mean is that in the midst of anything that may happen , I 'm the one who 'd be expected to stand like a pillar . When you said I was the center of this household you were right . I 've made it that way . I 've wanted them to need me . I 've done my best to make them feel that no matter what happened , trivial irritations or the most vital disillusionments , I would always be there to listen and understand . And now I 'm about to fail them . They do n't know it yet  --  or maybe Spratt has guessed it in spite of me  --  but already , before we 've been hurt at all , I 'm cracking inside because I 'm afraid . " Again there was a silence . It lasted a long time . After awhile Elizabeth turned her head toward him . Kessler was sitting very still . By the starlight she could just make out the lines of his figure , lying back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grass with his stick . It was resting at his side , his hand on it . " You 're not answering me , are you ? " she said . " There is n't any answer . But thank you for listening . " After a moment she went on , " I ca n't tell you what a relief it has been to say all this . I believe saying it to you has got it out of me so I wo n't pour it all out to Spratt . That 's why I 'm grateful . " She reached her hand out and laid it over his , as it rested on the head of his cane . To her astonishment , she found that instead of lying there lightly as she had thought , his hand was gripping the cane with such violence that the muscles were hard and the knuckles were like rocks . Elizabeth drew away quickly and sat up . " Mr. Kessler ! What have I done to you ? " " Nothing , " he answered sharply , and sat up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble ? " " Why could n't I keep quiet ? " she demanded of herself contritely . " Here I 've been babbling like a child who thinks nobodyhas anything to do but listen  --  " " But I wanted to listen ! " Kessler exclaimed . " You 're not sorry you talked to me ! " " Not for myself , oh no . But I was so absorbed in myself I did n't realize how I might be affecting you . Have I brought back something that 's better forgotten ? Forgive me , please forgive nee , if I 've tried you too far . " Kessler stood up abruptly . He turned and moved a step so as to face her . She looked up at him standing between her and the stars , a black figure that gave an impression of strength in spite of the crippled body . " I feel more like asking you to forgive me , Mrs. Herlong , " he said , and again he was speaking with the steadiness of tremendouscontrol . " You were right in suggesting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easily remembered , and what you said did reopen it . There is no reason why I should not tell you it concerns the last war . "  | " It was the war that crippled you ? " she asked . She began to laugh in ironic anger . " Funny , in those days we never thought of its striking the Germans too . We always thought of the Germansas the fiends who were doing it to us . " He did not answer that . He continued as he had begun . " My own disaster , like yours , would be easier to bear if we could look now upon a fresh new world and feel that what we went through had helped bring it to pass . But there 's no fresh new world , there 's only more of the same , and worse . " " I told you not to try to answer me . Please do n't try . There 's no answer , for me or for you . " " Yes there is , " he exclaimed decisively . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost believing that there was n't . You said it was too late for you to start over . You are not required to start over . But you are required to keep going . Remember , your responsibilities are of your own creation . You are n't responsiblefor what 's happening in the world , but you are responsiblefor how you take it . " " I told you I could n't take it . I can feel myself breaking at the prospect . I ca n't take it . " " Yes you can , " he said sternly , " and you 're going to . " His force was like a stimulus . Elizabeth exclaimed , " Do you believe I can , Mr. Kessler ? You seem to know me pretty well by now  --  do you believe I can ? " " You can , " he returned earnestly , " because you 've promised it , by every action of your life . Nobody required you to get married , or to have children , or to live so that you would be essential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you might have been one of these whining creatures who takes to her bed at every annoyance and becomes the center of her little universeby demanding attentions she 's too useless to get any other way . But you did n't do that . You outlived your own early grief . To do it you had to strip your character down to its core of strength , so that this is what they have seen of you , this is what you have taught them to expect . They believe in you . They need you , and they 're going to need you more . In God 's name , do n't fail them . " Elizabeth drew a long breath . Her chest felt tight . After awhile Kessler resumed his chair . He turned to her , saying , " Right now , you are beginning to fail . " She started . " Is it as obvious as that ? Already ? " " Why do n't you stop looking at this entirely from your own viewpoint ? " he asked . " You wonder if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Dick is taking it very well ? " " Dick ? He does n't seem to think very much about it . " " He does n't seem so to you , maybe . But he is thinking about it . " " How do you know ? " She was startled . " Has he said anything to you ? " " No . But I know he is , because I 've been there . " Elizabeth exclaimed , " Yes you have . Tell me what it 's like ! " " It 's a torment of bewilderment , " he returned . " You do n't say much about it because everybody seems to understand it better than you do . You do n't know the reason other people are n't explaining it to you is that they do n't understand it either . You go around wondering how you 're going to act like a brave hero because God knows you do n't feel like one . You do a little blustering to cover up how scared you are . You 're angry , mad as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel like a killer but you do n't  --  you keep telling yourself you 're not a coward , you 'll go out and do what you have to do , but all the time you keep wishing to God somebody would tell you why you 've got to do it . That 's what it 's like , Mrs. Herlong . " Elizabeth was sitting forward , her hands tight on the arms of her chair . " My God , that 's what 's going on in his mind ! But why has n't he told us ? Mr. Kessler , why does n't he ever say so ? " " I suspect it 's because he knows what 's going on in your mind , a lot better than you think . " " You mean , " she said bitterly , " he knows his father and Ip143are n't fit to be told . Because we have failed him , terribly . " " Have you ? Do you know you ha ' e ? " Ile asked it quietly . " Yes , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has no idea what the war is about it 's our fault . We were two of the people who thought we could avoid another war just by not wanting it . We always thought we were tolerant , broad-minded persons ; we did n't hate anybody , we just wanted to be Ict alone . We were the people who read about Hitler and hoped we would n't have to do anything about him . Then Pearl Harbor , and we were angry . Dick was angry too . I was astonished at how angry he was . But all I could think of that day was ' This means Dick . ' I suppose I was so engrossed with it I did n't stop to realize 1 ) ick was there at the radio thinking This means inc. ' 1 le was mad . I thought he was mad with the Japs . I did n't know then  --  you 're just beginning to make me know  --  that he was mad with us too , for letting this happen without making any of it clear to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't understand it and I ca n't tell him . I 'm beginning to sec the issues at stake , but I 'm still inarticulate about them . Maybe I 'm so frightened I 'm paralyzed . " She broke off , and added more quietly , " There now , I 've said it . " Kessler said in a low voice , " I understand . " " You do , do n't you ? " she pled . " Would you believe me if I told you I loved your son , Mrs. Herlong ? I do love him . He 's so much like the son I used to think I might have . " " You never had any children , did you ? Margaret told me this afternoon you adopted her after her parents died . " " No , I never had any children , " he returned steadily . " That was another of the things the war made impossible . " " Oh , " she said faintly . After a moment she exclaimed , " Yet you have conquered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nobly , in a world that left you absolutely nothing to live for . How did you do it ? It seems strange that I who have everything should turn to you who have nothing , and sayp144Please help me . ' But I do . Because right now it seems that it is you who have everything and I who have nothing . Will you help me ? " He asked , " Do you want me to try to tell Dick what he 's beingasked to fight for ? " " Yes ! Can you ? Will you ? " " I 'll try . I 'll do my best . " " Thank you ! You can do it better than I can . You 've seen it . And you are so wise , so gentle , so  --  how can I say it ? I mean you 're the only man I know I 'd trust to do it well . " There was a brief silence , then he said , " And you ? " " I 'll take it , Mr. Kessler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , you 'll take it . You are n't a coward . A great many of us think we are until the time comes to be one , when we find we are n't . And incidentally , " he continued , " do n't let me meddle with your affairs , but whenever you feel like telling somebody how difficult it is , wo n't you talk to me ? " " Is n't it very hard for you to listen ? It was tonight . " " Suppose it is ? That makes no difference . You and I understandsomething these others do not . We know what it means to be alone in the universe . Knowing that , it may be that we can give each other courage now . " " Each other ? I wish there were some way I could be of use to you . " " You have been , Mrs. Herlong . " " Why , how ? " " Do n't ask me to explain . There are no words . " " I do n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know  --  I 'm a lot farther from a crackup than I was when I began talking to you this evening . Thank you for being my friend , Mr. Kessler . I needed you . " He did not answer her , and there was another long silence . At length Elizabeth said suddenly , " Mr. Kessler , we have met each other before . When was it ? "  | " You 've never met me before this fall , Mrs. Herlong . " " Then why do I keep thinking I have ? I 'm not given to visions and superstitions ! I do n't believe you were a king in Babylon and I was a Christian slave . " " There were n't any Christians when there were kings in Babylon , " he retorted . " Do n't laugh at me . If we 've never met before this fall , why do I keep this curious illusion that we have ? Why did I feel that sense of recognition the first time you came into my house ? When you were telling us about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though you were repeating something I 'd heard you say already . Just now , while you were talking to me , it was as though you were an old friend I knew I could count on because I knew you so well . Nothing like this has ever happened to me . " Kessler answered her as though brushing the matter aside . " Sometimes two persons do understand each other very well from the start because they have congenial minds . When that happens a friendship grows fast , as ours has . That 's all , Mrs. Herlong . " " All right , " she yielded unwillingly . " I 've got to accept that because I ca n't explain it any other way . At any rate , I 'm glad to have found such a friend . " " Can you go to dinner with the others now , " he asked gently , " and let them think we 've been talking about the flowers ? " " Good heavens , " she exclaimed , springing to her feet , " I forgotabout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I have n't started to get dressed . Come on indoors , Mr. Kessler , it 's really grown very cold here . I 'll be down in a few minutes . " She heard him laugh softly as he got up . " You do feel normal , do n't you ? " " Yes , I do . Is n't it lucky life keeps calling us back with little things ? " They went indoors , and Elizabeth ran up to her room . She felt better than she had felt for many weeks . Kessler had given her the only possible answer , she told herself as she got a dress out of her closet . When you had to do the impossible , you went ahead and did it , that was all . Spratt and her children were going to need all the fortitude she had . Spratt had never failed her , and no matter what happened , she was not going to fail him now.  | KESSLER was her friend , and he remained so . But ( luring the next few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose her curious sense of this friendship 's being an old intimacy renewed . She tried to tell herself not to be foolish . You saw somebody by chance , you remembered without knowing you remembered , and when you saw him again you knew this was n't the first time and it worried you until you could recall that earlier meeting . It was a common experience in Hollywood to look up in a restaurant and catch sight of a familiar face at another table , and give a nod and smile before you recognized the face as that of some actor whom you had seen a dozen times playing those obscure roles in pictures which everybody saw and nobodyremembered . That happened so often that many professionalbit-players habitually smiled and nodded at anybody they saw looking at them with that puzzled **33;8836;TOOLONG , just so as not to appear discourteous . If that happened with actors , why not with other people ? She might easily have seen Kessler in a theater lobby , in the Brown Derby , on the streets of the studio lot , not once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . Elizabeth was annoyed with herself for being unable to accept this as the answer . She liked Kessler so much , and yet he had for her an almost irritating attraction . His wise sympathy never ceased to delight her . Yet with it there was always the bothersome sense that she had done all this before . Though she tried to ignore it , and laughed at herself for it , the feeling would not down . It kept returning , like the teasing involuntary search for a name , a line , or a tune long ago forgotten and too unimportant to be worth remembering , but which lay so close to the surface of her consciousness that no matter how much she tried to ignore it , it kept trying to push through , troubling her in the most unexpectedplaces by knocking on the door of her memory and demanding that it be let in . She would have been glad to let it in and so be rid of it , but this required opening a door to which she had long since lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help her remember . She had tried that several times , and he only laughed and shook his head . " Wherever you saw him , I was n't there . And if you 'll forgive me , my dear , I suspect Kessler was n't there either . He certainly does n't remember you . " All of a sudden one day it occurred to her , " Is it possible that I ca n't remember because I do n't want to remember ? " The idea was startling , but the longer it stayed with her the less startling it became . Shc had read about the thoroughness with which the mind rids itself of matters it does not want to remember . And then , without any more effort on her part , the question ceased to annoy her . She did not deliberately put it aside ; as long as she had tried to do that she had been unable to achieve it . But for some reason , as soon as it occurred to her that she had forgotten something she did not want to remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , how it had pestered her in the beginning . As if it mattered . He was a splendidfriend to have . Both she and Spratt , as well as the children , were drawing into closer intimacy with him , and now she could be glad they had all found so excellent a companion without worrying about whether or not she and Kessler had previously exchanged a glance at the Brown Derby . Kessler enjoyed coming to their house . Spratt often brought him in after work , when he would advise Brian about mounting his specimens or discuss school and the day 's events with Dick and Cherry . Kessler hadp149not yet said anything to Dick about Dick 's approaching part in the war . He was too wise to walk up to him with a peremptory " I want to talk to you , " without first making sure Dick was ready to listen . But the subject of the war appeared one day unexpectedly . Margaret was going to have a Christmas party for some of her schoolmates , and Elizabeth suggested that she and the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorate the Christmas tree . As it was hard to buy ornaments in the stores they brought their own , part of an abundance left over from earlier holidays . Margaret was there , jumping with excitement while Kessler looked on . 1 lc liked Christmas , and enjoyed her pleasure in it . While he was showing Elizabeththe silver fountain pen Spratt had given him as a Christmas present , Dick was dragging in a ladder , and calling to Elizabethto move out of his way . " We 'll start at the top , " he said , setting up the ladder by the tree and beginning to climb . " You hand me the junk , Cherry . " With Elizabeth 's assistance , Cherry handed up the junk . Margaret helped , her arms full of tinsel and her eyes wide and joyous . " It 's just beautiful , " she kept saying over and over . " It 's just beautiful . " She got close against the resplendent tree and looked up through the branches . " I can sec you up there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , scratching his face on the branches . " Sure , I see you . Hello . " As he leaned over , a collection of glass balls slipped out of his hand and smashed on the floor at her feet . " Oh ! " Margaret cried in dismay . " It does n't matter , " Cherry reassured her , " there are plenty more . " " You 've hung up about all it will hold , anyway , " Kessler observed as the door opened and the housekeeper came in to tell Margaret her supper was ready . Margaret shrank back against the tree , looking down at the broken glass before her . " I  --  I 'm scared , " she confessed . " I might fall down and get cut . " " Yes , so you might , " Elizabeth agreed . " Come give her a lift , Dick . " " Okay . Wait a minute , Margaret . " Dick scrambled down from the ladder . Remarking that he had jolted some lights out of place , Cherry climbed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Put your arms around my neck and hold tight so I can lift you , Margaret . There you are . She 'll be along in a minute , " he said to the housekeeper , and as she went out he swung Margaret across the pile of glass and set her down . " Right ? " he asked her . She nodded . " Right , thank you . I 'm always scared of fallingdown on broken things . I fell down once , and got a bad cut on my neck . See ? " She drew the collar of her dress aside . Dick bent to look at the scar she showed him . " Why , you did get a bad cut . How did that happen ? " " A man kicked me , " said Margaret , " and I fell down . " " What ? " said Dick . The eyes of them all turned to her  --  Elizabeth , her hands full of tinsel , Cherry on the ladder adjusting the lights , Dick standing beside Margaret at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near by , said nothing . But Margaret appeared not to realize the start she had given them . " What man kicked you ? " Dick demanded , and stopped , absorbingthe idea of men who kicked little girls . Margaret answered without any excitement . " The man who killed my mother . " She said it as matter-of-factly as a German child in a happierera might have said , " The Three Bears . " For an instant the others around the Christmas tree stood immobile , frozen with a horror the more shocking because Margaret seemedp151unaware that there was any reason why they should be surprised . Elizabeth could not say anything at all . She was thinking , " We hear of these things . A thousand anonymous deaths , ten thousand of them , and we 're blunted . But hearing it , like this , this makes it sharp again . " Cherry was the first of them to catch her breath . Standing on the ladder by the tree , she gasped , " But Margaret  --  where were you ? When was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago  --  oh , a long time ago , " Margaretanswered , looking up at her . " I was very little . " She glanced at Elizabeth . " I told you , did n't 1 , Mrs. I let-long ? I told you my mother and father were dead . " " You told me they were dead , " Elizabeth said with difficulty . " But you did n't tell me what happened to them . " She glanced at Kessler . He was looking at Margaret , his mouth tight with pity , but he did not try to stop her . " They came looking for my father , " Margaret explained . " He was n't there , and my mother said he was n't there , but they would n't believe her , and they broke things up looking for him . They were terrible men , the Nazis , they used to push us off the street , and my mother would not take me out . They broke things up , and they hit her , and I was scared and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way and I fell down , and when I saw the blood I got more scared than ever . It was dreadful . " She shivered . " Nobody does things like that here in **30;8871;TOOLONG utterance by any member of the new Congress . ( This is confidential , of course . ) I thank fortune we keep well , and the Washington climate appears to agree with us so far . I only pray my precious boys will not succumb to any of the dreadful fevers which arc so prevalent  --  due , in my opinion , to the general lack of sanitation and proper drainage . The boys are lively as ever , and we all enjoy ourselves . . . . " It sounds well enough , I must say , " Elizabeth observed to Ninian . " But if I know Mary , there 's plenty she has n't written . " But what could one write about evenings spent alone in a boardinghouse parlor , sewing or reading  --  except to say that they were very dull ? And why trouble Elizabeth with the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unrestrainedchildren into the pattern of boardinghouse life had led , on a number of occasions , to decidedly caustic criticism from Mrs. Spriggs and some of her other guests ? It was true that Mr. Lincoln was making his mark in Washington . More and more frequently now he was invitedout  --  and Mary could n't help but be pleased when , every so often , he was pointed out and recognized on the street . " See that man over there  --  the tall one in the plug hat ? That 's Abe Lincoln . Comes from out west somewheres . Kind of a solemn-looking duck  --  but I hear he 's real comicalwhen he starts telling stories . They say even Daniel Webster comes down to the Capitol post office at lunchtimeto hear Abe Lincoln 's yarns . . . " One evening Mr. Lincoln came home with the news that he 'd been asked to one of the Sunday breakfasts at Mr. Webster 's house . Mary looked up from her sewing . PIOI " Why , Mr. Lincoln , that 's wonderful . All the most importantpeople @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoughtfully . " Let me see now  --  I should think my green velours ought to be just about right . Or perhaps the ladies dress more formally . Maybe the black watered silk  --  " Mary stopped , aware that Mr. Lincoln was looking at her with a peculiar expression . " To tell you the truth , Mary  --  " he shifted uneasily , digging his hands into his pockets  --  " I did n't hear anything about any ladies being invited . " Sometimes , having her supper upstairs alone when Mr. Lincoln was working late or had been invited to join a group of men at an evening bowling party , Mary was puzzled . It was a fact , as she never failed to mention in her letters home , that Mr. Lincoln 's career was getting on . But somehow she could n't help feeling that it was n't so much her influence as the long apprenticeship in the back of Diller 's drugstore that was bearing fruit . " I 'm sorry you do n't like it better here , Mary , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more  --  " Mary shrugged impatiently . " How am I to get out , ' Mr. Lincoln  --  when there is no one for me to leave the children with ? And where , pray , would I go ? Without any carriage , or any husband to take me most of the time  --  I 'd be a fine sight parading the streets and hopping over mud puddles . " " Well , I do n't know  --  " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " I should think you might make friends here in the house . Mrs. Spriggs seems nice  --  and then there 's that new Miss Tompkins . I was talking to her at lunch today . " " Yes  --  so I noticed . " Mary gave a sharp twitch to the shirt she was mending . " Thank you , Mr. Lincoln , but I think I prefer to wait until the time comes when you see fit to introduce me to some of your friends you talk so much about . " " I do n't meet anyone but men , Mary ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married . " pIO2 " I suppose you could n't possibly mention it  --  without waiting to be asked . " Mr. Lincoln said nothing . In June , when the hot weather began , Mary took the boys back to Springfield . It was only sensible , after all , to get them out of Washington during the months when the fever epidemics swept over the city and every second person succumbed to malaria or the typhoid . They agreed that she was to return in the fall  --  but when October came , the trip was delayed for one reason and another . First Mr. Lincoln was away  --  speaking in New York , and attending to various political matters in New England . Then he wrote that Mrs. Spriggs was extremelysorry she had no rooms available for Mary and the boys just at present . With Washington so crowded , it was n't likely they could find another place that would suit them . . . Perhaps later , after Christmas .. . But with the winter half gone , it began to seem foolish to break up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that remained . Mr. Lincoln could n't get away from Washington to come and travel east with them  --  and he did n't like to think of Mary making the long trip alone , with the two children to take care of . I f she was really anxious to come , Mr. Lincoln wrote , why not ask Elizabeth to come along ? It was that , as much as anything , that made Mary decide to stay in Springfield . After all , she explained to Elizabeth , Mr. Lincoln 's term in Congress would be over so soon  --  it was hardly worth while establishing themselves in Washington . Of course , she said , Mr. Lincoln was terribly disappointed . His letters spoke constantly of how much he missed them . But he had agreed that it was the best thing all around for him to stay on alone . Elizabeth , taking neat , rapid stitches in the napkin she was hemming , made no reply.  |p103LOOKING  BACK SOMETIMES , MARY WAS STARTLED TO FIND how she could remember things without really feeling them . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and weeks into years  --  and the long , soldierly line could disappear over the horizon , taking all reality with it  --  except for a few landmarks that rose like peaks , snowcapped , still visible but no longer very important except as a means of placing events . " That was the spring Mr. Lincoln won the big case for the Illinois Central . I remember , because it was when we added the second story to the house . . . " " It must have been the summer they paved the sidewalksaround the square . . . " " Do n't you remember  --  it was the year Robert took the croup and was so awfully sick ... " There was the birth of Willie to remember , and only a few weeks later , the terrible night when they had watched little Edward die of fever . Then there was a morning when Mr. Lincoln had leaned over the walnut-spindled cradle and looked at another baby boy . This one was named Thomas , for Mr. Lincoln 's father  --  but Mr. Lincoln said he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long , thin body  --  and they called him Taddie . Taddie was his father 's favorite , so Mary said . " Funny thing , " they used to say down at Diller 's . " It looked for a while there as if Abe was set to do big things . Going off to Congress  --  and sassing the President , and hobnobbing with Daniel Webster and all . But nothing much seemed to come of it . Guess he decided Springfield was good enough for him , after all . " pI04 Mary was in the kitchen , delivering a lecture to Katie , the current Irish girl . It had rained all day , with no sign of clearing , and the boys had been noisy and troublesome . Mr. Lincoln was late for supper , the porch roof had developed a leak  --  and now Katie was in one of her unreasonablegrouches . It was past eight o'clock , and the younger boys ought to have been in bed and asleep  --  but they had wound up the long day by a furious quarrel , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie , it seemed , had gone out to the woodshed to find that Tad , for want of better amusement , had hung his turtle . It was a pet turtle , and Willie was attached to it with the passionate devotion he lavished on all small creatures . I le was still out in the shed now , brooding over the limp remains of the turtle  --  his usually mild and placid nature roused to a storm of indignant tears . Taddie , banished to bed in disgrace for his barbarous deed , was by no means penitent . Mary could hear him banging the bars of his crib against the wall , while he shrieked with rage against the indignity of his punishment . In the parlor , Robert was reading . Like his father , Robert had a maddening knack of burying his nose in a book and remaining completely oblivious to other people 's difficulties . He was expected , during Mr. Lincoln 's absence , to take care of the fires  --  but he had forgotten , as usual , and the house was damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do her work , when no one else did theirs ? The fire in the range was half out , and not a stick of wood had Robert fetched for her . " You should have got it yourself then  --  or else reminded Robert . " That , said Katie , tossing her head , was not her work . It was n't as though she did n't have enough to do , cooking and scrubbing all day and picking up after the boys who ought to be taught to do for themselves , they were certainlyold enough , and somebody at her heels every minute telling her do this do that , she tried hard to please , good/ness knows , though there were some people the saints in heaven , could n't satisfy , but there was one thing she would n't do and that was break her back carrying wood , not for the blessed saints themselves , she would n't .. . Mary put her hands over her ears suddenly . For God 's sake , Katie , stop talking . I 'll get the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her mistress , rendered speechless by this final indignity . Then , with furious haste , she began untying her apron . Never , Katie muttered , never in her life had she expected to see the day when she would be sworn at . And by a lady , too . It was more than decent flesh and blood could bear . Supper or no supper , Mr. Lincoln or no Mr. Lincoln , Katie McGonnigle would stay no longer under this roof . She was leaving . Having struggled in from the drafty shed with an armloadof wood , just in time to witness Katie 's flouncing departure to pack her bag , Mary dumped the logs into the woodbox and came back to the shed where Willie , shiveringand tearful , still hovered over his turtle . She had snagged her new lace cuff on a frayed end of bark , and driven a splinter into her finger . " Willie , you must come to bed now . I wo n't stand for another moment of this nonsense . The turtle is dead  --  and your hanging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . " But Willie only clung to the bench tighter , his round face white and tragic . " I 'm going to wait for Papa , " he said , between chatteringteeth . " Papa can fix my turtle . I know he can . " Mary pushed back her hair , her lips trembling . Dear heaven , why must they all , forever , wait for Papa ? Even Katie had announced , darkly , that she would n't set foot out of the house until Mr. Lincoln came . As though , Mary thought bitterly , Mr. Lincoln or anyone else could solve the problem of managing with one servant to do the work of three . And for that matter , whose fault was it that meals werep106delayed until all hours and unannounced guests turned up at the last minute , expecting to be fed ? It was Mr. Lincoln who went blandly on his way , forgetting his chores , and leaving Mary to cope with the hired girl 's grumbling over unchopped wood and sidewalks piled with snow . But they would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln 's presence they were as mealy-mouthed as sucking doves . Mr. Lincoln was such a kind-spoken gentleman , God love him . And though they complained , loudly , that Mrs. Lincoln drove them past endurance and they were plagued beyond bearing by the boys ' naughtiness , it never seemed to occur to them that Mr. Lincoln might occasionally lend a hand in disciplining his children . " You 'd better do what Mrs. Lincoln says . . . " "  --  I reckon your mother knows what 's best ... " This was the most he could be counted on to offer in dealing with domestic problems . " I should like to have the angel Gabriel change places with me for a week , " Mary said once , " and see whether all the heavenly powers could make this house run properly . " Mr. Lincoln had looked up over the edge of his book . " That might be a good scheme , mother , " he said mildly . " And while you were in heaven , you 'd probably be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Taddic 's roars still issued , unabated , from upstairs when Mr. Lincoln came into the house . He walked straight through to the kitchen , to be confronted by Katie , bag packed , arms folded , and murder in her eye . Briefly , in highly explicit terms , Katie informed him of her reasons for leaving . Mr. Lincoln put down his hat . " Katie , " he said , " I do n't blame you . " He stood a minute , looking at the half-cooked supper on the cooling range with an eye so sad and hungry and alto/gether weary that Katie 's heart misgave her . But she squared her shoulders . Mr. Lincoln sighed . Then he reached in his pocket and drew out a silver dollar . " Katie , " he said , and the voice of him would have pulled tears out of a stone , " if you were to have an extra dollar every week  --  just between you and me , and not a word to another soul , do you think you could see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollar , her blue eyes suffused with a sudden tenderness . It was n't , she said , that she wanted to leave him . And to part with the boys , especially little Taddie , God love the innocence of him , would surely break her heart . But still and all  --  Katie shook her head  --  she could n't live under the roof with any woman that treated her so . just because a teacup had got broke  --  and cracked already it was , and just slipped out of her fingers  --  Mrs. Lincoln had said she 'd take twenty-five cents out of her wages to pay for it . And it was n't just the money she grudged , but the shame of it . And then calling her names , and swearing at her  --  when she could n't carry in the wood fast enough , on account of her lumbago .. Mr. Lincoln reached in his pocket again . " If you had twenty-five cents to pay for the cup , Katie , and another twenty-five not to mention this to Mrs. Lincoln , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could tell her you were sorry ? " " Well , sir  --  " Katie set down her bag  --  " it would n't be for the money , if I did . " She pocketed the silver firmly . " But I 'd never hope to see the day when Katie McGonnigle would disoblige a Christian gentleman like yourself , sir . I 'll stay . " Mr. Lincoln went up , two steps at a time , to Taddie 's room . " Now then , Tadpole , what seems to be the trouble ? " Sobbing and twisting against his father 's shoulder , Taddie poured out a wildly grieved account of his injuries . Mamma had hitted him  --  because he had just touchedp1o8 Willie 's stinky old turtle . And she had hurt him bad  --  and the turtle had been all deaded anyway .. . Mr. Lincoln listened gravely , saying nothing . Hoisting the boy higher on his shoulder , he crossed the hall to his bedroom and opened the bureau drawer . " Taddie , " he said , pulling out a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make you feel like going to sleep ? " Taddie made a grab for the bag . Then he choked back a last sob , doubtfully . " Can I have them all , papa ? " " Well  --  I expect so . " Taddie rubbed his nose . " Can I cat them now ? " he demanded . " Well  --  " " If I do n't tell Mamma ? " Taddic 's glance was sidelong . " Can I ? " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " I guess so , Taddie ; only mind , you must n't cry any more or tease Willie about his pets . " On his way past the parlor door downstairs , Mr. Lincoln paused to remind Robert about the fires . Then he went out to the shed . Hearing his step , Mary turned to see him in the doorway . He came over and put his hand on Willie 's shoulder . " Is something wrong here , mother ? " The last remnant of Mary 's patience snapped . " Something wrong here , Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there something wrong in this house , I should like to know ? Katie is leaving because Robert refused to mind the fires ; Taddie had to be spanked and put to bed because he hung Willie 's turtle ; and now Taddie is crying himself sick and Willie insists on staying out here where we shall both catch our death of cold  --  and then you come in , two hours late for supper , and ask if something is wrong . "  | " Well , mother , it seemed the quickest way of finding out . " Now you 've found out  --  perhaps you can do something with this stubborn boy . He wo n't budge from his stupid turtle that was dead hours ago . " ' Willie 's furious wail cut in . " He 's not dead , papa . He 's not . I saw him move  --  just now . See , papa  --  look at him . You see  --  " Mr. Lincoln bent down a moment , then he lifted the turtle 's box and took Willie 's hand . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " We 'll just try moving Mohammed to the mountain  --  since the other way around does n't seem to work . Let 's take the turtle up to your room and fix him up there . Then he wo n't take cold  --  and neither will you . " " Mamma wo n't let me . " Willie gulped , his blue eyes turned on Mary accusingly . She does n't like my turtle . She says he 's dead  --  and he is n't  --  " " Oh , I think Mamma will . Please , ma'am , " he asked politely , may we have safe-conduct into Willie 's room for one turtle , guaranteed to be harmless , free from vicious habits ? " Seeing the small , wan smile that dawned on Willie 's forlorn countenance , Mary turned on her heel . You can do anything you like , " she said , and walked into the house . In the kitchen , Katie looked up from the stove where she was tasting a kettle of stew . Very red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she mumbled something indistinct about having changed her mind and being sorry the old cracked teacup had broke itself . Mary said nothing . Passing through the hall , she could hear the sounds of a briskly crackling fire , and she saw Robert on his knees before the grate . She went upstairs . Taddie was lying in his crib , his covers pulled up neatly , and as she bent over him he gave her an angelic smile  --  all the more touching because his subdued moments werep110so rare , and because of the way his puckered lip made the smile twist to one side . Poor baby  --  he was all worn out . His cheeks were stained with tears , streaked and grimy . Taddie 's tempers always vanished like this  --  as suddenly as they came  --  and Mary never failed to be disarmed by the way he could forgive his punishments . There was none of Robert 's silent , passive stubbornness . None of Willie 's shy , secretive ways that made his occcasional outbursts so frighteningly intense and mysterious . With Taddie everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her babies , Mary thought , Taddie was the most truly her own . It was n't until she bent down , tenderly , to wipe his checks that she detected the unmistakable odor of peppermintdrops that lingered on the guileless , rosy curve of Taddie 's smile . Standing in front of her mirror , smoothing her hair before going down to supper , Mary looked at her reflection . She could see the lines , faint , but no longer to be denied , around her eyes and the corners of her mouth . Lines that came from too often pressing her lips into the tight downward curve of exasperated weariness . With a kind of vague wistfulness , she found herself wishing suddenly she could tell Mr. Lincoln she was sorry . Perhaps  --  if she could tell him , she could make him understand . Perhaps he might even comfort her  --  as he could comfort Katie , and give Taddie peppermints , and bring Willie 's turtle back to life .. . But it was no use . He would have forgotten already that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Katie had forgotten , and Taddie , and Willie . And besides  --  Mary straightened her lace collar hastily  --  there was no time . Supper would be waiting , and unless she reminded Mr. Lincoln to hurry , there was no knowing how long he might stay with Willie , fussing over that wretched turtle. pIIIAnd it would be a pity , certainly , to risk making Katie cross all over again . IT WAS BEGINNING TO LOOK AS THOUGH THE SLAVERYissue would have to be decided , after all . The Whig party had held out as long as it could  --  trying to straddle the ticklish question  --  and had finally died , still straddling . The Democrats managed to keep themselves on the fence  --  but sooner or later they 'd have to make the jump . " The North wo n't let slavery alone , " Mr. Lincoln said , " and the South ca n't afford to give it up . One way or another  --  it looks like we 're headed for trouble . " He was back in politics now , helping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leftover Whigs and a few Democrats who were tired of their own party 's quibbling . Still , in spite of the Republicans ' firm stand against the extension of slavery , Mr. Lincoln had n't altogethermade up his mind . More and more , people spoke of the possibility of war . Of secession , and a split country . But mostly they talked without really meaning it . In the prairie summer , while the sun rose and set just as it always had , and the corn grew tall in the fields , war seemed a far-off and impossible thing . " If there should be fighting , " Elizabeth asked one afternoon , " which side would Mr. Lincoln take ? " Mary was evasive . He had n't decided . There were many factors to be considered . Moral rights were one thing , but property rights were quite another  --  and so long as the Constitution guaranteed both , how was a person to decide and be certain he was right ? - Elizabeth bit off her thread. pII2 It was n't so much a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being anywhere at all . And if Mr. Lincoln did n't hurry up and decide  --  he 'd find himself nowhere . But when Mary said the same thing to Mr. Lincoln , he only sighed . " I reckon it 's like the story of the old Scotch elder that used to make the same prayer every Sunday : O Lord , point me right  --  for Thou knowest if I get started wrong Thou , Thyself , ca n't change me . ' " After a minute , he sighed again . " I wish somebody 'd point me right , " he said . That was the summer Stephen Douglas came back to Springfield . He was running for the Senate , on the Democraticticket , and it was up to the Republicans to put up a man strong enough to give him a run for his money . And money , they said , was something the Democrats had plenty of . " Do n't know as they 'll get anybody fool enough to try to beat Douglas . " They shook their heads down at Diller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and always was . " Well , we 've got plenty of fools around , I reckon . That 's one crop never fails  --  specially in politics . " Mr. Douglas was married now , and there were those who hinted that his wife , who was younger than he and very handsome , already had her eye on something more important than the Senate . Adele Douglas was a smart one , all right , and she knew that if Mr. Douglas made good in this election , the Democrats were likely to put him up for president . And if money and good looks and influence could turn the trick , she meant to see to it that he won . When the Republicans first began to talk of running Mr. Lincoln for the Senate , Mary was annoyed by the apathy with which he received the news . After all , this was his chance . The chance they had waited for , that hadp113been so many years in coming . But when she tried to say this , Mr. Lincoln looked gloomier than ever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to take a skinning . With all the money the Democrats are pouring into Illinois , Douglas ca n't possibly lose . And anyway , he 's already the most popular man in the state . " Mary set her chin . " And how did he get so popular , I should like to know ? Not by magic , Mr. Lincoln . He went out and worked for it  --  and you can do the same thing , if you 've a mind to . " Mr. Lincoln shrugged . There was only one stick big enough for Douglas to stub his toe on , he said , and that was slavery . And Douglas was too smart to risk committing himself there . He 'd walk the fence , same as he always had , and get the vote on both sides . " Unless , " Mary said , " someone is smart enough to push him off that fence . Unless somebody asks him point-blank to state his mind . " It was some weeks after Mr. Lincoln was nominated for the Senate that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenging Mr. Douglas to a series of public debates that would put the slavery question fairly and squarely up to the voters . " I 'd like to know how Abe Lincoln expects to argue anybody down on something he has n't made up his own mind about , " Elizabeth said . But it seemed that Mr. Lincoln had been doing more thinking than Elizabeth or anyone else , except maybe Billy Herndon , realized . He had read newspapers from the South and studied their arguments , not only supporting slavery for blacks  --  but for the lower class of white workersas well . In the so-called free society of the North , they said , there were thousands of servile laborers who were incapable of self-government and yet were given the power to vote . The time was coming when the North would rid itself of this burden of ignorance and incompetence . It was natural for some men to be masters and some slaves  --  as natural as for parents to take responsibility for their children  --  and , late or soon , all thinking people must come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interests in the North that were beginning to listen to these arguments  --  and to believe in them . So  --  that was the way the wind was blowing . And Mr. Lincoln , having felt its cold breath , was ready to answer . If it was not possible to give freedom to every living creature , he said , at least they must do nothing to impose slavery upon any other creature . Speaking one summer afternoon to a crowd that stood quiet and attentive under a broiling sun , Mr. Lincoln lifted his voice : " When you have succeeded in dehumanizing the Negro , when you have put him down , and extinguishedhis soul ... are you sure that the demon you have roused will not turn and rend you ? . . . Our reliance is in the love of liberty which God has planted in our bosoms . Our defence is in the preservationof the spirit which prizes liberty as the heritage of all men , in all lands everywhere . Destroy this spirit and you have planted the seeds of despotism around your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you are preparing your own limbs to wear them . . . " Mary listened that afternoon , standing in the crowd . Even from a distance , every line of Mr. Lincoln 's face was familiar  --  each inflection of his voice she knew as well as though it were her own . He had taken off his coat  --  and the shirt he wore was one she had made . And yet the words were new . The words  --  and something more . A kind of spirit that came from him and from his listeners  --  like something that had slept a long time and was wakening . The crowd sensed it too  --  she could feel their responsein the silence all around her  --  in the upturned faces.  |p115The  current , dammed over the slow years , was flowing now . When Mr. Lincoln finished speaking , he pulled out a red cotton handkerchief and wiped his forehead . There was applause  --  and then the audience stirred , beginning to break up . A few went up to the platform , and she could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood quite still . And presently she was surprised to find that there were tears in her eyes . That was one of the few times Mary heard Mr. Lincoln speak . Most of the summer , while he was away campaigning , she stayed in Springfield . For one thing , the current hired girl was as unreliable as her predecessors , and Mary had to take care of the boys and the house ; for another thing , there was n't enough money in the Republican chest to pay her traveling expenses . While Mr. Douglas swept into one town after another in a private car , surrounded by his entourage , Mr. Lincoln was more likely to arrive carrying his own suitcase , after a long , dusty ride in a day coach . " We 've got to make up in elbow grease for what the Democrats put on in show , " Mr. Lincoln said . And he worked hard , coming home between speeches so tired that Mary watched him anxiously . For all the fanfare of the Douglas tour , Mr. Lincoln was holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneaking hunch , " he told Mary , " that folks would just as soon see a candidate act like a regular human being instead of landing in a town the way Douglas does  --  with a brass band and a torchlight parade , as if he 'd been fighting the country , and had just succeeded in conquering it . " There were others who were skeptical . " I do n't see why you ca n't work up a little more show , Mr. Lincoln , " Elizabeth said one night when he came to supper . " People like to be entertained  --  and there arepI16 bound to be plenty who vote for the party that makes the most noise . It makes them feel safer . " Writing to Billy Herndon from Chicago , where Mr. Douglas had just addressed the populace from the balcony of the Tremont House , Mr. Lincoln was still doubtful of his opponent 's heroics . " Douglas likes to make it look as if he were having a triumphal march into the country , " he said , " but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from his campaign in Russia . I read in the paper the other day that Douglas carries his own brass cannon , nowadays , so he 'll be sure of being saluted at every stop . " There were other papers that made equally uncomplimentaryremarks about the homespun Republican candidate . Lincoln could split infinitives as well as rails , they noted , and it had been plain ever since the day he said that a house divided against itself can not stand , that he was bent on splitting more than rails or the king 's English . With his wild , half-baked notions on slavery , Lincoln was trying to set one half of the country against the other . He was preaching war  --  and making an alarmingly good job of it into the bargain . Answering , Mr. Lincoln said merely that there was a difference between expecting a crisis  --  and wishing it . Kind of like the difference between a horse chestnut and a chestnuthorse . " I never aimed to make this a personal fight , " Mr. Lincolnsaid to Mary when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Douglas accused me of running a grocery store and selling whisky , I could n't resist saying the differenceseemed to be that while I was behind a bar  --  he was out in front . " Telling a crowd how the Democrats had used the old states ' rights argument again and again to fool the voters , Mr. Lincoln said it put him in mind of a fisherman 's wife whose husband was brought home drowned and full ofp117eels . They asked her what she wanted done with him , andshe said they 'd better take out the eels and set him again . After one of the debates , a lady said , " I felt so sorry forMr . Lincoln while Mr. Douglas was speaking  --  and thenI felt so sorry for Mr. Douglas when Mr. Lincoln replied . " All in all , it was n't an easy summer for Mary . With Mr. Lincoln gone so much and the law office closed down entirely , what money they had on hand had to go into his campaign expenses . But for once , even though the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her an odd feeling sometimes , when she read about Addie Douglas in the papers , to remember that there had been a time when people had talked about her marryingMr . Douglas . Not that she had any qualms about having made the wrong choice . But she could n't help wishing the voters would see things more her way . Even from the start of the campaign , no one seemed to have much doubt about the outcome . Lincoln had put up a good fight , they said . Starting from way behind , he 'd made Douglas sweat for every vote he got  --  but still you could hardly say anyone was exactly surprised , in November , when the Democrats carried the state . " I reckon nobody ever expected me to win , " Mr. Lincolnsaid , " excepting maybe Mother . " He was wrong , though . Mary had n't thought he would be elected any more than anyone else had . But when it was all over , and Mr. Lincoln was back home again , she knew one thing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from taking the appointment he could have had as governorof the Oregon Territory . At the time , he had thought they ought to go  --  seeing no possibilities for anythingvery promising where they were . She had been firm  --  and they had stayed , and now she saw that she had n't been mistaken . Because , even though Mr. Douglas was going back for another term in the Senate , there had been a sudden endp118to the talk of putting him up for president the following year . Mr. Lincoln had been defeated . But he had said some things that would n't be forgotten in a hurry . With money so scarce that winter , Mary had to give up the hired girl altogether , but while she cooked and scrubbed and mended the boys ' clothes , she was happier than she had been in a long while . Things worked out in queer , roundabout ways sometimes . Most of all , she remembered the afternoon she had heard Mr. Lincoln speak and the look on the faces of the people around her  --  listening . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Literary Circle at tea , and Mary went over to help her receive . When Elizabeth first asked her , Mary said she did n't see how she could come . With no one to look after the boys , she could n't leave the house . But when Elizabeth insisted , Mary had finally agreed . " After all , " Elizabeth said , it will look queer if you 're not here  --  being my own sister . Even if Mr. Lincoln was n't elected  --  you do n't want people to think you 're hiding . . . " So Mary had engaged the Underhills ' daughter , from down the street , to come and mind the boys , for twenty-five cents , until Mr. Lincoln got home from the office . Sitting in Elizabeth 's parlor , Mary felt uncomfortably conscious of her plain black silk amongst the more elegant costumes of the literary ladies . But they were all most kind . It was n't often , Mrs. Gurney pointed out , that they had the pleasure of seeing Mary at one of their meetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Gurney added charitably , " I 'm sure you set an example for us all in the way you devote yourself to your family , Mrs. Lincoln . Especially when you think of how Mrs. Douglas went everywhere with her husband while he was here campaigning . Why.  |p119they  say she was on the platform every time Mr. Douglas made a speech  --  and always in a new gown , of course . " The other ladies took up the subject with enthusiasm . " Personally , " Mrs. Fox said , " I do n't believe a real lady has any place in politics  --  no matter if she is as handsome as Mrs. Douglas . My husband said it was a question of which one was really running for the Senate  --  Mr. Douglas or his wife . " " I do n't doubt Mr. D. felt it a great advantage to parade her around . But when all 's said and done , I 'm not so sure a man 's well thought of for being tied as close as all that to his wife 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glanced sharply at Mary 's wellseasonedblack gown  --  " Addie Douglas never wore anything that could be called apron strings . They say she has all her clothes made in New York  --  and I 've heard for a fact she paid fifty dollars just for the lace trimming on one of her evening dresses . " " There 's no doubt about it , Mrs. Lincoln , " Mrs. Gurney said , nodding , " you can congratulate yourself on staying right here in Springfield and letting your husband do his own campaigning . " Mary smiled . " Nevertheless , we ca n't altogether overlook the fact that Mr. Douglas was elected . " There was a pause  --  before Mrs. Gurney hurried on . " Well , of course  --  " her laugh was a trifle uncertain  --  " things are always so unpredictable in politics . In any case , I 'm sure everyone feels Mr. Lincoln did his best . " Mary stood up , glancing at Elizabeth . " I 'd better see about fresh tea , " she said . " This has gotten quite cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was helping tidy up the parlor , Elizabeth glanced at her sharply . " Do n't you feel well , Mary ? " Certainly , Mary said . She had never felt better . " Well , I was just wondering . You were so quiet today . The ladies could n't help but notice . " I20 MR . LINCOLN 'S WIFEp120WITH MR . LINCOLN BACK AT THE LAW OFFICE , MONEYbegan to come in again , and the bills were paid . But Mary still had no help in the house . Robert was going to Exeter Academy in the fall , and she had to save for his tuition . " I ca n't see any mortal sense in sending Robert halfway across the country when there are schools right here in Illinois , " Elizabeth said . But Mary was firm . " I mean to have the best of everything for the boys . I 've always intended Robert to go to Harvard , and he needs a year at a good eastern school to prepare him . " " ' Well , I must say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long way just to get an education . If Robert went to Transylvania he could live with the family , in Lexington  --  andyou 'd be spared all this expense . " " Yes , " Mary said ; " and he 'd grow up just as we did , thinking there was nothing in the world outside of Kentucky . You do n't understand , Elizabeth . I want my boys to be different . I want them to meet people  --  and have the right opportunities  --  " Elizabeth looked at her curiously . " What does Mr. Lincolnsay to all this ? " Mary smiled . " Mr. Lincoln leaves such things to me , " she said complacently . " He 's devoted to the boys , but he has no more ideas about planning for their future than a kitten . So long as they keep out of mischief and learn to read and write , I do n't suppose he 'd notice what they did . He does n't realize that if the boys are ever going to amount to anything they must have their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that they have it . " A few weeks after Robert left for Exeter , Mary 's younger sister Emilie came to visit . Mary was fond ofpI2IEmilie , and in a vague sort of way she hoped Emilie might marry and settle down in Springfield . But nothing came of it . Shortly after her return to Lexington , Emilie wrote that she was engaged to Ben Helm , and they would be going to live in Georgia as soon as they were married . As Ann pointed out , Mary was altogether too wrapped up in herself to be any sort of matchmaker . Reading Emilie 's letter , full of happy plans for the future , Mary felt uneasy . Three of her sisters were already married to Southerners , and all her brothers were living in the South . And the dark prophecies of secession and war grew no less . She wondered sometimes how much Mr. Lincoln regrettedhaving lost the election to Mr. Douglas . He seemed completely taken up with his law work again , and though there were occasional visits from gentlemen who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Mr. Lincoln , he spoke little about politics . " I 'm glad for your sake , Mary , " Elizabeth said , " that Mr. Lincoln has gotten over this nonsense of running for office and settled down to business . I daresay it was a disappointment to you when he lost the campaign  --  but I suppose we all have to learn sooner or later that our husbandsare n't cut out to be great men . Taking things by and large , Mary , I do n't mind saying Mr. Lincoln has turned out a good deal better than I ever thought he would . " One winter evening , after supper , Mr. Lincoln came into the sitting room where Mary was darning socks . Insteadof picking up a book , he sat down on the sofa , his elbows on his knees . With Robert away , and Tad and Willie upstairs asleep , the house was very still . Suddenly , out of the silence , Mr. Lincoln sighed . " I was talking to Jesse Fell this afternoon , " he said . Mary nodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waswondering at the moment whether she had remembered to tell Robert in her last letter about the new shirts shepI22 was sending him . When Mr. Lincoln did n't go on , she looked up . " Yes ? " Mr. Lincoln sighed again . " Fell 's got a lot of notions about the elections next fall . Seems to have the idea that if the Republicans put up the right man  --  they might stand a chance to get in . " Mary snipped off her thread and rolled up a sock . She rubbed her eyes . Sewing by lamplight always made them ache , but she made an effort to seem interested . " He said "  --  Mr. Lincoln rubbed his chin  --  " there 'd been some talk that maybe they were thinking of putting me up to run . But I do n't know ... " For a moment Mary continued to inspect one of Willie 's socks . Then , as suddenly as though an explosion had rocked the familiar , firelit room , the meaning of Mr. Lincoln'swords dawned on her . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knuckles showed white . " What did you tell him , Mr. Lincoln ? " " Why  --  " he seemed surprised by the way Mary was staring at him  --  " I told him I did n't think much of the idea . I said if they were looking for someone that stands a chance of being elected  --  they were barking up the wrong tree . Seward , back in New York  --  or Chase , or Simon Cameron  --  any of those men are better known than I am . " " Mr. Lincoln  --  " Mary stood up , not noticing the lapful of socks that spilled at her feet . " Mr. Lincoln , you do n't mean to sit there and tell me you refused . " " Well , no , not exactly , mother . I just told Fell they 'd better think it over . After all , you 've got to remember nobody outside of Illinois has ever heard of me . " " No , " Mary said , " but they will , Mr. Lincoln . They will hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her voice , Mr. Lincoln glanced up again , uneasily . There was n't any use , he said , taking this thing too seriously . It was nothing more than a conversation , between friends . Did n't mean a thing , most likely ; he 'd just thought to mention it.  |p123Mary  shook her head , brushing aside his words . From somewhere deep inside her a strength seemed to rise . As if all the hopes , all the efforts that she had squandered for so many years on a thousand things that never really matteredwere suddenly concentrated . Quite calmly , she stooped and gathered up the scattered socks from the floor . She put the basket on the table . " Mr. Lincoln , you must listen to me . " Mary sat down facing him . This was the moment  --  she knew it now . The moment she had always known was coming , when the tide would run swift and full . " This is the time when you must decide what you are going to do , Mr. Lincoln . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone  --  " " Now , mother , there 's no call to get all excited . You ca n't force a thing like this . And besides , there 's no such luck for me . " Mary watched him steadily . " There 's no luck about beingpresident , Mr. Lincoln , " she said . " And these things can be forced . They must . " He looked up , and for a minute , in the still room , he almost seemed to catch the intensity that burned in her eyes . " Promise me you wo n't answer that way again , Mr. Lincoln . Promise me  --  " For a moment more her glance held his . Then Mr. Lincoln smiled . " Well , " he said , " it seems kind of early to be making campaign promises  --  " His voice dropped back into the old , easy drawl . " But if it makes you feel any better , mother , I 'll promise that when they come and knock at the front door and ask me to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowball gathered slowly . For more than a month after Mr. Lincoln spoke of his conversation with Mr. Fell , the days came and went much as usual . Mr. Lincoln was busy at the office . Willie fell off the porch and sprained his knee . Grandmother HumphreyspI24died in Lexington and left Mary a legacy of a thousand dollars and her amethyst brooch . During those weeks Mary was careful not to let Mr. Lincoln see that she was waiting . There was no need , she thought , to try to hurry things . The seed was planted . But for the first time in years she showed no irritation when Mr. Lincoln was late for meals or the boys tried her patience . It was as though a calm , deep and certain , had dropped over the house . But the snowball was gathering . By the time spring came , people in Springfield were beginning to say they 'd heard talk of Mr. Lincoln being put up for the nomination . It seemed an unlikely kind of idea , they said . But still , they mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke to Mary . Mary only shrugged , and said it was far too early to listen to such rumors . " It 's a queer thing , " Elizabeth said to Ann . You might suppose Mary would take some interest in all this talk . She 's always been ambitious for Mr. Lincoln . " Ann smiled . " I daresay Mary 's had her fill of watching Mr. Lincoln run for office and get nowhere , " she said . " I do n't blame her for not encouraging him this time . So long as he 's getting on in his work , he 'd better have the sense to leave well enough alone . " Mr. Lincoln had to go to New York , to make a speech at Cooper Union , and before he got back to Springfield the news of his speech had spread all over the country . Newspapers everywhere had reprinted his words  --  along with editorials praising or condemning his stand . " I ca n't figure out what they 're driving at , " Mr. Lincolnsaid . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were alone after supper . " When they could have Seward for the asking , it does n't make much sense to think they 'd want a candidate no more fit than I am. "  | " Fit or not , Mr. Lincoln , " Mary said , " you 're in the field now  --  and you may as well make up your mind to it . " He looked at her curiously for a minute , but when he spoke again , it was about something else . In the late spring there was a week of unseasonably raw weather , and both Tad and Willie came down with colds . It always frightened Mary to see the boys sick , and when Taddie 's cold settled in his chest , she insisted on sitting with him at night until , worn out with nursing and anxiety , she came down with a chill herself . Cousin Lizzie Grimsley was sent for , and for several days she took care of the house while Mary rested . When Cousin Lizzie went home , she was puzzled . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You know how particular she is about her house  --  and yet the whole time I was there she hardly seemed to notice what was going on . She 'd just lie in bed and look at the ceiling , and when I 'd ask her a question about anything , she 'd tell me to do whatever I thought best . Half the time I do n't believe she even heard what anyone said until Mr. Lincoln would come home . Then she 'd want to sit up and fix her hair  --  and start to fuss at me if his supper was n't ready the minute he wanted it . You might think from the way she treated him they 'd been married a week  --  instead of nearly eighteen years . " One morning after Mary and the boys were well again , another letter came from Emilie . She was married now , and very happy . But she could n't help being troubled by all the talk of secession . Did Mary suppose there was really going to be a war ? And from Lexington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept hearing , that if Mr. Lincoln ran for president he would try to abolish slavery ? Mary answered at length . There was talk of his being nominated , but as for slavery , Mr. Lincoln stood preciselywhere he had always stood , she said . He was opposedto slavery as an institution , but as for being an abolitionist , he was not , and never would be . Such an idea was absurd . She did n't bother to consult Mr. Lincoln about these reassurances she offered . It never occurred to her that it might be necessary . The weather grew milder , and it was time to fetch down the summer clothes from the boxes in the attic , to mend and clean them , and let down the boys ' trousers . As the days lengthened , and the sun blazed in the bright skies , there was no sign of lessening in the tension that hung over the country . Storm signals were raised everywherenow , in plain view for all who wished to read them . North and South were being drawn more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth  --  by the hotheads on both sides . The founding fathers and Holy Writ were quoted liberally , and with high feeling . The most plentiful commodity on the market , Mr. Lincoln said , seemed to be hot air . No one , in either the North or the South , took too much stock , for all the shouting , in the idea of an actual war . It was only a little group of radicals , mostly in New England , that went so far as to say they wanted to fight  --  and New England was very far away . War was a thing people did n't like to think about . But the little group had lighted the fires . And the fires kept on burning  --  popular or not . They were trying to pin Mr. Lincoln down now . He had spoken against slavery . If it came to slavery or war  --  which would he choose ? " You 'll have to tell them something , Mr. Lincoln , " Mary said . " If you do n't , you 'll wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Well , I do n't know why they should , " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " When I do n't trust either side . " " It does n't settle anything just to keep on saying there 's wrong on both sides , Mr. Lincoln . There must be right on both sides too . " " Yes , " he said . " That 's just the trouble . "  |p127The  snowball was rolling too fast to be stopped . No one seemed to know just how it had happened , but people everywhere were getting the idea that maybe this man Lincoln could do something to straighten out the mess . He was n't one of your name-callers anyway . And if Lincoln thought there was a chance of bringing both sides around and stopping this thing short of ruining the whole country  --  well , maybe he was the man to do it . On a rainy morning in May , the Republican National Convention met in Chicago . Mary was up early , helping Miranda with breakfast , and the boys were already at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary turned , a pot of coffee in one hand and a plate of hot biscuits in the other . For a moment she and Mr. Lincoln looked at each other , then Mary smiled . " Sit down , Mr. Lincoln . You look as though you needed some breakfast . " She poured his coffee , and put a helping of his favorite strawberry preserve before him , but he only sat staring at the food , seeming lost in thought . " I was just thinking , mother , " he said finally , " I 'd better bring in some wood before I go down to the office . It 's kind of chilly  --  maybe you 'd like a fire . " Mary looked up quickly . It was the first time she could ever remember his offering to do anything around the house without being reminded . " That 's all right , Mr. Lincoln , " she said . " Miranda or I can fetch the wood just as well as not . It 's not a bit of trouble . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school and Taddie was out playing in the yard . The house was tidy for the day , and Miranda had started getting dinner . Mary went to the front window and stood looking out on the familiar street . There was n't any use , of course , expecting news . It would be several days before the con- vention got around to actually deciding . . . And in the meantime she might as well find something to keep her busy . She was upstairs sorting sheets to be mended when the front door banged and Taddie came pounding up the stairs shouting breathlessly that Papa was coming down the street . Is he the Prestendent yet , mamma ? " No , no ; of course not , Taddie . " Mary hurried past him , not pausing to notice the mud he had tracked in on the clean stairs . She met Mr. Lincoln at the front door . " Mr. Lincoln , what is it ? Has something happened ? " He turned to hang up his hat . No , nothing had happened ; only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . The place was full of people , all with nothing in particular to say and wanting to say it fast . If it 's all right with you , mother , I guess I 'll just stay home today . " That was Wednesday . All day Thursday and half of Friday they waited . Mr. Lincoln walked down to the office every few hours , but before long he 'd be back again , with a fresh batch of telegrams . And between times there were streams of visitors , arriving at the most unlikely hours of the day and night  --  and letters , messages , and more telegrams . The house was in a constant turmoil . Meals were interrupteda dozen times , there were segar ashes all over the furniture , the polished floors were tracked with footprints , and the boys were in such a stew of excitement that Mary had all she could do to keep them in any sort of order . Reports and rumors came thick and fast from the convention . Billy Herndon had gone up to Chicago , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln 's name was given an ovation  --  but Seward got an even bigger demonstration when his name was put up . Everyone seemed to think Lincoln 's chances looked good  --   |p129but  it was still anybody 's guess how the convention would vote . By Friday morning , there were dark shadows around Mr. Lincoln 's eyes . " I 'll be glad when it 's over , " he said gloomily . " There never was much of a chance anyhow . " " Nonsense , Mr. Lincoln . Nothing 's over yet  --  and you 'll feel differently when you 've tasted Miranda 's pancakes . She 's the first girl I 've ever had that knew how to make them properly . " Mary handed him his plate and passed the syrup jug . It was barely eight o'clock , but Mary had been up for two hours , straightening the house , planning the meals , and giving Miranda directions for the day . It was the only time she had the house to herself . " I should think you 'd be all fagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look more as if you were fixed up for a party . " Mary smiled . She had gone up just before breakfast to change into her blue sprigged muslin  --  just in case there should be early callers  --  and her hair was brushed and shining . " Heavens and earth , Mr. Lincoln , " she said , " one of us has got to keep cheerful . " While Mary got Willie off to school and helped Miranda clear away the breakfast things , Mr. Lincoln followed her about , his hands in his pockets . She could n't help but be touched by the way he had seemed to turn to her in these days  --  as though there were some reassurance in her that he needed . It was strange , she thought , after all the years  --  after all the bitter , rebellious hours when she had felt so utterly shut out of his life  --  that he should come so close now , suddenly , at the very time when there was so much to pull him away from her . By nine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would begin this morning , he said ,  | and everyone was sure of a quick decision . By afternoon , at the latest , there should be news . Mr. Lincoln read the message and handed it to Mary . " I wish it were n't Friday , " he said . " It always was an unlucky day . " " I daresay it 's just as likely to be unlucky for Mr. Seward , " Mary put down the telegram and handed him a list . " If you 're planning to go downtown before noon , Mr. Lincoln , I 'd be obliged if you 'd stop at the grocery on the way and bring me these things . We 're out of vanilla and eggs  --  and Miranda wants to bake a cake . " It was a little past twelve when Mr. Lincoln came home and walked straight through to the kitchen to put down the packages . " Here are your things , mother . " There was a note in his voice that made Mary turn quickly . " While I was getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came across from Diller 's to tell me they 'd got the news that I 'd been nominated . " He looked at Mary a minute , with a queer mixture of surprise and sheepishness . " I guess they really meant it , after all , mother . " Miranda was outside , hanging up wash , and Taddie had gone across the street to play . In that moment , they were alone in the house , facing each other across the packages Mr. Lincoln had brought home . Mary came around the table . It was true , she thought . It was really true . The moment she had believed in and waited for , And now that it had come , surely all the weary background of impatience and misunderstanding and failure would be washed away . Fate had come knocking at last , and Mary stood ready to welcome her , like a long-expected friend . She put out her hand . " I knew this would come , Mr. Lincoln , " she said . " I 've always known it . "  |p131Mr  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well  --  I 'm glad you were n't disappointed , mother , " he said . The rest of the day was like being in a confused dream , where people appeared from nowhere , popping up in every corner of the house , shaking hands , shouting the same congratulations over and over . A band , hastily assembled , marched down Jackson Street and blared out a noisy serenade , half off key , and a dozen times during the afternoonMr . Lincoln went out on the front porch to shake hands some more . Telegrams came faster than ever . Every few minutes Tad or Willie came rushing in with new ones . There was no restraining the boys ' excitement now  --  it seemed to Mary they were everywhere at once , stumbling over visitors ' feet , hanging on Mr. Lincoln 's coattails , their cheeks and pockets stuffed with candy which they received from the visiting strangers with shrieks of delight . Elizabeth and Ninian were there , and Ann and Frances and the John Stuarts . And Cousin Lizzie , of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had a feeling the day Mary married Mr. Lincoln that he would turn out to be a great man someday . On all sides Mary heard them talking about Mr. Lincoln . How they 'd always said Abe had something about him that was different . " Seemed like he was almighty slow getting started  --  but I always figured Abe 'd be heard from someday . Yes , sir ... " Even her sisters seemed awed by the news  --  and when they offered to stay and help Mary serve doughnuts and hot coffee , she accepted gratefully . Her cup was too full to leave room for bitterness . By eleven o'clock that night , the house was still milling with people , and there were outraged howls from Tad and Willie when Mary finally marched them upstairs . Worn out herself , she managed somehow to get them undressedand into bed at last . But at the very moment when 2 she was tucking Taddie in , a fresh burst of music blared from the street below , and Taddie was up again , like a bolt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise . With a sigh of resignation , Mary gathered him up and carried him to the window . " Look , mamma  --  look at all the sticks on fire  --  " Taddie strained against her shoulder , wriggling with excitement . It was a torchlight parade , and in the flaring lights the street and yard looked like some strange and unfamiliar place . People were crowded about the front step , shouting ragged scraps of campaign songs above the raucous brass of the band . " Hurray for Lincoln ! " " Three cheers for Honest Abe ! " Taddie drooped suddenly against Mary 's arm , overcome with sleep at last , but for a minute more Mary stood holding him . Feeling his head heavy on her shoulder , she looked up at the sky , arched and clear above the hullabaloo beneath . There  --  in the domed silence of the stars  --  hung the pattern , the shape of the future , bright and unreadable . A breath of wind from the mild night stirred the ruffled curtains . Mary carried Taddie back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long sigh . She crossed to her room , pausing at the mirror to smooth her hair , and she was conscious of the aching weariness in her back . But when she went downstairs a few minutes later , to help gather up and wash the empty coffee cups , Mary was smiling . IT WAS A QUIET SUMMER FOR MARY . MR . LINCOLN WENTto the office every day , preferring to stay in Springfield and leave the campaign speaking to Sumner , Chase andp133the others . Robert came home from Exeter , and in August the word came that he would be accepted for the freshmanclass at Harvard in the fall . Except for the great bundles of mail the postman brought each day , and the number of gentlemen who came to call , it might have been any other summer . " I must say , " Elizabeth admitted , " Mary is taking this a good deal better than I 'd have expected . She hardly mentionsthe election  --  and I have n't heard her speak a cross word to Mr. Lincoln in weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find Mr. Lincoln already dressed , standing by the window . " I could n't seem to sleep any more . " He came over and sat down on the bed , staring at his hands . Mary watched him , thinking how tired he looked . Suddenlyshe wondered how he really felt about being president . It had n't occurred to her to wonder before  --  she had been so sure he felt just as she did  --  but now she realized that not once , in all the months , had he ever said what he wanted . When she asked him , a little hesitantly , he did n't answer for a long time . Then he sighed . " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " I guess there must be something wrong with me . I never have known what I really wanted  --  I never can feel sure . . . " He was silent a moment , twisting his fingers . " It does n't matter much , I suppose . What 's going to happen will happen  --  whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I expect you 'll feel differently , once we 've heard the news . " Mary made an effort to speak cheerfully , but she was aware of a twinge of disappointment . While she dressed , Mary glanced out at the gray morning . The sky looked cold and disgruntled , and a sharp wind rattled the windows and made her shiver . It was like the morning of her wedding day had been . From across the hall , she could hear the boys arguing about something  --  Willie 's voice low and persistent , Taddie 's growing shrillp134and high , as it always did when he was on the verge of tears . Dear heaven , why did they have to start quarreling so early  --  and on this day of all days . When she went in , Willie was sitting cross-legged on the floor . " Taddie wo n't put on his clothes , mamma . He wo n't even start , and I 'm all dressed . He wo n't be ready in time to see Papa be president , will he , mamma ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed . " I want to put on my Sunday suit , " he said , his lip quivering . " And Willie wo n't let me . He says I ca n't put it on  --  but I want to for Papa to be prestendent . " " He 's silly , " Willie said flatly . " I le ca n't wear his Sundaysuit when it is n't Sunday , can he , mamma ? And anyway , he 's a cry-baby . " " I 'm not  --  " Taddie 's face darkened furiously as the tears started down his round cheeks . " I 'm not crying  --  are I , mamma ? " " Yes he is too . Look at him , mamma  --  " Mary bit her lip with sudden impatience . If only everythingneed n't put her so on edge . She pulled Willie to his feet and ordered him downstairs , then she took Tad into her lap and began to dress him , pulling on his clothes with angry jerks . Abashed by her set face , Taddie stopped crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his leg straight for her to draw on his stocking , she slapped him , and his lip began to tremble again . " Arc you cross because Papa is going to be prestendent , mamma ? " Mary stopped , the stocking half on , and drew himquickly toward her . " Oh , Taddie  --  I 'm sorry . I  --  didn'tmean to be cross , only I  --  I 'm tired this morning . " He smiled , instantly forgiving . " That 's all right . Itdid n't hurt anyway . " He glanced up again , artfully . " I can put on my Sunday suit , ca n't I , mamma ? " " Of course , dear  --  if you want to . "  |p135As  she got up to fetch it , Taddie beamed with satisfaction . " Willie will be mad , " he said complacently . At breakfast there was more trouble . Taddie , swollen with triumph , refused to touch his porridge , and when Mary ordered him to eat it or go back to bed , he shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he announced blandly . " I do n't have to do anything I do n't want to  --  because my papa is going to be prestendent . " With a defiant gesture , Taddie pushed the plate away , upsetting it on the tablecloth . A dribble of milk splashed down on the lap of his Sunday trousers . Willie was ecstatic . " Taddie 's spoiled his Sunday suit . Look , mamma  --  " Mary put down her napkin , but before she could move or speak , Mr. Lincoln , without a word , rose and carried Taddie upstairs . When he came down , his face was grave . " I 've put him to bed , mother . It 's where he belongs , poor little chap  --  he 's all worn out . " He sat down . " Please God , this will be over today , " he said , sighing , and we can settle down to being a regular family again . " Hearing Mr. Lincoln 's words , and the weariness in his voice , Mary felt a sharp pang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , she wondered . But the tide was running full  --  there was no looking back . It was too late .. . Down at the State House they had reserved a room for Mr. Lincoln , where the returns would be posted as they were telegraphed in . When he was ready to go , Mary went to the door with him , and they stood a minute in silence . Mr. Lincoln took his hat down from the peg . " I 'll be back as soon as I can , mother . " Mary nodded . " The returns ca n't be coming in much before evening , " she said . " I 'll send Willie down at noon with something hot for you to eat . " He waited a moment longer , looking at his hat.  | " Well  --  good-bye , Mary . " She stood at the door , watching him down the street . It was still early  --  no one much was out yet  --  and he walked alone , rapidly , in the sharp November wind . At noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unchastened by a morning in bed , was full of conversation . " Is n't Papa prestendent yet , mamma ? " Of course not yet , " Willie said . It takes a long time , does n't it , mother ? " Taddie shook his head , unconvinced . We have to go on the train tonight , " he insisted . " Miranda said we did . And Willie has to leave his turtle here  --  and his pussy . And this is how the train goes  --  wh00000 ... " Willie 's face puckered in quick distress . " I do n't . I do n't have to leave them . If I have to leave them , I wo n't go to Washington . I 'll stay here . . . " Mary 's head was aching . Her eyes burned  --  dear God , how long was it since she 'd slept a whole night through ? After lunch Willie went back to school , and Mary sent Taddie out to play while she went upstairs . Three o'clock  --  four . She lay down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she closed her eyes , the house seemed filled with a strange whispering . . . When would he come home ? When would he come ? When .. . It was dusk when Mary got up . She told Miranda to light the lamps , and went out to call Taddie just as Elizabethand Frances came up the front walk . They had come to ask if there was any news . After a while , when they were gone , Mary was alone . At eight o'clock she went up to put the boys to bed , and when she came down , a message was waiting from Mr. Lincoln . The early returns were showing him ahead  --  but it was still too early to tell . They ought to know for sure by midnight . The boy who had brought the message said , grinning , he guessed Mr. Lincoln was the calmest man in town . Everybody else had gone clean crazy.  |p137Mary  went into the sitting room and got out her basket of mending . But it lay in her lap , unopened , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was one o'clock when she heard footsteps outside , and she rose , stiffly , to go to the door . It must be another messenger  --  but no  --  there was a sound of voices , and singing . Then she heard Mr. Lincoln . All right , boys ; go home and get some rest now . " Mary opened the door , and he stepped inside . " ' Well , mother , " he said , " I 've been elected . " Mary looked at him . At his face , his hat , at his eyes , deep-set , remote , and strange . Suddenly , without will , she burst into tears , pressing her face against his coat , while she felt Mr. Lincoln pat her shoulder soothingly . His voice was patient , full of mild surprise , as he waited for her to stop . " But , mother , " he said , " I thought you wanted me to be president . " THE MORNING AFTER ELECTION MARY SLEPT LATE . SHE woke with a start , finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys ' room across the hall . Her first thought was of something wrong  --  then she remembered . Sinking back , she lay for a moment , hearing sounds from below , smelling coffee and bacon . There was a creaking on the stairs , and Taddie called her , but he was quickly hushed by Mr. Lincoln . " Sh-sh , Taddie  --  Mother 's sleeping . " A minute later Mary was up and dressing . There was so much to be done . So many plans  --  a letter to Robert  --  food to be ordered  --  things to be arranged.  |p138Downstairs  she found Mr. Lincoln and the boys in the dining room . Mr. Lincoln was opening a stack of mail , and as Mary took her place , he handed her a letter . Dear Mr. Lincoln , you have been elected . What are you going to do now ? Mary looked up to find Mr. Lincoln smiling at her ruefully . " I wish I knew , " he said . It was raining again , and after breakfast Taddie settled down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange quiet over the house  --  a sense of letdown that hung heavy . Instead of going to the office , Mr. Lincolnwent into the sitting room and stretched out on the couch . Coming in , dressed to go downtown , Mary found him asleep . She stood a moment , looking down at his face . Then she tucked an afghan over him and tiptoed out , pausing at the parlor door to warn Tad to be quiet and not disturb Papa . Taddie glanced up at her thoughtfully , one hand resting on his stomach . " I think , mamma , I ate too much porridge . I think I am going to be sick . " Mary felt his forehead . It was feverish . His face was white , his eyes ringed with shadows and too bright with excitement . " I think , " he said , more urgently , " I am going to be sick nowt " Mary put down her things , and took Taddie hastily upstairs . Leaving him safely in bed , some minutes later , she came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her head in her hands . She was full of rheumatism , Miranda said . And she felt as though she might be coming down with a cold . Mary sent her to her room to rest . Then she carried wood upstairs to make a fire in Taddie 's room , and went back to the kitchen to see what she could find for lunch . When a kettle of soup was on the stove , andp139the downstairs rooms were swept and dusted , Mary sat down at the desk , remembering the letter to Robert . He would have heard the election news of course , but he 'd be anxious for more details . And there was so much to tell . She drew a sheet of paper toward her . The only sound in the still house was the slash of rain against the windows and the rattling of the wind . There was no sound from Taddie 's room upstairs . Across the hall , Mr. Lincoln still slept . Mary shut her eyes for a moment , trying to ease the dull ache in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a sigh , and began to write . My dearest Robert , I fancy you can imagine , without my telling you , what excitement and rejoicing there is in the house this morning over the glorious news . If only you could be with us today , I believe your dear father 's happiness would be complete . But we shall be together again soon  --  in Washington  --  where I am sure so much that is new and wonderful awaits us all . Your father is too busy to write to you himself just now , but I need hardly say he sends you dearest love . The little boys are well , and quite bursting with pride and joy  --  as , indeed , are we all .. . Toward the end of November , Mr. Lincoln was to go to Chicago , where he would meet Mr. Hamlin , the vicepresident-elect . There was to be a reception in honor of Mr. Lincoln at the Tremont House , and Mary was going too . At the last moment , in spite of Elizabeth 's protest that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys with them . The evening before they left , when she and Mr. Lincoln went over to the Edwards house for supper , Elizabeth lost no time in telling Mr. Lincoln she had offered to take care of the boys while they were away . " I told Mary it was perfect nonsense to drag the chil- dren to Chicago . Goodness knows they 've had enough excitement and spoiling already  --  without traipsing them into trains and hotels and what not . But it seems Mary does n't trust me . " Mr. Lincoln looked up , obviously surprised . " I do n't see why that would n't be a good idea , mother . If Elizabeth is willing to keep them  --  " Mary bit her lip . She had n't the faintest intention of leaving Tad and Willie with Elizabeth  --  she could imagine well enough what Elizabeth would have to say on the subject of their behavior , with her notions of how children ought to conduct themselves . When Elizabeth had first suggested the plan , Mary had explained that Mr. Lincoln quite insisted on having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , she was trapped . " The plans have been made , Mr. Lincoln , " she said , sharply . " I should think you might have the kindness not to upset everything at the last moment . " Mr. Lincoln seemed puzzled . " I only thought it might make the trip easier for you , mother . " " So far as I know , I have n't made any complaint about its difficulty , Mr. Lincoln . Of course , if you do n't want your own sons with you  --  " Elizabeth broke in , smiling blandly . " It does n't make any difference , I suppose  --  so long as Mary is suited . I 'm sure she knows what 's best . Though I must say  --  I was only trying to help . " They were careful , for the rest of the meal , to talk of other things , but Mary sat silent , her checks flushed and hot . She knew they had thought her rude and unreasonable . She knew they were humoring her now  --  trying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfair of Elizabeth to trap her  --  unfair of Mr. Lincoln not to understand . She had been unfair to suggest that Mr. Lincoln did n't want to take the boys  --  when he was always so generouswith them , never grudging them time no matter how busy and tired he was . It was all unfair . Unfair . Unfair . . . pI41Next day on the train the boys behaved like angels . They looked very smart in their new worsted suits , with peaked caps and square-toed , buttoned black boots . They were enchanted with everything on the trip , most of all by the brass band that met them in the Chicago station , and the delegation of welcoming gentlemen who were decked out so splendidly in badges and cockades . Taddie 's hand tightened in Mary 's and he looked up at her to whisper . " Are they all generals , mamma ? " Smiling at Taddie , Mary thought suddenly she would n't have missed the boys ' pleasure in the trip for anything . A moment later , when Mr. Lincoln turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way he said , " These are my boys . " She smiled again , confidently . Elizabeth seemed a thousand miles away . The days in Chicago were a complete success . At the hotel , Mary engaged a woman to stay with the children while she and Mr. Lincoln had to be out , and it was obvious that Mrs. Porter , a plump , friendly creature , was pleased and flattered to be employed by the new president'sfamily . She treated Mr. Lincoln with beaming awe , and plainly regarded Mary as the most perfect of women . As for Tad and Willie , Mrs. Porter took them at once to her motherly heart , and told Mary again and again that they were the sweetest lambs and the best-behaved little gentlemen she had ever seen . Accustomed to the lean and frugal diet of Springfield , Mary relaxed gratefully under the steady stream of Mrs. Porter 's flattery . Indeed , everywhere in Chicago they seemed to meet with such kindness and approval that even Mr. Lincoln was impressed . " I guess they like us , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering surprise . On the night of the big reception , Mrs. Porter helped Mary dress . The new rose satin gown looked very well  --  and not the least bit homemade , which was a credit to the efforts of Mary and Cousin Lizzie . When Mr. Lincoln came in , dressed in his evening clothes , and Mary took his arm , Mrs. Porter stepped back and clasped her hands . Sure , she said , and they were a handsome couple . They were to enjoy themselves now , and never give a thought to the boys , who would be quite safe and sound , the lambs . Elizabeth seemed two thousand miles away . At the reception , surrounded by admiring and friendly guests , Mary realized that almost for the first time in her life she was being accepted at face value . These people thought her handsome and agreeable  --  and so she was . It was so easy , she thought , to be what was expected . It was all so very different from Springfield , where she felt tied by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old mistakes and trials and shortcomings could never quite be forgotten . They were always bobbing up  --  making it impossible to change without seeming to be affected or queer . But here there was no past  --  no one to remember anything . It was wonderful , really , how comforting strangerscould be . Surely , Mary thought , it would always be like this  --  once they were in Washington .. . The morning they left for home Mrs. Porter came to the station with them , and parted affectionately from the boys . " I 'll never forget you , " she said warmly , shaking hands with Mary and Mr. Lincoln , " nor all your kindness . God keep you both . " Seeing tears in Mrs. Porter 's eyes , Mary was strangely moved . She could n't remember when anyone had wept to see her leave . On the train Mr. Lincoln was busy conferring with several gentlemen traveling with the party . Coming back to find Mary looking out the window , he sat down facing her . " Well , mother , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well , did n't we ? " She looked up quickly.  | " I was just thinking , Mr. Lincoln  --  I wish we did n't have to go back to Springfield . Since we 've been away , everything has been so different  --  " She hesitated . It was difficult , trying to put the feeling into words . Her eyes searched Mr. Lincoln 's face  --  hoping for some sign of response . " If only we could just go on  --  as we are now  --  " Mr. Lincoln smiled kindly , a trifle absently . " Well , " he said , " I guess it does seem kind of humdrum going back to housekeeping after all the fuss and feathers we 've had . But you 'll feel better  --  once you 're back home with Elizabeth and the others . " TWO WEEKS BEFORE CHRISTMAS MARY DECIDED SUDDENLYto make a trip to New York . There were a great many things she must buy before she would be ready for Washington . Clothes for herself and the boys  --  and new decorationsto be ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would give her a chance to go up to Cambridge and visit Robert . He was n't planning to make the long trip back to Springfield for the holidays  --  and he would need cheering up before his first Christmas away from home . Cousin Lizzie , hastily consulted , agreed to come and stay with the boys while Mary was gone . Mr. Lincoln and Cousin Lizzie both felt Mary ought to have company on the trip . Why not ask Elizabeth or Ann to go along ? But Mary insisted she preferred to be alone  --  and once she was in New York , she was glad of her decision . New York was like Chicago  --  only more exciting  --  and having Ann or Elizabeth there would only have spoiled everything . She could imagine , for instance , what they would have said to the columns of flattering comment about thep144new First Lady that appeared in the newspapers . Shops and hotels vied with each other for the privilege of her presence . At first a little hesitant and uncertain about appearing alone , Mary found herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely to be deferred to  --  to find herself recognizedand catered to wherever she went . And everywhere she was agreeably conscious of making a good impression . People were curious about her  --  and she took their curiosityfor kindness and hugged it gratefuly . They were eager for her trade , and she saw friendliness in their eagerness , and accepted it with warmth . After the first day or two , she went everywhere with assurance and a new sense of graciousness and ease . She read about herself in the society reports , saw herself described as handsome and stylish , witty and poised  --  and though she smiled over an occasional florid paragraph , she took the praise to her heart . True  --  she spent a good deal more money than she intended . By the time she took the train to Boston for a few days ' visit with Robert , she had quite lost track of her accounts . But surely it could n't have been an unreasonableamount , she reflected comfortably , since the people in the shops had seemed to expect it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the matter of credit . There was surely no need to worry . Nothing , they had assured her , need be paid for until it was quite convenient . Indeed , they had often seemed so reluctant to discuss prices at all that it seemed almost as though they were making her gifts of the things she selected . Sitting back in the train , Mary drew on her black glace gloves . It was a good hour before they were due in Boston , but she was ready to step off the train , comfortably assuredof her elegant appearance in the new traveling suit of gray velours from Stewart 's , and the stylish bonnet the clerk had exclaimed over so admiringly in the shop where she selected it . Robert would be pleased , she thought , to see her looking so smart.  |p145She  smoothed the fingers of the gloves , thinking with pleasure of the many more pairs , just like them , in her trunk . She had felt a little guilty , buying so many  --  especiallyall the white ones for evening . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that six dozen pairs was not a whit more than she would need . Miss Harriet Lane , who had been the White House hostess for her uncle , President Buchanan , thought nothing of ordering her gloves by the dozen dozen , the girl had told Mary . A single evening of handshaking at a receptionwould wear out two or three pairs , Miss Lane said . At five dollars a pair , Mary thought this sounded a trifle staggering  --  but she could hardly doubt the clerk 's word . The girl had said such very flattering things about Mary 's hands . Not much like Miss Lane 's hands , she confided . Miss Lane was a handsome woman  --  but the look of her hands , if Mrs. Lincoln took her meaning , was better suited to hoeing potatoes than wearing a dainty white kid . Mrs. Lincoln now , took a whole two sizes smaller  --  and just see how pretty they looked . To fit a hand like that was a pleasure and a satisfaction . Mary smiled , remembering the girl  --  and all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House , where she had stayed , it had been the same way . Mrs. Lincoln was to have the finest suite of rooms  --  the choice table in the dining room . And at Stewart and Company , Mr. Stewart himself had given orders that the entire store was at Mrs. Lincoln 's disposal . " Mr. Stewart says this lace is not to be shown to anyone until Mrs. Lincoln decides whether she will choose it for her inaugural gown . . " " Mr. Stewart wanted most particularly for you to see this sable cape , Mrs. Lincoln . . . " " Here is a frock I should hesitate to show to most ladies . It 's the very latest fashion  --  direct from Paris  --  but it takes a figure of your distinction to carry it off . " " Miss Nelson , do come and see how this bonnet suits Mrs. Lincoln . She 's ordering two in Paisley colors , and one in blue , trimmed with velvet bands . . . " Mary sighed , still smiling . Then there had been Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's shop who had had such excellent ideas about the new furnishings that would be necessary in the White House . Mr. Montrose talked a great deal , very rapidly , with a good many gestures . He assured Mary that he knew the White House intimately , and that it was , confidentially in a most shocking state of disrepair . Too many administrations had come and gone , leaving remnants of barbaric taste behind them  --  and Mrs. Lincoln would truly be doing a service to the nation in renovating the public rooms . Put that way , Mary could hardly fail to listen . It was really wonderful the way Mr. Montrose 's selections seemed to coincide with her own . Time and again , while they talked of repainting , upholstering and color schemes , some idea of Mary 's would strike a kindred response in Mr. Montrose , and he would groan with pleasure over the prospect of a First Lady with truly distinguished taste . Togetherthey fingered brocades and tapestries , and studied the effects of carpets and draperies . Whenever the subject of price was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mr. Montrose , was scarcely the object when it came to decorating the President 's house . Indeed , any reference to the matter of money seemed to offend his artistic sense . He would grow vague and frown slightly , as though in obscure pain , and speak of " all that being taken care of in due time . " Rather , Mary thought , as if at the proper moment a miracle would occur and the necessaryfunds would come down on a beam from heaven  --  and as if Mr. Montrose felt it indelicate to anticipate the miracle by speaking of it beforehand . Best of all the new things she and Mr. Montrose had decided on , Mary loved the crimson draperies they had chosen for the East Room . The very feel of the material was rich and luscious , like the color . She remembered howp147Mr . Montrose had described the room to her . White and gold and crimson  --  with crystal chandeliers . Even now , on the train , she could close her eyes and see the picture . Herself in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Candlelight and music , and the murmur of voices . " Mrs. Lincoln , I have the honor to present . . . " The train jerked , drawing into the station . A kerosene lamp was lit in the coach now  --  and by its light Mary could see her reflection in the dark window . She set her bonnet straight , and drew the new sable cape about her shoulders . She had worn the cape especially to surprise Robert . And besides  --  he might have some of his friends with him to meet her .. Mary saw Robert at once , standing alone a little back from the crowd around the train . She saw him catch sight of her  --  saw his glance , sober and reserved , taking in her new costume as he came forward , hat in hand . " Well , mother  --  " He stooped , with a grave smile , to kiss her cheek . It was always a surprise to find how serious Robert looked . Mary let him guide her through the crowd , finding her luggage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brows as she pointed to the pile of bags and cases . " All these , mother ? " " Why , yes  --  " She added rather hurriedly that the trunks had been sent directly on to Springfield  --  so at least they had n't those to bother with . Robert said nothing . On the way to the carriage , he explained that he had engaged a hotel room for her . " I 'm not sure you 'll find it big enough though  --  " His eye was on the porters who struggled under the mounds of baggage . His hand was on her arm , urging her along through the station at such a pace that Mary drew back a little , laughing . " Do wait a moment , dear  --  I 've hardly had time to look at you . Must you rush me so ? "  | He paused dutifully . But there was a strained , embarrassedlook about his mouth . " Yes , of course , mother  --  but do n't you think we 'd better  --  " She saw then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and pointed her out . And people in the station were turning to stare . Mary smiled back at them unperturbed , but Robert kept his head lowered , and he was frowning . Mary lowered her voice kindly . " You must n't mind , dear , if people seem to be curious . They 're bound to be  --  but it 's only because they 're friendly and interested . Oh , Robert , there 's so much to tell you . Father sent his love of course , and he 's very well . The boys are well too  --  though Willie had a cold when I left . But Cousin Lizzie writes that he 's quite over it now  --  " She stopped suddenly , aware that Robert was hardly listening . But that was only natural . The dear boy was n't accustomedyet to being stared at . Once they were alone , it would be easier . But in the carriage , Robert sat stiff and straight at her side . It was almost like having a stranger with her , Mary thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York . Mary heard herself replying quite formally . Then there was a moment 's silence  --  awkward and self-conscious . " I-iow are your studies , dear ? " " Well enough , thanks . " Another silence . Mary turned to look out the window  --  at the glimmer of twilight in the winter streets . Boston looked so cramped and crooked after the broad avenues of New York , she thought . Turning to mention this , she caught Robert 's glance resting on her cape . He looked quickly away , but she touched the fur apologetically . " I expect you think I 'm rather grandly gotten up for traveling , Robert  --  but I did n't know  --  I thought perhaps we might be dining with some of your friends  --  " No , Robert said quickly , he had n't planned anythingp149special for the evening . He 'd rather expected she might be tired . " I thought just a quiet dinner at the hotel  --  in your room  --  " Well , of course , Mary said quickly , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  though she did n't feel at all tired actually . At the hotel there was a great deal of confusion . The management had , it seemed , thought best to put Mrs. Lincolnin a somewhat larger suite than had been engaged . It seemed more suitable . It was Mrs. Lincoln this and Mrs. Lincoln that  --  quite the sort of attention Mary had found so delightful in New York . But here she hurried through the formalities as rapidly as possible , with one eye anxiously on Robert all the while . Settled at last , and the door closed behind the last lingering attendant , Mary breathed a sigh of relief . " Now we can have some peace , " she said , and really talk . " But somehow , in the dark and formal sitting room with its massive furniture and hangings of a dark and bilious green , the things she had planned to tell Robert seemed trivial and foolish . It was a relief , on the whole , to have Robert ring for the porter and ask for a fire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner . The next afternoon , when Robert came to take her driving after his classes , Mary felt the odd discomfort in him again . Just as they were stepping into the carriage , a woman in a bedraggled cloak and outlandish hat , rushed up suddenly and seized Mary 's hand . She wanted , the woman said , to wish God 's blessing on Mr. Lincoln  --  a noble man if ever there lived one . Mary shook the woman 's hand kindly , smiling after her as she bobbed a curtsy and hobbled away down the street , but Robert 's face was flushed as he climbed into the carriage after Mary . " How on earth do you stand things like that , mother ? " " Like what , dear ? " Mary was tucking the robe over her knees . " Oh  --  you mean that woman just now ? She meantpI50no harm , poor old soul  --  there was nothing I could do but be polite  --  " " But it makes such an absurd show of you . " Robert frowned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queen or something . I ca n't see how you endure such fussing  --  but you seem to , well  --  almost enjoy it . " Mary was silent for a moment . " The fussing , as you call it , Robert , is n't for me , " she said . " It 's for your father . I think you must realize that . " When Robert made no reply , Mary tried again , more gently . It had never done to be sharp with Robert . He was so unlike the other boys , who might be abashed for a few minutes and then , judging by the severity of her scolding , either went on as before or else tried to win her back with penitent sweetness . With Robert , she knew , the least hint of criticism was enough to send him into one of his queer stubborn silences . " I know it seems odd to you , dear , to have strangers speak so . But you must get used to it . We all must . After all , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am  --  " " Well , naturally  --  " Robert shifted uneasily . " But that 's hardly the point . I do n't see why just because Father is going to be president it needs to change everything . Even you , mother  --  you do n't seem the same . Your clothes  --  and the way you fix your hair . And you always seem to be watching people , as though you were waiting for them to recognize you . " For one blank instant Mary struggled with the angry hurt that rose in her . It was intolerable , suddenly impossible , to feel her child grown up like this . Standing off from her , completely apart , judging her . It did n't matter that Robert was n't pleased with her appearance . That he disapproved of the clothes she had thought he would admire . It did n't matter that he should seem more embarrassed and unhappy than pleased by his father 's success . It only matteredthat he should n't escape her so entirely . She must reach him some way  --  bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand out , touching his sleeve.  | " Please , Robert , you must n't feel so . It 's not true . I have n't changed . I  --  " The next moment she breathed more easily . Robert was looking down at her hand , and the little-boy expression had come back into his face . " Well  --  I 'm sorry  --  " His voice was shamefaced , reluctant . " I did n't mean anything , I guess . " " Of course not , dear . " Mary drew her hand away quickly . She remembered how Robert had always hated to be touched . After that , things were quite easy . But when Mary asked whether he would care to ask one or two of his classmates to dinner with them , Robert was evasive . It was a bad time , he said . With midterms coming on next week all the boys were up to their ears studying . " And besides , mother  --  there 's no use parading . " Mary drew back , bewildered . " I should hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet your mother . " " But you do n't understand . " Robert shook his head patiently . " They 'd all think they had to be polite  --  about Father , I mean . " " And why should n't they be ? " " Well , it 's just that I ca n't help knowing how they really feel  --  most of them anyway . You think just because people stare at you they 're friendly  --  but Boston is n't like New York  --  or the West , where they really know Father . People here think he 's nothing but a backwoodsman . One of the Boston papers called us a family of clodhoppers  --  " " Yes , " Mary said , " I saw that article . It said we 'd track mud into the White House and keep pigs on the front lawn  --  did n't it ? " Robert was silent . Mary sighed . It was n't that she blamed Robert exactly . Somewhere , dimly , she had a troubled sense that Robert might be feeling a little as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert might have been unhappy at home , but now she wondered whether he too had been glad to escape from Springfield  --  from the people who 2 had known him too well , who had pigeonholed him , cataloguedhim  --  decided about him far too long ago ever to allow for the possibility of surprise . . . Mary drew herself up sharply . It was absurd to suppose that a child should think such things . And Robert was only a child , after all , for all his grown-up ways . She smiled forgivingly . " I know it hurts you , dear , seeing such things written about your own family . But we have n't long to wait now , until your father is in office  --  and then , I 'm sure , all this stupid criticism will be forgotten . " On the train going home , Mary fell into conversation with a woman who was on her way to visit her married son in Chicago , and they passed a number of pleasant hours discussing their children . Before long Mary found herself confiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York , and the new clothes she had ordered  --  and the little chambermaid in the hotel who had wept with pleasureover the box of handkerchiefs Mary had given her when she left . She even described the crimson curtains she and Mr. Montrose planned for the White I-louse . The woman listened sympathetically to everything . " I can imagine how delighted your son must have been to have you visit him , " she said . The first year away from home is always so difficult  --  especially for a boy . " Mary agreed , smiling . She told how considerate Robert had been  --  how he had taken care of everything for her at the hotel , even to ordering their dinner . While they talked , and the miles between Boston and Chicago stretched out behind them , Mary found the little edges of disappointment in her visit fading . The strained moments , the awkward silences , and the hurt at Robert 's seeming disapproval were lost in a warm sense of her own good fortune in the eyes of this friendly stranger . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a trifle enviously  --  " fromall you 've told me , I should think you must be the happiest woman in the world . "  | 5 3Mary stroked the soft fur of the sable cape that lay across her knees . " Yes , " she said . " Yes  --  I suppose I am . " THE NEW YEAR , THAT DAWNED IN SPRINGFIELD ON A clear frosty night , brought little sign of hope for the country . The southern states were seceding one by one . And with each new secession the lines grew sharper about Mr  --  Lincoln 's mouth  --  and the troubled sadness deepened in his eyes . After the brief calm that had followed the election , the storm was rolling round again . Violence was open now  --  in both North and South  --  and between them , like a gaunt shadow of hope stood the man in Springfield . From everywhere came fresh demands that Mr. Lincoln do something . He must act , somehow , to save them from ruin . Promise the South security  --  promise to compromise  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks passed , and he did nothing . Watching him , from day to day , Mary began to wonder . She had long letters from her family . From Lexington , from her brothers in New Orleans , from her sister in Alabama , from Emilie Helm . From her uncles , cousins , friends . And in all the letters there was a new note of bitterness . The South had made up its mind . The South did not mean to give an inch  --  and it was time the North , and Mr. Lincoln , learned that . They were seizing arsenals all over the South , arming themselves  --  organizing to fight for their life as an independent nation . Mary showed the letters to Mr. Lincoln . Meanwhile , in Washington , old Buchanan waited . He was like a poultice , someone said , sitting on the festering head of rebellion . He was tired and confused  --  waitingpI54 to finish being president . Just as Mr. Lincoln waited in Springfield , through the cold weeks of January . And the North and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week after she came home from New York , Mary had been reading newspapers . She read dozens of them , sending Tad or Willie down to the office to get them from Billy Herndon . Newspapers from all over the country  --  Democratic , Republican , abolitionist , independent . Mary pored over them , pulling out her eyes over columns of close print , smudged with ink and filled with clamoring bitterness . Coming in one evening , Mr. Lincoln found Mary beside a cold fire in the sitting room . The boys were in bed , and Mary looked up from the strewn heap of papers scattered about her chair . Her eyes were strained and dull . " Well , mother  --  what news have you found today ? " Mary pushed the papers away with a sigh , and stood up . " The same as always , Mr. Lincoln . Nothing but hatred . Hatred and blame and bitterness . All of them saying you must choose a side  --  " She stood looking at him , her hands pressed together . " If only it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the words were forced out of her . " If only the fourth of March would come  --  " Every morning now the postman left a stack of letters at the Lincoln house . Letters with advice , questions , ugly threats . Letters demanding favors , asking for appointments , for offices , for money . Letters from friends  --  from enemies and from foolish , rambling crackpots . Every morning Mary read these and sorted them , slitting the envelopes , turning the pages feverishly , as though she must seek out each word of criticism , taste every bitter drop . Sometimes the howling tide seemed to rise about her , as though it would engulf the room where she sat  --  the desk  --  the very pen with which she labeled the sorted envelopes and laid them neatly to wait for Mr. Lincoln . These were the days when the fears began to come . Only occasionally at first  --  then more and more often . Gradually the trembling and the sudden flashes of panicp155disappeared  --  and fear moved in , familiarly , like an old friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary  --  dined with her , and went to market . Sat with her while she mended , and watched in the evenings while she read stories aloud to the boys . No longer a stranger , to make her start and turn pale , fear came and went at ease , followed her to bed , whispering troubled warnings in her sleep until it waked her with an icy finger to the stillness of the house , . A cry from Taddie 's room in the night  --  and Mary would find herself standing by the bed , cold and shaken , staring into the darkness with dread of she knew not what . A silent , nameless terror that held her fast , long after she had found the boys safely sleeping and had crept back , shivering and sleepless , to bed . The weeks of waiting dragged into February at last . They were to leave Springfield on the tenth , and Mary plunged with relief into packing and arranging  --  thankful for anything that kept her days busy and sent her to bed at night too tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon Willie came home from school to find his turtle dead . It lay in its box , a small , lifeless shell , and no amount of gentle prodding or coaxing would move it . Willie carried the box in and laid it on the table where Mary was sorting the contents of an old trunk brought down from the attic . His round blue eyes were full of tears . " He 's dead , mother , " Willie said . " I ca n't make him alive again this time . " Mary stared at the turtle a moment , then she sank down and drew Willie into her lap . Holding him there , her cheek against his , she wept over the dead turtle . All the strain , the long locked hours of fear seemed to burst her heart while she clung to Willie , rocking back and forth , shaken by helpless , choking sobs . When Mr. Lincoln came in , Mary pointed to the turtle.  | " Death is all around us , Mr. Lincoln , " she said brokenly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took Willie upstairs to bed , sitting beside him in the dark until he fell asleep . When he came down , Mary was quiet . The storm ofweeping had passed , and she sat still , her hands in her lap . " Mr. Lincoln  --  " He turned , and in the lamplight Mary saw the look in his eyes , drawn away , guarded . " Mr. Lincoln  --  what are you going to do ? " He shook his head . " I do n't know . . . " Mary bent toward him . " But you must , Mr. Lincoln . You must know . The whole country is waiting for you to decide  --  to speak . " She paused . There was no answer . Mr. Lincoln sat motionless , his eyes half closed . Mary stood up . She felt her knees uncertain beneath her . Dear God  --  what made him act this way  --  as though he was paralyzed , unable to speak ? He had spoken often enough in the past . He had spoken for the Union  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him now at the moment when everything depended on his words ? Why must he talk  --  when he talked at all  --  of being patient , of seeing the justice of both sides , of letting events take their course ? Mary looked at him helplessly , powerless to guess what thoughts lay back of that veiled , impenetrablegaze . She turned to a fresh batch of newspapers that lay on the table . " If you wo n't listen to me , Mr. Lincoln , at least you must hear these . Listen to what even your friends are beginning to say  --  " She turned the papers , hunting for the places she had marked , but when she thrust them at him , Mr. Lincoln put his arm up suddenly , covering his eyes . " Not now , Mary . For God 's sake  --  let me rest . " Mary drew back . The papers fell from her hands , and for a moment she stood stunned , as though the utter weariness in his voice had been a blow . Slowly she stoopedp157to gather up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she took the box with Willie 's turtle , and started for the kitchen . Waiting for the coffee to boil for Mr. Lincoln 's supper , Mary glanced again at the turtle . Strange  --  that such a little thing could have made her weep . Willie had felt badly , of course  --  but it was n't for Willie she had wept . She had forgotten now why it was .. . While Mr. Lincoln had his supper , Mary took out her sewing . She tried to think of things to talk about that would sound cheerful . Robert 's last letter  --  and the news that Emilie and Ben Helm were expecting a baby . Mrs. Reuther 's husband , who lived at the end of the block and had been so ill with lung fever , was getting better she had heard . Mr. Lincoln listened , answering now and then . But the deep melancholy did not leave his eyes , and when he went to lock up for the night , he stopped by Mary 's chair and touched her shoulder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , " he said . She reached up and took his hand , resting it against her cheek . He seemed so lonely standing there . " I 'm sure it will , Mr. Lincoln . " She felt his hand , motionlessand heavy . Suddenly the brightness went out of her voice . " Only  --  I did n't know it would be like this , " she said . " I did n't know  --  " For three days they had a bonfire in the side yard , and burned up the accumulation of old papers , letters , broken furniture and worn-out toys that the attic had brought forth . Mary watched the strange collection disappear in the flames . The little yellow sled Robert had learned to coast on , the winter when he ran into a tree and cut his forehead . A tuft of faded strawflowers that had stood on the mantel in the parlor when the house was new . A velvet bonnet , dusty and streaked , that Mary had always meant ,  | each winter , to have recovered , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , broken-backed grammar text that Mr. Lincoln had carried in his suitcase when he rode the circuit  --  and the saber belt he had brought home from the Black Hawk War  --  long before Mary had even known him . . . A rusty black umbrella , and a gray wool shawl the moths had got into .. . Tad and Willie stood by watching too  --  alternately fascinatedseeing the odd fragments smolder and wither in the crackling blaze and dismayed to see the last remnants of their once treasured playthings go onto the heap . The morning his red express wagon was brought out to be burned , Taddie wept so loudly that Mr. Lincoln rescued it , and promised it could go to Washington . But when Mary sent him to the woodshed to nail up the crates and boxes already packed and ready to go , Mr. Lincoln looked at the piled-up collection doubtfully . " Maybe we should n't take so many trappings , mother . They might not ask us to stay . " As fast as the old things were sorted and cleared out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail brought its quota of gifts . Peculiar parcels of ungainly shapes and sizes were stacked in the front hall . Unpacked , these disgorgeda weird assortment of articles without which , apparently , Mr. Lincoln 's admirers were convinced he could not assume office . Hats of every size and pattern to fit the presidential head . An Indian chief 's war bonnet , and a ceremonial squaw robe for Mary , complete with beaded moccasins to match . Western boots , elaborately tooled and studded with silver . A Pennsylvania spinster sent a china cake plate she had decorated for the White House pantry . There was a gaudy assortment of sofa cushions , some with embroidered mottoes : " God Bless our Noble President " or , less formally , " Hurrah for Old Abe . " Handkerchiefs , jewelry , pipes , segars  --  and a hundred copies of a pamphlet published by an antitobacco crusader . There were neckties , shaving mugs , fancy waistcoats of every known material , Bibles  --  and always more hats.  |p159Mary  was in despair , and the boys pounced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing else comes of all this , " Mr. Lincoln said , " we 'll at least have some new clothes out of it , mother . " One morning a crate was brought to the door with a pair of gray doves , huddled sadly in the corner . These were fallen upon at once by Willie , who revived them tenderly , and immediately inquired of his father whether he might take them to Washington . Mr. Lincoln glanced over the top of his book . There was no reason , he supposed absently , why not . Emboldened by success , Willie seized the moment to bring up the subject of Pussy . If Papa did n't mind the doves  --  could they also take Pussy with them when they went ? Mr. Lincoln was doubtful . He was n't just sure what Mamma would think of that . " She 's planning on having things kind of fancy when we get to Washington , " Mr. Lincoln said . " I do n't know as she 'll want a lot of animals mussing the place up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muss anything . She was ever so good and quiet  --  and Willie could keep her just in his own room , could n't he ? And maybe let her out the kitchen door to play ? " Please say I can , papa . " Willie hung on his father 's chair . " Please say so . " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " Well , as far as I 'm concerned , Willie , I do n't see any great objection . But you 'll have to ask Mamma . She 's the boss . " A few minutes later , Mr. Lincoln looked up from his book again . Mary , her sleeves rolled up to the elbow , her hands floury from the pastry board , stood in the doorway . " Mr. Lincoln  --  " Mr. Lincoln looked down quickly , engrossed in his reading . " Mr. Lincoln , what 's this about your giving Williep16o permission to take that cat to Washington ? He says you promised him  --  " " Now , mother , I did no such thing . I told Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pray , should he ask me ? " " Well , I did n't know how you 'd feel about it . " Mary set her lips angrily . " You know perfectly well how I feel about it . Of all the absurd notions  --  to traipse into the White House with a cat that 's about to have kittens  --  " " Is she , mother ? 1 had n't noticed . " " Yes , Mr. Lincoln , she is . And what 's more , you need n't pretend to be so innocent about it . You have eyes in your head , I hope . And besides , Willie has talked of nothing else for the past three weeks . " " Well , I suppose I must have forgotten . And anyway  --  all I said was , it did n't make any particular difference to me . " " But you said I could , papa  --  you promised  --  " Mary glanced at Willie , hopping on one foot in an agony of uncertainty . She saw the tears gathering in his blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I ca n't understand you . How you could deliberately raise the child 's hopes  --  when you knew all along it was absolutely out of the questionto let him take the cat . I do n't see  --  " At these ominous words , Willie 's tears spilled over and he set up a howl that quite drowned out the sound of knocking at the front door . A moment later Miranda appeared , ushering in three frock-coated gentlemen who had arrived to pay their respects to the future president just in time to see Mary march past them , her sleeves rolled up , her eyes blazing , towing Willie , kicking and protesting , behind her . Upstairs , while she tried vainly to silence Willie , Mary kept one car cocked for the sound of voices below . Dear heaven  --  they 'd surely think she was murdering the child to hear him scream so . And nothing she could say  --  no promises of a new pet in Washington , or the good homep1.61Pussy would have at Cousin Lizzie 's house  --  would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Willie insisted loudly . He wanted Pussy . And Pussy did n't want a nice home with Cousin Lizzie  --  Pussy wanted to stay with him . And Papa had said  --  he had promised . , Mary saw the resentment in Willie 's eyes . She was the one Willie would blame for losing Pussy  --  and it was n't fair . It was n't fair that she should forever take the blame  --  simply because Mr. Lincoln could never bear to say no . Willie looked up , still unconsoled , his lower lip pushed out accusingly . " Papa said I could take Pussy , " he repeated sadly , " and Papa is going to be the president . I thought presidents could do anything they wanted to . " Mary was silent for a moment , feeling curiously helpless . " I used to think that too , Willie , " she said , in a different voice , " but  --  I was wrong . " THE LAST WEEK IN SPRINGFIELD MOVED TOO SWIFTLYwith too many things to be done , to leave room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could leave the future to a hazy , nebulous vista of receptions , servants , clothes , and a carriage of her own . And visions of endless , delightfulconferences over the White House furnishings with Mr. Montrose , who would come down especially from New York . And crimson draperies , against the white and gold and crystal of the East Room . . . Each morning Mary made new lists and memorandums to be checked off . She arranged with Elizabeth and Francesp162and Ann for them and their husbands to come to Washingtonfor the inaugural . She found time for long letters to her family , filled with rashly generous promises of futurefavors and appointments for themselves and their friends , as soon as Mr. Lincoln should be in office . To Ninian Edwards , Mr. Lincoln commented privately that if Mary and her sisters had their way , the new administrationwas likely to go down in history as the reign of the Todds . " The only thing that kind of worries me , " he said , " is whether I can manage to scare up enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was no occasion for worry , he said . If there were n't enough towns , Mary and Elizabeth would see to it that a few new ones were created . Mr. Artemus Ward came to call , on one of the last days in Springfield , with an eye to writing one of his humorous pieces about the new president . He was at some pains , Mr. Ward reported later in print , to obtain entrance to Mr. Lincoln 's presence , so filled was the house by various and sundry gentlemen all of whom had come to express their lifelong devotion to the new leader  --  and at the same time make perfectly sure that Mr. Lincoln would not overlook the matter of providing each of them with an appointment , with " magnifisint and sootable emmolimint . " One of these well-wishers appeared to have about seven inches of corn whisky in him , and approached Mr. Lincoln with " tears of riverince in hiz eyes  --  addressing him as the Pra-hayrie Flower of the West , reeling slightly . " " ' I f they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd hardly be likely to scalp you , Mr. Linkun , ' " Mr. Ward said . " ' But of you do the fair thing by your country you 'll make as purty a angel as any of us . ' . . . He shook me cordynlly by the hand , and we exchanged picturs , so we could gaze upon each other 's liniments when far away from one another  --  he at the helium of the Ship of State , and I at the helium of the nonsinse byzniss ... "  |p163Robert  came home from Cambridge to make the trip to Washington , and the two days he was in Springfield , he spent at the Edwards house . " Poor boy , " Elizabeth said , " I daresay he feels quite lost , coming home to such confusion . At the first meal he took with us , he said he was relieved to find that some of his family could still sit down to a meal without being interrupted . " At the last moment Cousin Lizzie had been invited to join the party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gratitude and delight . " You might think Lizzie had been given a ticket straight to heaven , " Ann said . " Personally , I 'm willing enough to go  --  for Mary 's sake . But between us , I 'll be thankful when all this fuss is over , and we can settle down again . " Ann was exceedingly generous , however , in lending her advice . She and Elizabeth were filled with suggestions concerningplans for the trip , all of which they offered freely to Mary . Listening to the talk of clothes , receptions , stopovers , and general arrangements , Mr. Lincoln shook his head in wonder . " I wish I had half as many ideas what to do when I get to Washington as you seem to have , mother , " he said . " From the sound of it , folks 'll probably think we 're a traveling circus coming to town . " Mary smiled indulgently . " Someone has to make plans , " she said . " I daresay if it were left to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean shirt and a change of underwear and go . " The night before they closed the house , the Lincoln held a farewell reception . Seven o'clock to midnight  --  and the whole town invited . Mary wore one of the gowns she had ordered in New York . White moire , with a low round neckline that showed off her new pearl necklace , and white flowers in her hair . It was a pity , in a way , to put on one of the new frocks before she even left home  --  but then , as Cousin Lizzie said , Springfield ought to have one chance to see Mary as she would look in Washington . " There are times , I 'll own , when I have to admire Mary , " Elizabeth said to Frances that night . She glanced toward the parlor door , where Mary stood beside Mr. Lincoln , receiving the guests . " I know for a fact she 's been up since before six this morning , working like an Indian ever since  --  and yet to look at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day but dress for the party . " Frances nodded , without enthusiasm . For her own part , she was exhausted , though it was barely eight o'clock and the real crowd had just begun to arrive . From the look of things , Frances reflected , shifting her weight to ease the pinch of her new satin slippers , half of Springfield had already come , not to mention innumerable strange creatures who had popped up from nowhere  --  all parched with thirst and famished , to judge from their frantic onslaughtsat the refreshment table . " Beg pardon , ma'am  --  " Frances turned to make way for a stout gentleman who was attempting to squeeze his way past her out of the dining room . At the crucial moment someone jogged his elbow , and a trickle of punch splashed onto Frances ' sleeve . The stranger whipped out a grimy handkerchief and mopped energetically at the stain . " I did n't aim to do that , ma'am  --  " The man 's face , looking quite throttled by his collar , flushed several shades deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Old Abe in there , when the feller pushed me  --  " Still muttering apologies , the stout gentleman lumbered off , and Frances looked ruefully at her sleeve . " Impossible creature , " Elizabeth said indignantly . " Where in the name of mercy do you suppose Mr. Lincoln picked him up ? Sometimes , really , I 'm just as thankful Ninian was n't a success at politics  --  when I see the sort of thing Mary has to put up with . On my word , though , I believe Mary actually enjoys it . " " Well , after all  --  she could hardly complain , could she ? "  |p165Frances  smiled thinly . " When she was the one who nagged Mr. Lincoln into this whole thing . Though if you ask me , I should certainly hate to see my husband in Mr. Lincoln 's position . Mr. Smith says he 's heard there are people all over the country who are so opposed to Mr. Lincoln being president that they 've even signed papers taking an oath to keep him from reaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think Mary might be worried  --  but when I tried to tell her what Mr. Smith said , she was furious . She said it was only stupid jealousy that made people listen to such rumors and repeat them . You might suppose I was the one that threatened him . " Elizabeth shook her head . " Poor Mary  --  I do n't suppose she 'll ever get over thinking we 're all consumed with envy of her precious Mr. Lincoln . All the same , though , I expect we ought n't to be too hard on her . I daresay she 'll find out soon enough her bed is n't all roses . " The next morning they closed the house , and took their luggage to the Chenery House , where they would sleep the last night , before taking the train . Mary and Mr. Lincolnwent to the Simeon Francis ' for supper , and walking back to the hotel afterward , they passed the corner of Eighth and Jackson . Mary looked across at the house . She could n't remember ever having seen it completely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared forlornly into the night , and under the big elm in the side yard she could see the last remnants of their bonfire . She stood still a minute , her hand on Mr. Lincoln 's arm . " It 's strange , " Mary said . " I thought I 'd be glad when this moment came . There is n't anything in Springfield I really mind leaving behind  --  and yet , right now , I almost feel as though I could n't go at all . " " I know , mother  --  " Mr. Lincoln spoke slowly , his voice sounding hollow in the raw night wind . " We 've had some bad times in that house . More bad than good , I guess . But it seems as if even the troubles got to be old friends . "  | They stood a little longer . Then , not speaking again , they walked on together down the dark and empty street . ON THE SECOND NIGHT OF THE JOURNEY , AFTER A STOPoverfor a reception in Cincinnati , the Lincoln party came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least , the trip had gone smoothly . There were stops every few hours  --  for Mr. Lincoln to greet the crowds that gathered in the stations . Standing beside him , with Tad and Willie , Mary watched the faces turned up toward them . They were friendly for the most part , eager and ready to cheer the new president . " Stick by the Constitution , Abe  --  and we 'll stick by you. , , The Cincinnati reception had been huge and confusing , but a distinct success , as even Elizabeth admitted . There had been toasts for Mr. Lincoln and a huge armful of red roses for Mary . Halfway through the evening , Mary suddenlyremembered the date  --  and she lifted her glass , smiling at Mr. Lincoln . " We must drink to Mr. Lincoln 's birthday , " Mary said , " and many more to come . " The guests were charmed . Through the applause and cheers , Mary saw Mr. Lincoln 's eyes light up as he looked at her . he seemed more nearly happy , she thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , meeting his smile , Mary felt her heart lift . The wings of uncertainty , hovering and dark , were gone . The tide was running full . Back on the train , the gaiety of the party held . In the special parlor car , the ladies laid off their wraps and gathered about the stove to warm their hands . Cousin Lizzie took the roses Mary handed her.  | " They 're so beautiful . It 's a pity we have no vase to put them in  --  " Lizzie glanced about for a place to lay them . " Mr. Lamon , would you move that bag from the vacant chair there ? " Mr. Lamon had come along from Springfield as bodyguardfor Mr. Lincoln . It seemed kind of a foolish notion , Mr. Lincoln said , but so long as everyone was kicking up such a fuss over his having a guard  --  he reckoned Ward Lamon better be it , since he was the only man anybody could think of who was taller than Mr. Lincoln . Mr. Lamon picked up the bag Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who it might belong to . " Why , I do n't know  --  " Cousin Lizzie was busy proppingup the roses . " Someone just left it there , I expect . There  --  " She straightened up . " Do n't they look lovely , Mr. Lamon ? " She turned , beaming , but Mr. Lamon made no reply . He was still holding the small , neatly strapped carpetbag , frowning slightly . Rather gingerly , he shook it . Somethingrattled . Mr. Lamon unfastened the straps , peered inside , and then , without so much as a glance at Lizzie , he marched rapidly to the end of the car and disappeared onto the open observation platform outside . It was very odd , Lizzie thought , looking after him vaguely . Not to have answered her at all  --  and Mr. Lamon was ordinarily so polite . A few minutes later Lizzie saw Mr. Lamon step inside again , and draw Mr. Lincoln aside , saying something in his ear . Mr. Lincoln had been in the middle of telling a story that was amusing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face , as he heard what Mr. Lamon said . He stood quiet a minute , then he nodded once , gravely . The ladies were all looking at Mr. Lincoln , waiting for him to finish the story . Suddenly Mary stood up . " What is it , Mr. Lamon ? " Mary 's voice rose sharply above the rumble of the moving train . The color was gone from her cheeks , and her eyes , wide and strained , were on Mr. Lamon 's face . " You said something to Mr. Lincoln just now . Tell me what it was , Mr. Lamon  --  I insist  --  " Lizzie heard Mr. Lincoln answering , trying to soothe Mary . " Now , mother , there 's no use getting all upset . It 's nothing at all  --  " All at once everyone was talking , and out of the babble , Lizzie caught the word bomb . There was a muffled scream from one of the ladies . No , no  --  it was n't a bomb at all . A grenade . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car while they were all at the reception and left it on a chair . In a carpetbag . The fuse had been lighted , Mr. Lamon said . In another fifteen minutes . . . It was too horrible to think of . . . If Mr. Lamon had n't discovered it in time . . Rather oddly , it was Mary who seemed the most composed of anyone . After the first moment of shock , she went back to her chair . " I think , " she said , " we 'd better not talk about this any more . After all , the danger is past  --  there 's no use worrying over what might have happened . Supposewe order in some hot coffee ... " Truly , Lizzie thought , feeling her knees go limp , Cousin Mary was wonderful . They all said so , even Ann . Only Mr. Lincoln , staring thoughtfully at the blazing fire through the chinks in the stove door , said nothing . There were more stopovers , more welcoming committees , more speeches and dinners and receptions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where Mr. Lincoln addresseda huge crowd in the Municipal Hall . More bunting , more flags and cheers . More flowers for Mary . After the one incident of the grenade , there were no further alarms , no threats or signs of anything but good will . Mary felt easier again , reassured by the friendly enthusiasmthey met everywhere . Perhaps , after all , there had n't been any real danger that night in Cincinnati . Mr. Lamon might have been mistaken . . .  |p169The  evening before they reached New York , Mary left the others and went into the sleeping car where the boys had been put to bed . They had stood the long trip remarkablywell , but at supper she noticed Willie had n't eaten much . He 'd stared out the train window , hardly seeming to listen , while Mr. Lincoln told a story about a kitten that could n't go out in the rain because it was made of striped peppermint candy , that had sent Taddie into fits of amusement . Moving cautiously toward the darkened end of the sleeping car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sick . She glanced at Taddie , sprawled in the berth spreadeaglefashion , already sleeping soundly . Across the aisle , Willie lay very still , his head hidden against the pillow in a queer way . Mary bent down , touching his shoulder , and felt its tenseness . She sat down beside him . " Willie  --  " There was no answer . " Willie  --  tell me what 's the matter , dear . Are you sick ? " There was a sudden motion . Willie dug his face closer into the pillow . Mary coaxed him , trying to turn him over , but when he pulled away , holding himself stiff , she was alarmed . He must be really ill , to hide this way . If he did n't answer , Mary said , she would have to call PapaThere was a silence , then Willie 's voice , very small and muffled . " I 'm not sick . . I 'm feeling sad about my pussy . " While Mary explained softly , not to wake Taddie , that Pussy was surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Willie lay motionless , still turned away . Pussy would n't have liked the train at all , Mary said . She would have had to be in a box , nailed up , all these days . And it might have made her sick . The kittens might have died . She had been thinking , Mary went on , that when they got to Washington , where they would have a big stable of their own , they might be able to have a pony for the boys . " Of course , Taddie is still pretty young to have such a responsibility . But if you could help look after the pony  --  I think we might manage  --  " Still no answer , but the shoulder under Mary 's hand relaxed a little . " Well  --  " Mary stood up . " You think about it , Willie . And in the morning , we 'll see what Papa says . " She looked down a minute , feeling a pang at the sight of him , so straight and still beneath the covers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clack of the train wheels . " Yes ? " A pause . " Do you think Papa could find a black pony ? An allblackone ? " " I think so , Willie . " There was a sigh . " Good night , mamma . " Walking back through the swaying car , Mary heard the train whistle , clear and sharp , as it wailed and died away . She had heard the whistles sound like that often , in the night , back in Springfield . Always , then , she had been left behind , while the train shrieked on into the darkness . But now it was different . Now they were moving forward , boldly , surely  --  past sleeping towns , where the whistle would be heard for a moment , lingering and mournful , and then forgotten in the stillness . The last stopover , next morning , was in Albany , where they were entertained by the mayor at a large breakfast . " It 's a mercy they did n't build any more cities along the line , " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new dresses . " They parted , that evening , in New York . Mr. Lincoln and Ward Lamon and the other gentlemen were to go directly to Washington , while Mary stayed at the MetropolitanHouse with Robert and the little boys until the day before inauguration . Tired from the long trip , Mary went to bed early . It was sometime toward morning that she wakened suddenly ,  |p171sitting  bolt upright . There had been a scream . . . She felt the lurch of panic , sickening and black , and then , a moment later , she realized it had only been Willie , callingout in his sleep . She went to him . Willie had had a bad dream . He had dreamed that Pussy was dead . A man with a black face had killed Pussy  --  and run away . When Willie was comforted , Mary came back to bed . But her legs felt icy and numb , and she lay shivering , in the slow dawn that crept over the unfamiliar room , and she knew the fears had come again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night Willie 's turtle died . Now the dream had made it real again . A man with a black face , Willie had said , who had run away . . . She remembered the things Frances and Elizabeth had told her  --  rumors of assassins who had sworn that Mr. Lincoln would never reach Washington alive . And a carpetbag , left in a train seat . . . Mary clenched her hands , feeling them wet and cold . How could she have let Mr. Lincoln go on to Washingtonwithout her ? If only she could send him word somehow  --  to warn him . . . It was noon that day when the telegram came . All morning Mary had been in an agony of fear , and when the porter handed her the envelope her fingers were tremblingso that Robert had to open it and read it to her . Mr. Lincoln was safe in Washington . Mr. Seward was at the station the evening Mary and Robert and the boys got off the train in Washington . It was pouring rain , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary saw the drops of moisture on Mr. Seward 's coat as he came through the crowd to meet them . Mr. Lincoln could n't get away from the hotel to come down himself , Mr. Seward explained . He was sorry  --  but some people had come in at the last minute and he had to stay and see them . He would be waiting at the hotel , where everything was ready for them . Mr. Seward was polite , inquiring about the journey and speaking kindly to the little boys . In answer to Mary 's question , he said Mr. Lincoln seemed well , though naturally he had been very busy . The red plush lobby at Willard 's was thronged with people . Walking quickly through , her hand on Robert 's arm , Mary was aware of a buzz of comment as they passed . People turned to stare  --  one or two smiled , and she smiled back , trying not to show the mounting agitation that pounded in her heart . But when they reached the secondfloor suite and Mr. Seward opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alive and safe  --  and such a flood of relief rushed over her that she could scarcely breathe . He stood with his back to the door , holding a sheaf of papers in one hand . There were a number of strangers in the room , and Mr. Lincoln was speaking to one of them  --  not noticing for a moment that the door had opened . Then Mary saw him turn , and the smile of welcome that came over his dark face . " Oh , Mr. Lincoln  --  Mr. Lincoln  --  " Mary was clinging to his arm , hearing her own voice , trembling and broken . " Well now , mother , " Mr. Lincoln said , " I would n't cry . You see they have n't shot me yet . " THERE WERE GUARDS STATIONED IN THE HALL OUTSIDEMr . Lincoln 's room , and a special detachment of soldiers on duty in the lobby downstairs . The city was teeming with people , coming and going all night long , roaming the streets as though it were broad daylight . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ugly rumors  --  threats of violence and death . There were five hundred men , some said , all armed , all at large in the city . They had sworn a pact that the newp173president would not live to sleep in the White House . Five hundred men , somewhere in the crowds that milled and shouted in the streets , waiting for morning . Mary sat with Robert and the boys and the others of their party in the diplomatic gallery , watching the inauguralceremony . Everything was going smoothly . Old Chief Justice Taney , looking small and shriveled in his black robes , had administered the oath while Mr. Lincoln towered above him . Now Mr. Lincoln was speaking. we are not enemies , but friends . . " It was strange to hear those words from him , when he had always been so slow to recognize either enemies or friends . It was all strange , Mary thought  --  as though being here was some part of a familiar dream . Long ago she had dreamed it  --  fancied herself in this moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . And the pride was here , filling her heart . But where , she wondered , was the happiness ? She watched Mr. Lincoln 's face , and the faces of the men who sat near him , listening , and wondered what they were thinking . She wondered if they could hear , beneath the sure , even flow of his voice , the deeps of melancholy and doubt that she knew were in him . The present , with its triumph , was real  --  but the price of the triumph was real also . The endless weeks of waiting , the bitterness , the discouragements and loneliness  --  the dark horizon of the future . These things had been no part of the vision she had dreamed . Stephen Douglas sat directly behind Mr. Lincoln . Mary could see the outline of his heavy and stocky shoulders . He sat quiet , his face impassive , as he listened . On his knee he held Mr. Lincoln 's top hat . What was he thinking now ? That he might have been standing where Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or was he hair thankful , perhaps , that he need only wait , holding Mr. Lincoln 's hat ? Taddie. in the seat beside her , squirmed restlessly , and started to whisper something . Mary shook her head , her finger on her lips . She could see Robert next to Taddie , then Willie , and Elizabeth . Mr. Lincoln finished speaking . There was an instant 's silence while he stood looking out over the crowd , his shoulders stooped slightly , his face solemn and intent . Then he stepped back  --  and there was a general stir . Applause  --  cheers  --  rangfrom the audience . Mary saw Mr. Lincoln turn and glance at her , and she met his eyes , smiling . Cousin Lizzie was clapping her hands , pausing to wipe away her tears . Robert was applauding . Mr. Douglas rose , and handed Mr. Lincoln his hat . They were shaking hands now  --  Mr. Seward , Mr. Chase , Mr. Cameron . Mary drew a long breath . She saw Elizabeth leaning across to nod approvingly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very well indeed . " They drove up Pennsylvania Avenue in the new carriage that had been sent for Mr. Lincoln from New York . A dress coach , of dark maroon , with scarlet brocatel upholstery . Beside them , in the thin March sunlight , rode a special guard of honor . Marshals with their bright scarfs and rosettes of orange and blue . In the seat next to Mr. Lincoln was General Scott , commander of the army , looking out at the cheering crowds that lined the broad street . The old general 's eyes , beneath his cockaded hat , were pale and wary  --  watching . At the White House , Mr. Lincoln took Mary 's arm and they went in together . Edwards , the attendant who sat by the door with a bunch of large brass keys dangling from a chain on his belt , climbed down from his high stool and came forward . Ile shook hands with Mr. Lincoln and bowed to Mary , eying her narrowly out of sharp blue eyes . Close behind Mary , pushing ahead of the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Willie . Their copper-toed boots clattered noisily as they slidp175across the bare parquet floor , and they made a dive for the wide staircase that curved upward from the reception hall . " I 'll race you down the banisters , Willie ! " Mary caught Taddie just in time , pulling him back as she saw the dour and disapproving frown on old Edwards 's face . She kept the boy 's hand firmly in hers while they walked through the downstairs rooms . But when they looked in the East Room , at the end of the corridor , Taddiebroke away again , and he and Willie rushed about the long room , poking and prying and chattering like squirrels . " Look , mamma  --  the piano 's made of gold  --  " Willie went closer to inspect . " Only  --  the gold is all coming off in peelings . " Taddie stopped suddenly , his face puckered with dismay . " Mamma  --  is this the President 's house ? " Mary said nothing . She stood in the doorway , looking at the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mr. Montrose had discussed . White and gold and crystal , Mr. Montrose had said . But the white walls were streaked and grimy . The gilt on the frescoes was chipped , and the crystal chandeliers were filmed with dust . The long windows , where the crimson draperies would hang , were bare , and the cold March sunlight shone through them , on the dingy , ill-assorted furniture and the faded carpeting . Mary turned to Mr. Lincoln . He was standing beside her , his eyes narrowed , lost in some thought of his own . " We 'd better get back to the others , " Mary said . They were gathering in the broad reception hall . Mary saw Elizabeth 's expression as she and Ninian came in  --  the quick , appraising look , the slightly lifted brows . There was to be a luncheon for the new Cabinet members in half an hour , and the ladies , Mary realized , would expect to be shown upstairs to their rooms . Taddie pulled at Mary 's sleeve .   " Mamma , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I unpack my red wagon ? " " Mamma  --  " Willie was on her other side , hopping excitedly . " Please , can Tad and I go out and look at the barn ? I want to see where my pony will stay . " She sent them along , and then turned to her guests , but before the last carriage had drawn up at the front door the boys were back again . Willie 's lip was trembling indignantly . There was a man out in the barn , Willie said . A very cross man , who had told them to go away and not bother him , and they were n't to come fooling around the stables . " Is n't this our house now , mother ? " Willie 's round face was troubled . " Do n't we livt here ? " There was an abrupt wail from Tad die . Overcome by the strangeness of this new and hostile world , he buried his face against Mary 's skirt and burst into tears . " I do n't want to live here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary looked about distractedly . What on earth was she going to do with the boys while they got ready for the luncheon ? There seemed to be no servants in sight as yet . She glanced at old Edwards , but one look at his glum , wizened countenance and she turned away . She had a sudden , mortifying image of the way their arrival must look  --  with all of them standing about as though they were in a railroad station , and Taddie , refusing to be quieted , howling to high heaven and demanding to go home . Suddenlyher eye lit on a pleasant-looking young officer , assignedfor the day as an aide to the President , and Mary smiled hopefully . Would he , she asked the young man , be so very kind as to walk out with the little boys for half an hour or so , and show them the grounds ? Instantly , sensing the looks the others exchanged , and the slight , frozen pause before the young officer answered , Mary realized her mistake . Mr. Lincoln stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The boys can go out with me . " He offered them each a hand . " Come alongP177we 'll see it the cross man can be persuaded to let me into the barn . " Mary bit her lip , feeling embarrassment sweep hotly over her . Mr. Lincoln meant to be kind , of course  --  but he had only put her more hopelessly in the wrong than ever . To think the new president must spend his first half hour in office minding the children  --  and before he had had so much as a chance to lay aside his hat . Mary turned quickly , to avoid meeting Elizabeth 's eye . " Let 's go upstairs , " she said . In the room that was to be hers , Mary stood looking about . It was pleasant enough , large and square , with long windows that faced south across the sloping grounds down toward the river , and beyond to the hills of Virginia that showed the first pale yellow-green of spring . But the furnishingson the second floor were , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at the limp blue curtains , and thought of the crisp starched ruffles at the bedroom windows in Springfield . The bed was carved walnut , large and gloomy , covered with a counterpane of faded rose print . Mary laid her bonnet on the bare dresser . It was hard to think that until a few hours ago someone had actually been living in this room . She had a sudden , uneasy sense of being an unwelcome guest in someone else 's house . From across the hall , Mary could hear Elizabeth speaking . " I must say , I should think the country could do better than this for the President 's house . Did you ever see such furniture ? It might have come out of the ark . And as for the carpets , if you please , half of them are worn clear through . . . Then Ann , chiming in sharply . If I were in Mary 's place , the first thing I should do would be to hire some decent servants . The only ones that have taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot .   And the way they treated us  --  as though we were sightseersor something . I call it disgraceful . " " Well , I daresay Mary will have everything running smoothly in no time  --  " That was Cousin Lizzie speaking  --  " with all the lovely things she ordered from New York . And Mary 's always so clever about managing  --  " Mary closed her door sharply and crossed to the window . She ought to be fixing her hair  --  getting ready for the luncheon . She looked down on the lawn , such as it was . Here and there , on the ragged expanse , were a few crocuses . She hoped , vaguely , the ground was n't as damp as it looked . If Tad got his feet wet and came down with one of his colds .. . This was it , Mary thought . This was the thing she had waited for , planned and dreamed . Now it was real . And when she woke up tomorrow morning it would still be real . Tomorrow and tomorrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aloud sometimes by the fire in Springfield . It was a long time now , she realized , since Mr. Lincoln had read to her .. . Mary went over and sat down on the bed . All of a suddenshe knew what it was that made her feel like this . She was homesick . Homesick , like Taddie . Homesick for a house she knew and a familiar room  --  and one cross Irish hired girl instead of a staff of strange servants most of whom she had n't even seen . She put her hands over her eyes . This was only a bad moment , she knew . It would pass  --  and everything would be right again , the way she had always planned it . But she did wish , wearily , that things need n't forever keep turning out so differently from what one expected .. . There was a knock at the door , and Mary looked up , bracing herself quickly . That would be Elizabeth , no doubt , telling her she must hurry and get ready for lunch . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped into the room . Her name was Lizzie Keckley , she said , and she had come recommended by Mrs. Breckinridge , who thought perhaps there might be workp179for her at the White House . She could sew , or press dresses , or help with the unpacking .. . Mary considered a moment . Mrs. Keckley 's manner was deferential . She spoke carefully , in a low voice , and Mary noticed her neat dark dress , and the way she carried herself with poise and dignity . There was some last-minute fitting to be done on her gown for the ball that evening . How soon could Mrs. Keckley start to work ? As soon as you wish , madam . I can stay now if you like . " " Then do , by all means . " Mary stood up . The strangeness of a moment ago had vanished . There would be so much to do these first few days , she said to Mrs. Keckley , briskly . A good deal of entertaining , no doubt , and callers to be received . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boys . They were restless , after the change and the long journey , and needed someone to keep an eye on them . Mrs. Keckley nodded . She was very fond of children . " I have a son of my own , madam , going on eighteen . " " My oldest boy is just the same age  --  " Mary 's tone warmed . " Yes , I know . I 've heard what fine children you have , Mrs. Lincoln . I 'd be very pleased if you 'd care to trust the younger ones to me . " Mary turned from the dresser where she was smoothing her hair , and saw that Mrs. Keckley , without being asked , had picked up Mary 's bonnet and cloak and was laying them away carefully in the wardrobe . Mary smiled . " I think , " she said , " we shall get on very well together , Mrs. Keckley. " 18o MR . LINCOLN 'S WIFEp180MR . LINCOLN ACCEPTED THE PRESENCE OF MRS . KECKLEYas unquestioningly as he did most things that appeared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dress for the ball , Mrs. Keckley had established herself as quite indispensable . She had taken the boys in hand , coaxed them to eat supper and read to them until they feel asleep . Mary 's new gown had been adjusted expertly , her hair was dressed , and her gloves and flowers were waiting on the bed . When Mary was ready , Mrs. Keckley went to help the other ladies dress , and later Ann drew Mary aside . " Mark my word , Mary  --  you have a real treasure in Mrs. K. Mind you do n't let her slip through your fingers , though . If Mr. Lincoln talks and jokes with her , as he always does with servants , it will certainly spoil her  --  and that would be a pity . If I were you , I should speak to him about it . " If you were me , Ann , everything would be managed quite perfectly , I have n't a doubt . And if you were God , I daresay the universe would be a great deal better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I will have to struggle along as best we can . " Mary 's voice was sharp , but she smiled as she spoke . She was too happy to let Ann or anyone else spoil things for her tonight . She looked affectionately at Cousin Lizzie Grimsley and complimented her new coffeecoloredsilk gown until Lizzie 's cheeks flushed with gratitude . " Oh , Cousin Mary  --  " Lizzie scrubbed the tip of her nose vigorously  --  " who but you would think to notice my dress on a night like this ? " She sighed , pushing back a stray wisp of hair that had escaped Mrs. Keckley 's careful brushing and would keep falling over one ear . " You 've been so thoughtful and wonderful  --  bringing us all hereP181with you . But , then , I 've always said you were the most unselfish woman in the world . " The Inaugural Ball was to be held at the Union Building , a few blocks from the White House . Stepping out of the carriage , Mary held her head high . Her hand was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , looking more rested and cheerful than he had for weeks . And he had said her new gown was most becoming . Mary smiled graciously as they walked into the muslin-draped ballroomtogether . War  --  and the servant problem  --  could wait until tomorrow . All of Washington , they said , was at the ball that night . All of Washington , however , seemed to include some unexpected elements . The fashionable southern set were there , having come , apparently , for the purpose of inspectingand commenting on the appearance of the new presidentand his wife . For weeks now , their Democratic dinner tables had seethed with stories of the Republican interlopers , and now , having seen for themselves , the inner circle found their worst fears confirmed . It was plain to be seen , they said , that the Lincolns were rustics . Westerners , to begin with , and definitely antislavery , which was shocking . Abolitionists were bad enough , in all conscience , but at least a New England abolitionist was a gentleman if scratched deeply enough . Whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond the pale but sociallyas well . " Quite , quite impossible . . . They say he 'd never owned a pair of boots until he was elected  --  and having to wear them now is what makes him look so sad . . . " " One ca n't help rather pitying him  --  after all , what can one expect of a backwoodsman who 's been shoved into the limelight by an ambitious wife ? But she , my dear  --  quite too awful . I 'm told she made the most absurd spectacle of herself in New York . Rushing about to theP182shops and demanding all sorts of attention in the most overbearing way . She 's going to do over the whole White House , it seems  --  and expect the country to foot the bill for her bad taste , I have n't a doubt ... " " She sides with Mr. L. in politics , they say  --  even though she comes from a quite acceptable southern family . It shows what a woman will stoop to when she 's set on pushingher husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , about the dreadful thing she did to Lieutenant Page , poor dear ? Actually asking him , in front of her luncheon guests , to mind her two brats this afternoon . She even expected him to bathe them . Oh  --  but it is a fact . Absolute gospel . I had it straight from my aunt 's stepson and he heard it from Kate Chase who was there with her father for the Cabinet luncheon . Miss Kate vows she saw the whole thing with her own eyes . Just fancy  --  ordering an officer about as though he were a body servant . Miss Kate says she thinks poor Lieutenant Page would have sunk through the floor with mortification if Mr. Lincoln had n't interfered . It just goes to show that even he has more sense of things than she  --  though I 've heard that he lives in mortal terror of Mrs. L. 's temper ... " Miss Kate and her father , the new secretary of the treasury , were late arriving . When they came in , there was already a crush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From all over the crowded hall , people turned to look , to watch Mr. Chase shake hands with the President , to see what Miss Kate was wearing , and how she greeted the President 's wife . Miss Kate was very pleasant . If her manner was somewhatlanguid , Mary had already gathered that this was the badge of social distinction in Washington . Unlike the West , where people were eager , even effusive , it was evidentlyconsidered proper here to be offhand . Mary felt Miss Kate 's fingers , slim and boneless , rest a moment in hers . They had rested a shade longer , Mary had observed , P183in Mr. Lincoln 's  --  though she had looked up at him from under long dark lashes quite as casually as she did at Mary . " How too awful  --  such a crush  --  " Miss Kate 's glance swept over the room . " Does n't it make you feel quite dreadful having all of us come just to stare at you , Mrs. Lincoln ? Though I must say  --  " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face  --  " you look as though you were quite enjoying it . Does n't she , Mr. Lincoln ? " " Being stared at is something one gets used to , I expect , " Mary said . Miss Kate made a little shrug , lifting her slim shoulders prettily . " I daresay you 're right , Mrs. Lincoln . Personally , I find it very trying  --  but then , of course  --  " again the smile , candid and disarming  --  " you 've had so many more years of experience than I. " As Miss Kate drifted away in the crowd , her whiteglovedfinger tips resting lightly on her father 's arm , Mary stared after her . She saw the slender lines of Miss Kate 's figure , and the elegant poise of her small head . She must be very young , Mary thought . She looked barely more than twenty . Yet Mary noticed how she greeted the older guests , particularly the gentlemen , with an air of easy , slightly bored familiarity . Miss Kate was wearing white too , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wore no jewels . Her shining red hair was parted in the center and drawn smoothly into a low knot at the back of her neck . Mary looked down , suddenly conscious of the elaboratenessof her own gown . And of the wreath of flowers in her hair . She felt short and tightly laced and middle-aged . But the next moment she remembered something she had heard a woman say about Miss Kate in New York . " Kate Chase is bound and determined her father will be president someday , " the woman had said . " She 's twice as ambitious for him as he is for himself  --  and that 's saying a great deal . If she does n't get her wish , it will be a bitter disappointment  --  andKate 's not used to being disappointed . "  |p184A  smile , not unlike Miss Kate 's own , lingered on Mary 's lips . Beauty or no , middle-aged or no  --  she had a sudden conviction that between herself and Kate Chase she held the trump card . The evening wore on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many people at the ball who had nothing whatever to do with society . Mingled with the more fashionable clement , rubbing elbows with the cave dwellers and diplomats , was a large and motley assortment of guests who appeared to have wandered in simply for the show  --  and were bent on improving the occasion by seeing how much they could eat and drink . They roamed about , gawking and commenting on all they saw , pocketing souvenirs , and making such forays on the refreshments that the supper tables were turned into a shambles . Alarmed to discover that the food had vanished , along with virtually all the silverware and napkins before the evening was half over , Mary appealed to Mr. Lincoln . " What are we to do , Mr. Lincoln ? The tables are quite bare . They 've even carried off most of the centerpieces  --  and there are still dozens of guests who have n't been served . " Mr. Lincoln shook his head . " I do n't know what we can do , mother , unless we send out for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , that no one besides Mary was seriously perturbed by the situation . Washington partygoers seemed to accept the presence of the barbarous horde as a matter of course . " You must n't let it worry you , " Mrs. Breckinridge said cheerfully to Mary . " These sightseers turn up everywhere nowadays . We 're quite accustomed to them . " Elizabeth remained scandalized . " Pigs are pigs , " she said firmly , " whether Washington is accustomed to them or not . And I must say I do n't see that the manners of the decent-looking people are much of an improvement . Of all the insolent , overbearing rudeness I ever saw  --  P189IT WAS EARLY IN THE MORNING WHEN MARY WOKE . SHEopened her eyes to discover Tad and Willie hanging on either side of her bed , arguing noisily about something . Seeing her eyes open , the boys left off their discussion and began talking to her , both at once , in such agitation that for a moment she could n't make out what they were saying . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was bouncing on the edge of the bed excitedly . All sorts of people , right outside the door there  --  simply hundreds of them . Queer-looking men , mostly , and some ladies too , and they were all talking about getting in to see the President . One of them , Willie said , had given him a silver dollar just to tell which was the door of Old Abe 's office . And another had offered Tad a pinch of snuff . " See the dollar , mamma ? It 's a real one . See ? " The people are all over the stairs , mamma . Just come and see . They 're all over  --  " Mary sat up . She could n't think what the boys were prattling about , but when she opened her door a little and looked out , there , sure enough , were a number of oddlookingindividuals , lined up , leaning against the wall , helping themselves to snuff and generally making them-. selves at home . Several of them turned to gape at her through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " one man inquired . He had n't troubled to remove his hat . Mary slammed the door . She dressed hastily , sent the boys off to Mrs. Keckley , and marched down the corridor to Mr. Lincoln 's office . A few of the bystanders , seeming to recognize her , fell back grudgingly to let her pass . She went in without knocking . " Mr. Lincoln  --  " He was alone at his desk , writing something . " Mr. Lincoln , have you seen those people out there ? " " Not yet  --  but I expect I will . " He looked up mildly . " That 's what they came here for . " " But who on earth are they , Mr. Lincoln ? Coming in like this  --  before we 've even had breakfast  --  " " Office seekers , mother . " Mr. Lincoln put down his pen . " That 's one commodity I reckon we 'll never be short of . " " How did they get in ? " " By the front door , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wait downstairs then , " she said shortly . " I wo n't have the creatures cluttering up the halls  --  staring at us as though we were waxworks . One of them actually tried to give Taddie snuff . You 'll have to speak to someone , Mr. Lincoln  --  at once . " " All right , mother , I 'll see what I can do . " Mr. Lincoln took up his pen again and stared at it for a moment , thoughtfully . " The trouble is , there does n't seem to be anyone to speak to around here except me . " He sighed . " But I 'll do the best I can . " That day , however , and the next day and the next passed , and nothing had been done . The house swarmed with the favor seekers , crowding the staircase , pushing their way to the front of the line , clutching their credentialsand arguing loudly over the relative merits of their claims . Now and then one of the visitors would wander out of his orbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where he would generally stand , gawking and unabashed , until requested to leave . By the fourth day Mary was unnerved . Quite as she might have expected , Mr. Lincoln had done nothing whatever .   " After all , mother , " he said , " I ca n't very well turn them out . These are the people who voted for me . " " And since when , I should like to know , does voting for a man include the privilege of walking into his family 's bedrooms at all hours of the day and night ? " Plainly , if anything was to be done , Mary saw that she would have to do it . She spoke to Mr. Nicolay , Mr. Lincoln'ssecretary , and Mr. Nicolay , looking harried but patient , said he would speak to Mr. Hay , the other secretary , who would consult Mr. Stoddard , and they would see what could be arranged . But without definite orders . . The orders , said Mary , were quite definite . And what was more , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since Mr. Montrose was expected from New York that afternoon to confer with her in the matter of redecorating the house . Mr. Nicolay , looking noticeably more harried and less patient , agreed to do what he could . Most unfortunately , an hour before Mr. Montrose 's arrival , a large body of young gentlemen called at the White House with the patriotic purpose of offering themselves to the President as a volunteer company to defend Washington in the event that Rebels should invade the city . Old Edwards , at the door , ushered the gentlemen into the East Room , for want of other space , and there Mary discovered them when she came in with Mr. Montrose . The zealots , unable to restrain their feelings while waiting for an audience with Mr. Lincoln , were milling about the room , leaping onto chairs and vowing heroically that if they were only given guns they would bivouac where they were . Mr. Montrose , already exhausted by his journey , seemed totally undone by the spectacle of so much virility , and it was with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinions from him in regard to upholstery , carpeting and color schemes . Eventually the stream of volunteer recruits , including a large number of fashionable and unmilitary-looking gentlemen who were suddenly fired with a desire to be commissioned as brigadiers , was deflected to the War Department . And as the weeks went by , the influx of office seekers dwindled to a steady but manageable trickle . Mary was learning that in Washington problems were often best settled by the simple device of allowing them to settle themselves . In household matters , however , she declined to be passive . The White House staff , when consulted , proved to be curiously immune to suggestions . Pride , custom , and precedentwere their tenets , and the greatest of these was precedent . In the memory of the oldest usher , who dated back to the Van Buren administration , things in the White House had always been done a certain way . And no new president 's wife was expected to give orders . She was merely to be tolerated , so long as she was willing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Lincoln , " Mary said . " This house is being run as though we were still in the Dark Ages . When I try to give an order in the kitchens , I 'm told it ca n't be done that way because Mrs. Madison said fifty years ago it was to be done some other way . Who 's running this house , I should like to know ? Dolly Madison or me ? " Mr. Lincoln looked at her thoughtfully . " Neither one , so far as I can see , mother , " he said . Cousin Lizzie was more sympathetic . " If you ask me , " she said , " half these servants ought to be discharged . They 've been here so long they think they own the house . They 're positively insolent to you , Mary ; and the things they say behind your back are disgraceful . They grumble over the least thing that makes a little extra work for them , and then they say you 're stingy and unreasonable just because you object to their wasteful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been here through four administrations , and you were the first mistress that ever came down to the kitchens every day . Spying , she called it  --  " Lizzie 's nose grew pink with indignation . " She saidP193it was plain to see that you were n't used to having servants  --  since you were n't willing to trust them . I took pains to tell her , you may be sure , that you 'd been brought up to expect good service  --  and they need n't think they could fool you with their slovenly ways . " It was a relief all around when Mary discovered that a trip to New York would be necessary before she and Mr. Montrose could settle on the final details of the new furnishings . For his part , Mr. Lincoln said , he thought the house looked well enough as it was . A lot better than any they 'd had before . But if Mary was set on adding a few frills , he could n't see any objection . " You and Lizzie run along , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like . " Once in New York , Mary found herself soothed by the flattering attention of Mr. Montrose . They had long , engrossingdiscussions of designs and fabrics , during which each deferred to the other 's opinion . They were always charmed , in the end , to discover how perfectly their tastes agreed . In the matter of lace curtains they were particularlyharmonious , with the result that Mary found she had ordered , without quite knowing how , a double set for every window in the house . It was a trifle disconcerting to contemplate the probable cost of these , but Mr. Montrose , as usual , slid so delicately over the matters of price and credit that Mary hesitated to mention actual figures . While they were there , of course , it seemed a pity not to look at a few of the new styles in spring clothes . And the clerks at Stewart 's were as eager as ever to be of service . Encouraged by their friendliness and Lizzie 's raptures over the gowns and bonnets , Mary ended by ordering a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was bound to be a great deal of entertaining in Washington , and , as Mr. Stewart himself said , it would never do for the First Lady to be outshone . Miss Kate Chase , he added thought- fully , had been up only last week to buy her spring wardrobe . Mr. Lincoln brought the boys to the station to meet them the night they got home . He looked tired , but he seemed pleased to have Mary home again , and listened amiably while she told about the new plans for the house , neglecting obligingly to inquire the cost of anything . When Lizzie commented later on this singular omission , Mary smiled . " Mr. Lincoln has no notion of such things , " she said indulgently . " He likes to have the house in proper style , and he 's always pleased to see me in what he calls fine feathers '  --  but he has no more idea than a kitten what it will mean to live up to our position here . I daresay he fancies a few yards of bonnet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman needs to produce a whole new wardrobe . " By the end of the week Mr. Montrose had sent down his corps of drapers and upholsterers , and there was frantic activity in the house . Mary was busy all day , supervising and directing , but even in the midst of the hammering and confusion , Mr. Lincoln remained oblivious to the violent upheavals going on around him . When , one morning , he tripped over a man with a mouthful of tacks who was busily laying the new stair carpet , Mr. Lincoln only murmured a vague apology and went on his way , frowningand abstracted . " You 'll see , though , " Mary said confidently to Cousin Lizzie , " how delighted Mr. Lincoln will be when everything is done . " Lizzie sighed . " I do think you 're wonderful , Mary . Mr. Lincoln is a lucky man to have a wife who does so much for him . " It was on a Friday morning , in April , that the last new curtain and the final strip of carpeting were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the decoratorsp195were sent back to New York . And she found the results of their work all that Mr. Montrose and she had dreamed and planned . The old house had come to life again . Rooms that had been bare and dreary glowed with new color . Fresh damasks , rich and gleaming , covered the old furniture . There were new carpets underfoot . The windows were hung with lace curtains , and the fringed overdrapes pulled back with plump silken ropes and anchored by large rosettes . After the workmen had gone , Mary went back for one more look at the East Room . It was perfection . The gold and white walls , restored to pristine freshness , gleamed in the morning sun . Hundreds of tiny rainbows spangled the ceilings in the light reflected from the shining prisms of the crystal chandeliers . And the crimson draperies , echoing the darker red of the deep-piled carpet , gave the crowning touch of color from their rich , full folds . Mary sighed . She walked down the long room , moving softly , touching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment by the keyboard of the huge , newly gilded pianoforte . Let Washington come and see her house now , she thought , and they would find something to stir them out of their haughty indifference . They were so fond of talking  --  thiswould give them something to talk about . It was lunchtime  --  Mr. Lincoln would be coming down from the office any moment  --  and then she would show him everything . He 'd worked so hard these weeks , been so preoccupied and worried by all the new demands they were pressing on him , he 'd scarcely had time to look up from his desk . But now , surely , the worst rush was over , and he could rest a little . She thought , smiling , how astonishedhe 'd be to discover all she had done . Out in the hall , Mary was surprised to see Mr. Seward just coming in the front door . It was an odd time for the secretary of state to call , surely . She started to speak , but he brushed past with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just as Mr. Lincoln appeared at the top landing .   The two men met midway , looking very grave , and Mary saw that Mr. Lincoln held a telegraph blank in his hand . " You 've seen this news ? " Mr. Lincoln handed the message to Mr. Seward , who glanced at it and nodded . " That 's why I came , " Mr. Seward said . " If it 's really true that they 've fired on Fort Sumter  --  it means we 're in for war . " Mary saw the shadow that crossed Mr. Lincoln 's face . " It 's true , " she heard him say slowly , out of a long silence . " It 's true . " The two men turned and came down the stairs into the hall together . " We 'd better go over to the War Office , " Mr. Lincoln said , " and find out what Cameron knows . " They went out the door , Edwards watching from his perch on his high stool , his old face gnarled and impassive . Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In a single hour the city was in a turmoil . No one had expected war . They had talked of it without really believing in it , and now that it had come , everyone was angry . Congress , having stewed and frittered for months without getting anywhere , boiled over in a fury of oratory and invective . Everybody wanted to blame somebody , and the President was the likeliest target . " The North does n't stand a show . We 're caught unprepared  --  andit 's Lincoln that 's responsible . With all this prattle of peace , to get himself elected , he 's left us a fair target  --  and now we 're done for . " Other factions , equally bitter , shouted that it was the President who had deliberately shoved them into war . " If he 'd been man enough to own the South was right , " they said , " we 'd never have had to fight . But he 's harped on humanity and the curse of slavery , like a damned preacher , until he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in their sashes and sabers ,  |p197took  on a new meaning now . All over the North , men were mobilizing , moving toward Washington . Sign up now and get it over quick . March on Richmond , and - we 'll be home before the summer 's out . Ranks of three months ' volunteers joined up , promising that they 'd be back in time to help with the harvest . On a bright spring morning the Pennsylvania Fifth , the New York Twelfth and the Massachusetts Eighth paraded up the avenue in Washington . Their flags whipped smartly in the fresh breeze , their drums rolled , and bayonets flashed in the morning sun . At the White House gate they wheeled , turning up the drive to pass in review before the President . Mary stood beside Mr. Lincoln , watching them go by . She saw the faces , young and eager . They wore bright sashes , and many of them smiled broadly as they marched past . Mr. Lincoln did not smile back . His eyes , fixed on them sadly , seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the avenue , windows stood open in the soft spring air . And from inside now and then came sounds of music . Rebel tunes , clear and tinkling , signalling a thin defiance from the Southern ladies at their pianofortes . The strains of " Dixie " mingled with the blare of fife and drum , and the steady clump of marching feet . But here came an odd-looking company  --  dressed in gaudy uniforms with red fez caps and pantaloons of vivid blue . The New York Fire Zouaves  --  a volunteer brigade led by a dashing young colonel who rode before them , his saber drawn . He heard the pianos tinkling  --  turned and gave an order  --  and the next moment his corps band struck up smartly . Then I wish I was in Dixie ! Hooray ! Hooray ! In Dixie 's land we 'll take our stand , To live and die in Dixie . . .   The crowd lined along the sidewalk caught the twist , and a roar of laughter went up . The bystanders took up the words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Away , away , away down south in Dixie ! The defiant pianos were silenced . Windows banged shut . " The North has stolen everything , " the southern ladies cried . " Even our tunes . " When the Zouaves marched past the White House portico , Mr. Lincoln 's face relaxed for the first time into a smile . They struck up " Maryland , My Maryland . " General Ben Butler occupied Baltimore that morning , and Marylandcould be fairly claimed . Mary , looking at the Zouave colonel , recognized young Ellsworth , a lad who had read law for a few months in Mr. Lincoln 's office in Springfield . She remembered him pleasantly , as a blond , round-faced boy . Riding past now , he grinned at Mr. Lincoln , and winked broadly . Mary saw Mr. Lincoln 's hand raised in salute . That afternoon there was an informal reception for the soldiers at the White House . Mary stood with Mr. Lincoln , shaking hands , greeting them all . She was a trifle surprised to find them so friendly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lads , in a burst of confidence , told her she looked like his mother , Mary was touched . She promised to write his mother and tell her how well he seemed . The boy blushed under his freckles . " Ma 'd be all perked to hear from you , ma'am , " he said . " She did n't think much of my signing up , but Pa said if Old Abe wanted me to fight , I 'd best fight . Pa thinks a whole heap of Mr. Lincoln . " Mary looked at the thin young face a moment . " Tell me  --  how old are you ? " " Going on eighteen , ma'am . " Mary was silent . A fear , swift and cold , brushed against her heart , but she pushed it back.  | " I have a son , a little older than you , " she said . " I can imagine how your mother felt to see you go . " " Yes , ma'am . " The boy looked troubled , then he brightened . " Pa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . And I can go home again . " " I hope so , " Mary said . " Oh , sure to . " The boy nodded confidently . " Pa says he figured Mr. Lincoln wouldn't 've called for threemonthersunless he knew the war 'd be finished then . Or maybe sooner , of course . " When the boys had gone , Mary spoke to Mr. Lincoln . Did anyone really suppose the fighting would be over before the summer was out ? Mr. Lincoln hesitated . He was sitting forward in his chair , his shoulders slumped . The talk in Congress , he said , was all of making the war a short one . " They say the South will give in quick enough , once they see we mean business . " " All the same  --  " Mary said  --  " I wonder if the Confederateboys are signing up for just three months . " THE NEXT DAY WAS SUNDAY , AND ELLSWORTH , THE young Zouave colonel , came to lunch . He was full of talk , at the table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and Tad and Willie were entranced . " What would you do if you saw a Reb coming at you ? " " Shove a bayonet through him  --  like this  --  " Ellsworth skewered Tad on the end of a fork , and Willie squealed with delight . " What will you do with old Jeff Davis if you catch him ? " " Hang him on a sour apple tree . "  | " What is a Zouave anyway ? " Ellsworth laughed at that . " Ask anyone in Washington  --  and they 'll tell you a Zouave is an Irishman , plus three yards of red flannel sash . " After lunch , in the sitting room , Ellsworth borrowed a carbine from Mr. Stoddard and showed them the manual of arms . They watched the clockwork motions , the boys in high glee , until one shoulder arms . Ellsworth was standingtoo near the south window , and his smart motion sent the muzzle of the gun crashing through the pane of glass . Ellsworth was dismayed for a moment , then he grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " what we 'll do to Johnny Reb . " That night , after Tad and Willie had gone to bed , Mrs. Keckley came downstairs to find Mary . Both the boys were very restless , she said . They seemed feverish . Mary hurried up to their room . They were complaining of sore throats , and when Mary opened the front of their nightshirts she found a bright rash . The doctor was sent for . Measles , he said . The next day and the next Colonel Ellsworth came tothe White House . He made himself entirely at home . " We seem to have adopted him , " Mr. Lincoln said . " No  --  he 's adopted us , " Mary answered . It was pleasant having young Ellsworth around . He laughed easily , and was so friendly and informal that not even the stiffest-necked members of the staff could help liking him . Cousin Lizzie was charmed . " I do n't know what it is about that young man , " she said , " but just having him around makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary said . " Sometimes I think what we need in this family is a really happy person . " Later , to Mrs. Keel:ley , Mary confided that it made her feel as though she had her three boys at home again to have Ellsworth with them . She did n't add that she had found herself wishing , more than once , that she could bep201sure of the same gay affection from Robert that Ellsworth gave so freely . " I feel as if Ellsworth were my own son , " Mary said . Mrs. Keckley looked up from her sewing with her quiet smile . " It might seem strange for me to say it , madam  --  but I feel almost as though he were my boy too . " More than once Mary suggested that Ellsworth should make his home at the White House while he was stationed in Washington , but Ellsworth was firm . " I 've got to stick to my boys , " he said . " They 're such a troublesome lot of Irishmen  --  if I were n't on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company would be tarred and feathered before the week was out . " In spite of all Mary 's warnings and scoldings , Ellsworth insisted on going up to visit Tad and Willie every day , and no one was much surprised to hear , after a week of this , that the colonel was confined to his quarters , indisposed . To Mary , who drove to visit him each afternoon , he stubbornlymaintained that it was only a little cold he had . " And what are those spots , pray , that make you look like a strawberry patch ? " Ellsworth smiled apologetically . Just a touch of hives , he said . He always got them with a cold . Mary fussed over him indulgently , coaxing him to take the medicines the doctor had ordered for Willie and Tad . It was a pity , she said , when a grown man and a soldier had no more sense than to go about catching measles . On one of the afternoons when Mary had gone to take a hamper of food to Ellsworth , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a bill from a firm of dry goods merchants in New York , to the sum of two thousand dollars owing for carpeting furnished as per order , installedin the East Room , main corridor , state dining room and staircase in the White House . Mr. Lincoln looked at it for a moment . " Mr. Hay  --  " The secretary turned.  | " Mr. Hay , do you know anything about this ? " Mr. Hay studied the bill carefully . He cleared his throat . " No , sir . Mr. Nicolay must have  --  " " Mr. Hay , does n't it strike you that two thousand dollarsis a lot of money just for something people walk on ? " " Well , yes , sir . I  --  " Mr. Lincoln looked at the bill again . " You do n't supposethey could have made a mistake , Mr. Hay ? " Mr. Hay said , uncertainly , he did n't suppose so . Since Mrs. Lincoln had taken charge of all the decorations and repairs , perhaps she might know . Or possibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was to keep track of the household accounts . He was sent for , and Mr. Lincoln showed him the bill . So far as he could see , Mr. Stoddard said guardedly , the statement was correct . Mr. Lincoln looked at him in silence a minute . Then he asked whether Mr. Stoddard knew whether any more such bills might be expected . Well , yes , Mr. Stoddard admitted . There would certainly be others . " How much will it come to altogether ? " Mr. Stoddard hesitated , glancing uneasily at Mr. Hay . He could n't say for sure , but judging from the amount of work Mrs. Lincoln had had done , he would guess some where in the neighborhood of six thousand dollars . There was another silence . " I wish you had consulted me about this sooner , Mr. Stoddard . " Mr. Stoddard 's uneasiness grew more marked . Mrs. Lincolnhad taken charge of everything , he said . She had particularly told him that Mr. Lincoln was not to be troubled about household affairs . " I naturally supposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew what was being done . Mrs. Lincoln seemed quite sure  --  " " Yes . "  |p203Mr  . Stoddard tried again . He understood that it was customary for Congress to appropriate a certain sum at the beginning of each new administration for necessary repairs to the White House . Though in this case , since Mrs. Lincoln had found so much that needed doing , it might be necessary to ask for a larger amount . Mr. Lincoln smiled . " At a time like this , " he said , " with an army to raise and half the country howling about taxes , I hardly think Congress could be persuaded that two thousand dollars for carpets comes under the head of necessary repairs . And for once  --  Congress would be quite right . " He took the bill from Mr. Stoddard , folded it , and put it in his pocket . " I still do n't see how it could cost so much to fix up a house that looked all right to start with , " Mr. Lincoln said . His voice was mild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose it must have been necessary . When the other bills come in , Mr. Stoddard , will you be good enough to bring them to me ? I 'll make up the extra myself . " " Yes , sir . " " And , Mr. Stoddard  --  " Mr. Lincoln 's glance was level  --  " I should appreciate it if nothing more were said of this . It would be too bad  --  " he rubbed his chin  --  " to have Mrs. Lincoln upset . " It was useless to hope , however , that any morsel of information that might contribute to the fashionable pastime of criticizing the new administration would remainfor long unnoticed . The Washington grapevine was well developed , and within a few days the tea tables and drawing rooms rocked with delight over the story of Mrs. Lincoln 's new furniture . It was a fact , they said , that the impossible Mrs. L. had had a quarrel with the President because he had danced three times at the Inaugural Ball with a certain lady , and had gone off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bills which he was expected to pay , poor man . Just for spite , mind you . Someone had heard , straight from an usher who had been in the White House for years , that she 'd sent back three huge trunkfuls of nothing but lace curtains . Dozens and dozens of pairs  --  and nowhere to hang them at all . They 'd heard Mr. L. went into a toweringrage when he found what she 'd done  --  and one of the maids said she would n't be surprised if he 'd actually beaten her . It was too shocking , really . Just to fancy anyone spendingsuch sums at a time like this  --  with the country at war . The secesh ladies shook their heads virtuously . What an example for the President 's wife to set . Furthermore , the ladies added thoughtfully , it must not be forgotten that Mrs. L. herself was a Southerner . Might n't it even be that that was the cause of her quarrel with Mr. L. ? For all she talked so freely about sympathizingwith her husband 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. 's family was still in the South  --  that she had three brothers under the Confederate flag . Her youngest brother , Alexander , was a prisonkeeper at Richmond . And mind you , they said , blood is thicker than politics . Going over her mail with Mr. Stoddard one morning , Mary put down a letter suddenly . " Mr. Stoddard  --  " she pushed the remaining stack toward him  --  " will you read the rest of these for me ? I  --  ca n't stand any more . . . " Mr. Stoddard glanced up , startled to see tears in Mary 's eyes . " Take them away , Mr. Stoddard . " She gave the letters another push . " Burn them  --  do anything you like  --  only do n't let me see any more , please . " He glanced through a few of the letters , frowning . They were the sort that came every day now . Ugly , anonymousscrawls , most of them  --  though now and then he came across a carefully written one , no less bitterly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elegant stationary . He picked one at random and read it through.  |p205Dear  Madam , Who do you think you are ? You are only the President 's wife , nobody is interested in you , so why do n't you stay home and mind your own business instead of trying to get your name in the papers all the time ? I read you bought lace curtains for your house , six pairs for every window , and how much you paid for gloves and hats and a string of pearl beads the paper said you paid a thousand dollars for . There are lots of people like me that never had lace curtains at all . We are lucky if we have one pair of gloves and a hat decent enough to go to church in . My husband is gone in the army and my boy too even if he was only fifteen . People like us have to give everything but you do n't care so long as you can spend the government money and see your name in the paper . People say you want the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to fool us with your spy tricks .. . Mr. Stoddard put the letter aside and glanced at a few of the others . The abuse and bitterness were all too familiar to him . Each morning the President 's mail was filled with just such ravings . He looked up and found Mary watching him . " Mr. Stoddard , why must they write these things ? Why do they hate us so ? " THERE WAS A WHITE HOUSE RECEPTION PLANNED FOR the last week in April . Mary worked for days over the arrangements , consulting with Cousin Lizzie over the details , ordering the refreshments down from Maillard 's in New York . It was her first chance to entertain the Wash- ington ladies , and she meant to show them she knew how to do things properly . The house was done to the perfection of Mr. Montrose 's taste . And Mrs. Keckley had Mary 's new gown ready . Watching the preparations , Mr. Stoddard was doubtful . He hoped the party would go well  --  after Mrs. L. had gone to such trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , especially in the secesh circles , it seemed there was n't anything they 'd stop at to make things hot for the President . Not that Mr. Lincoln noticed much  --  he never appeared to care , one way or the other , how people treated him . But it broke Mrs. L. all up to hear him criticized . One thing you had to say for her . Proud and stubborn as she was for herself , she was even prouder for Mr. Lincoln . It would be a shame , Mr. Stoddard thought , if the ladies took it into their heads to be really mean . On the night of the reception , Mr. Lincoln was late coming down . He 'd been working until the last moment , while Mary fumed impatiently outside his study door . She 'd sent the barber in to shave him and trim his hair while he worked , and finally Mr. Stoddard was directed to go and warn him that he must dress at once . His clothes were all laid out ready  --  and Mr. S. was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white gloves . Mary and Cousin Lizzie were in the East Room when Mr. Lincoln appeared . He stood still a minute , looking around the big room . There were flowers in tall vases , and in the soft candlelight the crystal chandeliers sparkled . The carpet , at which Mr. Lincoln glanced with a new respect , was soft beneath his feet , and the crimson curtains seemed to fill the whole room with rich , living color . Mr. Lincoln raised his eyebrows . " Kind of dolled up tonight , are n't we , mother ? " Mary came over to straighten his tie , smiling up at him . She wore a new gown of dull-blue watered silk , cut low over her round , smooth shoulders , and with a full skirt sweeping into a train.  |p207Our  cat has a mighty long tail , " Mr. Lincoln said , looking at the new dress . " Seems to me some of the tail might have come in handy at the top . " " Do n't be old-fashioned , Mr. Lincoln . It 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daresay you 'd find nothingout of the way if Miss Chase wore a low neck  --  or any of the other young ladies . " Mary gave his tie a final pat . " There  --  you look very fine . Now do , for pity 's sake , remember to stand straight and not slouch  --  it looks so undignified . And do n't put your hands behind your back while you talk to the ladies . It offends them . " " ' Well , mother  --  I 'll do my best . " Mr. Lincoln simply must come and peep at the dining room , Cousin Lizzie insisted . It was too , too beautiful . Mary had ordered everything down from New York  --  caterers and all  --  for she was quite sure the regular staff would never manage things to suit her . " Do n't the tables look lovely ? The centerpieces were Mary 's idea . All red , white and blue , see ? And those flags are made of spun sugar . " Mr. Lincoln eyed the staggering mounds of salads , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , he guessed nobody was likely to go home hungry . " Come , Mr. Lincoln . " Mary took his arm . " I hear a carriage . " They stood together by the East Room door , waiting . From the hall outside , the Marine Band struck up a lively tune . There were voices in the corridor . Standing with her hand on Mr. Lincoln 's arm , Mary heard the usher 's voice , announcing the first guests . Mary looked up . Her smile , bright and expectant , was full of confidence . Three gentlemen from the Senate , all looking rather uncomfortable in their dress clothes , shook hands with the President and bowed stiffly to Mary . One of them was saying something , not too clearly , about regretting that his wife had been unable , at the last moment , to come . Between the senator 's mumbling and the noise of the band , Mary failed to quite catch the words . She only nodded brightly , and the gentlemen , a trifle red of face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then judge Stevenson who murmured over Mary 's hand that Mrs. Stevenson was indisposed and sent regrets . More congressmen  --  then a group from the French embassy , among them one woman who was presented to Mary as the wife of one of the young attaches . She was a sallow little creature , all in black , who gazed at Mary out of sad dark eyes and remarked mournfully , in broken English , that it was a charming occasion , and she was enchantedto be present . Carriages were arriving steadily . The outside corridor was jammed , and the sound of voices rose above the music . Senator This , Representative That were announced , made their bows , and passed quickly into the crowd . " The secretary of the treasury  --  Mr. Chase . " Mary lifted her shoulders . Her smile grew a shade brighter . Mr. Lincoln was shaking hands , the two men greeting each other pleasantly . As Mr. Chase moved on to Mary , she glanced at the next gentleman in line . " ' Where 's Miss Kate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shook his head regretfully . Miss Kate was desolated , he explained , but a headache-at the very last minute . She begged that Mrs. Lincoln would understand , and forgive her for not coming . The secretary 's voice was smooth as butter . For a moment Mary looked at him blankly . She had been on the point of replying quite conventionally when something in Mr. Chase 's bland , immobile face made her pause . The next instant , in a stinging , bitter flash , Mary realized what was happening . In the whole roomful of people , except for herself and Lizzie and the dreary little French wife , there was not a woman present . It was Washington 's answer to the President and his wife . A colossal , unbelievable snub . In the sick , unmistakable certainty of what had hap/pened , Mary found herself staring at Mr. Chase 's face that swam before her eyes like an absurdly bobbing balloon . Then it steadied  --  and she saw that he was still waiting , bland and impassive , for her to speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frozen . She raised her chin . " Indeed , Mr. Chase , please be sure to tell Miss Kate that I do understand  --  quite . " She drew her fingers away , keeping her voice carefully bright and even . " It 's such a pity though  --  I can fancy her disappointment at not being able to come . Still  --  " her smile deepened  --  " there is one consolation . I 'm quite certain Miss Kate will hear all about the party . She 's so fortunate in having so many admirers among the gentlemen who are here . " The minutes passed . Minutes of humiliation , sick and cold , while Mary kept her smile fixed and unfaltering , and the ruins of the evening for which she had planned so carefully crumbled slowly about her head . Gentleman after gentleman appeared , shook hands , and moved on . Then suddenly , the usher 's voice rang clearly : " The Honorable Stephen Douglas and Mrs. Douglas . " Mary turned swiftly toward the door . Adele Douglas , her blonde curls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brocade , was coming in . There was a stir  --  an almost tangible wave of surprise and disbelief  --  among the guests who stood near the door . They turned to stare , open-mouthed , like boys caught in the midst of a prank that had n't quite come off . " My dear Mrs. Lincoln  --  " Mrs. Douglas took Mary 's hand . Her voice , low and clear , carried over the hush . " How charming everything looks . " It was then , for the first time , that Mary found herself weakening . Her knees trembled , and she felt her smile waver uncertainly . But the next moment Mr. Douglas was before her , and she felt his hand on hers , steady and reassuring . " I 'm glad we 're not too late , " he said . " I was afraid the dancing might have already begun  --  and I was hoping to ask you for the honor of the first one . "   The band had just that minute struck up a waltz , and Mr. Douglas held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mary nodded . It would seem odd to dance , she thought , when there were so few ladies . But Mr. Douglas did n't appear to mind . He seemed rather to be enjoying himself , as he escorted her past the guests to the reception hall where the floor had been cleared . She looped her train up , and Mr. Douglas smiled . " This is quite like old times , is n't it ? " he said . COLONEL ELLSWORTH RECOVERED FROM HIS MEASLES INtime to have one more Sunday dinner at the White House before the news came that the Confederates were threateningAlexandria , and he and his Zouaves were ordered to move south . They sailed , that same evening , down the Potomac . Ellsworth was apologetic for the condition of his company . Having been hastily rounded up from the bar at Willard 's , and other favorite haunts , some of them were noticeably the worse for wear . " They 'll be all right , though , " Ellsworth said to Mr. Lincoln . " It 's action they 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , you 'll hear well of them , sir . " His face , beneath the peaked red cap , looked young and eager . Mr. Lincoln nodded . " They 'll be all right , " he said . " I 'm sure of it . " Two mornings later , a telegram was delivered to the White House . Coming in late to breakfast , Mr. Lincoln said in a queer flat voice that Ellsworth was dead . He had been shot in the back and killed instantly by a Rebel innkeeper in Alex-P211andria while he was climbing the stairs to fly the Union flag from the inn roof . He was still holding the flag , Mr. Lincoln said , when he fell . The news came like a blank , black shock to the others at the table . Willie and Tad burst into a storm of weeping and rushed at their father , burying their heads against him , and refusing to be comforted . Mary looked at Mr. Lincoln , dazed and unbelieving . " It ca n't be true , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were on his , pleading . As if he might somehow soften the blow , make the truth untrue . But he only shook his head . " It 's just the beginning of the truth , " he said slowly . " I suppose we must learn to get used to it . " It was Mary who insisted that the funeral must be at the White House , and all that day , while the household mourned and Mr. Lincoln went on working , it was Mary who made the arrangements for the service . Late in the evening , when she had finished everything and went upstairs , Mary saw the light burning under Mr. Lincoln 's study door . It was seldom , in these days , that she ventured to disturb him  --  but after a moment 's hesitation , she knocked softly and went in . I lc was sitting at his desk , a letter before . him , and he looked up as she came to stand beside him . " I 've been trying to write to Ellsworth 's parents , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamplight , was worn and heavy . Mary saw the last lines he had written . " . . . to the memory of my young friend and your brave and early fallen child .. . May God give you that consolation which is beyond all earthly power . . . " While she watched , he signed the letter and laid down his pen . Mary was silent for a moment , then she said slowly , " Do you know , Mr. Lincoln , when I lived in Lexington there was a doctor in town named Jackson . He used to come to our house often  --  and I remember how he told us that our Alex made him think of his little brother Jimmy . Jimmy was very like Alex , he said  --  gay and naughty and alwaysP2I2 into mischief . I heard this afternoon that Jimmy Jackson was the man who killed Ellsworth . " Mary paused . " And then I heard that one of Ellsworth 's men had killed Jackson . I suppose in the South tonight they 're wanting revengeagainst the man who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because Jimmy killed Ells-worth . " Mr. Lincoln scaled the letter and sat looking down at it . " Yes , " he said . " And one cry is just like another ... " The morning they brought Ellsworth back was mild and sweet . Sitting next to Mr. Lincoln while the funeral service was read , Mary felt the warm breeze that stirred the black draperies she had hung to cover the crimson curtains in the East Room . She looked at the flag-draped coffin , and thought of Ellsworth , going through the manual of arms to amuse Tad and Willie . She remembered the new window pane in the south parlor , with the glazier 's marks still fresh on it . She saw this room , thinkinghow she had fretted over it , wanting so to have it handsome to impress Kate Chase and the other ladies . She remembered the deep lines of tenderness and grief about Mr. Lincoln 's mouth as he had sealed the letter to Ellsworth'sparents , whom he had never seen . Hearing the words of death , measured and final in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear . It was as though a world had splintered at her feet , in jagged , shining fragments . THEY SAID IN WASHINGTON THAT NOWADAYS A MAN HAD to be a Westerner to get anywhere . " Unless a fellow 's been a rail splitter  --  or at least a hogip213caller  --  he do n't stand a show with Abe 's gang . And what 's Lincoln up to anyway ? Playing politics and finding jobs for all his Republican friends while the South steals a march on us . " " These Democrats hold tight to their seats , " Mr. Lincoln said . " If the news got out there was a post office being given away at the South Pole the road there would be paved with frozen Virginians . " For three months Washington had watched the northerntroops arrive , march through the city , and disappear across the Long Bridge to join the Army of the Potomac . The first enthusiasm for the shining brigades in their brave uniforms had begun to wear thin . All this hoopla was well enough , people said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ? " Why do n't they fight ? We 've sent the boys and the money . What 's Lincoln waiting for ? " " If we do n't get a move on , the war will be lost before we 've begun it . They got the boys to sign up for three months  --  and the time 's most out already . Why do n't they go ahead and take Richmond and finish up the thing so 's they can get back home ? " The generals were after Mr. Chase for more money . But the Treasury was empty , and when the secretary appealed to Congress , Congress said they could n't raise any more till they had something to show for what they 'd spent already . People had no heart for this war anyhow , and unless they saw some signs of action soon they 'd lose patience altogether . Chase went back to the Cabinet , and the Cabinet appealed to Mr. Lincoln . " There 's such a thing as striking while public opinion is hot , " they said nervously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ howling for a victory . " " Yes , " Mr. Lincoln said , " and so is the South . " " But the longer we wait , the better chance the enemy has to prepare . If you could only persuade General Scott to make some sort of move  --  just to keep people quiet  --  " " Well , " Mr. Lincoln said , " I 'll try . I 'll talk to Scott again , and see what he says . " But Scott and General McDowell , who was commandingthe Army of the Potomac , shook their heads . " Hang public opinion , " old Scott said . " What do the fool preachers and congressmen know about a war ? Just let us try an attack once  --  and fail  --  and then see where your public opinion leaves you . " The general was in his parlor , his gouty leg propped up on a stool . The window blinds , drawn against the hot June sun , let through thin strips of light that lay across the flowered carpet . Mr. Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beneath his chair , his hands resting on his knees . " McDowell is doing all he can , " Scott said , " but the troops they 've sent him are nothing more than schoolboys . They act as though the whole business were some sort of holiday  --  and talk about going home again in a few weeks . It takes some doing to lick boys as green as that into an army  --  and it takes money too . Tell your damned politiciansthat . " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " What about the regular army , general ? We 've been supporting one all these years . " The old man snorted . " The regular army is lined up against us , fighting for the South  --  the best of them , anyway . " He reached out to pour himself a drink . " Better have one with me before you go , " he said , as Mr. Lincoln stood up . " Good whisky 's the only thing to keep a man alive in weather like this . . . No ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . Ca n't move around much , with this confounded leg . " " That 's all right , I can let myself out , " Mr. Lincoln said . He stood a moment , looking thoughtful , then he stooped and picked up his hat . " I 'll tell them what you 've said . I believe you and General McDowell know best  --  butp215it 's a hard job keeping these fellows from blowing the roof off . " Hearing the outer door shut , the general drained his glass and leaned back , easing his collar . Queer chap , Lincoln , he thought . Not half bad , as politicians went . None of the usual poppycock  --  and he had the decency to give a man credit for knowing what he was about . He 'd never have the stuff to amount to much of a soldier  --  too apt to shilly-shally around and see two sides to a question . But Seward and Cameron and Chase were fools . Thinking they could run an army from their damned department desks . The air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general shifted a little , grunting at the sharp twinge of pain in his leg . His grizzled chin dropped forward , and his eyes closed . . . He could n't see that this war they 'd cooked up made much sense on either side . You spent your life building up a decent army , and then it split in two and began to fight itself . Sense or not , though , it was war . And war was still a soldier 's business , even when you had your own men against you . It was hard to think of them  --  Jeb Stuart , Jackson , Longstrcet , Beauregard , Joe , Johnston . . . the best officers that ever came out of West Point . All gone . And you were left in the soup , with a mess of brigadiers who 'd never fired a gun and troops so green they would n't burn with a fire under them . And the damned politicians . " The generals say we ca n't fight without more money , and Congress wo n't raise any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mary . " I ca n't tell where the head ends and the tail begins . " " You 'd better listen to the generals , " Mary said . " I do n't trust Chase  --  or Seward either . They 're both jealous of you , Mr. Lincoln . Like as not they 're trying to scheme things so that the war goes badly , and you 'll be dis-credited . " " Oh , come now , mother  --  they 're not as bad as all that . "  | Mary shrugged . " I do n't expect you to believe me , though you listen to everyone else 's advice gladly enough , I notice . I should think I might talk to you once in a while , Mr. Lincoln . I 'm not entirely lacking in intelli-gence- " Why , mother , I never said you were . " " No ; but you act it . Which is worse . Let me breathe one word of criticism against your precious Cabinet and you laugh at me and accuse me of being suspicious  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard on them , mother . " " All the same , I have eyes , Mr. Lincoln . And what I say is true . Everyone knows Chase wanted to be president  --  and if only you were n't so blind , you 'd see that he 'd stop at nothing now to take the honor away from you . " " Well , he 's welcome to the honor  --  if he can find any , " Mr. Lincoln said . " If he 'll just find some way to get us out of this hash . " The last of June melted into July , and the heat grew worse . It hung over the crowded city while Congress stewed and sweated , and the Cabinet met in shirt sleeves , Secretary Welles lifting his beard to fan his neck with a large palm-leaf . They consumed gallons of the iced ginger beer Mary sent up . And still the war hung stalemate . For Mary , the days were endless . It was impossible to keep the boys quiet . They raced and played and rode Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when night came they were too restless and exhausted to sleep , and complained fretfully of headaches . Mary worried incessantly . She held long conversations with Mrs. Keckley over the dangers of malaria and typhoid , and the menace of the old sewage canal that wound past the foot of the White House grounds and spread foul smells and disease through the city . Now that Cousin Lizzie had gone home to Springfield , Mary had no one but Mrs. Keckley to talk to . Mr. Lincoln was busy all day and half the night , and when he came top217meals he sat staring at his plate , eating little and hardly seeming to hear when Mary spoke . It was too hot for Mary to go driving , and there was nothing left to do . After the long years of work , with the constant pressure of time at her heels , leisure was like a friend long lost and grown unfamiliar . As for callers , there were none . The Red Room , which Mary and Mr. Montrose had decorated so charmingly as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unused . Kate Chase and the southern ladies had seen to that . Miss Kate 's pointed tongue grew no duller with the passing months , and she had the ear of every important person in Washington . Mary , alone in the White House , had the ear of no one save the President , and he could not always be counted on to listen . In the confused hate that boiled up everywhere , criticismthat had begun as dinner-table gossip was taken up and given the dignity of serious charges . Anything that would make the President look bad was welcomed by nine-tenths of the press , and stories about the President 's wife were relished as spicy side dishes to vary the steady diet of vitriol . The President 's wife was extravagant . She was vain , ill-tempered , stingy , mean and vulgar . She was a meddler , interfering with her husband 's decisions , and playing politics to satisfy her personal grudges . Best of all , she was accused of being a spy . Rumors of her Confederate sympathies , enlarged and glorified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemn truths . It might be a good idea , Mr. Lincoln suggested one day , if Mary were to take the boys and go away for a while . To the mountains or the seashore . Just until the hot spell blew over . Mary flared up instantly . " Do you want to get rid of me , Mr. Lincoln ? " No , no . Of course not . He was patient . He 'd only thought she might enjoy a little change . Washington was no kind of place in summer  --  and the boys seemed to be getting all tuckered out .. . So long as Mr. Lincoln must stay , Mary said , there was nothing , nothing that would induce her to leave him . She would be miserable every moment she was gone  --  knowing he needed her with him . Mr. Lincoln sighed and said no more . From that day on , Mary was careful never to complain of anything in Mr. Lincoln 's presence . She made light of the weather , and insisted that the boys were thriving on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the fevers that had worried her so , lest Mr. Lincoln should again suggest her going away . It was a curious fear that made her dread the thought of leaving him . As though she must cling , in the midst of the many pressures that pulled him this way and that , to the little that was still hers . She must hold fast , or else he would be lost altogether . It was a relief when Ben Helm , Emilie 's husband , came for a few days ' visit . He brought messages from Emilie and the others at home , and Mary welcomed him eagerly , hungry for news . While Ben was at the White House , Mr. Lincoln offered him a commission in the Union army . We need young men like you , " Mr. Lincoln said . And it would be a fine thing for Mother if she could have Emilie here . To tell you the truth , Ben , it 's been kind of lonesome since we came to Washington . " Urged by Mary , Ben wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were some men in New York he 'd have to talk to first . Men who had been at West Point with him . Southerners , like himself . The day Ben left , Mary put her arms around him . " Try to come back , Ben , " she said . " We need you  --  so much . " A week later Ben 's letter came , addressed to Mary . He 'd thought it all over . She was please to tell Mr. Lincoln that he was deeply honored by his offer , but now that he had talked with his friends , he could n't see his way clear toP219accepting . There was one man in particular , Colonel Robert Lee , who had just resigned his post at West Point to go home to Virginia . " He did n't try to influence me to join the Confederacy , " Ben wrote . " Lee told me he is not in favor of secession . He is so opposed to this war that he hopes never to draw his sword in it  --  but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I. " Ben hoped Mary and Mr. Lincoln would understand . Mary encountered General Scott at the White House a few days after Ben 's letter came . His leg was still troubling him and he leaned heavily on his cane . " I had a young officer on my staff in the Mexican Wars , " he said . " Name was Lee . I 've just heard he 's resigned to go south . " The old man was silent a moment , sucking in his cheeks . " Pity we 've had to lose him too . He was the best soldier I ever saw . " He looked at Mary out of pale , expressionlesseyes . " I 'm a Virginian myself , " Scott said . MARY CAME ACROSS AN UNEXPECTED LETTER IN HER MAILone morning . Carefully written , on ruled white paper , it said the writer , one Rebecca Orville , would greatly appreciatean interview with Mrs. Lincoln on a matter of business . She hesitated to impose on Mrs. Lincoln 's time  --  which she realized must be crowded  --  but if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a few words of " advice and counsel . " Astonished by the novelty of anyone 's wishing to consult her on anything requiring advice and counsel , Mary showed the letter to Mr. Stoddard . " You 'd better let me find out who this woman is before you answer , " Mr. Stoddard said . " People are trying all sorts of queer tricks nowadays . "  | " Nonsense , Mr. Stoddard . " Mary brushed aside his cautionimpatiently . " Anyone can see this person is n't planningany mischief . " She took the letter . " I shall write today , and ask Miss Orville to come and see me . It ca n't do any harm , certainly , to hear what she has to say . " The afternoon when Miss Orville was expected , Mary ordered tea served in the Red Room . She was ready promptly at four , pleased with her new mauve silk gown and the prospect of a visitor . At five minutes past , there was a knock at the door and one of the pantrymaids , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a woman waiting with a note from Mrs. Lincoln , and what should they do ? What should they do ? Mary echoed sharply . Why , show her in , of course . She had left word that a caller was expected . And why on earth , she wondered with annoyance , had n't Edwards had her properly ushered in , instead of fetching out this creature from the pantry ? " But , Mrs. Lincoln , " the maid looked more flustered than ever . " This woman is colored . " Mary looked at her blankly . " Edwards told her there must 've been a mistake , ma'am . He sent her around to the kitchen to wait  --  " Mary rallied quickly . " There 's been no mistake , " she said . " Please bring Miss Orville to me at once . " " In here , Mrs. Lincoln ? " " Certainly . " " But  --  what shall we do about tea , ma'am ? You ordered it served  --  " " Serve it , of course . " Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Orville  --  and mind you 're civil about it . " A few minutes later a young mulatto woman , quiet and well mannered , was shown in . Mary greeted her kindly , apologizing for the delay and misunderstanding at the door . She talked pleasantly , anxious to put Miss Orville at her ease , but it was entirely impossible to overlook the glaring insolence of the pantrymaid who presently ap/peared with tea . Without waiting to serve the guest , the maid disappeared , slamming the door behind her . Mary saw the embarrassment on her guest 's face . She saw also that the tea was half cold , and the only refreshmentswere a few stale-looking cakes carelessly arranged on an ordinary kitchen plate . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Lincoln , " the woman said . " I expect I should have told you more about myself before I came . But I  --  did n't think you 'd be expecting me to take tea  --  " Mary rose and handed Miss Orville her cup . " I 'm very glad you could come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cakes . " I only hope I 'll be able to give you the advice you wanted . " Miss Orville explained that she was a teacher . She was also a member of the colored Presbyterian church on FifteenthStreet , and through the church an effort was being made to supply some sort of school for the Negro children in Washington . " There are a great many free colored people in the city , Mrs. Lincoln . " Miss Orville leaned forward earnestly . " We 're respectable people . Quite a lot of us own our own homes , and pay taxes . But we have n't any way of educatingour children . " The District had laws , she said , forbidding Negroes to enter any public building , and this included the schools . They had to obey a special curfew which kept them off the streets after ten o'clock at night . " We try to do as much as we can for ourselves . We have enough teachers  --  and we 've been holding classes for the children in the church . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular school building . " They had raised the necessary money , Miss Orville said , but their plan had been blocked by a number of Washingtoncitizens who were objecting to the idea of educating the Negro children . Unless they could get some support from influential people , the whole plan would be lost . The woman talked well , without either rancor or false humility , and Mary listened sympathetically . She would speak to Mr. Lincoln at once , she promised , and see what could be done . Miss Orville was grateful , but she seemed rather taken aback by the suggestion . They would n't want to trouble the President with their affairs at a time like this  --  when he had so much important work to do . They had thought perhaps if Mrs. Lincoln would just be willing to mention the school to some of her friendsMary smiled inwardly at the picture of herself murmuringthe suggestion into influential ears . But she assured Miss Orville that she would do her best . She was pleased and touched by the gratitude in the woman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will always remember your kindness , Mrs. Lincoln , " Miss Orville said warmly . Remembering the difficulty with Edwards at the door , Mary was careful to escort her guest out personally . As they walked through the hall , Mary saw Edwards 's glower of disapproval . He climbed down from his stool , and at the very moment when he swung open the front door and Mary turned to shake hands cordially with Miss Orville , a carriage swept up beneath the portico outside and a flunky in mulberry livery stepped smartly from the box . Mary froze . There was only one carriage in Washington with that livery . It was Secretary Chase , arriving for a meeting of the Cabinet . But it was not at Mr. Chase that Mary looked . She barely saw him as he hurried past her and up the stairs . Her eye was fixed on the carriage outside , where Miss Kate , all in cool white , with a parasol tipped elegantly over her sharp , pretty face , was leaning forward . And from the gleam of amused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , Mary knew that the little scene of the President 's wife shaking hands with a Negro woman at the White House door had not gone unobserved . There was no chance for Mary to speak to Mr. Lincoln that evening . The Cabinet meeting dragged on until tenp223o'clock , at which time General Scott arrived , to stump upstairs and remain closeted with the President for another two hours . Next morning , when Mr. Lincoln came in to breakfast , he told Mary that a plan of attack against the Confederates had finally been drawn up . General McDowell would move his army against Beauregard at Manassas  --  while General Patterson held the other half of the southern force in the Shenandoah valley . " Sherman thinks we 're still not ready , " Mr. Lincoln said , " but General Scott finally gave his consent last night . " Mary looked at him anxiously . His face was drawn and gray . " They talk and talk , " Mrs. Lincoln said , and the more they talk , the worse it sounds . " But as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The long , dreary delay was over , and the city came out of its midsummer doldrums to celebrate . The voices around the bar at Willard 's were loud with bragging . " We ca n't lose . Now the fool politicians have quit their wrangling  --  we 're sure to win . We 've got more men , more generals , more equipment . The damned Rebcls 'll run like rabbits once they see we really mean to fight . " The young officers , riding up from the Potomac camps that evening , raised their glasses in a fine spirit of defiance . They had never seen a battle , most of them , but the light of victory shone brightly in their eyes . " We 'll show the measly Graybacks a thing or two , " they vowed thickly . " Just let us throw one good scare into them  --  and they 'll kite for home fast enough . " Returning to their camps , late in the hot night , the officerssounded off alarms to see what their troops would do . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers were doubled up , convulsed by the killing spectacle of the men , half dazed with sleep , brandishing their guns and rushing about with shouts that the Rebs were on them . It was a great success.  | The mood of stunning self-confidence that emanated from the plush and gilt interior of Willard 's that night only intensified the public conviction that the coming battle was bound to rout the southern armies . People in the streets spoke happily of getting the boys home again . And high time too . July list , the day set for the attack , was popularly regarded as the end of the war . Even old General Scott caught a trace of the prevailing cheer , and admitted things looked promising enough . A smile lighted Mr. Lincoln 's tired eyes when he heard that , but Mary shook her head . " They forget one thing , Mr. Lincoln , " she said . " The South is fighting for its life in this war . Our men , most of them , are only fighting because they 've been told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his study , looking through a glass toward the Virginia hills , low and rolling . From a steepletop in Alexandria the stars and bars of the Confederacy floated defiantly in the breeze . Mary stood beside him . " General Scott says our troops are still as green as grass , " she said . " Well , so are the Rebels green , mother , " Mr. Lincoln said . He put down the glass with a sigh . " I suppose it will be a contest to see which side is greenest . " With all Mr. Lincoln 's attention taken up by conferencesover the new developments , Mary still found no chance to bring up the subject of Miss Orville 's school . Meanwhile , wanting to talk to someone , she confided in Mr. Stoddard . " After all , " Mary said , " ' Washington does n't seem to regard me very favorably as an ornament to the Capital  --  so I may as well try making myself useful . I like this plan of Miss Orville 's  --  she 's sensible and honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've promised her to come and see the building where they plan to have the school , and then , as soon as Mr. Lincoln has more time , I shall consult him about it . He 's quite certain to approve  --  " P225Mary broke off , aware that Mr. Stoddard was frowning in a peculiar way . " You do n't seem very enthusiastic , Mr. Stoddard . " He glanced up , embarrassed . Rather reluctantly , doing his best to be tactful , he suggested that Mrs. Lincoln 's takingup such a plan might be awkward . Washington people might misunderstand , and there would be talk . " Talk ? " Mary 's brows rose sharply . " There 's talk enough anyway , I should think . They ca n't say worse things of me than they do already , Mr. Stoddard  --  and this , at least , would have the novelty of being true . " Mr. Stoddard shook his head . This , he said , was different . At a time like this , with feeling running so high , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chance to jump on anything to discredit the President . And for the President'swife to sponsor a school for Negroes . . . He paused . It was the devil and all trying to explain what he meant . With Mrs. L. sitting there watching him , touchy as a firecracker and refusing to see what was as plain as a nose on a face . Of all things , he thought despairingly , for her to have gone and got herself keyed up about . " They 've accused me of being a Southerner and a spy , Mr. Stoddard . Would n't this prove that I 'm not pro-slavery ? " Mr. Stoddard hesitated again . " I 'm afraid people who circulate such stories are n't likely to be convinced by any sort of proof , Mrs. Lincoln . " " Then what am I to do , pray ? Just sit by  --  and do nothingat all ? " " Well  --  for the present , it might be best . In these times , one ca n't be too cautious  --  " Whack " Mary 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenness that stopped Mr. Stoddard short . There  --  he 'd gone and done it now . For all his pains , and trying to be tactful , he 'd got her in a wax and no mistake . " Mr. Stoddard , I will not hear that word cautious again  --  " Mary 's eyes blazed . " Every fool in this city talks of nothing but being cautious . You sound like Mr. Lincoln , forever saying we must go slowly . " " Mrs. Lincoln , please  --  " Mr. Stoddard glanced uneasily at the door . " You may be overheard  --  " " I have n't the slightest doubt I 'm being overheard , Mr. Stoddard . Every word I utter in this wretched house is overheard  --  with servants peeping and spying at the keyholesfor some new gossip to spread all over town . And then you talk to me of caution . I 've tried your precious caution , Mr. Stoddard , and what has it got me ? Nothing but hatred and lies . Spiteful , vicious lies about me  --  about Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes  --  I know . " Mr. Stoddard mopped his forehead . " I realize it 's been most trying . But we can only be patient , Mrs. Lincoln -- and try to understand . . . " " Mr. Stoddard  --  do for mercy 's sake stop trying to soothe me . " Mary 's voice trembled with fury . " You talk to me as though I were ill  --  or out of my mind . I shall thank you to remember that I 'm neither . I tell you , Mr. Stoddard , I know quite well what I 'm saying . I 'm sick of caution . Sick to death . Ever since I came into this house , I 've heard nothing but that hateful word . I must be cautious  --  Imust be careful  --  I must n't do this or that for fear of being misunderstood . I ca n't go into a shop to buy a new dress without being accused of extravagance . I must hold my tongue and smile no matter what lies they spread about me . I dare n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in the South and I 'll be called a traitor . I 'm spied on and talked about in my own house  --  but I ca n't discharge a servant who is insolent to me for fear of having more vile stories spread about me . And then you tell me I must be patient and try to understand  --  " Her voice broke bitterly . " You are the one who does n't understand , Mr. Stoddard . How can I be patient when I 'm humiliated every day of my life ? I 'll go mad if I keep on this way  --  doing nothing  --  afraid to speak or move . I 'm practically a prisoner in this house . "   " I know  --  I know , Mrs. Lincoln . Believe me , I see how difficult it 's been , but still , you must think of your posi-tion  --  " " My position ! " Mary flung the word back at him furiously . " My position is a laughingstock , Mr. Stoddard . Washington : has seen to that . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you and the others pity me . You talk about me behind my back  --  oh , do n't deny it , Mr. Stoddard , I know the things you say . Do n't you think I read the letters my son Robert writes to me ? Asking me to be more careful , more discreet , because there has been so much talk . What do you think I care for my position when my own son is ashamed of the lies he hears about me ? And you dare to sit there telling me I must think of my position . You 're a young fool , Mr. Stoddard . A blundering , self-important fool ! " Mary sank back in her chair . The anger died out of her in a shuddering wave , leaving only misery . She covered her eyes , feeling the tears against her fingers , helpless and shaming . And through the spinning emptiness she could hear Mr. Stoddard 's words . His distressed apologies . He was so sorry  --  he had n't meant to say anything that would upset her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allow herself to get so overwrought . No matter how unreasonable he thought her , Mary realized , he must try to make amends now . He must cater to her , humor her , give in to her . Not because he had an ounce of affection or respect for her  --  but merely because she was Mr. Lincoln 's wife , and so she must n't be offended . She dropped her hands . " It 's quite all right , Mr. Stoddard , " she said . Somehow , she felt , out of this ridiculous and shameful scene she must manage to show him she was n't an utter fool . She stood up , shakily , and smiled at him , a smile that bit deep in the corners of her mouth . " You see  --  there 's no reason to be alarmed , Mr. Stoddard . I 'm quite myself . "   She began to gather up her letters , fumbling at them , cramming the edges into an even pile . At the door , she turned to look back . Mr. Stoddard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the school , Mr. Stoddard  --  I mean to go ahead just as I said . After all , I gave my word to Miss Orville  --  " Mr. Stoddard bowed stiffly . " Very well , Mrs. Lincoln . " She closed the door . Crossing from the Red Room , past the dour glance of Edwards , Mary moved swiftly . She went up the stairs , her head held carefully high . And the full sweep of her stiff blue gown hid the trembling of her knees . The Union attack was set for Sunday morning , at dawn . It was convenient , having the date and hour posted in advance . For half of Washington , it appeared , was making plans to drive down the night before and be on hand to watch the show . It was worth going twenty miles , after all , to see the Union victorious . " Southern chivalry will bite the dust , " they said . " Watching the Graycoats run will be a treat for sore eyes . " By sundown on Saturday all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and lesser dignitaries had marshaled their carriages for the drive . Newspaper correspondents , sightseers , and assorted visitors in the city had besieged the local stables for hired hacks  --  and , after one last round for luck at Willard 's bar , were off to battle . All that night the Long Bridge over the Potomac rumbled beneath the carriage wheels , and by morning Washington was practically a desert . Everyone who was anyone had gone . It would never have done to leave out the ladies . They were as anxious as any to see the fray  --  and nearly every party had its quota of crinoline skirts and gaily ribboned bonnets . The ladies obligingly squeezed themselves intop229corners to make room for the loaded picnic hampers at their feet , and they set the sultry night air ringing with their gallant cries . " On to Richmond ! " Tad and Willie , kept awake by the brave shouts of the departing company , grumbled bitterly at being left out of the fun . " But why ca n't we go , mamma ? Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnny Rebs run too . " That night McDowell and Sherman sat late , talking with their lieutenants . The tent flaps were pinned back to let in the faint breeze , and the candles flickered , throwing shadows on the grave faces bent above the maps . On the far side of Bull Run Creek , beyond its yellow , muddy banks , were Beauregard and Jackson , Longstreet and Joe Johnston . The moon , rising late , shone clear . High and impartial , it floated through the night , making the tents bright where the soldiers lay , turning restlessly in a half-sleep , waiting ... THE SABBATH MORNING BROKE , HOT AND RED . All day , in Washington , the telegraph wires clicked , bringing news . McDowell had attacked , and things appeared to be going well . The plan was working like a charm . By three o'clock that afternoon , Mr. Lincoln rose from his desk . He went to find Mary . " Well , mother , it looks as though they 've pulled it off . " He stuffed the latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He might walk down to General Scott's house , Mr. Lincoln said , and see what he thought of the news . Mary was waiting at the front window when Mr. Lincolncame back . " Well ? " she looked at him closely . " What did Scott say ? " " He said it was damned hot . " Mr. Lincoln sat down and pulled out a red cotton handkerchief to wipe his face . " But he admitted things look pretty favorable . " There seemed to be a lull in the telegraph messages . " I guess the worst is over , mother , " Mr. Lincoln said . " Why do n't you order up the carriage ? A breath of air might do us both good . " They drove for an hour , and everywhere in the streets the people seemed in high good humor . Some of them waved as the President 's carriage passed . Now and then there was a voice raised in cheerful greeting . " Good luck , Abe ! " " Hurray for Lincoln and our side ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheers . " Our stock seems to have gone up , mother , " he said . When they came back to the White House , Mr. Nicolaywas waiting on the front steps . He came forward at once , with an odd expression . " Mr. Lincoln , may I have a word with you ? " A moment later Mr. Lincoln turned back to Mary . " Seward was here while we were gone , " he said . " He 's over at the War Office now . I think I 'll just walk over and see what 's up . " Mary felt a twinge of alarm . " It 's bad news , Mr. Lincoln  --  " She put her hand on his arm . " I know it is  --  do n't try to hide it from me  --  " " Now , mother  --  " he patted her hand consolingly  --  " it 's no use getting all fired up . Seward did n't say there was anything wrong . Most likely he 's just got some bee in his bonnet he wants to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ahead with supper . I 'll be as quick as I can . " P231But there was an uneasy note in Mr. Lincoln 's voice that troubled Mary . All through supper , while the boys gabbled noisily about the news of the battle , she was listening  --  waiting for the sound of Mr. Lincoln 's step . By eight o'clock , when it was time for the boys to go to bed , he still had n't come . Willie was teasing for a story . " Mother , you said you would . You promised , if we won the fight today you 'd read us extra  --  " Mary looked down at Willie 's flushed face . He and Taddiehad been up since dawn  --  and she had been too preoccupiedto notice how long they had stayed outdoors , racing in the sun . They were both fretful and keyed up , after the excitement of the long day . " Please , Willie , you and Tad go to bed like good boys . I --  " Mary paused , glancing at the door . She thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll read to you tomorrow . And I 'll play with you all day  --  truly I will . " But , mamma , you said tonight . You said  --  " Mary bit back a quick jab of impatience . Hastily , before Taddie should start to cry , she promised that Mrs. Keckleycould read . You can tell her I said she might . " " As long as we want her to , mamma ? " ' Caddie 's eye , never slow to catch a bargain , brightened artfully . " Until we go to sleep , mamma ? " " Yes , I suppose so  --  if you 'll only go quietly now . " As the boys rushed upstairs , Mary followed slowly . She ought to be more firm with them really . They were getting so out of hand . But it was difficult , with the house always filled with people , and hours so irregular . Hearing Mrs. Keckley 's voice , calm and reassuring , and the door close , Mary turned into her sitting room . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was stiflingly hot in the room , and her head ached , with a dull , insistent beat . She pressed her hands against her eyes . Where was Mr. Lincoln ? Why did n't he come ? Surely he could n't have forgotten that she was waiting . . She turned abruptly and went to the wardrobe , to fetch out a bonnet and gloves . There was n't any reason to stay here . She could send for the carriage and drive awhile . It was barely dusk , and out of the house at least she could breathe . As the carriage turned down the avenue , Mary leaned back and closed her eyes . There  --  it was better now . The heaviness , the vague uneasy feeling was gone . The sound of people 's voices and the smart clatter of traffic on the cobbled street were comforting . She drew a long breath , and opened her eyes . They were nearly at the corner in front of Willard 's Hotel . A crowd was gathered there , grouped about the door , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling something and waving a paper . Mary glanced curiously . It was odd that the man should shout so . She bent forward , trying to catch the words , but they were lost in the noise and confusion . Everyone seemed to be shouting now . But it could n't be good news that made them act like this , Mary thought . The faces she saw looked angry and frightened . Suddenly a woman screamed , close by the carriage . Mary turned , and saw the woman throw up her hands . " They 're coming  --  the Rebels are coming ! " The woman rushed out into the street , her arms waving , her bonnet half off . " They 're marching on the city  --  and we 'll all be killed  --  murdered . . . " Still screaming hysterically , the woman barely missed beingstruck by Mary 's carriage . The coachman managed to swerve just in time , but the startled horses plunged , lurchingthe carriage so that Mary was nearly thrown out . There were more voices now , rising shrill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beaten us  --  " " Our troops are routed  --  " " They 're marching on us  --  we 'll be killed  --  " " We 'll all be killed  --  " The carriage heaved again . The coachman , caught in the sudden , milling rush , struggled to quiet the horses and steer them clear of the crowd . But it was already tooP233late . Someone had recognized Mary  --  and they were closing in around her , screaming and shaking their fists . Jeers and hoots rose in a frightening chorus . " There she is  --  look ! " " There 's Mrs. Lincoln ! " A rough-looking man , bolder than the rest , pushed his way through the crowd and leaped onto the carriage step . " Uncoil  --  It 's to blame for this ! " The man pushed a hairy face close to Mary 's . " He 'll pay for it  --  just wait and see . We 'll make him pay  --  see if we do n't  --  " Mary shrank back , clutching the seat , her hands clammy , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sweating , leering face . She could feel his breath , fuming with whisky . She saw the coachman turn  --  saw him raise his whip  --  but she managed to speak in time , and at her sharp command , he lowered the whip . The man still clung to the step , pouring out a stream of black abuse . Suddenly a girl at the edge of the crowd brandished her fringed parasol . " Hurray for Jeff Davis ! " The girl 's voice rose defiantly . " God is on the side of the South ! " For a moment the crowd 's attention was diverted from Mary as they turned on the girl , trying furiously to howl her down . But she was instantly surrounded by Rebel sympathizers . A tall gentleman flung his hat into the air . " Three cheers for Beauregard . Old Beau has knocked the damned Yankees into a cocked hat . " " The South has won  --  " " Down with the South ! " Another gentleman seized the tall Southerner 's topper and drove his fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " In the brawling confusion , the coachman saw his chance . He wheeled the horses , and whipped them up . The carriage swayed perilously , then righted , and the next instant they were clattering up the cobbled street while the howling melee died in the distance . Only the burly man , shaken loose from the step when the carriage turned , followed a little way , still shouting.  | " She 's a dirty spy . Lincoln 's wife 's a spy . . . " And then he too was left behind . Old Edwards had been dozing on his perch by the door when Mary came in . She stared at him , blinking in the sudden light after the dusk outside . " Has  --  Mr. Lincoln come yet , Edwards ? " Yes , a few minutes ago . He 'd gone upstairs with Mr. Seward and Mr. Cameron . There was to be a Cabinet meeting , Edwards said . He was looking at Mary , moved to curiosity for once by the sight of her white face . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her knees were like water , and her hands shook as she tried to straighten her hat , but she managed to turn toward the stairs . Once her hand was on the banis- ter , she felt safer . She paused , gathering her strength . Edwards was still watching , puzzled . She must have heard the news , judging from the look of her . Or else seen a ghost . He 'd never thought to see her like that  --  her , with her proud eye and her head always in the air , as if the ground were too poor a thing to give a glance to . He followed a little way , thinking she might need a hand  --  and when she was halfway up , he remembered to call after her . " Mr. Lincoln said to tell you when you came in , ma'am  --  there 's nothing to worry about . " It was nearly one o'clock when Mary heard the door of the Cabinet room open , and the sound of the departing gentlemen 's steps . She went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the head of the stairs alone . He did n't seem surprised to see her standing there , still dressed . He only looked at her . " What is it , mother ? " His voice was cold and lifeless . Mary hurried to him . " Mr. Lincoln , I had to see you . I had to know . Is it true what people are saying ? The dreadfulthings  --  that we 've been beaten ? " " Yes , it 's true . We lost today . " " But the things they said , Mr. Lincoln  --  I was out on the street and I heard them . The people were so angry  --  P235so frightened . They said we 'd been ruined  --  that we 'd lost everything . They said our army was routed and the men were deserting  --  " " We do n't know yet , " Mr. Lincoln said . " We do n't know just how bad it is . But I do n't believe we 're ruined . We made a mistake , it seems . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake has cost . We must try to find out now how to keep from making more . " " Mr. Lincoln , how could it have happened ? How could everything have gone wrong so suddenly ? You said yourself  --  GeneralScott said , this afternoon  --  " He shook his head slowly . " They did their best , " he said . " McDowell did the best he could . " " How do you know that , Mr. Lincoln ? How can you be sure ? You take things so on faith . " She must shake him out of this lifelessness somehow , Mary thought . Make him listen . " Do n't you see , Mr. Lincoln ? They could have tricked you into this failure . Because they hate you  --  because they want to make the people blame you . They are blaming you , Mr. Lincoln . The people I saw tonight  --  they were saying you 'd have to answer for this . They said terriblethings . " " Yes , I know . " He paused a minute . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to blame someone . " " But why must it be you , Mr. Lincoln ? Why must you let them put everything on you ? " He came closer and put his hands on her shoulders . " You 're all tired out , mother , " he said . " You 'd better go to bed and try to get some sleep . " It was no use . He had n't even heard her . He 'd listen to the others , trust the others , believe every word they said . But when she spoke , he did n't even hear . " What about you , Mr. Lincoln ? You 're tired too . " " I 'll wait up awhile . There may be more news . " For a moment more she stood looking up at him , wantingso to reach him , to say something that would ease the sadness that lay deep in his eyes . But there was no way . . . She only made things worse . She turned away .   6Passing the study door , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held a sheaf of telegrams in his hand . Glimpsing his face , opaque and expressionless , as she passed , Mary wondered how much he had heard . Everything , no doubt . On the threshold of her room , she turned to look back along the empty corridor . The study door was shut . IN THE MORNING MARY WOKE TO SEE THE RAIN . A GRAY ,  --  listless rain that fell like a chilling curtain after the days of heat . She got up and dressed , smoothing her hair into place , and crossed to Mr. Lincoln 's room . The door stood half open , and she saw the bed untouched . Down the hall , in front of the study , Mr. Hay was standing guard . He touched his lips warningly as Mary came near . " Mr. Hay , where is Mr. Lincoln ? " " In the study  --  sleeping . People have been coming in to see him all night , and he insisted on staying up to talk to them . They 'd come back from the fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " " You should have called me , Mr. Hay . He ought to have had something to eat  --  " Mr. Hay had seen to that . He had ordered up coffee and eggs at five o'clock . " But surely he ca n't be warm enough . Sleeping on that couch  --  it 's turned so cool . He 'll need a blanket , Mr. Hay . " Mr. Hay had attended to that too . He had fetched a quilt from his own room and put it over Mr. Lincoln . Mary bit her lip . She looked over Mr. Hay 's shoulder , at the closed door . Then , slowly , she walked back to her room . By nine o'clock the cavalcade of visitors had begunp237again . All that day it kept up , steady and monotonous as the rain . Congressmen and senators , the sightseers who had started out so confidently to the battlefield were back now  --  their eyes wide , their voices hoarse , as they described the horrors they had seen . The utter rout of McDowell 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , panicstrickenretreat . They were full of indignant stories . Of officers lashing their men , trying to force them back into line . Of deserters , throwing down their guns and running wildly off the field into the woods . In awestruck tones the gentlemen told how narrowly they had managed to escape with their own lives . Their carriages had been all but wrecked by the deserting wretches who had cut loose from their regiments and were crowding the roads north . Sitting at his desk , Mr. Lincoln heard the accounts , breathless and dramatic . " I congratulate you , gentlemen , " he said dryly , " on winning the race . " By late afternoon the returning stream of carriages had stopped  --  and the soldiers , on foot , began to straggle in . Their boots , still caked with Virginia mud , left tracks on the new stair carpet as they filed up to Mr. Lincoln 's office . The stories they had to tell were briefer . After walkingtwenty miles , they had n't much breath left to shout . The fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , until midafternoon . Then something had happened  --  no one could quite tell what . But the enemy had taken a new hold  --  begun rushing them . And before they could reformto counterattack , Jackson 's troops had been on them . They came like a gray wave  --  with a yelling that was like no sound they 'd ever heard . The Union officers had done the best they could  --  some of them , anyway  --  but the men were running wild . Companies had got broken up , and everybody was too scared to pay much attention to orders . And those confounded carriages that had come down from Washington  --  cluttering up the field  --  and the ladies screaming blue murder . It had been a mess .   Mr. Lincoln sat at his desk , listening . Listening to anyone who would come in and talk . Listening to excuses , explanations , stories of the long trek back to the city . Of roads jammed with men who were lost or who had deserted , retreating helter-skelter through the night  --  of the carriages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick up those who had fallen by the way . Stories of wounded men who had walked all night long , supported by their comrades . . . Listening . . . Coming downstairs into the front hall that afternoon , Mary found a group of soldiers who had just left the President 's office . They were standing by the door , looking out at the rain . Seeing their wet coats and muddy boots , and the exhaustion in their faces , she paused and asked where they were expecting to go . They turned , staring at her dumbly . They did n't rightly know , one said , shuffling his cap . Nobody seemed to know just what they were supposed to do . " But there must be some place for you , " Mary said . " They must have made some arrangements . " The men shook their heads , looking at each other uncertainly . " I guess we can find some place , ma'am . " Mary hesitated , then she turned toward the corridor . " Come with me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Room . " You can make yourselves comfortable here . I 'll have a fire built , so you can dry your clothes , and see about some food right away . " Within an hour there were kettles of soup and coffee boiling on the big ranges in the kitchen , and Mary was supervising trays , having them sent up to the East Room . One of the soldiers had told her there were more men outside , lying on the benches in Lafayette Square across the way , and she had sent Mr. Stoddard over to find them , and bring as many as would come back with him . TheyP239had come in , rain soaked and dazed with fatigue , and been sent to the East Room . When she went up again , Mary found the men silent , grouped about the fire . A few were perched gingerly on the edges of the brocaded chairs and sofas , but most were sitting on the floor . They stared uncomfortably as she came in . One or two stood up . But none of them spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drank hungrily , in silence . Most of the men had taken off their wet coats , and Mary saw that a few had wounds they had bandaged clumsily themselves . She hurried upstairs to find Mrs. Keckley , and together they ransacked the linen closets for old sheets to tear into strips . But when they took the bandages down , it was to Mrs. Keckley that the men turned . Mary was puzzled to notice how easily the men talked to Mrs. Keckley , and how their smiles died and they lapsed into uneasy silence again whenever she approached . But on the whole she was relieved to leave the dressings to Mrs. Keckley 's capable , experienced hands  --  while she went to the kitchen again to sec about fresh coffee . On one trip , she met Mr. Stoddard in the hall . " Mr. Stoddard , if you 're not too busy , would you give me a minute ? Some of the men are so tired , they 've fallen asleep . And they really ought to have some covering . I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them down  --  " " Certainly , Mrs. Lincoln , if you wish it . " Mr. Stoddard 's tone was stiff . Mary glanced at him sharply . What on earth could have got into him to answer like that ? Surely he was n't offended by such a simple request . Then she remembered that they had n't seen each other since the unfortunate discussion about Miss Orville and the school . Good heavens , it was n't possible he was still harping on a little misunderstanding  --  and at a time like this . But evidently he was waiting for her to say something . Mary smiled  | " Mr. Stoddard  --  " He turned . " Mr. Stoddard , I 've been meaning to speak to you . Naturally , I 'm sure you realize that any  --  " she hesitated , still smiling  --  " any differences of opinion between us are not to be taken personally . For my part , I 'm quite sure your advice the other day was entirely well meant . " Mr. Stoddard bowed . " It 's very generous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went on smoothly , while she gathered up the blankets . As a matter of fact , she said , she had talked over the matter with Mr. Lincoln  --  and while he was quite in sympathy , he felt that she had better not undertake any active part in the school until Miss Orville 's plans were more definite . Possibly in the autumn , Mr. Lincoln had said . She had written to Miss Orville and explained . " So you see , Mr. Stoddard , you were quite right after all . " Mary laid the last folded blanket on the pile in Mr. Stoddard 's arms and smiled up at him again , briskly . There  --  she thought . Surely he would see now that she bore him no grudge for their little quarrel . She was on the point of starting toward the stairs to go down when she caught something in Mr. Stoddard 's glance that made her hesitate . It was an odd look about his eyes . A look that was half amused , half pitying . He might have looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been naughty and willful and was trying to make amends by being extra good . Mary lifted her chin . She must look haggard and badly , she thought suddenly . She 'd slept so little the past two nights  --  in the rush this afternoon , she 'd had no time to tidy herself . She pushed back a loose strand of hair from her cheek . " Will you take the blankets please , Mr. Stoddard ? " Her voice was stiff and even . " And tell Mrs. Keckley I shall be down presently . " " Yes , Mrs. Lincoln . " The look vanished from Mr. Stoddard'seyes , leaving them blandly impersonal again . P241He stood aside to let her pass , and she swept by quickly , her chin still high  --  not looking back . Another night passed , and still there was no sign of a Rebel invasion . Washington relaxed . Not a single citizen had been murdered in his sleep . . People came out of the first hysterical shock of defeat , and took time to look around and get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had gone wrong with the glorious Army of the Potomac ? The army that had boasted so loudly the night before the battle ? The army that was in pieces now  --  scattered and disgraced ? Somewhere , they said darkly , there must be a scapegoat in all this  --  and they meant to smoke him out . Congress and the Cabinet said it was the generals ' fault . The generals , soothing their smarting pride , howled backthat it was the meddling politicians who were to blame . And Lincoln . Where was Lincoln in all this ? they demanded . Lincoln would n't say yes and he would n't say no . While the air was thick with hurtling brickbats , Lincoln sat tight , refusing to come out and say who had been to blame . " For mercy 's sake , Mr. Lincoln , why do n't you stop all this argument ? " Mary said impatiently . " Admit that the Rebels fought too well for us  --  and be done with it . " But General Scott thought otherwise . " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man said to Mary . " It was our own blockheadedness . Too many cheers ahead of time . " I-le rubbed the silver head of his cane gloomily . " People think they can win a war just by yelling loud enough they 're going to . Now they 've found they 're wrong  --  and they want to chop off a few heads to make themselves feel better . McDowell 's will be the first to go  --  though he does n't deserve it . And Patterson'stoo . If anyone 's to blame , it 's me  --  for being fool enough to let them talk me into a fight when I knew we were n't ready . But they 'll never think to take my head off . It 's too old ' and tough to give them any satisfaction . "  | " Do you think Mr. Lincoln was wrong ? " Mary asked . " Do you think he ought to have tried to make them wait longer ? " " Of course he was wrong . The politicians are always wrong . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , Lincoln 's man enough to own up to his mistakes  --  and that 's more than the others will ever do . " He looked at Mary in silence for a moment . His eyes , under grizzled brows , were cold and tired . " Lincoln might learn , " he said . " He might turn out to be a pretty good president . Only  --  try to keep him from taking these things too hard . He 's got a long way to go yet . " IN THE WEEKS THAT FOLLOWED , MARY OFTEN FOUND herself remembering the old general 's words . It all happenedjust as he had said it would . McDowell and Pattersonwere in disgrace . And still the grumbling , the endless hue and cry of criticism went on . " Why do n't they do something ? They got us into this war  --  and now they sit and talk  --  and get us nowhere . " The more they railed , it seemed , the less Mr. Lincoln was willing to commit himself to any policy . Floods of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , week after week , he sat in his study listening . " In the name of heaven , Mr. Lincoln , what more is there for you to hear ? " Mary said . " You listen to every Tom , Dick , and Harry who wants to air a crackpot scheme . You take every word your Cabinet utters as though it were graven on tablets of stone . " " Well , mother , they 're the best men I knew how to pick . I have to trust someone . " P243Mary leaned toward him . " Then trust yourself , Mr. Lincoln . " He looked at her for a long moment . Then he sighed . " I wish to God I could . " " Stop listening to everyone who says you are wrong , Mr. Lincoln . Stop blaming yourself for everybody else 's mistakes . You 're the President  --  you 're the one they elected . The whole country is looking at you  --  " He shook his head . " I know it , mother . I wish they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ August , after a month in Springfield . He said little about his visit there , except that everyone was well , but Mary could gather clearly enough from Elizabeth 's letters the shocked fascination with which they dwelt on every shred of criticism against Mr. Lincoln . Robert said little about anything , for that matter , except to tell his father he 'd been thinking seriously of enlisting . Half his class at Harvard had gone already , he said , and it looked queer for him not to . Mr. Lincoln looked at him thoughtfully . " You have n't mentioned this to your mother , have you , Bob ? " Well , not exactly , Robert said . He 'd tried leading up to the subject once or twice , but she had n't been encouraging . " No , I expect not . " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " Your mother 's been upset lately . Things have been pretty hard on her , I guess , since we came to Washington . " He hesitated , weighing a paperknife in his hand . " I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd appreciate it if you could kind of let this thing slide for a while . Maybe later  --  your mother might get more used to the idea . " Robert shrugged . Later might be too late , he said . The war might be over . Mr. Lincoln smiled . " I guess there 's no call to worry about that , Bob . From the looks of things , I 'm afraid you 'll have plenty of time . Only  --  " he looked up quickly  --  " do n't tell Mother I said that , will you ? "  | Robert was careful not to mention the matter again . but Mary was uneasy . The last day before he left for Cambridgeshe asked him to promise her not to enlist . " It 's your father I 'm thinking of , Robert . He has so much to trouble him these days  --  it would n't be fair to add another worry . " Robert was silent . " When you 've finished your education there will be plenty of time to talk of enlisting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , mother  --  for heaven 's sake . " " Well , it 's true , Robert . You 've always had a delicate chest  --  ever since you were a baby . You know what dreadfulcolds you get . And if you were off in camp somewhere during the winter , I should n't have an easy moment . " She put her hand on his . " Please , dear , promise me you wo n't think about it any more . " " I should think you might realize how it makes me look , " Robert said . " With my own father calling for volunteers  --  Ica n't join up because my mother says I have a weak chest . It makes me feel like a fool . " " Oh , Robert  --  " Mary 's eyes filled with tears  --  " how can you speak to me so ? When I 'm asking it for your father 's sake  --  " her fingers tightened . " All right , all right , mother . I 've promised  --  is n't that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her world , rocked for a moment with fear , came back to its precarious balance . She wiped her eyes . " Yes , dear . " Her smile quivered . " If you 've given me your word , Robert , that 's enough . " The nights were the hardest times now . With the late summer heat hanging over the city , Mary could n't sleep . Hour after hour she lay staring into the stifling darkness . She would get up suddenly and cross to the boys ' room , only to find them sleeping . But down the corridor she could see the crack of light under the study door.  |p245Dear  heaven , what could Mr. Lincoln be doing so late ? She would tiptoe down and stand listening . Sometimes there was no sound , but often she could hear his steps , slow and even , moving back and forth , back and forth . There was one night when she opened the door without knocking and went in . Mr. Lincoln turned to look at her . He was standing by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his eyes ringed with weariness . He stood waiting for her to speak , but now that she was here , Mary wondered what it was she had meant to say . She pushed one of her thick braids across the shoulder of her blue robe . " I  --  could n't sleep , Mr. Lincoln . " " I know , mother . Neither can I. " He stood facing her , his shoulders drooping . " I thought perhaps  --  if I could talk to you  --  " But there was n't anything to say , really . After a moment , Mr. Lincoln sighed . " I wish things were easier for you , mother , " he said . " Maybe if you had gone back with Robert  --  and stayed a few days in New York  --  " Talking to Mr. Stoddard one morning , Mary had a suddenidea . The trouble with them all , she said , was that they had had no company for such a long time . " Why should n't we plan a dinner for next week , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I believe a party would do us good . " After the long dull drag of summer , it was nice to have something to plan for again . Mrs. Keckley was making up a new gown for Mary . A patterned white silk , sprigged with small bowknots of cornflower blue . On the morning before the dinner , Mary tried on the frock for a last fitting . While Mrs. Keckley knelt beside her , pinning and snipping , Mary talked more cheerfully than she had in weeks . A thunderstorm the night before had broken the heat , and now a steady rain was falling , P246freshening the baked earth and washing the trees so that the leaves hung dark and glistening . Tad and Willie , pleased by the novelty of a rainy day , were playing checkers on the sewing-room floor . Mary and Mrs. Keckley discussed the plans for the dinner . Mary had decided to make it a larger affair . There were so many people back in the city  --  and it seemed a pity to go to all the trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the caterers from New York anyway , for there was simply no trusting the kitchen staff to do a dinner up in proper style  --  and besides , it saved so much wrangling and argument to have everything brought in from outside . " It will do Mr. Lincoln a world of good , " Mary said . " He needs cheering up  --  and he always enjoys a party , though he does fuss so ahead of time over having to dress for it . " She lifted one arm , so that Mrs. Keckley could adjust the waistline . " What do you hear from your son these days , Mrs. Keckley ? You told me he was in Tennessee , did n't you ? " Mrs. Keckley drew a basting shorter , stroking the gatherscarefully with a pin . No , her son was in Ohio . " Could you turn just a shade , madam ? There  --  that 's right . " Of course . Ohio . Mary remembered now . " I hope he 's well ? " " Quite well , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the placing of a pin . " He 's in the army now . " " Really ? " Mary looked down in surprise . Mrs. Keckley nodded . " He enlisted two months ago  --  in Ohio . " She hesitated . " They put him in a white company  --  even though he told the officers his mother was colored . He says they 're very good to him . " " I should think you must be very anxious about him . " Mrs. Keckley nodded again , quietly . Just at first , she said , she had been disappointed to have him interrupt his schooling . But now she was more used to the idea.  | " When I told Mr. Lincoln , he said I ought to feel very proud . He said  --  " Mrs. Keckley paused , smiling a little  --  " that we must all learn to be anxious in these times . And then , of course  --  I 'd expect my son to do whatever he thought was right , no matter how I felt about it . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose so . " She turned ' to look into the long mirror . " It looks perfectly lovely , Mrs. Keckley . It 's really a beautiful dress . " " Thank you , madam . I 'm sure Mr. Lincoln will think it 's very becoming . He always seems to admire you in that shade of blue . " Mary smiled at her reflection . " I hope you 'll let me know when you have news of your son , " she said . " Indeed I will , Mrs. Lincoln . It 's kind of you to be in-terested . " Mary watched Mrs. Keckley stoop to brush the silk ravelings from her neat black skirt . She seemed to take it calmly enough , Mary thought . Her only son two whole months in the army  --  and she 'd gone about quite as though nothing had happened , never even troubling to mention it . But then , it only went to show that with some people feelings never ran very deep . From the look of things , Mary reflected , the dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long table , lit softly by the candles in the wall brackets of the state dining room , and smiled graciously at Mr. Seward on her right . He was actually looking quite agreeable for once . His sharp eyes and long nose seemed less noticeable than usual . Perhaps Mr. Lincoln was n't so wrong about him , after all . Mr. Chase , on her left , was bland and impassive . She saw him eying the centerpiece , a concoction of white sugar doves and icing roses , topped by a gilded eagle with spread wings and lowered head who glared at the guests ferociously.  | Catching Mr. Chase 's glance , Mary smiled . " You approve , I trust ? " Mr. Chase touched his lips with his napkin . " It 's  --  most original , I 'm sure . " Mary was pleased . Mr. Chase was looking at the soup , which had just been put before him . Let him look , she thought confidently . There was nothing he could possibly criticize in terrapin flavored with sherry . Nor , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the dinner . The caterers had seen to that . Mr. Seward , less tentativeby nature , was already consuming his soup with evidentrelish . Conversation generally was going well . Looking down the table , Mary saw that Mr. Lincoln was telling a story . At the laugh that went up when he finished , Mary smiled . She 'd been right to think a party would do him good . She had n't seen him look so cheerful for weeks . " Miss Kate seems to have positively thrived on our wretched weather , " Mary said to Mr. Chase . " She looks charming tonight . " It was after the entree that the general spirits showed signs of sagging . If only it had n't turned so miserably hot again . There was no fault with the dinner , surely , but in the stifling closeness it was discouraging to face course after course of rich food . There were beads of perspirationon Mr. Chase 's high forehead , and Mr. Seward stared at the raddled remains on his plate as though his tussle with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mary was casting around for a new topic to begin when suddenly the voice of a senator , midway down the table , boomed out . Ilad anyone ever heard of anything more outrageous , the senator demanded , than the uppityness the free Negroes were treating the city to lately ? You would n't believe it  --  but there had even been some sort of scalawag notion of the Negroes of setting up a free school for themselves . P249The general lethargy , stirred by the senator 's vehemence , gave way to a flurry of murmurs . " Absurd , " said someone . " Too , too preposterous . " There was a pause , then the delicate voice of Miss Kate , cool and drawling , came clearly down the table . " Do tell us more , senator . " Miss Kate bent toward him encouragingly . " I 'm sure Mrs. Lincoln will be interested . " Her smile , flicking Mary 's glance for an instant , was sweetly barbed . " Why  --  " the senator looked surprised  --  " the thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proper foolishness  --  cookedup with the idea of wangling a slice of money out of honest taxpayers , I daresay . No decent sort of backing . The authorities put an end to it quick enough . It just goes to show , though , what sort of wildcat notions get started nowadays . As if we do n't have enough trouble with free niggers , without educating them to make more . " The senator leaned back , evidently rather pleased with his mot , though it was plain from their expressions that a number of the guests felt he had gone somewhat too far . " Personally , " Miss Kate said , " I 'm inclined to disagree with you , senator . I 'm frank to say I believe Negroes have their rights , quite as other people have . But I 'm certain we all admit that there are limits . I mean to say  --  " her glance brushed Mary 's again  --  " one is hardly expected to invite Negroes to take tea with one . Do n't you agree with me , Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at her , Mary could feel her cheeks flaming . She saw the long row of faces , waiting expectantly , and the centerpiece with its sugar roses that had begun , ever so slightly , to melt . She was aware of Miss Kate 's smile  --  languid and challenging . " I 'm not so sure , Miss Kate , " Mary said . " Judging from some people who are asked to tea in the best Washington circles  --  I think one might do a great deal worse . " Miss Kate 's smile remained serene . " That 's very witty , Mrs. Lincoln ; and , I 'm afraid , all too true . But quite seri- ously , I wonder if we are n't making a mistake to let the Negroes feel that this war is being fought for them . In all fairness to them , I mean . One would n't want them to get an exaggerated sense of their importance . " She turned to the other end of the table . " Do you think I 'm right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Kate . Mary held her breath , waiting for his answer . He must n't fail her now  --  he would n't . . Mr. Lincoln took a slow breath . " It seems to me , Miss Kate , that 's kind of like worrying in the middle of a tug of war , for fear the rope might get to feeling too important . I guess it 's important , all right  --  but whichever side wins , I do n't know that the rope gets much fun out of it . " It was only a little after eleven when Mary went upstairs . The party had broken up early  --  the guests had made polite excuses about the heat and the possibility of another thunderstorm , but it was plain enough that they were anxious to escape . After the incident at the dinner table , conversation had been strained and difficult , and Mary , watching the party slowly crumble into boredom , had felt helpless to revive it . She climbed the stairs slowly , too tired to care that the dinner had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early in the evening , had grown into a drumming throb of weariness . She was half way down the hall when a sudden sound from the boys ' room made her pause , frowning . They must surely have been asleep long ago  --  but no  --  there it was again . A curious moaning sound , low and strangled . In quick alarm , Mary opened the door just in time to see Taddie hurl himself off the foot of his bed with an earsplittingscream of laughter . The table lamp was lit , showing the wild disorder of the room . The sheets were dragged off the beds , a chair was upset , and Taddie in his nightshirt danced furiously up and down over the prostrate form of Willie.  | " Boys ! " Taddie turned , his eyes blazing with excitement . " We 're playing war , mamma . Look  --  Willie is dead now . He 's a Johnny Reb , and I 've shooted him dead . Be dead , Willie  --  you 're dead . " Willie , on the floor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " O-oo  --  oh , I 'm dead . Help , help  --  I 'm dead  --  " " Look  --  Willie is dead ! " Tad 's scream was ecstatic . " Now I 'm going to shoot his head off with a big cannon . " He leaped onto the bed and took aim . " BANG BANG BANG . Look , mother  --  " Mary put her hands over her ears . The sound of Taddie 's shouts pierced her aching head like a knife . Suddenly , in his agonized twistings , Willie 's foot caught the leg of a table that held a vase of flowers and sent it crashing to the floor . Mary made a quick move . She reached Willie , yanked him to his feet , and boxed his ears soundly . And then , just as Willie 's outraged howls were added to the din , Mr. Lincoln appeared in the door . " Papa ! " Both the boys hurled themselves on Mr. Lincoln . " Papa  --  papa , Mother hurt Willie . " In a burst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knees . " She hit Willie  --  and she hurt him , papa  --  " Mr. Lincoln lifted Willie in his arms . The boy clung to his shoulder , sobbing . " Hush , Willie . " Mr. Lincoln 's voice was mild . Over theboy 's head , he surveyed the room . The stripped beds , the ! ' upset chair and table , the broken vase and scattered flowers . " Well , mother  --  " a tired smile touched the corners of his mouth  --  " it looks as if the war has reached us at last . " Mary pressed her hands over her eyes , shutting out everything . " Willie broke the vase . " She could hear her voice , muffled and childish . " He broke my favorite vase . I ca n't stand it . I ca n't stand any more . I ca n't  --  I ca n't . . . " Misery broke over her , shaking and helpless . She turned and left the room , stumbling blindly over the hem of her gown . When Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up . She lay face down across the bed , the new blue and white dress crushed beneath her . " The boys are all right now , mother , " Mr. Lincoln said after a moment . " I got them to bed and called Mrs. Keckley . I told her things had got a little upset . I reckon she 'll know what to do . " Mary did n't answer . " Willie was sorry about the vase . I do n't suppose he meant to break it . " Mr. Lincoln paused . " I guess all the fuss over the party was too much for you  --  in this weather  --  " His voice was kind , a little puzzled . Mary said nothing . In the silence she could feel him standing beside her . There had been a hundred times , she thought dully , when she had lain awake in the night , alone , and wished she might look up and find him like this . Times when she wanted to talk to him , to try to reach through the lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there seemed to be no words to tell him what she had wanted to say . No use trying to speak of the long nights , and the dreads that came like shapeless mists . No use to ask for comfort . No use , even , to speak of the party that had gone so flat and wretched . She might have liked to thank him for standing up for her , answering Miss Kate . But he would n't have understood . He 'd only say she was imagining things . She lay still . Let him think it was nothing but the heat  --  and being tired that made her like this . It was no use . . He waited a minute longer . " Well , you 'll feel better tomorrow , mother , when you 've had a good sleep . " He bent down and touched her shoulder . Then he went out , closing the door carefully behind him . Next morning at breakfast , when Mary said she had been thinking of taking the boys north for a few weeksp253to Saratoga @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary said , the early autumn was the pleasantest time of year to travel . Saratoga would n't be too crowded , and she might try the waters . On the way home , they could stop a few days in New York . The shops would be showing their new fall things  --  and perhaps Robert could come down and join them for a visit .. . But when the moment came , a few days later , to say good-bye , Mary clung to Mr. Lincoln weeping . " I ca n't go , Mr. Lincoln . Please do n't make me . Mrs. Keckley can take the boys .. But let me stay with you  --  please . I 'll be better , I promise  --  " She heard his voice , mild and surprised . " Why , mother , there 's nothing to feel so bad about . I thought you wanted to go . You and the boys will have a fine time  --  and you 'll be home again before you know it . " On the train , Mary leaned back against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the flat , bedraggledoutskirts of the city . She sat motionless , lulled by the steady clack of the wheels . As they gained speed , rolling north , and the low green hills began to appear , she straightened up . At the Springs , where the nights were cool , she could surely sleep . And when they came back , she thought , everything would be different . She could try again . Yes , of course . . . things were bound to be better . They need n't stay away very long . Only until she was rested . And then she could begin again . . . IT WAS LATE OCTOBER BEFORE MARY CAME HOME TOWashington . The weeks had passed quickly , and it was pleasant at the Springs . Pleasant to be waited on , to takeP254the boys driving every afternoon on the smart promenade past the United States Hotel with its famous millionaires ' piazza where Commodore Vanderbilt sat , and young Jim Fisk with kiss-curls on his forehead . It was pleasant to dress every night for dinner , and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its round tables and roseshadedcandlelight . To hear voices and music and laughter , and no talk of war . And to sit on the verandah in the mornings , after taking the waters , while the boys went pony riding , and listen to the latest hotel gossip . Gossip about Jim Fisk and Mr. Astor and Madame Jumel with her wigs and parasols and laces and airs . Gossip that had nothing to do with Washington . At first Mary had worried a good deal about Mr. Lincoln . But he wrote often and assured her that , while he was missing them sadly , he was delighted to hear that she and the boys were enjoying themselves , and he was getting on all right . The only sad news he sent was the information that Mrs. Keckley 's son had been shot in a skirmish with Rebel troops on the Tennessee border , and had died a few days later , of a fever that had developed from the wound . Mrs. Keckley had borne the loss with courage and fortitude , though it was an overwhelming blow  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for fear it would mar the pleasure of her holiday . But he had thought she would want to know . Mr. Lincoln was at the station to meet them the night they arrived in Washington . Seeing him come down the long platform toward her , Mary was struck , even before they were close enough to speak , by the change in him . Surely he looked older  --  she had n't remembered how stooped his shoulders were nor how deeply the lines were set around his mouth . But he looked well , though he was even thinner , and there was a new firmness , a kind of toughening , she felt in him at once . And she saw that he smiled more readily , in spite of the anxious look that never quite left his eyes.  |p255He  was glad to have them home again  --  pleased to find Mary so rested and well . " You look very grand in your new feathers , mother , " he said , admiring the bonnet she had bought in New York . He swung each of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their weight . There was nothing in his mannerto show that Mr. Lincoln remembered the strained and difficult circumstances under which they had parted , and for once Mary was grateful for his ability to act as though the past simply did n't exist . Driving up the avenue , Mary felt excited and pleased . Everything seemed new , and she kept turning to look at Mr. Lincoln beside her , conscious again of the subtle difference in him . Not until they reached the White House , and she saw the familiar countenance of old Edwards , gnarled and glum , did Mary realize she had come home again to Washington . It was n't long before Mary discovered that Mr. Lincoln was n't the only person who seemed to have changed while she was gone . There was a new spirit in the city  --  a sort of settling down to the grim business of war , that showed itself in a hundred ways . Social feuds and scandals were no longer of paramount interest , having been abandoned for the moment in favor of the far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had become a military expert overnight , and conversation nowadays was all of encampments , platoons , maneuvers , bivouacs , and such . " Washington , " Mr. Lincoln said , " has decided to accept the war , after all . Even in the best families . " In its new phase of patriotism , the city was inclined to view the President with a more tolerant eye . Except for a few unregenerate cave dwellers , even the Southerners forgot their hatred and distrust of the black Republicans . The first evening she and Mr. Lincoln went to the theatertogether , Mary was astonished to see the audience rise and cheer when they stepped into their box . Mr. Lincoln leaned over to whisper in her ear .   5 6 " You see , mother , what fine folks we 've gotten to be these days . " At lunch one day a visiting gentleman from New York spoke feelingly of the selfless spirit the Capital women were showing . " It 's an inspiration , " he said to Mary , " to see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Kate Chase tells me she 's given up entertaining entirely to do hospital nursing this winter . I understand she makes a point of driving down into Virginia regularly to visit the camps and take supplies for the men . It 's that sort of spirit , Mrs. Lincoln , that will do more than all the generals ' speeches to give our soldiers the courage to fight and win . " Mary 's smile was thoughtful . The next morning , ordering the carriage , she drove to the military hospital and offered her services , and from that day she went regularly to do her share of rolling bandages , distributing candy and tobacco , and writing lettershome for the soldiers . One new element of Washington life which Mary found puzzling was the overwhelming public confidence in GeneralMcClellan , the new Commander of the Army of the Potomac . McClellan was young . He was handsome and dark , with a fiery eye and a great reputation for fearlessness . And his penchant for galloping up and down the Washington streets on a spirited black horse seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Union had been revealed at last . A rash of McClellanbadges and pennants appeared everywhere  --  in lapels , on hatbands , and even proudly adorning ladies ' muffs and tippets . When Tad and Willie played soldier now , they wrangledbitterly over which one should have the honor of being " Little Mac . " Mary was curious . " Besides looking very well on a horse , " she inquired of Mr. Lincoln , " what has this GeneralMcClellan done to make himself such a hero ? "  |p257Mr  . Lincoln was as taken as everyone else with Little Mac . McClellan , he assured Mary , had a good head , firmly screwed on . There would be no more rushing into battle half cocked , as they had at Bull Run . The new commander had laid his plans before the President and the Cabinet , and informed them that he was building the largest and best armed and trained military force that had ever been raised in the course of history . " Well , at least , " Mary smiled , " your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What does he intend to do with this remarkable army ? Is it to fight with  --  or only to look at ? " The army would strike , Mr. Lincoln said gravely , when in McClellan 's estimation , the moment was ripe . And not before . The one thing he has insisted upon is plenty of time . " And I have personally promised that he sha n't be hurried , " Mr. Lincoln said . Mary pursed her lips . " I can only hope , Mr. Lincoln , that General Beauregard will be equally considerate . " For one thing at least , Mary was grateful . She saw that Mr. Lincoln had come out of the long , slow process of making up his mind about who should run the war . His tone was no longer hesitant . Once and for all , he had shown the politicians the door  --  and Congress , having reluctantlyabandoned its fond dream that the war could be waged without parting with either money or authority , had heaped both on the President and sat back , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw fit . " It 's kind of surprising , " Mr. Lincoln said , " to find how many people would rather be driven than drive themselves . I guess maybe horses are luckier than we realize . " " We have a novelty in office seekers today , mother , " t Mr. Lincoln said one morning . He handed Mary a letter dated from Springfield . Ninian Edwards had written to say that he had suffered severe business losses during the past months , to put it plainly . Was there , Ninian wondered , any possibility of an opening in a government appointment for which Mr. Lincoln would think his qualificationssuitable ? He hesitated to ask for favors , but at Elizabeth 's suggestion he ventured to write . Mary looked up from the letter . " What do you intend to do for him , Mr. Lincoln ? " " Whatever I can , I suppose . " A few days later Mary inquired whether an appointmenthad been found , and learned that Ninian had been offered a captain 's commission , in charge of commissary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I daresay Springfield will have plenty to say when they hear that , Mr. Lincoln . " Sure enough , the following week brought a letter from Ann , the first Mary had had in a long while . Everyone in Springfield was amazed , Ann said , to hear that Ninian had received a commission . It was very wonderful for him , of course , and for poor Elizabeth , who had surely had much to bear . As for Ann herself , she was delighted . But all the same , she could n't help wondering how those outside the family would regard it . There were those , certainly , who would think it odd  --  coming from the Presidentto his own brother-in-law . " There are times , " Mary said , putting away Ann 's letter , " when I 'm afraid I do n't think any more highly of my sisters than they do of me . " From Elizabeth , Mary heard nothing at all  --  an omission which she did n't fail to comment on when writing to Cousin Lizzie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am sure Elizabeth means no slight or lack of gratitude in not writing , dear Cousin Mary Butlmust be honest and tell you that your sisters have felt , since you went to Washington , that you have been so preoccupied with the pleasures and duties of your positionthat you have rather lost touch with the old tiesP259which in the past held you so devotedly together . For my part , I feel that this is entirely natural under the circumstances , and I have said so plainly on a number of occasions . But you know for yourself how firmly dear Elizabeth clings to an idea once she has formed it . I am sure , however , that in spite of this little misunderstanding , your sisters regard you with as much affection and esteem as ever . Even Mr. Lincoln is beginning to be highly spoken of here . Only a few nights past I heard Judge Harris observe , at a dinner , that Mr. Lincoln 's ability to fill the office of President gave him the same sense of wonder and admiration that Dr. Samuel Johnson experienced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have got this right . ) I did not altogether understand the reference , but it was greeted with so much approval by the company that I am passing it on to you , knowing you will be pleased , and doubtless you will know what it means , dear Mary , as you are always so clever . . . " On one of her visits to the hospital wards , Mary noticed a thin young man whose cot was placed next to the wall , a little apart from the other beds . I fe was a Confederate lieutenant , she discovered , who had been wounded and captured at Bull Run and sent to the hospital to recover from a fever . The other soldiers were kind enough to him , but Mary saw the wistful look in his eyes when he watched the visitors who came to the ward , and she took special care to stop by his bed for a word whenever she could . The young man was friendly and likable . In the course of their conversations Mary found that he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Be- ing an officer , and well connected , he had a good chance 1 of being sent back to the South in one of the customary exchanges of prisoners  --  but he confided to Mary that he was worried for fear the exchange would come too late for him to reach home in time to see his mother , who was very ill and not expected to live . Touched and troubled by the young man 's anxiety , Mary spoke to Mr. Lincoln . Was n't there something that could be done to hurry the boy 's transfer ? Mr. Lincoln was doubtful . He had a pile of letters with just such appeals waiting on his desk for cases just as urgent . " But this is different , Mr. Lincoln . This boy is a friend of Ben and Emilie 's . If you could just see him  --  if you could hear the pathetic way he speaks about his mother  --  " " I know , mother . I 've talked to dozens like him . " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " I wish I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these things have got to be done in a military way . And I do n't like to ask McClellan for special favors , when I know he 's doing the best he can . " For a few days Mary let the matter rest , but it was hard to forget the young lieutenant 's thin face and the hauntingexpression in his eyes that lost a little more of hope each time she saw him . Suppose it were she who was dying , and Robert was a prisoner somewhere in the South  --  waittingto come to her . One morning when she walked through the ward , Mary found the young man up and dressed . He was leaving the hospital the next day , he said . He did n't know where they were sending him . He wanted to say good-bye and thank her for being so kind . He said nothing more about his mother , or his chances of reaching home . But when Mary left the hospital , her mind was made up . Military procedure or no military procedure , she meant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was no use , she knew , to appeal to Mr. Lincoln any further . But at least she could go to the general herself . And since there was no time to lose , she told the coachmanto drive her to the War Department . General McClellan sent out word that he would receive Mrs. Lincoln at once . The arrival of the President 's wife , unannounced and alone , caused a stir of curiosity in thep261offices , but Mary was too intent on her errand to notice the stares that followed her progress down the corridors to the general 's office . McClellan waited at the door . It was the first time they had met , and the general , with a great show of gallantry , bowed low over Mary 's hand and expressed himself as deeply honored by the unexpected visit . She had come , Mary explained at once , to ask a favor . Quite unofficially . The general bowed again , sweepingly , and begged her to be seated . Anything in his power , he said , was hers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had scarcely been prepared for such a flowery reception . While she told about the young lieutenant , the general sat facing her , his dark face frowning and intent , his finger tips drumming nervously on the desk . When she had finished , he looked up . Such cases , he said , involving the exchange of military prisoners were subject to hard and fast rules . There was no room in official regulations for exceptions , however urgent the personal circumstances behind them might be . ButHere he paused , rising dramatically . " It is the duty of a soldier , Mrs. Lincoln , " he said , to exercise discretion when and where he feels it indicated . In view of your interest in this young man , which has impressed me deeply  --  and your willingness to vouch for the truth of his story , which I can not doubt  --  I am inclined to feel that this is a case deserving of the utmost consideration . I shall do all I can to see that this prisoner 's transfer is executed at once . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that General McClellan would forgive her for coming so impulsively . " Not at all . Not at all . " The general made a deprecatinggesture . You have no need to apologize , dear madam , for your generosity in seeking help for this unfortunate boy . Indeed , I wish there were more such examples of un- selfishness and humanity in the world today . " He paused , sighing heavily . " We soldiers are generally supposed , I fear , to be mere machines of efficiency . But we are not without hearts , Mrs. Lincoln . And I assure you that no stone will be left unturned in my effort to see that your request is granted . " The general bowed one last time , and they parted . It was lunchtime when Mary reached home , and Mr. Lincoln was just coming down the stairs . She smiled at him so warmly that he looked surprised . " Is something up , mother ? You look like the cat that just swallowed the canary . " Hearing the homely twang in his voice , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at the wrinkles in Mr. Lincoln 's rusty black coat , and the lean breadth of his shoulders  --  and she thought of the general , small and elegant and dapper , with his carefully brushed pompadour , his polished boots that shone like mirrors . She tucked her hand in Mr. Lincoln 's arm , smiling up at him . " I was only thinking , " Mary said , " how glad I am to see you , Mr. Lincoln . " Writing his daily letter to his wife in Cincinnati , GeneralMcClellan was careful to include an account of Mrs. Lincoln 's visit . He had given in to the Lady President , he said , as everyone must  --  and she had gone off feeling that she had wheedled a great favor out of him . He might have told her she could have spared her pains  --  that her young lieutenant 's exchange had already been arranged and would have been accomplished quite as promptly without her interference . He had thought it hardly politic for one in Mrs. L. 's position to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rumors one heard ( very likely quite unfounded ) of her southern sympathies . But one hesitated to offer advice , however sound , to a lady of such decided mind . He had found her somewhat overbearing in manner.  |p263though  civil enough  --  and knowing her reputation for vanity , he had been careful to treat her with great deference , which he could see pleased her  --  and she had gone off flattered and delighted , convinced that she had charmed him into submission ! IT WAS A REGULAR THING NOWADAYS FOR VISITING REGIments to be entertained at the White House . One afternoon , chatting with a group of Massachusetts volunteers , Mary discovered that a number of them were former Harvard students . Oliver Wendell Holmes , Jr. , was among them , a slight , soft-spoken lad with a good wit and admirable manners , and a handsome boy who was a grandsonof Paul Revere . Some of them , Mary learned , had recentlyleft their classes to join up . Delighted at finding someone who could bring news of Robert , Mary began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twist in the conversation that they were speaking of the possibility of Robert 's being in the army soon . Holding tight to the teacup in her hand , Mary went on ' talking . As though nothing out of the ordinary had been said , she spoke of the weather , of the New England climate , of the prospects for a Union victory . But when the guests had gone , she went at once to find Mr. Lincoln . Had Robert , she asked sharply , said anything more about this absurd notion of joining the army ? He could n't have meant it , of course . He 'd given her his word before he went back to Cambridge . But with these other boys rushing off so recklessly  --  with so much talk of enlistments  --  hemight have been influenced in spite of his promise . " Has he written to you , Mr. Lincoln ? "  | Mr. Lincoln did n't answer for a minute . His glance was fastened on something outside the window and he seemed unaware of Mary 's agitation . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Robert could n't go now  --  he must n't . There was his education to finish  --  and the boy was n't strong enough for army life . And besides , it would n't be fair  --  Robert would be in far greater danger than the others , being the President 's son . . While she spoke , pleading and angry , piling up excuses , Mary was conscious all the time of the truth , dark and terrifying , that hid beneath her words . If Robert was to go , she knew the fears would come back . The fears that came at night and whispered : " This is the price . This is the price you must pay . This is the price . . . " But surely the price had already been great enough . It need n't begin all over again . " You must forbid Robert to go , Mr. Lincoln . " He turned from the window . " Robert is a grown man , mother . He has to decide for himself  --  just as these others did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered . There are other reasons  --  " " There are always other reasons , mother . It 's always like this  --  in all the homes these boys come from . " " Yes  --  yes , I know , Mr. Lincoln . But this is different  --  " Mr. Lincoln shook his head . Mary had seldom seen him look so stern . " No ; it 's not any different , mother , " he said . Alone in her room later , Mary tried to write to Robert , but halfway through the letter she stopped and tore the sheet in two . There must be some other way to stop him , she thought . She remembered how easily General McClellanhad granted her request for the young lieutenant . She would wait , and watch her chance . A word dropped to the right person , at just the proper moment . . . She would wait .. . P265The opportunity came sooner than Mary had expected . General Scott was being retired , and there was a dinner for him at the White House . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of war . Old Scott was one of the few men in Washington whom Mary respected , and she was troubled and genuinely sorry to see him go . It was McClellan 's doing , she knew , to force his commander in chief out , but when she had said so to Mr. Lincoln , he shook his head . " There ca n't be two heads to an army , " he said , " and Scott is old  --  and sick besides . McClellan says he can handle things better if he 's not interfered with , and he knows what he 's about . The people trust McClellan . " " Yes , " Mary said , " they trust him because they know nothing about him except that he looks well on a horse and boasts that he can win the war . They call him the little Napoleon  --  " She shrugged . " It will take more than a few photographs of McClellan with his hand inside the front of his coat to make a Napoleon of him , Mr. Lincoln . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seated next to Mary , his grizzled countenance looked merely sleepy and impassive while McClellan held forth , with a great display of energy and courage , on his plans for the future of the army . When Mary told him he would be sadly missed in the Capital , the general roused himself and turned to look at her . " It 's kind of you to say so . But I ca n't say I 'm sorry to go . They 've given me everything I could require for my last days  --  even a successor . " Mary saw him glance down the table . She wondered what thoughts lay behind his heavy eyelids as he watched McClellan , frowning and important , more conscious of his gold braid than ever . " I only hope , " Mary said , " your successor will be worthy of you . " The old man looked at McClellan a moment more ,  | fixedly and without expression . Then he sighed  --  a sigh that was half a yawn . " I 'm too old for anything , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course of the evening , Mary found the chance for a few minutes ' private conversation with Mr. Cameron , and brought the subject around to the matter of Robert 's enlistment . Being careful not to put too much of a point on it , she let him understand that she and Mr. Lincoln were opposed to Robert 's leaving college for the present . They hesitated to interfere directly  --  boys at that age were so headstrong and anxious to show their independence  --  butif Mr. Cameron would be willing to use his influence , she was sure Mr. Lincoln would be grateful . A judicious word in the right quarter ? Perhaps Mr. Cameronhad already heard something of Robert 's intentions ? Mr. Cameron was evasive . He could make no promises . . But Mary was satisfied . She felt certain at least that the secretary of war would take steps to see that Robert was not allowed to enlist without her knowledge . Doubtless , she thought , Mr. Cameron and the others would have their private opinion of her for wanting to keep her son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was a small enough price to pay for keeping , a little longer , her truce with fate . The fears would not come again , for a while at least . For a little while .. . At four o'clock one rainy morning in November , GeneralScott left Washington . He had received the thanks and tribute of Congress and the President , and he was free to go . General McClellan came to see him off , muffled in a heavy cape  --  dramatic as always as he clattered down the avenue in the pitch dark and the beating rain . Surrounded by his cavalry officers , sneezing and shiveringin their dripping uniforms , McClellan stood in the drafty station , trying not to show his impatience to see oldp267Fuss and Feathers on his way . General Scott shook hands with them all . He puttered about , seeing to his luggage , sending courteous wishes to Mrs. McClellan and the baby . He was too old and weary to be hurried . With General Scott gone , McClellan was in full swing . Mr. Lincoln spoke to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible lot on you now . " McClellan smiled quietly . " I can do it all . " Once , when the President had been kept waiting two hours for an appointment with McClellan , Mr. Hay protestedthe general 's cavalier behavior . Mary was quick to chime in . " It 's perfectly true , Mr. Lincoln . No matter how much you admire McClellan , you 'll admit he treats you as if you were nothing more than an old grandma . " " Well , maybe so , mother . But this is hardly the time to be standing on points of etiquette . I 'll hold McClellan 's horse if only he 'll bring us a victory . " Christmas came , and Tad and Willie hung their stockingsover the mantel in the south parlor . The first snow fell , thin and wet , over the camps where McClellan 's army waited . There had been another victory for the South at Ball 's Bluff  --  but in comparison to Bull Run it had seemed only a mild setback . Surely soon McClellanwould be ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and troops and money and supplies poured down from the North  --  to disappear across the Potomac into silence . All quiet along the Potomac , some people said . All too quiet , if you asked them . But for the most part they were still content to pin their faith to McClellan 's star . The weeks went on , and winter settled in . The country waited . And Mary held , from day to day , her truce with fate.  |p268DURING  A RAW AND SUNLESS FEBRUARY , MARY CAME home from a morning at the hospital to find that Willie was feverish and had been put to bed by Mrs. Keckley . She hurried upstairs . Willie was sitting up , a red wool sock wrapped round his throat , entertaining Taddie with a long , excited story about a little lame robin who could n't fly south when the other robins did and would have starved and frozen except for the sparrows , who brought him food and gave their feathers to make him a warm cover . Taddie caught Willie 's cold , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She read to them , rubbed their chests with camphor , dosed them with sassafras tea , and scolded Tad for hopping out of bed in bare feet . " I 'm afraid poor Taddie has taken it the worse of the two , " Mary said anxiously . " He 's like Robert  --  these things always go to his lungs . " Taddie was a troublesome invalid , complaining loudly of his woes when he felt badly and bursting into irrepressiblyhigh spirits the moment he showed signs of improving . Keep them quiet , the doctor had told Mary , and they 'll be all right in a few days . But there was no keeping Tad quiet . He squirmed and fussed and bounced until by evening he had brought on the fever and coughing worse than ever , and at night he slept fitfully , half waking to fling off the covers , so that Mary had to get up half a dozen times and tuck him in again . One night , when Taddie had been crying and restless , Mary sat by the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell asleep . When she rose , stiff and chilled , to go back to bed , she paused to bend over Willie and was surprised to find him wide awake , looking up at her . " Do you feel badly , Willie ? "  |p269He  shook his head . " I was just listening to the story you told Tad , " he said . Unless Taddie was better by morning , Mary told Mrs. Keckley , she meant to have the doctor again . But when he woke , the fever was broken . Mary sighed with relief . By afternoon both boys were so much improved that she went for an hour 's drive  --  breathing the misty winter twilight air gratefully after nearly a week of being indoors . That evening at dinner Mary spoke cheerfully to Mr. Lincoln about the White House reception planned for the following week . It was to be the largest affair of the season . All the diplomatic corps was invited , and the Marine Band was to play for dancing . It was lucky , Mary said , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got sick . Two days before the reception Taddie was up and out , quite well again . But Willie , who had seemed so much less ill , was still in bed . His cold was better , but he remained white and listless . Mary questioned him anxiously . Was he in any pain ? No . Was there anything he wanted ? Willie hesitated . Nothing special , he said , only it would be nice to see his pony . " So you shall , dear . " Mary was touched by the politeness of the small voice . So unlike Taddic 's stormy demands . " Tomorrow morning , if you 're better , Papa will carry you to the window , and Taddie can ride the pony right onto the lawn where you can sec him . " That night Mary was wakened by Taddie calling , and she hurried across the hall to find Tad sitting up , huddled in his nightshirt , staring at Willie 's bed . " Something 's wrong with Willie , mamma . He keeps sayingfunny things and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Willie was awake , but when Mary bent over the bed his eyes looked strange and unfocused , and he muttered something thickly as he pulled away from her touch . His skin was dry as hot paper.  |p270Is  Willie very sick , mamma ? " Tad leaned over from his bed . " Will he have to take medicine again ? " Mary went to call Mrs. Keckley . They stood together looking down at Willie in the shaded night light . " It may be only the fever working out of him , madam . I 've seen it act this way  --  and then in the morning it may be quite gone . " Mrs. Keckley 's voice was calm and reassuring . " Let me put Taddie in the guest room , and I can stay here and watch . I 'll call you if there 's any change . " In the morning the fever had not gone . The doctor came , and Mary stood watching while he looked at Willie gravely . The cold had gone into the lungs , he said . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the doctor 's words , heavy and guarded , fear plunged sharply into Mary 's heart . She looked at Willie . He twisted fretfully , trying to say something , but his voice was choked and unfamiliar . Through a rush of tears Mary bent and gathered Willie in her arms , begging him to speak again  --  to tell her what he wanted . Over Mary 's head the doctor looked at Mrs. Keckley . He cleared his throat . It might be best , he said , to have a nurse for Willie . Then Mrs. Lincoln would have some chance to rest . And in a case like this , it was often better for the mother to stay away as much as possible . The slightest emotion , however natural , could often be most upsetting . Mary looked up quickly . " I wo n't have a nurse . I wo n't have some stranger coming in . No one understands Willie as I do  --  no one else knows how to take care of him . . . " The doctor stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 'd see . He would come in again , toward evening . When the doctor was gone , Mary still knelt by the bed . Willie was quieter now , his eyes closed in a drowsy stupor as she smoothed the tangled hair back from his forehead . They were trying to push her away , she thought . Trying to shut her out . But she would n't let them . Not when Willie needed her.  |p271Late  in the afternoon Mr. Lincoln came in and sat an hour by Willie 's bed , watching , speaking very little . Later , when they went down to dinner , Mr. Lincoln told Mary that the afternoon before Willie had first taken cold he had gone out to ride his pony and had wandered too far and got caught in a drenching rain . Mr. Lincoln had seen him come in , but had promised not to tell , for fear he might be scolded . " Poor little fellow  --  he was punished much worse than he deserved , after all , " Mr. Lincoln said . Mary flared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret between them . " You had no right not to tell me , Mr. Lincoln . If I had known  --  I could have taken care of him at once . And this never would have hap-pened  --  " " No , mother . If Willie were going to have the fever , he 'd have it . There is n't any use thinking after a thing has happened we could have made it different . " Mary shook her head impatiently . " That sort of talk is humbug , Mr. Lincoln . " " Well , mother , all the same  --  I believe it . " A little past midnight Mary hurried into Willie 's room . She had wakened from a heavy sleep , fancying she heard Willie call . But he lay quiet , and Mrs. Keckley was asleep in Taddie 's bed . The night light threw vague , twisting shadows on the wall . There was no sound but the hoarse breathing from Willie 's bed . Pausing in the corridor , Mary saw the door of Mr. Lincoln'sbedroom ajar . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressed , and reading . " Mr. Lincoln , I 'm so frightened about Willie  --  " Mary stood on the threshold , her long braids over her shoulders . She drew her blue robe closer , shivering . " There must be something we can do , Mr. Lincoln . Is n't there something ? " She spoke almost timidly , feeling for a moment as though she was one of the strangers who came to Mr. Lincoln , asking him for help in their troubles  --  trusting him , somehow , to reach out and make things right . In that moment she had forgotten that he was her husband  --  forgottenthat he was a prophet in his own house . Mr. Lincoln got up from the low rocker and took off his spectacles . " Come in , mother , " he said . They faced each other in the circle of lamplight . In the night silence they were like strangers , and yet closer than they had come in a long while , without obstacles or barriers . Mr. Lincoln talked . He spoke matter-of-factly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisdom . But hearing his voice , Mary was quieted . In the stillness of the room , in the simple words and the plain , worn face  --  she felt for a few minutes the strength that had given comfort to so many . At the doctor 's insistence , next morning , a nurse was sent for . Mary made no protest . When the woman arrived , she watched Willie lie back , quiet under the sure , impersonaltouch . She saw how docilely he took the spoonfuls of barley water he had refused from Mary . All day Mary hovered in and out of the sickroom , unwilling to quite give over to the new nurse . Downstairs , meanwhile , the caterers were getting ready for the reception , spreading the long tables , clearing away furniture , taking charge in the kitchens . The florists ' men arrived , bringing garlands of laurel and tubs of potted palms for the East Room . Mr. Lincoln said it might be better to postpone the reception until Willie was better . But Mary shook her head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said wearily . " We must go through with it somehow . If we cancel the invitationsit would only make more talk . " By evening , when it was time for Mary to dress , the doctor had come again  --  and for the first time he said Willie was better . Mary went in one last time before going downstairs , to find him sleeping . His breathing was easier , and his cheeks felt cooler to her touch.  |p273The  nurse stood by the bed . The shaded light fell softly on the ice-blue satin of Mary 's gown and caught the gleam of pearls at her throat and wrists . " You look very handsome , ma'am . " Mary fancied she caught a trace of resentment in the woman 's voice . No doubt she , like so many others , thought it out of place for the President 's wife to be entertaining in satin and pearls while just beyond the river an army lay camped in the snow , without enough blankets to protect them from the damp and freezing night . " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary said quickly . " I wish we need n't have had it at all  --  but even in wartime the President is expected to entertain for the foreign diplomats . " " Naturally . " The nurse smiled faintly . She leaned down with a possessive gesture to smooth the sheet over Willie 's shoulder where Mary 's touch had disturbed it . " I only hope the noise of the dancing wo n't be too loud . It would be a pity  --  when I 've coaxed the poor lamb into such a nice sleep . " Mary bit back a sharp answer . She glanced again at Willie'sface . It would n't do to let herself resent the woman when so much depended on her . She would n't resent anything  --  everagain , Mary thought suddenly  --  if only Willie would go on being better . It was the old feeling again  --  that she must bargain with fate  --  that all fortune must be paid for with an equal measure of misfortune . She turned to the nurse , forcing a smile . " There wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we 're not to have the music . " Plainly , the evening was a success . The embassy guests were elegant and gay , and light voices mingled with the rustle of fashionable silks and brocades in the palm-filled East Room . Mary felt the weariness drop away from her as she saw the approving glances of the gentlemen who bent over her hand . Even the Washington ladies appeared to be too occupied in discussing other matters to find time for criticism . A year of war had made the old sport of hating the administrationseem tame and outworn . Kate Chase , in pale lemon-yellow lace , that set off the flame of her red hair , paused a moment in the receiving line to ask kindly for news of the sick boy . Mary was touched and grateful . Later , when she saw Kate deep in conversation with Mr. Lincoln , and noticed how attentively he listened and the way he laughed at her sallies , Mary only smiled , pleased to see him enjoy himself . It was two in the morning before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upstairs together . Mr. Lincoln took her arm . " Well , mother , it was a nice party . I was proud of you tonight . " Mary looked up . The compliment , so rare from his lips , added the last drop to her full cup . Still together , they looked in the door of Willie 's room . Several times , earlier , Mary had left the party and come up  --  and twice during the evening she had seen Mr. Lincoln go upstairs . Willie still slept quietly , his head turned to one side , the long lashes shadowing his cheeks . The nurse , wrapped in a woolen comforter , drowsed in her chair by the night lamp . Mary bent to touch Willie 's hand , and straightened again , meeting Mr. Lincoln 's eyes . The moment , full and sweet , hung between them like something shining and unfamiliar . Moving carefully , almost fearfully , lest the tremblingperfection break , Mary turned and tiptoed from the room . THE DAY AFTER THE PARTY WAS GRAY AND COLD , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing letters , while downstairs the men carried away the extra chairsP275and dismantled the long tables . Willie wakened late , rested from the long sleep , and when Mary went in he smiled a little , and asked if he could have his pussy please , to sleep on the bed . " Of course you may , dear . I 'll send Taddie to fetch her from the kitchen . " But when Mary brought the kitten in , the nurse frowned . She did n't hold with animals in a sickroom , she said . They poisoned the air and carried all manner of disease , and the doctor would surely disapprove . Besides , the child was not to be excited . It might bring on the fever again . Mary hesitated , torn between resentment of the woman 's officious manner and a reluctance to offend her . But seeing the light in Willie 's eyes as he reached out for his pet , she had n't the heart to disappoint him . " Just for a little while , " she said , holding the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She glanced at the nurse apologetically . " Surely it ca n't do any harm  --  when it pleases him so much . " The nurse , rustling her starched apron , made no reply . Later she took care to point out to Mrs. Keckley that , First Lady or no First Lady , she was n't accustomed to havingher authority in the sickroom questioned . By afternoon the sky had cleared , and the sun came out , warming the air with the false mildness of early spring . Willie was sleeping again , his arm wrapped contentedly around the curled-up kitten , and when Mr. Lincoln found an hour free from appointments and suggested a drive , Mary felt safe in going . It was dusk when they came home . The sun had vanished , leaving a chill in the sharp wind . Edwards , opening the door , stepped back quickly to avoid the cold draft . Mrs. Keckley had brought down word from the nurse , Edwards said . Mrs. Lincoln was to go upstairs directly she came in . Mary knew at once that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the nurse said , immediately after Mrs. Lincoln left . And now the fever had taken a queer turn . " I do n't like the looks , ma'am . I should n't be surprised it 's going into the typhoid  --  " Mary knelt by the bed , still in her coat and bonnet . She pulled off her gloves , rubbing her hands to warm them beforeshe touched the flushed , blazing cheeks . This must n't happen . It could n't  --  not now . Not now . She spoke to Willie , coaxing him  --  but there was no light in the dull eyes that stared back at her . If you do n't mind , ma'am  --  I really think you should n't try to rouse him . He ought to be left quiet , until the doctor sees him . We 've sent for him  --  just now  --  " Mary turned , sudden anger blazing in her voice . Why had he only been sent for now ? Why not at once  --  an hour ago ? " Well , ma'am , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house . But Mrs. Keckley said she 'd be re-sponsible  --  " It was another hour before the doctor came  --  an hour while Mary hung over the bed , while she felt the strength drain out of her with every moan , every restless spasm that racked the small , worn body . She hardly knew when the doctor had gone again , and Mr. Lincoln came in to stand at the foot of the bed , for a long while , in silence : Much later , when they came and helped her to her feet to lead her across the hall to her own room , she followed numbly , only partly aware of Mrs. Keckley helping her undress , holding a cup , of hot milk to her lips . Alone in the darkness , when they had left her to sleep , Mary lay still . She had n't noticed when they tiptoed out , or felt the icy stiffness that crept slowly over her . She only knew that Willie was dying  --  and that this , at last , was the price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay motionless , his round cheeks shrunken so that he looked strange and wax-like . He no longer looked up when Mary came to the bed , nor seemed to hear when she called him  --   |p277|pleading  through the tears that choked her , begging him to listen . Living the hours blindly , hardly knowing day from night , Mary hovered between her room and Willie 's . At intervals , conscious of the doctor 's voice speaking solemnlyof courage , she struggled to push back the anguishedtide . When they said she must either control herselfor else be forbidden to come into the sickroom , she would promise to be quiet . But the tide would rush over her , and she was flung with helpless , shaken fury against the fate that would take her child and would not be denied . Mrs. Keckley watched by the bed during the times when the nurse slept , and Taddie was left to roam the house disconsolate . There was nowhere for him to go  --  nothing to do that would n't make a noise and disturb Willie . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pins out of the war maps and making paper hats out of the piles of letters stacked on the desk . There was a meeting of the Cabinet one afternoon , and Taddie crawled under the long table . He was an Indian in the forest , and the circle of black-trouscred legs were trees through which he peered cautiously at Pussy , who was a skulking , stealthy enemy . At length Mr. Lincoln pulled Tad out and took him on his knee . " It 's hard on a little fellow , having to keep so still , " Mr. Lincoln said to the gentlemen . Dozing one night , in her chair by Willie 's bed , the nurse roused to a faint sound from across the corridor . She straightened  --  jerking her eyes open . If that was Mrs. Lincolnagain , coming with her tears and wild talk . . . The door opened softly , and it was Mr. Lincoln who stood there , tall and sad . He came near the bed , and stood watching . The nurse left him there , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I 've fixed some hot tea , sir . Why do n't you take a little ? It might do you a speck of good . " " Thank you . " Mr. Lincoln took the cup . " I believe maybe it will . " He stood holding it , not drinking . " This is the hardest trial of my life , " he said , speaking low . " I wish I knew why these things must come . " " Perhaps to make us better , sir . " He looked up . " Do you really think that ? " " I know it , sir . I lost my own two children , and thenmy husband . But I ca n't feel bitter . It was God 's handthat took them , and I 've learned to love Him all the more . " He still looked at her . " Did you always feel like this ? " " No ; not for a long while . But blow after blow cameand then I began to learn . " For a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you told me , " he said finally . He handed back the cup . " But you have n't taken the tea , sir . Would you like some fresh ? " " No . But I 'm grateful all the same . " The next day , when the doctor came , he spoke to Mr. Lincoln . It would be better , the doctor said , if Mrs. Lincolnwere not to be with the boy . " It seems hard , I know ; but the nurse tells me she disturbshim  --  " The doctor coughed . " I 'm afraid , with all the strain , Mrs. Lincoln is not quite herself ... " Mr. Lincoln nodded . " We must try to remember how hard this is for her . " From her room across the corridor Mary listened late into the night . Toward one o'clock she heard the door of Willie 's room open and shut , and then the sound of Mr. Lincoln 's step . Up and down . Up and down . She had heard him walk like that in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then for other men 's sons  --  now it was for his own . Up and down . At the sound , Mary felt a swift , unreasoning resentment . In her own sorrow , sharpp279and immediate as a knife plunge , it hurt her to know that he had grieved as much for the others as he did now for his own . That he would always mourn so  --  for all who must die . She went to the door and called him . " Mr. Lincoln  --  Willie is dying . I know it . I must go to him . " He answered patiently . She was worn out and overwrought . There was nothing she could do for Willie . It was best to leave him with the nurse . " The nurse , " Mary said . " The nurse is a stranger , Mr. Lincoln . A woman we never set eyes on until a few days ago . Why should I have to listen to her ? Let her tell me whether I can see my own child . " She was silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln , I do n't trust Willie with her . I do n't like her eyes  --  the way she stares at me . There 's something queer about her , I tell you . I wo n't have her alone with Willie  --  I wo n't  --  " She made a move toward the door , but Mr. Lincoln held her back . He would stay with Willie , then . I le could call Mrs. Kecklcy . " Go back to bed , mother . Try to rest . " When Mary wakened later there was no sound in the darkness . She crossed to Willie 's door , and stood listening a moment . Then she knocked , and heard Mr. Lincoln 's answer . " Mr. Lincoln , may I come in now ? " He opened the door and took her arm , not saying a word . He was still dressed , and Mary saw Mrs. Keckley sitting beside Willie . The nurse , busy at the bureau where the medicines were kept , did not turn as Mary went toward the bed . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the covers , but she made no move to touch it . Holding herself very still , trying desperately to do right , Mary watched Willie 's face  --  listening for the breath , hoarse and shallow , that stirred his parted lips . She was still there , motionless and dry eyed , when Willie died.  | The snowball of the war rolled on , piling up its burden of defeat and misery , of treachery and jealousy and strife . There was trouble now between the new factions that wrangled and bickered for control . They were opposing McClellan more and more openly . He was slow , overcautious  --  worseeven than old Scott had been . They complained to Mr. Lincoln , and Mary saw him harried and worried until it seemed his shoulders must break beneath the weight of malice and confusion heaped on him . Only from the West was there any good news . A man named Grant had captured Fort Donelson from the Rebels . Later Mary heard that her brother Sam had been killed in the fighting , on the Confederate side . Seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lincoln still had time to be patient with her , Mary tried to respond . In little ways she tried to meet his kindness . But the strange listlessness that held her did not lift . She would look up , sometimes , out of a long silence and find his eyes on her , watchful and troubled . They were together more than in a long while , talking of everyday things , of old times in Springfield  --  of anything that would not touch on the soreness of grief . They were friendly , considerate of each other  --  affectionate . But all the while , beneath the surface calm , Mary felt the dark gulf of silence widening between them . In the first days after Willie 's death there had been no way to speak . The language of their suffering was so different that it seemed hopeless . And now , as the silence lengthened , it was like a wedge  --  forcing them apart , driving deeper day by day , making them strangers who could only try to cover the loneliness with cautious phrases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taddie away with her . He ought to be out of the city  --  to have other children to play with . Mr. Lincoln suggested Saratoga . They had enjoyed it last season . But Mary shook her head quickly . She thought of the familiar hotel rooms  --  of the piazzaP283where she used to sit and watch the path for the boys to come back after their pony ride . She remembered their kind Polish waiter in the dining room who always smuggledextra lumps of sugar from the kitchen for Willie to take to the brown and white pony . It was unbearable to think of meeting the people she had known the year before . Their sympathy , however kindly meant , would be like a knife in the rawness of her heart . " No , " she said , " I do n't think the waters agreed with me after all . Perhaps we might try the seashore this time . Some quiet place , where no one knows us  --  " " Well , " Mr. Lincoln said , " whatever you think best , mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sewingroom , going over Taddie 's clothes and getting them ready to pack . Mary had finished lengthening the sleeves of an Eton jacket . She sat twisting the silver thimble on her finger for a minute , watching Mrs. Keckley 's head bent over her stitching . " You know , Mrs. Keckley , " Mary said , " I was just thinking . You 've been so kind to us since we came here  --  I feel now as though we could n't get along without you . I hope you 're not too lonely  --  being so far from your own people . " Mrs. Keckley looked up . " I never think of being anywherebut here , Mrs. Lincoln , " she said . " I feel as though I belong with you . " Mary hesitated , turning the thimble . Then she said slowly , " I wonder sometimes these days how you bore your trouble so bravely when your son was killed . It must have been very hard for you  --  and yet you never complained . I 'm afraid we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o , I was n't brave at all , really . There were times , in the first weeks , when I felt as if I could n't go on living  --  " Mrs. Keckley bent her head lower over her sewing . " I do n't believe I ever could have gone on  --  if it had n't been for Mr. Lincoln 's kindness . But when he talked to me  --  he seemed to understand everything and to comfort me so . . " She was silent a moment . " I can never forget what he did for me . " Mary said nothing . She was thinking how often she had heard these same words . From soldiers she talked to in the hospital  --  from the wives and mothers of other soldiers who had been killed . I can never forget how Mr. Lincoln gave me the courage to go on .... Mr. Lincoln helped me ' when no one else could .... It was a strange and bitterthing that he could give comfort so freely to these others , and yet for her , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come close to him  --  the strangers . But when she searched for their path , Mary knew that somehow she had lost the way . There was a pleasant-faced young woman Mary had engagedearly in the year to take charge of the household supplies . The woman worked well , minded her own affairs , and fitted into her position so unobtrusively that beyond an occasional glimpse of her hurrying along the upstairs hall with an armful of fresh linens , Mary was seldom conscious of her presence in the house . One afternoon the woman brought a tea tray to Mary 's sitting room . Bessie , the chambermaid , was ill , and there was no one else to carry up the tray . Mary thanked her , adding pleasantly that she hoped the woman was finding her work agreeable . " Very satisfactory , thank you . " The reply was prompt and courteous . She touched the tea tray , straightening a corner of the embroidered cloth . " You have such beautiful linens , Mrs. Lincoln , it 's a pleasure to take care of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it came up from the laundry this morning , and I took the liberty of mending it . I hope you do n't mind  --  Honiton tears so easily and it would be a pity to have it spoiled . " Mary glanced up in surprise . It was n't usual for a servantto recognize Honiton . She noticed that the woman'sp285hands were soft , and the nails carefully trimmed and buffed . She made no comment , but , coming into Mr. Lincoln'sstudy a few mornings later , when he was out of the house , Mary was startled to find the woman standing before the rack where the war maps hung . She turned as Mary entered , making an excuse about having come in to see whether the curtains needed laundering , and left the study quickly . That afternoon , Mary spoke to Mr. Lincoln . " I do n't like the way that woman acts , Mr. Lincoln . She 's always snooping about , making excuses to come into our rooms . " So long as the woman did her work well , Mr. Lincoln said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just the same , I do n't believe she ever worked as a servant before she came here . I do n't trust her , Mr. Lin-coln . " Now , mother , there 's no use imagining things . The woman 's decent and well behaved . And she 's got a nice face -- - " " A nice face  --  " Mary shrugged . " Do you suppose , Mr. Lincoln , there arc no women with nice faces who might be in sympathy with the Rebels ? I believe that woman came here deliberately to spy on us  --  and I mean to find out who she is . " A trip to the woman 's room in the servants ' quarters revealed nothing , but the next day Mary was informed by Mrs. Keckley that the woman had gone . She 'd packed her things the night before , and simply walked out  --  without a word to anyone . " It does seem strange , madam , when she took such pains with her work . " Less than a week had passed when Mr. Stoddard showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling herself Edith Connell , had attempted to take a position as chambermaidin the home of the secretary of state . Having become suspicious of the woman 's manner and appearance , Mr. Seward ordered her to be investigated , and the woman had been identified as the widow of a Confederate officer who had been killed at Bull Run . Arrested and taken to the Old Capitol prison , she admitted that she had recently been employed by Mrs. Lincoln as a servant . Sufficientevidence in the form of letters and maps had been found in her possession to convict the woman as a spy . " I do n't know whether Mr. Lincoln ought to be told about this , " Mr. Stoddard said . " I have n't mentioned it  --  " " Then do n't . " Mary handed back the paper . There was no use , surely , in burdening him with another worry , now that the danger was past . And besides , Mary had learned long ago that there was never any satisfaction in saying " I told you so " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Adelina Patti was in Washington . Mr. Lincoln had heard Patti sing once , at a concert in New York , and had met her afterwardat a reception . Rather hesitantly , he asked whether Mary would care to invite Patti to the White House . Mary knew he was making another effort to distract her . She smiled at him , trying to rouse herself from the listlessness that still hung over her empty days . " I could send around a note , I suppose , and ask her for tea  --  if it would please you , Mr. Lincoln . " The afternoon Patti came , Mary was late coming downstairs , and she found her guest in the East Room talking to Mr. Lincoln . Mary paused a moment on the threshold . She had dressed carefully , taking extra pains with her hair , and for the first time since putting on mourning she had added a touch of white to the throat and sleeves of her gown . It would please Mr. Lincoln , she knew . She saw him look up , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smiling , to greet her guest . Patti was charming . Slender and very young , she wore wine-colored silk , and a tricorn bonnet of ostrich plumes that curled around her fresh , pretty face and dipped over one shoulder . It was the first time in weeks that Mary had entertainedp287a stranger , but Patti was so friendly and unaffected that the conversation went easily , and Mary found herself joiningin , laughing with Patti at Mr. Lincoln 's stories . When tea was finished , Patti smiled at them . " I 've had such a lovely time , " she said simply , " I should like to do something to thank you . I ca n't tell clever stories , as Mr. Lincoln does  --  " she spread her hands  --  " but if it would please you  --  I can sing for you . " Seeing Mary 's smile of pleasure , Patti crossed to the gilt piano . Against the yellowed keys her fingers looked very white and slender as she began the rippling accompaniment to a Mozart aria . From her place by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listening to the lovely voice that rose and swelled until it filled the room as effortlessly as the late afternoon light that streamed in the long windows . The light fell on the crimson curtains , on the graceful curve of the singer 's throat  --  on a bowl of deep-red roses that stood on the piano . It shone on Mr. Lincoln 's face , lined and weary , and on the stiff folds of Mary 's black silk dress . The song ended , and Patti paused  --  letting her hands rest on the keys . Then , more softly , she began again . " The Last Rose of Summer " . . . Her young voice was full and tender on the melody ; when it was done , the sweet notes died in the silence . Mary had left her chair and gone to the window . She stood looking out across the lawn , her back to the room , and she did not turn when Patti rose from the piano . She heard Mr. Lincoln saying something in a low voice , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was weeping , Mary thought  --  even though she had made no sound . She could hear them now , going toward the door . Still she did not turn . Mr. Lincoln would make her excuses . . . and they would go out , thinking she had wept because of the song  --  and Willie . They would be understanding and considerate , and they would pity her . But they could n't know that she wept for something more . For a sadness she could not understand  --  for the bitterness of a world gone hopelessly wrong . THAT WAS THE SUMMER OF COLD HARBOR , AND LATER , IN August , of the second disastrous battle at Bull Run . At Cold Harbor the Union troops had been within sight of Richmond  --  and for a few days there was hope in the North that a victory was coming at last . It was the furiousonslaught of Stonewall Jackson 's brigade that turned the tide , at the end , and McClellan 's advance into Virginia was ended . The North , accustomed now to defeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mary , hearing that General Lee had taken command of the Confederate armies , remembered what Old Scott had said . There was an officernamed Lee who fought with me in the Mexican War  --  he was the best soldier I ever saw . It still goes badly with us , " Mr. Lincoln said . " The lessons of war are hard to learn . But with God 's help , we will learn them yet . " Mary , home from the summer at the seashore , had been dismayed to find that even in the bitter weeks while the army of the north was being beaten back , steadily and relentlessly , the politicians and the generals were intent on their old jealous game of wrangling for power and blamingeach other for each new failure . " It seems to me , Mr. Lincoln , " Mary said , " that one good general could help more than God just now . " " I expect he could , mother . " Mr. Lincoln sighed . " But until we can lay our hands on the right man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " P289Less than a week after Mary 's return came the news of Antietam . There , at last , was a victory for the North  --  but they learned too late that McClellan had succumbed to one of his fits of caution at the crucial moment and let Lee and Jackson escape with their exhausted troops and retreat to safety unpursued . Coming down late to dinner after a meeting of the Cabinet , Mr. Lincoln sat staring at his plate . Mary watched him anxiously . " They 've been at you again , Mr. Lincoln , " she said . " I can tell from your ex-pression . " " Well  --  partly at me , and partly at each other . And betweentimes they were picking on the generals . Altogether , it was quite a day . " " Truly , I do n't know why you stand for it . " Mary put down her fork . " If I were you , I should n't put up with their carping another day . " " I do n't know what else I can do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Cabinet meetings  --  the way Seward does when things do n't go to his taste . " " Seward  --  " Mr. Lincoln smiled , in spite of his weariness . " The way you say that name , mother , makes it sound as if there were no worse word in the English language  --  unless maybe it would be the way you can say Chase . " " Or McClellan  --  " Mary said , and suddenly they were both laughing . Mr. Lincoln took a piece of bread and buttered it slowly . The laughter died out of his eyes , leaving them puzzled and thoughtful . " They want me to throw out McClellan , " he said . " They 've got up a petition  --  and this time Stanton says he means to fight it to a finish . " Mary looked up quickly . Months before , when Cameron had resigned and Mr. Lincoln had appointed Stanton as the new secretary of war , she had been indignant . " For pity 's sake , Mr. Lincoln , " she had demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Stanton has snubbed you and talked against you for years . Mr. Stoddardsays he 's actually heard Stanton refer to you as a gorilla . " " I know , mother . But if I were to choose only my admirersfor the Cabinet , I might not have enough to go around . " " But Stanton of all people , Mr. Lincoln . He 's sure to make more trouble  --  I do n't believe he has the slightest respect for your opinion . " Mr. Lincoln had looked at her with unexpected firmness . " I have a great deal of respect for his opinion , " he had said . " And that 's enough . " The appointment had worked out surprisingly well , but Mary had remained unconvinced , by all of Stanton 's dogged efforts to cut through the paralyzing lengths of red tape and put some action into the war . She found him personally quite impossible  --  rude and irritable , and so charged with his own importance that he held forth at a dinner table as though he were giving orders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mary had said , and she clung to her opinion without wavering until a day , shortly after Willie died , when she had encountered Mr. Stanton unexpectedlyon his way to Mr. Lincoln 's office . She had n't supposed he would even notice her , but to her surprise he stopped and took her hand , and spoke to her with such gentleness and understanding that she was astonished . " Mr. Stanton told me about his little daughter Lucy who died , " she said later to Mr. Lincoln . " He 's a strange man , I think  --  but I shall never see him again without remembering the way he spoke to me  --  and the look in his eyes . " In the times when they had met since , Mr. Stanton had been as irascible and hard-shelled as ever , but Mary never forgot his moment of tenderness , and never again spoke a word against him . Hearing now that Stanton was determined at last top291put a hatpin into McClellan 's bumbling mismanagement , Mary took hope . If anything could ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be Stanton who could do it . But Mr. Lincoln was still doubtful . " I do n't see how I can put McClellan out now , " he said . " Three of our other generals are already dismissed for inefficiency  --  and McDowell is so distrusted he says himself he ca n't hope to command his men again . If we fire McClellan , there 's no one to take his place . Besides , I 've heard that McClellan is the only one of our generals the Rebels have the slightest respect for . They say Pope is a fool  --  and worse than that , no gentleman  --  and they call poor old Burnside the Tortoise . ' But they admit McClellan takes watching . " Mary sighed . " Well , that 's something in his favor , I suppose . If he ca n't be respected by his own side , it 's nice to think that at least the enemy approves of him . Still and all , Mr. Lincoln , it 's a sorry picture . " As they walked out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't give up yet , mother , " he said . " I guess all this is like a book on religion I read once . The first chapter was called Hell , and the second was called I1 ell Continued . " Mr. Lincoln went up to Sharpsburg to have a look at McClellan 's headquarters , and see for himself what was going on . " Everything was in fine order , " he reported glumly to Mary when he got home . " McClellan keeps his camp neat as a whistle . All the guards wore nice white gloves , and they bowed me in with wonderful style . The men say Little Mac is a demon on etiquette . He makes his sentries polish their boots every morning and stand as straight as wooden soldiers  --  " He paused and sighed . " Sometimes , I 'm afraid , they 're just about as harmless . " But Mr. Lincoln had enjoyed being with the men . There were some Rebel prisoners in the camp , and he had talked to them too.  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I was afraid they might bear me a grudge , but they seemed glad to have me come in and shake hands . " Several of the captured soldiers had been members of Stonewall 's brigade , and Mr. Lincoln had asked them questions about their commander . " The most surprising thing they told me , " Mr. Lincoln said , " was that Jackson makes his soldiers kneel down and pray with him  --  and they do n't mind doing it . " He rubbed his chin thoughtfully . " I 'd swap all the supplies in the Union army for one general who could do that . " The best the Union could do was to spin their wheel and try a new one at the top . Less than a week after Mr. Lincoln'sreturn from the camp , General McClellan was relievedof his command , and old Burnside , whose only claim to distinction was that he trimmed his whiskers in a novel way , seemed to be the only successor whose record was so uneventful that everyone could agree on him . " It seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the news , " that we must choose our commanders by default . " The winter set in early . As the days grew short , and the sun shone pale over the gray , frozen ground , the hopes for a northern victory congealed like the mud in the rutted streets . With only old Burnside to look to , people said , the chances for a surprise move against the Rebels seemed mighty thin . More than likely , by the time Burnsidestirred himself to action , they 'd be a good deal more surprised than the South . In December , after a week of cold , mean rain , Burnsid  --  did finally attack at Fredericksburg . But Lee and Jackson rallied and refreshed by the long interval since their retreat from Antietam , carried the day . A pall of gloom , lead-cold as the winter sky , hung over Washington . For three days after the battle , the wounded poured into the city . The hospitals overflowed , and those who could not be cared for at once were left , on stretchersp293or huddled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found for them . Since Willie 's death , Mary had given up her work at the hospital . She went back now , hoping to find some place where she could help , but after so long an absence it was difficult . People brushed past her , too busy and tired to stop and find something for her to do . It was all very different from the leisurely mornings when she had rolled bandages and scraped lint  --  and there had been only a few patients in the wards . Now there was no time to stop by the beds and talk , to read aloud and help the men write letters home . Now there was only ceaseless , confusing activity . The rows of beds in the wards were long since filled , and men lay on the floor , in the corridors  --  any place where a few feet of space was available . Only the most desperate cases were treated at all . After a few hours of being jostled about , of feeling in everyone 's way and being sickened by the sights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary gave up . On the way up the avenue the carriage came to an abrupt halt , delayed by a train of wounded which had just arrived . Mary looked out . Dear heaven  --  not more men when there were already so many , and no place left to care for them . She leaned forward , looking out at the ragged , shivering procession . They were being unloaded from the springless ambulances that had brought them over the miles of rutted roads from Fredericksburg . Unloaded , like so many head of butchered cattle , to lie in the cold , the stretchers lined in rows across Lafayette Square . There was a woman , Mary saw , in a long gray cloak , moving among the men . She had a wagon of supplies drawn up in the street , from which she carried blankets and food and water . Followed by two rough-looking orderlies , she went from stretcher to stretcher , bending briefly over each one . One of the orderlies , following close behind , carried a basin and sponges . Mary saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces , caked and frozen as hard as turtleshells . She watched the woman's motions , calm and skillful . There was no time for sentiment , no lingering over the wounded . The woman moved swiftly , like a tireless and experienced angel , speaking little . A word here and there , a low request to the orderly . The eyes of the men followed her progress with silent patience . Watching , drawing her fur mantle closer against the biting wind , Mary was appalled by the sight of so much suffering . She would have liked to get out , to do something to help  --  but the spectacle of so many made her shrink back , feeling futile . Vaguely she thought that Mr. Lincoln would never have sat still , as she was doing . He would have been out , in a moment , among the men  --  talking to them . But it was a language Mary did not know . She spoke to the coachman , telling him to turn back and take another way around the square . . . . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldier who lay with his face turned away , on a stretcher by the edge of the park . There was something in the line of his cheek , in the way his dark hair fell over it , that was so startlingly like Robert that Mary felt her heart leap . In an instant her hesitancy was forgotten . Giving a quick order to the coachman , Mary got out . Unmindful of the raw wind that whipped her skirt , or the curious stares of the men , she knelt beside the stretcher , on the frozen ground , looking down at the wounded boy . There was no blanket over him , and she saw that he had one leg shot away . The stump was wrapped in clotted bandages . As Mary leaned over him , he turned his head weakly , and opened his dark eyes for a moment . In spite of the cold , his face burned with fever , but there was no delirium in his gaze , only an expression that wrung Mary 's heart with its hopeless patience . The boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even shivering . From under his long lashes , so like Robert 's , silent tears rolled down his cheeks . With the tenderness she would have given her own child , Mary took her handkerchief and wiped the tears away . The boy did n't move or look at her again . P295Mary stood up . She looked around for a moment , dazed , and found herself staring into a circle of curious faces . She heard a young soldier standing near her whisper suddenly , " That 's Lincoln 's wife  --  " The men watched in silence while she hesitated , not knowing where to turn to get help for the wounded boy . The lad who had recognized her stepped forward , touching his cap . He had one arm in a makeshift sling , and a patch of bandage on his forehead . " Is there something I can do for you , ma'am ? " he asked politely . Mary looked at him . " I must get a blanket for this boy here , " she said . " It 's so cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand . He said something about all the others who lay in the wind , with no blankets either  --  but Mary did n't listen . She saw the woman in the gray cloak coming toward her . The woman did n't seem to notice Mary . She was dipping slices of bread into a bowl of whisky , bending over each man in turn to feed him . When the woman was near enough , Mary spoke . " Please , " she said , " is there anything you can do for this boy ? He 's very badly hurt  --  " For an instant the woman 's eyes met Mary 's , direct and unemotional . She showed no slightest sign of recognizing the President 's wife . She turned to look down at the soldier . " If he could just have a blanket , " Mary said . " There are no blankets . " The woman 's voice was low and well bred . She spoke matter-of-factly , as though repeatingsomething she had said a great many times before . " I 'm afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help from the hospital . " The woman moved on , calm , unhurried , and Mary was left . She glanced around once more . There must be someone , surely , who would do something . . . A slight stir behind her made Mary turn , and the next moment she was face to face with a tall , dark-haired gen/Only Cousin Lizzie seemed to approve of the party . Shortly after midnight she came up to Mary , beaming ecstatically . " Is n't it simply wonderful ? " Lizzie fumbled with the drooping lock over her ear . When Lizzie raised her arm , Mary noticed with irritation several gaping hooks at her stout and straining waistline . " I never saw so many people , Mary . And just to think they all came just to meet you and Mr. Lincoln . I should think you 'd be flattered to death . Everyone seems to be having such a good time . You know that Miss Chase , Mary  --  the one that was at lunch today ? Well , I never dreamed she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she saw me and was ever so friendly . Not a bit standoffish . And you know , when she smiles she 's quite pretty , in spite of being a redhead . I could see she 's tremendously taken with you , Mary . She asked me all sorts of questions about you . All about your house in Springfield and the boys  --  " " I 've no doubt you answered them  --  fully . " " Well , after all  --  why should n't I ? " Lizzie 's round eyes were puzzled . " When she was so interested . And I know she admires you , Mary . I heard her talking to Mr. Lincoln later  --  and she told him she thought you looked just like a fashion plate . She said she never expected to see one come to life  --  right out of Godey 's . So , you see  --  " Mary 's patience snapped suddenly . " Oh , Lizzie , for mercy 's sake do n't be such an eternal fool . Ca n't you see Kate Chase was only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why , Mary  --  I did n't  --  I 'm sure she did n't mean  --  " Unable to bear the sight of Lizzie 's stammering bewildermentanother instant , Mary turned away . She could n't bear anything more . Not tonight . She looked up to see Mr. Lincoln coming toward them . " Well , Cousin Lizzie , it seems to me you 've been quite a belle this evening . Every time I caught sight of you you had a new gentleman in tow  --  " Mr. Lincoln paused , lookingfrom Lizzie to Mary for a moment while the smilep186died slowly out of his eyes . He put his hand on Mary 's arm . " I guess maybe it 's time we were getting home , mother , " he said . " The party seems to be about over . And it 's been kind of a long day . "
