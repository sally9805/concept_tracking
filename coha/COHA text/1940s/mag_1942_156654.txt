Glass fiber , finer than human hair , spread over ordinary chicken wire and painted leaf-green is the newest variation in the camouflage nets that are gradually being rigged over the more vital U.S. war plants . The nets are light enough to be supported by light framework , strong enough to stand up under snow and ice , and , being non-inflammable , can not be destroyed by incendiary bombs . The paint job can be changed as often as necessary to keep the camouflage design in harmony with seasonal changes .
