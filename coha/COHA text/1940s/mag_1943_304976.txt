A joint communiqu of the British Admiralty and Air Ministry last week : A force of U-boats estimated to number between 25 and 30 . . . was subjected to such a relentless assault by surface escorts of the Royal Navy and by aircraft of the Coastal Command that the enemy was denied the opportunity to launch even one attack against a large and valuable eastbound convoy . <P> Almost on the first clear day out of port , a Liberator had found three U-boats stalking the convoy preparing for attack . The big plane dropped its depth bombs : one submarine was considered sunk . Surface craft attacked two more , depth-charged them . From one a huge oil slick bubbled to the surface : the U-boat was seen no more . <P> For two days and two nights , by air and sea , the U-boats were hunted and harried by the convoy escorts . The first attack was followed by another , 15 miles from the convoy . Depth charges brought oil slicks and splintered wreckage to the surface . Five more attacks were made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lookouts reported no less than 20 submarines circling for the kill they could never make while planes and escort vessels crisscrossed the convoy 's path . <P> All the next night the long-range Liberators , the frigates and corvettes provided " cover in strength . " The next day five attacks were made . The third day no U-boats tried to close in on the convoy ; it was evident that they had given up . From then on , the convoy sailed to its destination with no further incident . Not a ship , not a man was touched . <P> The communiqu placed the attack " some weeks ago . " It might well be that this successful action was one of those which marked the turning of the tide in the Atlantic battle .
